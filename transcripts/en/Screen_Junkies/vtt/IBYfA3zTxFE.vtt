HONEST VOICE
Universal Pictures proudly presents the film

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.099
you realized had absolutely no dialogue whatsoever
- only after you bought your ticket.

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:18.660
HONEST VOICE (CONT'D)
Les Miserabablebles

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.500
HONEST VOICE (CONT'D)
Told in award-winning songs of beauty and

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.669
exuberance.
Except those sung by Russell Crowe.

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:28.090
RUSSELL CROWE
Unless you learned the meaning of the law.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.660
I have made a false report. We may have met.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.760
HONEST VOICE
Characters often singing about things that
could be very easily done by just talking

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.850
normally--

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.440
HELENA BONHAM CARTER
Go and draw some water from the well.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.170
EPONINE
Hey there monsieur, what's new with you?

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.170
AMANDA SEYFRIED
Are you alright? Why did you go away?

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.289
HONEST VOICE
Seriously they sing everything, so to hit
that point even harder we thought we'd sing

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:52.989
the rest of the trailer.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.589
SINGING VOICE
Meet the spirit of human redemption: Jean
Valjean. A paroled thief now on the run under

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:02.039
an assumed identity... for reasons never made
clear in the entire movie.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.330
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
Who must face off against Inspector Javert...

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.750
An officer with such terrible priorities,
he'll put the entire city of Paris on lock

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.560
down to a stop a man who already served his
time.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.750
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
Follow along in their epic game of cat and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.020
mouse - that spans 20 years

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.570
Which is almost as long as the movie feels.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.780
Meet Fantine... a random factory worker who
brings an incriminating letter to work for

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.149
no reason... and is fired--

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:38.149
Sinking into desperation so deep - she becomes
most pathetic woman in France - in just two

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.700
verses of song!

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.950
Watch her with no hair, watch her with no
teeth - yet she becomes the most desirable

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.729
prostitute in town - which she'll blame on
Hugh Jackman. Even though he had nothing to

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.710
do with it.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.890
It's Anne Hathaway like you've never seen
her...

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.249
(Spoken)
Literally, she drops dead after only like

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.990
twenty minutes of screen time.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.460
Leaving Valjean to now care for Cosette, her
precocious child who is scared of the dark--

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.080
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
But totally cool letting some stranger drag

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.700
her around the city.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.209
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
Now, at the dawn of revolution... One young

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.060
man, will give up everything for a woman he's
met through a fence.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.830
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
Prompting a heart-breaking romance we know

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.190
nothing about, because the entire subplot
is glossed over...

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.970
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
To make room for countless scenes of Borat!

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.010
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
Not since "The Dark Knight Rises" has a movie

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.769
been so manipulative with its use of time
jumps.

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.560
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
And not since Chicago, has a movie tried so

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.930
hard to convince you that movie musicals are
a good idea.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.560
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
Featuring award-winning songs, but they all

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.720
sound the same, so without the track listing
you won't be able to tell one song from another.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.720
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
Experience over 2 1/2 hours of CGI Crane Shots

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.590
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
and extreme close-ups.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.830
SINGING VOICE (CONT'D)
And the death of Russell Crowe's acting ability.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.140
HONEST VOICE
Starring...

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.920
HUGH JACKMAN
I have a very annoying vibrato.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.840
ANNE HATHAWAY
I really, really, really wanted to win an

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.250
oscar!

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.950
RUSSELL CROWE
I should have never agreed to sing an entire
movie!

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.329
SACHA BARON COHEN
They really should have shown less of me and

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.900
more of Eponine!

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.049
HELENA BONHAM CARTER
Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice! Beetlejuice!

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.310
SINGING VOICE
If your girlfriend doesn't appreciate you
after sitting through this movie... Then you

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.290
should really rethink your relationship.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.129
HONEST VOICE
Les Miserables.

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:56.129
HONEST VOICE (CONT'D)
Well that was fun! Now why not be a doll and

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:04.319
SUBSCRIBE! I'll get you my pretty. And your
little dog, too! NO SOUP FOR YOU! I can't

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:09.799
believe it's not butter. Ya'll gonna make
me loose my mind, up in here, up in here.

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.530
Go Ninja Go Ninja Go!
