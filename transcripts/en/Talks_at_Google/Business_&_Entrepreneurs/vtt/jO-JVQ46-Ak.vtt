00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.600
JORGE CUETO: Joining today
we have Pejman Nozad and Mar

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.820
Hershenson, two of the
most respected venture

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.950
capitalists in Silicon Valley.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.580
In 2013, they teamed
up to create Pejman-Mar

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.800
and together invested in
over 30 startups including

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.260
Jordache, Garden Health,
Branch, and Gusto.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.720
Just last year, they
announced their second round

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.820
of funding of $75 million
and rebranded to Pear.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.020
On the who we are
section of Pear's website

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.600
are the following
words, "We understand

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.990
what it means to build
something from nothing.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.780
That journey defines
each of our life stories.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.050
We are immigrants, having
come to America penniless

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.850
but with big ideas.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.680
We've been
entrepreneurs determined

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.570
to build great companies.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.850
We know now that
success emerges only

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.930
for those who have endured
setbacks and overcome hurdles.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.670
We've learned from
our failures and we

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.948
know what it takes to succeed.

00:01:02.948 --> 00:01:04.989
There are no short cuts
when it comes to building

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.790
something extraordinary.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.090
All of this finds
expression in our work."

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.710
That quote speaks
to what I think

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.890
makes Pear stand out among
venture capital firms

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.200
and it reflects the
unique personal background

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.900
that Pejman and Mar experience.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.500
I'm very excited that both of
you are here with us today.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.410
And maybe we can get
started by having

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.920
you share a little bit about
your background, where you grew

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.700
up, your career pathways,
and how you got into venture

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.390
capital and you can see how
your experience is reflected

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.599
in Pear's missions statement.

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:38.598
MAR HERSHENSON: Awesome.

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:40.106
Pejman, you should start.

00:01:40.106 --> 00:01:41.230
PEJMAN NOZAD: Ladies first.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.105
MAR HERSHENSON: Yeah.

00:01:42.105 --> 00:01:43.020
OK.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.790
I think Pejman
has a great story,

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.210
but I'll go with mine first.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.720
I'm originally from
Barcelona, Spain and I

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.510
apologize for my cold.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.510
I came to the US in 95 to
do a masters at Stanford

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.570
and I ended up getting a PhD
in electrical engineering.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.380
This was 1999 and I was
ready to go to academia.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.605
I had already lined
up a professor job

00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:12.120
and at the last minute in
the crazy time of 1999,

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.890
I decided to reject that
offer and go do a start-up.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.920
And that was my first start-up.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.010
My PhD was in circuit design,
in analog chip design,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.640
so it was fairly technical.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.460
And I also did convex
optimization, large scale

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.850
optimization, so I had kind of
a dual background for somebody

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.050
in chips.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.840
My first company
actually didn't work out,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.020
but it was a great learning
ground for everything

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.530
that came afterwards.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.360
And after that, I did two
companies that did work out.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.550
So that was great.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.950
Throughout my
journey, I met Pejman.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.360
Pejman was an investor
in my second company.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.430
And I remember going
to pitch to Pejman

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.840
and saying after my
first company had failed

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.920
and wondering who would give
me money, I said to Pejman,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.400
I'm working on this, I've
learned what customers want,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.500
I'm building this
software platform

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.350
using convex optimization
for designing chips.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.950
And Pejman said, I have no
idea what you're talking about,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.670
but I really like you so
I want to give you money

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.640
and I will have my friends talk
to you and if they like you,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.540
we'll just put a round together.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.050
And this was in 2004 and a
lot has changed since 2004.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.340
In 2004, there was I think
maybe Tech Crunch had started,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.350
but there was no
angel list, there

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.880
was no sense of angel
investing as a sport.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.940
It was really a
few people and you

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.430
would have to raise by
going to their big houses.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.280
Nobody was in a
coffee shop coding.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.860
It was very, very different.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.830
But Pejman was there doing
this from a very early point

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.237
in this seed movement
that we have right now.

00:04:06.237 --> 00:04:08.070
So anyway, that's how
he got to know Pejman.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.450
And he approached me
in 2010 with this idea

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.330
of doing a house where we
could work with founders

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:16.769
and help them build companies.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.450
And it took almost four
years for me to pull the plug

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.080
and say, great,
let's go do this.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.814
But that's how I got started
into venture capital.

00:04:26.814 --> 00:04:28.480
PEJMAN NOZAD: Well,
thank you very much.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.420
It's funny, I look at myself--

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.860
I don't have a
tech background, I

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.910
don't have an
investment background,

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.870
I'm a venture capitalist.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.203
So that tells you a little
bit more about my background.

00:04:37.203 --> 00:04:40.450
So I came 24 years
ago from Iran here.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.790
I didn't speak any
word of English

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.410
and I didn't want
to come to America.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.240
My brother just
pushed me to come here

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.400
and I ended up
going to San Carlos

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.900
because my uncle lived there.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.527
I had $700, I lost all
the money because I

00:04:53.527 --> 00:04:55.610
was calling a girl in Iran
that I really did love.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.170
And I thought, if I don't
call her, I lose her.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:02.050
So at that time, it
was like $4 per minute

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.250
because of the payphone.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.230
So there was no Google for
none of these things today.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.850
So my first job was
washing cars in American

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.070
and I ended up getting
a job at the yogurt shop

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.530
in Redwood City.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.820
And I slept in an attic
above the yogurt shop

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.240
because I want to save money,
go marry the girl that I love.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.330
And one of these nights
I was studying English,

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.730
I saw an ad that Medallion Rug
Gallery in downtown Palo Alto

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.080
is hiring salespeople.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.490
So I ended up being a
salesperson at that rug gallery

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.560
and I became very good
at selling carpets.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.630
And Persian carpets are
very, very expensive

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.220
so you don't sell
them at the gallery.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.740
You take them to people's homes.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.800
So in one year,
I sold $8 million

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.200
worth of carpet, which
is really unheard of.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.470
But that tells the scope of
the sales and the relationships

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.740
we had with our customers.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.060
But in late '90s, I figured
out all of my customers

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.500
are CEOs, venture capitalists,
founders of big companies.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.440
And I was really amazed
by the amount of value

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.705
they're creating-- not only
nice homes and nice cars

00:06:01.705 --> 00:06:04.330
and the ability to buy cars, but
just really building companies

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.121
based on knowledge.

00:06:05.121 --> 00:06:07.720
And I thought, I want
to be one of them.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:10.960
And I thought maybe this
is the opportunity for me.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.160
I'm having a job and the
most important streak

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.100
maybe in the most
important time of my life.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.340
And I started to
educate myself and I

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.510
learned about the ecosystem.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.580
And think about it, this
is the '90s, late '90s.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.770
There was no TechCrunch,
no YC, no blogging.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.170
So the way I did
it, I started to put

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.279
a lot of events and
networking events at our place

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:30.820
and the deal first
started to kick in

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:31.944
and they started to invest.

00:06:31.944 --> 00:06:33.836
I convinced the owner
of the rug gallery

00:06:33.836 --> 00:06:34.960
to start to invest with me.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.050
I didn't have money so
we started it and we made

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.100
horrible mistakes.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.010
But I became very, very
lucky nine months into it

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.840
to meet Mar's husband
and Andy Rubin.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:45.810
This was dangerous.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.220
So Andy came one
day to buy carpets

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.850
and I was like really
in awe of this guy

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.820
and how he thought
about the future.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.900
And then I said, I'm
angel investing and nobody

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.250
was giving them money.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.850
So somehow, I became the first
investor and Andy and Matt

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:01.600
and Joe Britt.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.782
And as you know, Andy
went on and built Android.

00:07:04.782 --> 00:07:07.240
I'm actually the only person
in the world who gives Android

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.220
a term sheet but we didn't
agree on terms with Andy.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.600
So you can be a good investor
but miss big opportunities.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.150
So fast forward,
I ended up being

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.550
the first investor in
DropBox, Lending Club, Danger,

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:19.780
and many others.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:24.280
And in around 2011-12, after
like 11, 12 years doing this,

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.370
I felt that companies are
raising a million dollars

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:28.990
but nobody's helping founders.

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:32.260
And I thought given my
background and network,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:36.370
it's a huge opportunity to build
an institution to help founders

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:37.750
on ground zero.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.610
And I wanted to
partner with somebody

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.620
who built companies, have
a deep tech background

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.510
and have the same
philosophy in life.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.420
So I reached out to Mar
and I tried to convince her

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.030
for a few years.

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.380
We built this partnership,
we're kind of yin and yang.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.720
I'm a college dropout,
she's a Stanford PhD.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:57.700
I invested in 120 start-ups
before starting the fund,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.170
Mar invested in only one.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:01.780
But very complementary skills
and the same philosophy

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.930
in life, helping people and
really be good, give first

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:05.800
before you get.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.000
And I think it
remains to be seen,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.920
but Pear is now perhaps in the
center of the ecosystem here

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.580
in the Valley to just help
founders in really early stages

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:15.080
of the idea.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.830
We have done so many
different [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.100
that we can talk about it.

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.520
And it's amazing to be here.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.710
I remember my partners that
own Medallion Rug Gallery,

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:25.900
they own 165 University Avenue,
the lucky building Google

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.170
started there.

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.050
So I saw Google
when there were 120

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:31.360
versus today I don't know
how many thousand people.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.790
So it's pretty amazing to
be part of this community.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:36.574
We are really
honored and humbled.

00:08:36.574 --> 00:08:37.990
JORGE CUETO: Pejman,
you mentioned

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.460
you worked at the
rug shop and then

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.100
you sort of used that
opportunity to transition

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.025
into doing VC by working
with your clients.

00:08:45.025 --> 00:08:46.900
I think in Silicon
Valley, a lot of the times

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.000
there's a divide
between tech employees

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.430
who are tech workers
and everyone else.

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.890
So maybe you wouldn't
have necessarily

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.100
CEOs speaking and forming
genuine relationships

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.050
with people working
at a coffee shop

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.630
or serving tables
at a restaurant

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:03.430
or working in sales at a store.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.649
So how were you able to bridge
that divide that exists?

00:09:08.649 --> 00:09:10.690
PEJMAN NOZAD: I think I'm
good at making friends.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:12.760
So once you become
friends with these people,

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.600
they listen to you.

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:17.000
So I wasn't going into
people's home selling carpets

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.927
and saying, hey, I'm investing,
let's do it together.

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:21.510
It was just building
the relationships

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.830
and I paid a lot of
attention to build

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:27.920
that real concrete
relationship with my customers,

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.530
who a few of them are
advisers to our fund now

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:32.660
and then a few of them
invested through our fund

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.450
so they became LP in our fund.

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.470
So it's very important
to build this very

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.680
authentic relationship
with whoever you work with.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.730
So that was the genesis of my
relationship with clients who

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:47.600
became co-investors with me.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.770
MAR HERSHENSON: He also
threw great parties.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:50.520
PEJMAN NOZAD: Yes.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.320
Everyone loves Persian food,
so whenever [INAUDIBLE] people

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.410
come.

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.820
JORGE CUETO: So throwing
great parties is the secret.

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:59.100
PEJMAN NOZAD: And inviting
their spouses so then

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.872
everybody will come.

00:10:00.872 --> 00:10:02.330
JORGE CUETO: And
Mar, you mentioned

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:06.480
that you did a start-up that
initially didn't do well.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.977
One of the questions
that comes up

00:10:07.977 --> 00:10:09.810
when I talk about
start-ups with my friends,

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.330
a lot of them being
people of color and women,

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.640
is that they're concerned
that, especially

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.740
for first-time founders, there
is some bias from the VC world.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.560
And I was wondering if you
experienced any of that

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.209
during your first start-up
and to what extent.

00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:27.000
PEJMAN NOZAD: Yeah.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.600
It was a very different time.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.400
I think when I
left school, which

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:35.740
was the year 2000, the standard
way of doing a company,

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.560
whether you were a female
or not didn't really matter.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.870
There was a tech
person and the standard

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:48.030
was we'll bring a CEO to run the
company and you will be the CTO

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.240
and that's the way companies
were run at the time.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.380
And it has changed a lot.

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.240
Right now that's
not the philosophy.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.360
People understand that
in good companies,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.170
the founder stays with
the company all the way

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.240
and they're the CEO and they're
the one driving the company.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.900
And that's what
Pejman and I believe.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.520
I think we invest in
a lot of companies

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.970
where the founders are
either just out of school,

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.530
so definitely
first-time founders,

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.395
or maybe they're a few
years out of school

00:11:19.395 --> 00:11:22.565
and they've had a couple of
jobs but it's their first take.

00:11:22.565 --> 00:11:24.690
And that's what I think
we're really good at, which

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:29.580
is taking people that are
amazing and then teaching them

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:32.580
how to do your sales
pitch, how to fundraise.

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:34.240
It's not rocket science.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.830
I think smart people can learn
it with the right support,

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.740
and that's our role, right?

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.120
So anyway, that's us.

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:47.100
I didn't encounter any sort of
issues, or I didn't feel them--

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.240
let me say that--

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.980
when I was fundraising or not.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:52.740
It probably was more
in the workplace,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:57.420
but not necessarily when I
was in the role of a founder.

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.630
JORGE CUETO: And I know you
worked at Stanford teaching

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:02.700
in addition to doing your PhD.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.380
Did that experience
in academia, do

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.000
you think that helped you
with doing VC work now?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.360
MAR HERSHENSON:
Surprisingly, yes.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.240
Actually, I used to
teach circuit design

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.380
so it's very techie.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:20.640
But a lot of what we do
is teaching in some way,

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:21.886
it's transferring knowledge.

00:12:21.886 --> 00:12:23.510
Sometimes it's our
knowledge, sometimes

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.760
it's transferring knowledge of
other people to our founders.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:31.740
So it's similar to what you
do when you are either guiding

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:34.820
somebody in a research
project or teaching them maybe

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.530
what's a transistor
for the first time.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.590
There's a lot of
coaching that we do

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:43.900
and I did the same at
Stanford for many, many years.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.830
So yes.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:46.663
PEJMAN NOZAD: And I
want to talk about that.

00:12:46.663 --> 00:12:50.060
So I mean, giving
credit to Mar and being

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:52.290
a lecturer and a
founder and having

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:55.410
a deep technical expertise
really helped for us

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:56.970
to really understand
opportunities

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:58.505
exist and really help founders.

00:12:58.505 --> 00:12:59.880
One of our portfolio
companies is

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.240
a company called the One
Concern, which just closed

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.610
a massive $20 million
Series A. And Mar really

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.650
found them as a poster
session at Stanford.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:11.100
They were pitching
their PhD thesis

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:15.030
and Mar saw an opportunity
that the groundbreaking

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.160
technology they have,
they can convert it

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.524
to a commercial company.

00:13:18.524 --> 00:13:19.440
The didn't believe it.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.470
They came to our office
and then fast forward now,

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.879
they're becoming really a
category defining company.

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:28.920
JORGE CUETO: And you guys
have done a lot of work

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.530
at Stanford, especially
with the Garage Program,

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.740
trying to get students to make
start-ups during the summer

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.500
and see if they can go even
further beyond the summer

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.910
work they do.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:41.940
Did you decide that you
wanted to work with students

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.180
before starting that
program, or was the success

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.590
that you saw in
that program sort

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:51.156
of the driver for the
outreach that you do now?

00:13:51.156 --> 00:13:53.790
MAR HERSHENSON: I'll
let Pejman talk.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:56.610
PEJMAN NOZAD: I think there are
a few backgrounds in history.

00:13:56.610 --> 00:14:01.200
So when I started investing in
Andy, I needed a few million

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.170
to start.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.170
Today, basically you
don't need money to start.

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:05.820
As long as there's
a laptop, there's

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.560
a Starbucks, and AWS and
Google Drive and you don't die,

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.579
you can start a company.

00:14:12.579 --> 00:14:14.370
And then there's so
much capital out there.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:15.570
So there's lot of noise.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.190
If you're a seed
investor like us,

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:19.440
how do you look at this
landscape of so many founders,

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.420
how do you pick the winners?

00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:23.160
So luckily, Mar and
I started the fund

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:25.368
because of our background
with a very good deal flow.

00:14:25.368 --> 00:14:27.600
But we thought in
order to increase

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.400
the quality of our
deal flow, it's

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.960
great to go inside communities
that are already filtered.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.960
And Stanford was the obvious
choice because Mar was there

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.030
and then I had funded
a few companies.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.670
And the first thing we wanted to
build the community over that.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.350
And we thought it
would be great--

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.010
actually, Mar and I
thought the Garage Program,

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.385
we didn't have
any business plan.

00:14:46.385 --> 00:14:49.080
We thought if you have
exceptional students

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.600
under one roof, something
good will happen.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.710
MAR HERSHENSON: Maybe
explain about the garage.

00:14:52.710 --> 00:14:53.085
PEJMAN NOZAD: Yeah.

00:14:53.085 --> 00:14:53.670
Go ahead.

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.760
MAR HERSHENSON: No.

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.600
You go ahead.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.100
PEJMAN NOZAD: So
Garage is a program

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:59.080
and every year we select up
to 20 students from Stanford.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.100
It could be freshman all the way
to graduate or post-doctorate.

00:15:02.100 --> 00:15:04.410
And basically,
these are typically

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:07.876
people in computer science
and engineering departments.

00:15:07.876 --> 00:15:09.750
You don't need to have
an idea as long as you

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:10.980
want to be an entrepreneur.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:14.310
So we select these 20
students for nine months

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.420
while academic year.

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.790
We give you space,
mentorship, and we really

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.190
help you find problems
you're passionate to solve

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:21.750
and help you build the product.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.310
No expectation to
build the company,

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:24.720
no expectation the fundraise.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.860
But it naturally happens.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:27.990
So this is the fourth
year we are doing it

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:30.240
and we don't take any
equity in these companies.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.030
We don't invest, we give
them a lot of resources.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.020
They come to our office
once every two weeks

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:37.530
to check in with our
team and their mentors.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:39.390
And already, six
companies came out of it.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.880
One of them is a
portfolio company,

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.100
one was sold to Palantir.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:45.900
Mar actually negotiated
the terms with Palantir.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.840
We make $0, but those
two founders came back

00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.370
and they're our founders
of our portfolio companies.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:53.860
And because of that, I think
this community is growing.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:56.960
And the philosophy you
give before you get,

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.960
we're kind of under the
skin of Stanford now

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.774
and we see things
before anybody else.

00:16:01.774 --> 00:16:03.690
JORGE CUETO: As part of
your mission statement

00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:05.400
that's on Pear's website,
you also mention--

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.400
PEJMAN NOZAD: We actually
wanted to recruit him,

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.080
but he didn't come.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.279
JORGE CUETO: I had a lot
on my plate at the time.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:14.820
In Pear's mission
statement, you also

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.800
mention that you're
looking for founders

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.210
that have unusual backgrounds.

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.400
Can you speak a
little bit to why

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:23.610
you decide to focus on
that aspect of founders

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:25.470
and maybe some
examples of what you

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.405
mean by unusual backgrounds?

00:16:28.405 --> 00:16:29.280
MAR HERSHENSON: Yeah.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.380
I think venture is
really interesting,

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.870
because especially for engineers
I think it's very interesting.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.260
And the first time
I went into venture,

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.590
I said, oh, I'll just look at
all the variables about what

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:42.390
makes a company successful.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.330
So I spent a bunch of
time collecting data

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.360
on actually semiconductor
companies over a decade.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.190
And I would record I think I had
maybe 40 variables per company

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:56.550
and then I did some
simple regression

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.250
and I tried a few models.

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.450
Anyways, you're like
great, I have a model

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.450
and now I can predict what's
the next winner, right?

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.099
And it's almost the opposite.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:09.180
We are a business of
exceptions, truly of exceptions.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:13.349
And the really big winners, they
are just almost unpredictable,

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.630
right?

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:18.540
And it's almost
interesting, but I'll

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:22.189
tell you that the movie
about Facebook came out

00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:23.730
and for a while
then, people thought,

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:28.890
oh, I must just fund
dropouts from MIT or Stanford

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:31.800
and we are guaranteed
to hit a success, right?

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.406
And now people are kind
of coming back out of that

00:17:34.406 --> 00:17:36.780
and saying, no, maybe we should
fund people in their 30s,

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.280
when they're more successful.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.700
So anyways, my bottom line
is that there is no formula.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.530
I think everybody is different.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:51.780
And we really like people
that are almost like unusual

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.780
and they've not gone
in a straight path.

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:58.650
So for example, we
just hired somebody

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:01.425
who was a chef for some time.

00:18:01.425 --> 00:18:05.250
One of our founders
who runs a big company

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.020
called Memebox, an
e-commerce company,

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:12.190
it's very large in Asia, he
was in Afghanistan for a while

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.830
and he was an
engineer but decided

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:15.330
he truly wanted
to go into fashion

00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:18.630
and went to Parsons School
and worked for Tom Ford.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.470
So it's somebody that
was not something

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.210
that you would predict easily.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:27.690
So anyway,
everybody's different.

00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.610
This company that
Pejman was mentioning,

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.830
One Concern, which
basically they're

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.030
using artificial
intelligence to predict

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:38.040
in case of an
earthquake or a flood

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:41.040
where the big damage is so
you can send the emergency

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.160
responders very easily and
you can do prevention, right?

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.470
So this guy is from Kashmir.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:49.980
He lived all his life
in this little village.

00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:52.680
He suffered
earthquakes, floods, he

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:57.150
spent literally like five
days on the roof of his home.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.600
And he knew that he wanted
to actually do something

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.000
to avoid being in the
same situation again.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.200
So again, somebody with
a special background

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.300
that you want to
fund and contribute.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.430
And I don't know if you
have something to add.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.590
PEJMAN NOZAD: I think
on the broader spectrum,

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:15.810
if you look at the venture
capital community there

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:18.554
are a lot of people who claim
to be venture capitalists,

00:19:18.554 --> 00:19:20.220
but there are more
capitalists, I think,

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:21.970
than venture capitalists.

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.200
And the reason is I mean,
especially when you come--

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.880
and actually, I met
another person yesterday.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.720
I said, how do you
look at companies?

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.390
They said, when there is
no product risk and then

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.040
no market risk.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.880
And I thought, wow.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.540
So how can you be a venture
capitalist to do these things?

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.670
And in our business
you live for the moment

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:44.490
that somebody walks out
door and surprises you

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.670
and you break all the rules.

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.650
No terms is important.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:51.570
Everything you earn
doesn't fit there,

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:54.090
and you really want to part
with that particular person.

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:56.670
And if you look at the
biggest company ever created,

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.956
the founders were
in that category.

00:19:59.956 --> 00:20:01.580
JORGE CUETO: So
there's probably people

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.621
here in this room that
may be interested in doing

00:20:03.621 --> 00:20:06.590
a start-up at some point or
maybe people watching online.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.690
And you went a
little bit into this

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:11.120
with talking about
finding people

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.350
who are special and unusual, but
in terms of the type of company

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:18.584
or how a company
approaches the market,

00:20:18.584 --> 00:20:20.000
do you have anything
that you look

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.842
for in the companies and
start-ups that you're funding?

00:20:23.842 --> 00:20:25.800
MAR HERSHENSON: Maybe
let me say something else

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.700
about the founders.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:31.800
Because it's not only like, hey,
you have an unusual background,

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:32.430
we pick you.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.720
It's not just like that.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.630
I think the founders
that we work

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.240
with-- at the very
beginning, just imagine

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.830
you are in our position.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:42.900
There's people that come
in, they have nothing.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:46.740
There might be a prototype, but
there's really nothing, right?

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.420
And they come in
and they're like,

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.470
we want money to
build our business

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:51.990
and we think it's
going to be great.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:57.660
So we're just judging that
founder or founders, right?

00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:00.510
And one of the characteristics
that I think is very important

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:03.180
is these people are
so mission-driven,

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.940
they're obsessed with
what they're doing.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.939
It's like they can't sleep
at night because they

00:21:06.939 --> 00:21:08.730
have to go to this company.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:10.980
And I think when you are
obsessed and completely

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.220
mission-driven, there's
a lot of other things

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:17.070
that fall from it,
right, like your focus

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:20.550
and you're spending all your
time doing this and so on that

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:21.180
really matter.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:24.176
But this obsession is
really, really important.

00:21:24.176 --> 00:21:25.550
And I'll go back
to your question

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.300
about I think the market.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.160
Sometimes there is no market
when we invest in companies.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:33.630
We just don't even know.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:35.650
You're creating a new market.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:40.680
So for us, it's hard to look at
even a financial model or unit

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.170
economics or
margins or anything.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:47.490
We just have to believe that
you could get there, right?

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:51.930
But we like people that
almost like are action-driven.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:54.752
So they have a plan, so it's
not randomly things happen.

00:21:54.752 --> 00:21:56.460
They're like, hey,
I'm going to try this,

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:58.020
almost like a math mind.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.324
I'm trying to have
some sort of hypotheses

00:22:00.324 --> 00:22:01.990
and it might not work
and it might work,

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.890
but if not I'm going to try
this and so on and so on, right?

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:07.540
It's almost like this constant
learning loop that they have

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:10.230
and it's not just like
I'm doing a company

00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:12.210
and let's see what
happens, basically.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.400
Go ahead.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.300
PEJMAN NOZAD: I want
to add a few things.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:16.133
Mar and I mean, when
we look at the founders

00:22:16.133 --> 00:22:19.440
we like to work with, there are
some common characteristics.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.080
We like founders who are really
close to the problem they're

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.160
solving.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.080
Typically, when people
come and they say,

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.330
we have 20 ideas narrow it down
to 10, and we picked this one.

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:30.780
It's kind of a red flag.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.180
We like people who have
lived through that problem

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.070
or they have
academically background

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:37.274
or you have faced those
challenges here at Google.

00:22:37.274 --> 00:22:39.690
You are building a product,
but you see a huge opportunity

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:40.356
to do something.

00:22:40.356 --> 00:22:42.500
So we really want to see that.

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.900
We like the teams who
have history together--

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.590
either work at Google or
they rock climb every weekend

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:51.930
or they went to the
same high school.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.630
And as Mar mentioned,
people who have a vision.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:57.100
Many founders, they
think they have a vision,

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.370
but they're just having
a goal of raising

00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.230
more money into two years.

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:02.240
So it's very different.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.860
And we pay a lot of
attention to figure out

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.010
why you're doing this.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:08.640
I think most of the
start-up doesn't

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.570
work why you want to go
through these things?

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:16.200
And it's a very important
question that we ask.

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.930
And so it's a combination of the
characteristics of the founders

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:23.035
we want to see in the teams
when we are working with them.

00:23:23.035 --> 00:23:24.660
JORGE CUETO: There's
been a lot of talk

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.630
recently in the news about the
importance of company culture

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.510
and making sure that you
foster a good culture

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.510
from an early stage because,
otherwise in the long run

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.970
potentially you could
be facing problems.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.527
So since you guys work
with early stage companies,

00:23:38.527 --> 00:23:40.110
are there things
that you see that can

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.720
be done since the
beginning of a company

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.060
to help create that
good culture, to avoid

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.952
those problems?

00:23:46.952 --> 00:23:48.910
PEJMAN NOZAD: I think
everybody talks about it,

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:50.950
nobody defines what
it is in the culture.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:53.880
I mean, the scope of Google it
is, but a start-up, what is it?

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:58.010
Is it a ping-pong table
or is it free food?

00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:00.750
And I think it's should be
defined by the founding team.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.600
And I think culture could
be different in any set

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.200
of companies.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.040
But it's a set of principles
that you believe in

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.890
and you stick to it.

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:09.470
And it could be very different.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.070
And one of the companies
I broke like 10 years ago,

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:14.520
it was an amazing
CEO and the culture

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:16.070
was all about transparency.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.470
And I remember every
Friday they had barbecue

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.350
and he put himself in
front of the company

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:24.490
and everybody can ask
any question from the CEO

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:25.740
or criticize him.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.520
That's one way to do it.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:32.319
The other way is people say that
it's all about our customers,

00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:33.610
I think we should service them.

00:24:33.610 --> 00:24:35.520
And so this is a set
of different principles

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.604
that you should create and
you should stick to it.

00:24:37.604 --> 00:24:39.520
MAR HERSHENSON: But I
think the most important

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.040
is to spend the time doing it.

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:42.570
The second time
you have a company,

00:24:42.570 --> 00:24:45.220
you realize that's really,
really, really important.

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:46.860
And when you have
these principals,

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:48.990
it almost applies
to everything--

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:51.660
how you recruit, how you
treat your customers, how you

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:52.500
run your meetings.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:55.620
So it's super critical to
have that conversation.

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:57.570
And you can get
help, get coaches

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.362
to help exactly what that means.

00:24:59.362 --> 00:25:01.320
Because if you've never
done it, maybe you just

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.140
don't know how to do it.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:05.546
But critical.

00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:07.170
JORGE CUETO: And do
you have any advice

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:10.590
for people who are in early
stage companies trying

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:13.327
to get funding, particularly
maybe if they come

00:25:13.327 --> 00:25:14.910
from immigrant
backgrounds, if they're

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:16.649
people of color or women?

00:25:16.649 --> 00:25:17.940
PEJMAN NOZAD: Talk to us first.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.980
MAR HERSHENSON: Yes.

00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:23.480
Yeah.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.810
I think the great
thing about the Valley,

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:30.860
especially if you're here, is
that you can get a lot of help.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.810
People are typically
very, very helpful.

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:39.610
So you're almost a
block away from anybody

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:42.530
that can help either
with your business plan

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:45.980
or is a good idea
or not or research.

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.120
You can get out there.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.850
These days, there are so
many things for founders

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:51.980
and entrepreneurs and events.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.460
I think Pejman and I could be
on every night and every day

00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:56.310
meeting people.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.670
So I think if you really
start from nothing,

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.034
I would say reach out
for help to your network.

00:26:02.034 --> 00:26:03.950
JORGE CUETO: And I think
a lot of times people

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:05.600
are really hesitant
to reach out.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.780
But I've been surprised
how responsive people are

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:12.140
to an email or even if you
tweet them they might reply

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.520
and then you start fostering
a relationship over time.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.520
MAR HERSHENSON: I think
one of the things that's

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.140
so important for
founders to know

00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.300
is that there's a
lot of rejection when

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.240
you do entrepreneurship, whether
it's raising money or getting

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:23.980
customers.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.060
Sometimes people will
come and it's like,

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.140
I've sent 500 emails
through LinkedIn

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.730
and I got two responses
and they're devastated.

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.650
I'm like, well, you got
two, that's awesome, right?

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:37.430
And it's really hard
at the beginning

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:38.930
to get somebody
to listen to you.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:42.200
But the good founders,
because they're obsessed,

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:43.460
they don't give up, right?

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.918
And they're like, OK, maybe
LinkedIn was not the right way,

00:26:45.918 --> 00:26:48.140
I should do this other
thing or whatever.

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.630
It's the same when you start.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.960
JORGE CUETO: Do you approach how
you look at first time founders

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.970
differently than how
you approach people

00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:58.140
who have had several
start-ups potentially

00:26:58.140 --> 00:27:00.167
or who have pivoted?

00:27:00.167 --> 00:27:02.000
PEJMAN NOZAD: Our
approach is not different.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.054
It's the same way, but
obviously at different stages

00:27:05.054 --> 00:27:06.470
you need a different
type of help.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:08.630
If you're a second or
third time founder,

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.820
maybe you need an
introduction from us

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.202
to [INAUDIBLE] of a public
company and they take it.

00:27:13.202 --> 00:27:14.660
But if you're a
first time founder,

00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.900
you need to put an operations
plan together with us.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.900
So it all depends on the
maturity of the founder.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.066
And we've worked with both.

00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:23.690
If you look at our
portfolio companies,

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:25.610
we have a lot of
first time founders,

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:28.380
but we have founding teams
that are second or third time

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.470
they're starting a company.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.310
JORGE CUETO: Another thing that
I really appreciate about Pear

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:37.010
as a firm is that you
place a lot of emphasis

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:39.350
on the immigrant experience.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:41.830
And especially right now in
today's political climate,

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:45.090
I think that's really important
and it's also very courageous.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.420
And I was wondering
if there's been

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.530
any impact from the current
political climate on your work

00:27:51.530 --> 00:27:55.010
with Pear, if you've seen
maybe changes in the people who

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:57.860
are pitching to you or
any changes in the people

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.340
that ultimately get funded.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.690
MAR HERSHENSON: I think the
impact is on our companies.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:07.460
I think we have founders
that can't go home

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.110
and that's a big deal.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:11.670
If you can't go home to see
your sister get married,

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:13.280
I think that's a
big deal, right?

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:19.700
So at a personal level, we
don't have a large Immigration

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:22.790
Department like maybe you
HR like Google does, right?

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.120
So we've got involved
on how to help them.

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.860
But

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.910
So we have stories
that have happened.

00:28:31.910 --> 00:28:35.270
We haven't seen
necessarily a change

00:28:35.270 --> 00:28:39.890
in that people that come pitch
to us because some of them

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:44.020
are either on an H1 or
they're just finishing school

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.220
so they're on an
OPT visa or whatnot.

00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:50.270
But Pejman and I are experts
at writing all these letters

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:53.240
of recommendation
for our founders

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.910
and I think a lot of them
have been able to get them.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.850
Anyway, it's not good news.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:02.190
Pejman is very committed to this
cause and he can talk bout it.

00:29:02.190 --> 00:29:06.710
PEJMAN NOZAD: I came 24 years
ago as an Iranian Muslim.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:09.590
And my immigration status
after I came was unknown,

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:12.510
but America never judged me.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.640
It gave me all the
opportunities to thrive

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.190
and I still feel
the same thing and I

00:29:16.190 --> 00:29:19.940
hope the spirit of America stays
that way when I arrived here

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.410
24 years ago.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:24.430
And I think if you look
at this room, even,

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:26.210
and what Google and
people are doing

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.789
in Silicon Valley it's just
a testament of that spirit.

00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:32.330
JORGE CUETO: And I
think sometimes it

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:35.240
can be difficult to
bring up one's background

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:37.520
or maybe make
connections to things

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.440
like your immigrant background,
given the political climate.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.320
How do you approach
deciding when

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.410
to speak up about
something or what to say

00:29:48.410 --> 00:29:50.240
in response to certain issues?

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:52.800
How do you balance those things?

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.629
PEJMAN NOZAD: I always learned
to stand up for my rights

00:29:55.629 --> 00:29:56.420
and whatever it is.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:59.820
And I think America
is a great country

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.710
that your voice is heard if
you just raise your voice.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:06.710
I'm not hesitant to
raise my voice when I

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:10.194
want to stand up for my rights.

00:30:10.194 --> 00:30:11.610
JORGE CUETO: And
when you do that,

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.685
do you see support from
fellow people in the industry

00:30:14.685 --> 00:30:15.935
or have there been instances--

00:30:15.935 --> 00:30:16.820
PEJMAN NOZAD:
Yeah, very much so.

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.194
I think especially
in the Valley,

00:30:18.194 --> 00:30:20.960
you get so much support
from the people here.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.460
I mean, almost everybody's
immigrant two grandfathers

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.290
backward, three.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.820
I've got always huge support.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:36.270
And even though the political
climate is changed by Trump,

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.780
I just don't feel it in
Silicon Valley it's happening.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:43.180
It's the same Silicon Valley
I know for the last 24 years.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.880
But as Mar mentioned, its
just very difficult I think.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.302
I'm from Iran and
Iran has a university,

00:30:50.302 --> 00:30:52.760
I think [INAUDIBLE] here has
gone to it, Sharif University.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.560
It has the highest
acceptance of PhD

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.500
at Stanford, that EE
department, like Mar is.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.300
People are deciding
not to come here.

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:01.440
They go to Canada or
they go to England.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:03.230
So I think in the
end, America is

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:06.172
losing a lot of amazing talent
from all over the world.

00:31:08.295 --> 00:31:10.170
MAR HERSHENSON: Maybe
I should say something.

00:31:10.170 --> 00:31:12.770
I think sometimes we do get
founders that come and say,

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.220
I have a visa issue.

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:18.440
And I think Pejman and I,
once we find somebody we want,

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.350
will do whatever we can
to help this person.

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:25.320
It's no show stopper
for us so we'll try

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.830
whatever we can to get them in.

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.580
JORGE CUETO: I know
both of you are really

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.730
focused on giving back
to the communities

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:34.359
that you identify
with, and I was just

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:36.150
wondering if you could
tell us a little bit

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:37.950
about the ways in
which you give back

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.690
and your experience
about why you do it

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.529
and what you get from it.

00:31:43.529 --> 00:31:44.320
PEJMAN NOZAD: Yeah.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.870
I think it was the
Garage Program that's

00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:50.980
an example of how much time
and effort it takes from us.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:57.130
And without any specific
request of owning any ownership

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:58.510
in these companies.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.790
So that really
tells that we really

00:32:00.790 --> 00:32:03.520
want to give back, at least
to that particular community.

00:32:07.021 --> 00:32:09.760
Specifically, Mar-- even
though some of the companies

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.920
we don't want to invest,
she spends so much time.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:17.110
There's a company that we liked
to Stanford GSB business school

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.830
founders.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.510
They wanted to get to
YC and then Mar spent

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:22.930
the last two weeks coaching
them how to get to YC.

00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.730
And they got to YC yesterday.

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.730
So I think that that tells you
that we're all about helping

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:30.679
founders at the core.

00:32:30.679 --> 00:32:32.470
JORGE CUETO: And you
also don't necessarily

00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:38.500
see someone joining
another firm as a negative.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.310
MAR HERSHENSON: No.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:39.810
No.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.880
I mean, I think it's a big
world and companies last

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.320
for a long time.

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.120
So you never know, right?

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.290
And a founder, it's rare that
you stay in a company forever.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.350
You have many companies
inside of you.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:56.410
So at the end, we just
want people to do well.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:59.650
That's how I see
the world, anyways.

00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:02.310
One company is not going
to make or break us.

00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:03.560
JORGE CUETO: Do you have any--

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:04.600
PEJMAN NOZAD: Unless
it was Google.

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.850
MAR HERSHENSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:33:07.664 --> 00:33:09.830
JORGE CUETO: They'll just
buy out all the companies.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.910
Do you have any
stories about companies

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:18.390
that you funded that
you particularly

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:21.147
saw great success in and
maybe the qualities reflected

00:33:21.147 --> 00:33:21.855
in their success?

00:33:25.075 --> 00:33:25.950
MAR HERSHENSON: Yeah.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:29.340
Maybe I'll talk about the
first company we actually

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:32.460
did out of a fund, it's
called Branch Metric.

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.010
It's a deep linking platform.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:39.070
And I met them when they
were students at school

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.950
and so they were students.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:44.730
It was November they were
students for still a long time.

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:46.770
But the CEO presented
what they were

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:49.440
doing at the time,
which was a mobile app

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.770
to print pictures,
which is completely

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:54.350
different from a
deep linking up.

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:57.990
But I came and I rushed
to Pejman and I said,

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:01.080
Pejman, we have
to fund this guy.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.590
I don't really know what
he's doing, but he's great

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:07.170
and I'm sure he's going
to figure it out, right.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:12.090
So that's how we
got into Branch.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:16.050
They basically pivoted twice
until they did what they did.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:18.270
But why did I think
in that first meeting

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:23.850
that this guy would be a great
CEO and was not going to stop?

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:27.630
He is what I call
a data-driven CEO.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:32.170
So everything he says almost
has a number and a reason why.

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.280
So it's not hand-wavy and
he has done his homework

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.409
and he kind of knows
where he's going.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:40.469
That's why I was like, I
want to work for this guy

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:43.687
because I know that we
are going to go somewhere.

00:34:43.687 --> 00:34:46.270
And if we don't get them, he'll
turn around and figure it out.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.179
And that's basically
what he did.

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:51.030
I mean, it's pretty impressive.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:54.210
The success of the company
was not an accident.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:57.970
The company pivoted twice
into what they're doing

00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:01.179
and it was all really literally
data-driven decisions.

00:35:01.179 --> 00:35:02.720
They're not getting
enough customers,

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.540
oh maybe we should build
an SDK for printing.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.595
Oh, how do we get people
to install and open it

00:35:08.595 --> 00:35:09.550
in the right place?

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:13.190
And that's how they eventually
got into deep linking.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:16.250
Anyway, so that's one story.

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:17.230
I have many.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.122
Pejman?

00:35:19.122 --> 00:35:20.580
PEJMAN NOZAD: I
think you mentioned

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.280
that if you were telling me,
Pejman, you're starting a fund

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:26.060
and you invest in a
Korean cosmetic product,

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:29.130
I would have said I would
never do it until you meet

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:30.660
the founder and CEO of Memebox.

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:36.360
So as Mar mentioned, he studies
computer science in Korea,

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:40.710
then decided to go to serve in
the Peace Corps in Afghanistan,

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:44.130
then decided to go
to work for Tom Ford

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.470
and figure out that
Korean cosmetic products,

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:47.280
people love it.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:50.210
After France, it's the
second biggest market

00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:51.960
in the world of Korean
cosmetics products.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.000
Much cheaper, same quality.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.960
And he wanted to build a brand
that serves the entire world.

00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:02.280
And fast forward, this year
they're making a lot of money,

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.400
they might go public.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:07.740
So his desire to build
something in a market that is so

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:10.580
saturated was just astonishing.

00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:14.290
And the quality of the founder
who walks through the wall

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.544
to make things happen was just
really, really obvious in him.

00:36:17.544 --> 00:36:19.710
MAR HERSHENSON: And may I
say one more founder story

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.380
because I think those are the
best stories, not really ours.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.240
But we have a company
called Aurora Solar

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.720
and it's founded
by two immigrants.

00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.860
One is actually from Kenya and
the other one is from Germany.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.680
These guys met at Stanford.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.060
But the guy from Kenya, he had
started a solar installation

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:46.230
company in his home country
and when he came here,

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.570
he tried to turn
it into a business.

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:52.860
they realized that the solar
installation was very manual

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.840
and that they could actually
automate it with software.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.530
Today, they're the
number one software

00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:00.990
use for any solar installation.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:04.920
It's actually super
techy and impressive.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:08.790
But anyways, this was in 2013.

00:37:08.790 --> 00:37:12.480
And time flies, but in
2013 if you said solar,

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:15.120
people were like, oh, no,
we can't talk to you, right?

00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:19.950
So they could not get
any money, they could not

00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:23.740
get any place to live or
work out of, et cetera.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:28.680
So this guy, Sam, the founder,
called us almost begging,

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.480
please let us stay
in your office

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.410
because we don't
have anywhere to go.

00:37:32.410 --> 00:37:34.370
And that's how we met him.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:38.260
But just the fact that he had
the courage to come and say,

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.550
I don't have anything and
nobody really cares but lend me

00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:43.840
a hand, that was a big deal.

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:46.560
So again, it's the
sort of mentality

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.480
that I'm going to
work and I want

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:51.060
to bring solar energy to
Kenya and I want to solve it

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.610
and I'm working on this problem,
I'm not going to give up.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:54.496
So anyways.

00:37:54.496 --> 00:37:55.870
PEJMAN NOZAD: And
that's why they

00:37:55.870 --> 00:37:57.750
were chosen the number
one software company

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:01.110
in the entire solar industry.

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:03.450
JORGE CUETO: You both
talked about the founders

00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:05.880
being very passionate
about specific industries

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.680
or specific products.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.720
Do you have anything,
any opinion,

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:14.147
with regard to people who maybe
aren't working on something

00:38:14.147 --> 00:38:16.230
that they're passionate
about but they're doing it

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:19.830
because maybe their financial
circumstances require them

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.950
to work in that or maybe
they're trying to build up

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:26.360
the skills to then do something
that they're passionate about?

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.940
Do you think there's a certain
point in which doing that

00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.250
for too long can be a
bad thing and at what

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:35.180
point do you make the decision
to actually do something

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.984
that you're passionate about?

00:38:36.984 --> 00:38:39.150
MAR HERSHENSON: I mean, it
really depends on people.

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:43.230
But I do encourage
the students that

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.050
come out of school to go get
a job or learn something.

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:49.500
It's not my recommendation
to do a company right now,

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:50.310
right after school.

00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:52.740
It has to be a very,
very special situation.

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:55.800
Because I think you
learn a lot by you're

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:58.420
not done right after school,
you're not completely done,

00:38:58.420 --> 00:38:58.920
right?

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:02.710
You are learning for the first
five to 10 years of your career

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.150
just really learning.

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:08.610
So we pay so much attention
as to what college we go,

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:10.890
but I think the impact
on your careers,

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:14.820
the first job you have is much
more impactful than necessarily

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.930
what college you went to.

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:20.050
So I'm totally
supportive of that

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:23.160
and that's the advice I
give to most people, right.

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.120
I think at some
point in your life,

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.200
it gets really, really hard
to go to a start-up because

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.360
of the circumstance of life.

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.830
You're making a lot of
money, you have a family,

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.330
maybe you are the only person
in your family that's working.

00:39:36.330 --> 00:39:38.560
So it's just harder, right?

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:41.590
Again, people are super
obsessed, they figure it out,

00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:42.090
right?

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:44.730
I mean, humans are very capable.

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:45.970
But it's harder.

00:39:48.477 --> 00:39:50.310
PEJMAN NOZAD: My same
philosophy as Mar has.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.824
I mean, I think sometimes
you do a job that just pays

00:39:52.824 --> 00:39:54.990
for the bill and the family
and you might not really

00:39:54.990 --> 00:39:57.300
be passionate, but I
think you can balance it.

00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.450
If you like art, you can
spend your weekend doing art.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:03.210
If you like soccer like
me, you can play soccer.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.552
So I think Google is really
good at this 80/20 things.

00:40:06.552 --> 00:40:08.260
I don't know if it's
going around or not,

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:10.610
but I think you can
balance your life.

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:11.360
JORGE CUETO: Yeah.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.494
We still have 20% projects.

00:40:12.494 --> 00:40:15.100
PEJMAN NOZAD: Find your passion.

00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.130
JORGE CUETO: What about
looking forward into the tech

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:19.130
industry as a whole?

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:22.150
Do you see any
specific areas that

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:26.320
have a potential for high
growth in the coming years?

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.050
PEJMAN NOZAD: I mean, I let
Mar talk about the platform she

00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:31.420
thinks is the future, AI.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:34.150
But I think we don't know.

00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:36.970
I think our motto is, investors
don't create the future,

00:40:36.970 --> 00:40:38.690
entrepreneurs do,
and we stick to it.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:43.439
We think always entrepreneurs
see future before us.

00:40:43.439 --> 00:40:44.980
And we don't want
to corner ourselves

00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.420
in any particular sector.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:49.030
And that's one of the reasons
if you look at our portfolio

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:52.540
companies, you have companies
all over the map and the reason

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.030
is we really believe in
the founders were solving

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.125
a real problem in a big market.

00:40:57.125 --> 00:40:58.000
MAR HERSHENSON: Yeah.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.640
It's really hard to
predict the future.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:03.820
To be honest, it's really hard.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.200
And I know we are surrounded
by great investors that have

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.510
thesis and so on and so on.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.259
And sometimes they get
it right, sometimes

00:41:11.259 --> 00:41:12.310
they don't get it right.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:13.390
I'll tell you my story.

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:16.150
I was in the
semiconductor business

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:20.080
and semiconductors was a
great industry in the '90s

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.360
and then it almost died.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.830
All the venture
firms in the Valley

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:26.860
were funding semiconductor
companies and now

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.020
nobody funds semiconductor
companies, right?

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:33.415
So I thought I would never
work in semiconductors again

00:41:33.415 --> 00:41:36.160
and the last company we
did was in semiconductors.

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.750
So you just never know.

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:40.180
And again, it's all
based on the team.

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:42.010
They had a convincing
pitch of why

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.740
that was a good opportunity
and all the issues

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.435
that one would face
with semiconductors.

00:41:47.435 --> 00:41:49.060
We just kind of like
forgot about them.

00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:54.700
PEJMAN NOZAD: When we
started the fund in 2013,

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:57.020
I think everybody was
talking about block chain

00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:01.140
and then six months after
it was IOT, then was drones,

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.780
and today it's AI.

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.870
I mean, one investor
told me that if you

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:09.010
sprinkle a little AI on
your deck, you get funded.

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:11.660
And information changes
happen pretty quickly.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.160
MAR HERSHENSON: And we see it,
everybody's on AI something.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.920
We're like do you have
an engineer or something?

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.342
No, but we'll hire them.

00:42:19.342 --> 00:42:20.950
I'm like, OK.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.990
So we get.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:24.210
Founders get it, too.

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:26.050
They're smart.

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:28.160
JORGE CUETO: What about
VR and autonomous--

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:31.740
MAR HERSHENSON:
Also, also, also.

00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.524
I also heard something last
week, which is interesting.

00:42:34.524 --> 00:42:36.440
I think autonomous driving
is on its way down.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.070
I'm like, it hasn't even
made it [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:40.070 --> 00:42:40.820
JORGE CUETO: Cool.

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:43.030
So I think at this
point, we can open up

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:45.070
to questions from the audience.

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:46.780
AUDIENCE: What
percentage of women

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:49.192
were participants in
the Garage Program

00:42:49.192 --> 00:42:50.650
since you've done
it for four years

00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:54.790
and do you do anything to try
to recruit from that category?

00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:55.780
MAR HERSHENSON: Yes.

00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:56.280
OK.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.410
I'll tell you, in the first
year we started Garage,

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:04.034
we did it with two people that
head the ACM Group at Stanford.

00:43:04.034 --> 00:43:05.950
And the way we started
was, hey, why don't you

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:08.920
come up with a list of 20 people
that we could reach out to,

00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:09.640
right?

00:43:09.640 --> 00:43:13.850
So they came to us and
that 20 list was all guys.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:18.760
I'm like, OK, guys, we need some
diversity in this group, right?

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:22.300
So we had to force them
to go find some women.

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:27.130
And I think we had in that
Garage group four women.

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:30.160
Two actually were of
color, which was great.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.320
But it was clearly
not the majority

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.930
because we had about 15 to
20 people, give or take.

00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:40.960
And the second year
we did call out

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.530
for people and the same
ratios to be honest, right?

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:45.910
We've tried really hard.

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.950
This year is actually
maybe the highest

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.500
that we have in terms of
ratio, but it's always

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.300
under 50% for sure.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.512
I would say around 30%, 35%.

00:43:55.512 --> 00:43:57.220
PEJMAN NOZAD: But we
do some initiatives.

00:43:57.220 --> 00:44:01.550
Like for example, we do a lot
of Hackathon at our place.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:03.890
The first Hackathon
was only for girls.

00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:06.980
And the winner had dinner
with John [INAUDIBLE],

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.700
which is like kind
of life-changing.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.610
And if you look at our
portfolio companies,

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:13.160
we have pretty amazing
female founders.

00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:17.110
And we picked them because
they're the best at what they

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:18.889
do, not because they're women.

00:44:18.889 --> 00:44:20.680
They're really exceptional
at what they do.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.800
So we don't wake
up in the morning,

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.670
so next quarter we'll only fund
men and then the other quarter

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:25.630
women.

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:27.472
These women are just
really exceptional

00:44:27.472 --> 00:44:28.930
and happen to be
the founder or CEO

00:44:28.930 --> 00:44:31.085
and we're very lucky
to work with them.

00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:31.960
MAR HERSHENSON: Yeah.

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.626
So mostly it's reachout
that we've done.

00:44:33.626 --> 00:44:36.820
We did a reachout for she++,
which is a group at Stanford,

00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.270
and it's a great group.

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:44.500
Anyways, we hosted some sort
of design thinking activity

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.160
for them.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.810
Anyway, this was
maybe two years ago.

00:44:46.810 --> 00:44:50.950
But out of that we met
our current engineer

00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:52.660
in residence, who
happens to be a woman,

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.570
and she came from that
reachout program that we did.

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:57.900
So that was great.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:00.650
AUDIENCE: So you
spoke about founders

00:45:00.650 --> 00:45:04.290
who have lived the problem
or have experienced it

00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:05.790
in some way.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:07.620
As someone fresh
out of college, I'm

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.020
interested in solving
problems for enterprise

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:11.970
because I see that
the software there

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.480
is much worse than the stuff
that we have as consumers.

00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.490
But obviously, I've
only ever worked

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:19.580
at very tech forward
companies like Google

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:22.650
where we build our own
solutions to all these problems.

00:45:22.650 --> 00:45:25.140
What is some advice
you might have

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:28.110
for someone like me to either
go get that experience myself

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:31.050
with those problems
or find people?

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:33.200
PEJMAN NOZAD: I have some ideas.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.510
So I think first of
all, you have to find--

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:39.630
I mean, when you say enterprise
is just such a big place,

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:42.450
I think you should figure
out where in enterprise you

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:45.630
want to focus and get
educated and go to places.

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:48.510
As Mar mentioned, there's so
much information online you

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:51.180
can find and there's so many
groups you can go and learn

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.310
from them, there are some
conferences you can go.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:56.670
But narrow it down and exactly
what you mean by enterprise.

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.010
And just surround
yourself with the people

00:45:59.010 --> 00:46:01.017
who have done it
before, ask questions.

00:46:01.017 --> 00:46:02.850
MAR HERSHENSON: And
sometimes the best thing

00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:05.370
is to actually try to
put something out, right?

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:09.210
And I mean, I want
to say so easy,

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:12.900
but it's relatively easy
to mock up some stuff

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:16.200
and run it by
people in industry.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:19.810
I don't know if you
have any ideas in mind.

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.740
But that's what I encourage
people to do in the Garage.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.280
When they don't know
what to work on,

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:26.961
we actually bring
speakers to tell them

00:46:26.961 --> 00:46:27.960
what problems they have.

00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.043
That's how Garage started.

00:46:29.043 --> 00:46:31.170
So we would bring people
from media or people

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:34.049
from real estate or e-commerce
and they would be like,

00:46:34.049 --> 00:46:35.340
these are the problems we have.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:38.580
And students would actually say,
work because they would come up

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:39.900
with solutions.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.110
Similar to you,
that's how it started.

00:46:42.110 --> 00:46:43.840
They said, we can
code anything, we just

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.750
don't know what to code.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.170
And so anyway, they're getting
the feedback from people.

00:46:49.170 --> 00:46:51.720
And I encourage, like Pejman
said, you can do the same

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:53.885
but you almost want to
take it a step further.

00:46:53.885 --> 00:46:55.260
This is when you
tell people, I'm

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:56.460
going to build this,
what do you think?

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:57.793
People are like, oh yeah, great.

00:46:57.793 --> 00:46:58.530
Great.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.738
And people say like, wait,
I have product market fit,

00:47:00.738 --> 00:47:02.240
I'm going to go do it.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.680
And truly, until
you tell somebody,

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:07.890
will you pay me for doing
this, Then if you have

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.280
to really product market fit.

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:11.670
And sometimes people just
need to see a little more

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:16.830
than an idea in words or some
sort of PowerPoint et cetera.

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:18.210
But anyway, just start.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:20.310
That's my big advice.

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.026
That's the best way to finish.

00:47:22.026 --> 00:47:23.400
JORGE CUETO: One
of the questions

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:26.370
that we got is what advice do
you have for someone at Google

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:29.490
who is interested in going
into venture capital?

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:31.711
MAR HERSHENSON:
Talk to Pear, right?

00:47:31.711 --> 00:47:32.960
PEJMAN NOZAD: No, you're open.

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:37.800
Actually, we just hired a person
from Stanford Business School

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.370
that she's actually in food.

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:44.130
So she worked for Good
Eggs, she was a chef before.

00:47:44.130 --> 00:47:47.100
And given her expertise
and background,

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:49.960
we are creating a call
for a start-up in food.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:52.500
So if you're interested
in any particular way

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.060
of being a venture capitalist,
we'd love to talk to you.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:59.220
And when you think venture
capital world from outside,

00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:03.510
it looks like you sit down in a
meeting and you look at a pitch

00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:05.800
and then you provide
some feedback.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.204
It's just one part of
being a venture capitalist.

00:48:08.204 --> 00:48:09.870
I think a good venture
capitalist should

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:11.550
have a really good deal flow.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:13.410
I think if you don't
have a good deal flow,

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:15.750
you end up picking
the wrong founder.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:18.030
So if you're coming
out of Google,

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:19.820
you have already a
great community here

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.480
that could be a good deal flow.

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.240
You have to be able
to pick winners.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.410
It takes time.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:26.021
But just find your
niche if you want

00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:27.645
to be a venture
capitalist because it's

00:48:27.645 --> 00:48:28.920
a saturated market.

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.005
But as always, the industry
looks for talented people.

00:48:32.005 --> 00:48:32.880
MAR HERSHENSON: Yeah.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:34.296
I want to say
something about that

00:48:34.296 --> 00:48:38.170
because I think it's the
same advice I gave earlier

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:39.871
is the best way is to start.

00:48:39.871 --> 00:48:41.370
And I think we live
in a world where

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:44.400
you don't have to wait and
get permission to get started,

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.060
right?

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:49.022
So let's assume I wanted to
get into venture capital now.

00:48:49.022 --> 00:48:50.730
The first thing I
would do is start doing

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.080
some angel investing, right?

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:55.140
I think if you're working
at Google as an engineer,

00:48:55.140 --> 00:48:58.200
I would guess you can use some
percentage of whatever you're

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.120
making every year
and devote it to do

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.080
some angel investing, right?

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.620
And just doing a
couple of investments

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:09.420
is going to teach you so much
about what it takes, right?

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.840
Like Pejman says,
it looks some way,

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:14.370
but once you get in it's
kind of dirty and messy

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:17.400
and it requires a lot
of time, et cetera.

00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:20.880
The other thing that I think
the world has given us right

00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:25.140
now is this amazing social media
and kind of digital access.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.530
So there's a lot of people
in the last five to 10 years

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:31.980
that have built their own
brand just by I have a podcast

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.280
and they talk about something
or I have a newsletter on AI

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.750
or whatever.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.000
Every day there's some
new vertical or pitch

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
that people do and they're
getting enough sourcing

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.370
that they build their own
deal flow to get going.

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:47.055
So anyways, again,
whoever answered

00:49:47.055 --> 00:49:50.577
in Dory, that mysterious face,
I'm happy to chat with them.

00:49:50.577 --> 00:49:52.035
AUDIENCE: Some of
the entrepreneurs

00:49:52.035 --> 00:49:54.780
I respect the most have
either lost everything or been

00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:57.050
on the verge of losing
everything more than one time

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:59.410
and they're so
determined that that's

00:49:59.410 --> 00:50:01.419
OK they caution to the wind.

00:50:01.419 --> 00:50:03.210
Is that something you
look for, that people

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:06.929
that if they didn't have any
path to funding from a group

00:50:06.929 --> 00:50:08.970
like yours, that they
would just figure out a way

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:10.710
and be prepared
to put everything

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:11.880
at risk for their idea?

00:50:13.839 --> 00:50:15.630
MAR HERSHENSON: Sorry,
can you repeat that?

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:16.255
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:16.255 --> 00:50:18.720
So do you look for something
that is a proxy of this

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.414
willingness to-- that
you'd be willing to go--

00:50:21.414 --> 00:50:22.330
MAR HERSHENSON: We do.

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:23.270
AUDIENCE: The
entrepreneurs that are

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:25.410
really good or they seem,
they have gone bankrupt

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:27.360
one or more times or
are on the verge of it

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:27.990
and is that something
that you look for?

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:29.781
MAR HERSHENSON: I mean,
it's not bankruptcy

00:50:29.781 --> 00:50:32.735
that we're necessarily
looking for.

00:50:32.735 --> 00:50:34.992
But yeah, I mean, we do
look for that person that

00:50:34.992 --> 00:50:36.200
is like, I'm working on this.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:38.741
Sometimes people come and it's
like I'm starting this company

00:50:38.741 --> 00:50:41.136
but I'm working
here in the meantime

00:50:41.136 --> 00:50:42.510
and you know
they've been working

00:50:42.510 --> 00:50:45.090
and they could
afford quote unquote

00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:48.300
to go do something full time
and really commit, right?

00:50:48.300 --> 00:50:53.130
So it's definitely
a sign that doesn't

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:55.860
make us feel super comfy
about the founder, right?

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.710
But again, everybody's
different, right?

00:50:58.710 --> 00:51:01.440
And some people-- it doesn't
mean because you have it

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.375
easy, you can't
be a good founder

00:51:03.375 --> 00:51:06.030
and it doesn't mean
because you haven't hired,

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:08.520
you're automatically
a good founder, right?

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:11.910
It's a business of exceptions.

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:13.500
AUDIENCE: One of
the hardest things

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.780
I hear my friends
say about at VC

00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:21.840
is that bad ideas look just like
the good ideas at first glance.

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.420
And when you become good, you
get thousands and thousands

00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.220
of deals coming
across and you have

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.010
to be able to spot the ones that
look bad but are really, really

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:29.820
awesome.

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:31.320
What are your secrets
to doing that?

00:51:35.684 --> 00:51:37.600
PEJMAN NOZAD: I think
it's kind of the pattern

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.070
recognition among the founders.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:41.620
We typically want
to meet founders.

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.740
Last year we met
2,000 companies.

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.080
We met 2,000 companies.

00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:49.740
Normally, we get about
10,000 leads and so on.

00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:53.930
And because we do it so early,
we typically look at the idea

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:57.024
and we really want to
get to know the founder.

00:51:57.024 --> 00:51:58.940
And in part of it is
just pattern recognition.

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.090
When you do it
for so many years,

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:03.440
you just understand
the character

00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.060
of some of the founders.

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:08.680
But yes, I mean, like
in the case of Branch,

00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:11.980
the first idea was
FitBit for dogs.

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:12.940
No, seriously.

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:15.574
And I think no one
wants to do that.

00:52:15.574 --> 00:52:16.990
But it was about
the founding team

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:19.180
and the character
to build something

00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:23.215
and their determination to
do it that attracted us.

00:52:23.215 --> 00:52:24.590
MAR HERSHENSON:
It's really hard.

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:26.390
I think there a high error rate.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:28.820
A venture looks very glamorous.

00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:30.710
We're only known
for our successes,

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:32.210
not for our failures, right?

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:34.710
So we can invest in
companies that don't make it

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:38.669
and nobody knows
or nobody cares.

00:52:38.669 --> 00:52:40.710
I think it was really
important for the founders.

00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:44.370
We could miss 10 great companies
and it's nowhere to be seen,

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:44.870
right?

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:50.840
So I mean, we have our
own internal KPIs to see

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.250
how we're doing and so on.

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:56.810
But I think we're almost
lucky that we're not measured

00:52:56.810 --> 00:52:58.670
externally on those misses.

00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:59.510
But it's hard.

00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:02.390
Truth, it's hard and
everybody misses, right?

00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:07.880
And I think only hard work and
obsession gets you to be better

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:10.079
at the end of the day.

00:53:10.079 --> 00:53:11.870
JORGE CUETO: Do you
have any notable misses

00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:14.150
that you can talk about?

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:15.440
Yes, Yes, we do.

00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:20.270
It's early in the fund
because we may have

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:22.220
missed more than I know of.

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.220
I think we missed Box, which
is a giant company now.

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:27.920
It's like Costco online.

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:32.540
And I think, again, if we
had stuck by our principles,

00:53:32.540 --> 00:53:34.430
sometimes it's like
missing our principles.

00:53:34.430 --> 00:53:38.300
It's really hard to say,
great founders, something

00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:40.510
doesn't make sense but it's OK.

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:43.550
And at the time, it's like, wow,
are they competing with Amazon?

00:53:43.550 --> 00:53:46.070
Who wants to
compete with Amazon?

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:49.580
And it was a little later stage,
but we missed that company,

00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.260
for example.

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:53.910
AUDIENCE: So what kind of advice
do you give to the founders,

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:55.580
whether they're looking
for new founders

00:53:55.580 --> 00:53:59.120
or they're looking to bring
the first three or four

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.240
people on the team, what kind of
characteristics and what advice

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:04.610
do you give them as
they expand bringing

00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:06.575
new people into the team?

00:54:06.575 --> 00:54:08.200
MAR HERSHENSON: That's
a good question.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:08.910
And I think--

00:54:08.910 --> 00:54:10.370
OK, in general,
so I think there's

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:11.900
two types of recruiting.

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.690
One is like your founding team
and then obviously, a lot of

00:54:15.690 --> 00:54:20.810
plys later the first 10 people,
the first 100, et cetera.

00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:26.330
But if you are building
that founding team,

00:54:26.330 --> 00:54:29.930
the most important advice
is to take your time

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:32.330
and actually be super
focused at doing it.

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:33.310
It takes time, right?

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:36.222
It doesn't just happen by
itself that all of a sudden,

00:54:36.222 --> 00:54:38.180
you find your founder
and it's a perfect thing.

00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:40.470
It's because you are out
there and you're trying

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:42.260
to find this person, right?

00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:45.600
And you can't just hire the
first person that comes along

00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.780
or bring or get together
with the first person that

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.310
comes along.

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:52.430
Because its like
finding a wife, right?

00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:54.530
You could marry your
first girlfriend,

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:57.320
but maybe it was a bad idea
if your first girlfriend

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:58.190
was like 14.

00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:59.380
I don't know.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.620
Its the same thing, right?

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:05.090
So you have to be super patient
at making the right choice.

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.290
The second thing is I think
its good to find people

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:08.960
that are complementary,
especially

00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:11.780
if you are starting from zero.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:14.150
If you want to pull
out a company together,

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:18.200
you maybe need
somebody that has--

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:21.890
an engineer, a front end
engineer, and a data scientist

00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:25.280
maybe, and some person
that's more in operations

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.350
or sales or something, right?

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:30.200
Sometimes it's one person that
can do three things, right?

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:32.000
Because you have
a founder that is

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.770
excellent at
speaking to customers

00:55:33.770 --> 00:55:35.700
and they've built
everything and so on

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:37.424
and they can just pull it out.

00:55:37.424 --> 00:55:38.840
But sometimes you
need two people,

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.590
sometimes you need
three people, right?

00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:44.660
And I think for me, I
think it's important--

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.630
I see it in companies when
the critical components

00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:50.300
of the company are in
the DNA of that company

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.850
from very, very early on,
you have a higher chance

00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:54.680
of success.

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:55.580
Not always the case.

00:55:55.580 --> 00:56:00.290
But a good example is if you're
building a consumer brand,

00:56:00.290 --> 00:56:03.200
some companies will say, oh,
we have this great product

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:05.450
and we'll hire a branding
agency later, right?

00:56:05.450 --> 00:56:07.080
But if you're a
consumer company,

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:09.980
it's good to have consumer
DNA early in the company.

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:13.470
For example, you should
go find that person.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.770
I call it the
minimum viable team.

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:18.050
So the minimum viable product.

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:20.870
PEJMAN NOZAD: I want to
add that a lot of people

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:25.950
can build product, not many
people can build companies.

00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:27.770
So if you're looking
for a co-founder,

00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:30.100
look for those people who
have, as Mar mentioned,

00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:31.130
complementary skills.

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.020
But it can help you
build companies.

00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:36.070
If you're looking for a VP of
engineering as a co-founder,

00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:38.045
it's not enough to just
be a great engineer

00:56:38.045 --> 00:56:39.500
as you built the product.

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:41.900
You just need to be
able to attract talent.

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:43.100
So just spend a lot of time.

00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:47.840
And I learned that spending
time socially tells a lot

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.380
about that particular person.

00:56:49.380 --> 00:56:50.570
So get them out there.

00:56:50.570 --> 00:56:53.400
Go for a walk or
go see a ball game.

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.480
Just get to know them
and just be patient.

00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.850
And then making sure you
share the same vision.

00:56:59.850 --> 00:57:04.140
The most difficult thing as an
early stage investor is when

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.930
founders cannot get along.

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:09.050
You always can raise money, you
can always change the product

00:57:09.050 --> 00:57:12.910
and pivot, but when you
don't have the same vision

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:17.490
and you can't look eye
to eye, we can't fix it.

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:19.060
AUDIENCE: So a
question for you all,

00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.370
when should someone go to YC?

00:57:21.370 --> 00:57:24.890
Only because there's about
so much mindshare here

00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:28.422
versus taking seed VC from
a VC firm like yourself?

00:57:28.422 --> 00:57:29.630
So that's the first question.

00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:31.963
And the second one is, how
do you differentiate yourself

00:57:31.963 --> 00:57:33.290
among other VCs?

00:57:33.290 --> 00:57:36.530
Because for all of us here who
live and breathe technology,

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:39.450
we hear of so many
VCs all the time.

00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:43.200
a16z has a very strong
marketing machine.

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:45.860
So how do you sort of
benchmark yourself against them

00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:48.635
to sort of stand out?

00:57:48.635 --> 00:57:50.010
PEJMAN NOZAD: I
think today there

00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:53.490
are pretty amazing accelerators
out there, including YC,

00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:57.240
and they have done a really
good job in the last five to 10

00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.180
years to really help
founders from ground zero

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:02.310
to get to the next stage.

00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:06.430
It all depends on your need and
what you can accomplish there.

00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:10.170
There are other resources
that you can use to not

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:11.550
go through an accelerator.

00:58:11.550 --> 00:58:14.740
But again, I think it's case
by case. it's very different.

00:58:14.740 --> 00:58:18.100
Yes, the venture capital
community is just very crowded.

00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:22.140
But again, if you are
looking for people

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.510
who can help you
the first 24 months

00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:26.070
and help you build
the foundation

00:58:26.070 --> 00:58:27.990
of a long-lasting
company, you need

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:32.160
to look for venture capitalists
who have that experience.

00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:36.960
I think that their firm is
set up to serve you in that

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.430
and they take the
risk and they are

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:41.880
able to navigate the
challenges that you have.

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.350
There are other
VCs that you only

00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:45.310
go to them when you
have product market fit,

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:46.960
you have a customer,
and you can scale

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.750
and you want to build
an engineering team.

00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:50.250
That's a different skill set.

00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:51.570
We don't have that skill set.

00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:55.230
The DNA of our fund is helping
founders at ground zero,

00:58:55.230 --> 00:58:57.760
especially in the
first 24 months.

00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.420
So that's where
we've set up but.

00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.800
And Sequoyah might be
completely different.

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.720
You can go to them
when you have customers

00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:06.156
and they can help you to
become a massive company.

00:59:06.156 --> 00:59:08.030
MAR HERSHENSON: Maybe
I want to say something

00:59:08.030 --> 00:59:09.946
that I think is really
important for founders.

00:59:09.946 --> 00:59:15.780
There are multiple ways to
build a big company, right?

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:19.830
There is no one single place
you need to go to be successful.

00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:22.140
At the end, the companies
work not because of us

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.990
but because of the founders.

00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:27.100
And we're really like
support and we try very,

00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:28.600
very hard to support them.

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:31.140
But at the end, it's really the
founder that makes or breaks

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:33.540
the company, not us.

00:59:33.540 --> 00:59:34.810
I hope not us, anyway.

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:39.750
AUDIENCE: What sort
of characterizes

00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:42.480
when you see someone who has
been at Google for a while,

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:45.360
sort of like what are the
characteristics of in your mind

00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:47.360
picture when you see
someone like that?

00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:49.530
And the maybe particularly
for product management?

00:59:49.530 --> 00:59:51.571
Another way of asking it
is, what kinds of things

00:59:51.571 --> 00:59:55.470
should we make sure we
learn while we're here?

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:56.720
MAR HERSHENSON: Good question.

00:59:59.144 --> 01:00:01.060
Well, first of all, maybe
I will say something

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:04.530
before Pejman says
something smarter.

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:07.715
We love the PM role as
a CEO for our company.

01:00:07.715 --> 01:00:10.680
We think it's just amazing.

01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:15.024
Because when you're a PM,
you're like a mini CEO, right?

01:00:15.024 --> 01:00:17.190
When you're a CEO, you just
have more responsibility

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:19.080
because there's just more--

01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.410
I mean, you're on the
edge all the time.

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:25.130
But it's a great experience
and I think the more broad

01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:28.350
it is, right, like all
the way from customer

01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:31.530
to talking to the
engineer, the better--

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:33.280
the more exposure,
the more projects,

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.800
et cetera, and seeing things
from end to end, right?

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.610
Because it's different taking
a project from zero to 80%

01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:42.610
and from 80% to 100%
and getting it out there

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:44.670
and following up what
happens when you put it out

01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:47.190
and customers are
using it, et cetera.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:51.030
I don't know exactly how the
PM thing is organized here

01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:53.474
at Google, I apologize,
but I know every company

01:00:53.474 --> 01:00:54.390
is slightly different.

01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:57.540
But just all the way
and I think broad,

01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:00.950
that would be my advice to you.

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:03.330
PEJMAN NOZAD: And it
all depends if you're

01:01:03.330 --> 01:01:05.030
planning to start a company.

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:07.750
I think it depends on you have
to build your network here,

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:10.710
it's an amazing place
to build a network.

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:13.970
I met this CEO who is
building a great company--

01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:16.220
we actually missed being an
investor in that company--

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.800
and he was the PM
of a large company

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.430
and he telling me for
four years he was PM.

01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:24.210
Every time he shipped a product,
he then went to a smaller team

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:26.190
and started from ground
zero because he knew

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:27.810
he wants to start a company.

01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:31.140
So he was always uncomfortable
being in a big team.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:35.100
So he always requested the CEO,
I managed to ship this product,

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:37.410
I just want to go start
again from ground zero.

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:40.310
Just give me more
tasks that I can do.

01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:42.870
And speaking of that,
I have a request here.

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:45.330
As Mark mentioned, we
think PMs or companies

01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:48.525
are the best founders we
have seen because they're

01:01:48.525 --> 01:01:53.920
their own CEO and we are trying
to build a conference or a boot

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:57.390
camp maybe this year or
next year for PMs who

01:01:57.390 --> 01:02:00.000
want to start a company or
have already started it.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.700
So we'd love to hear from
you what type of topics

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.320
you want to be covered.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:06.930
So you can email,
Pejman@pear.vc.

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:08.430
I'd love to hear
from you because we

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:11.430
think it's just a pretty
amazing place for us

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:15.470
to partner with the
future founders.

01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:18.284
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
reaching out and getting help

01:02:18.284 --> 01:02:19.950
from people, and
that's always something

01:02:19.950 --> 01:02:22.050
I've been nervous about.

01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:24.210
When asking for
help from someone

01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:27.030
like yourselves, who
are busy individuals,

01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:29.100
do you have advice for
how to ask for help?

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:32.930
Should I go well it's a
well-formed, clearly scoped

01:02:32.930 --> 01:02:38.250
30-second question or are
people like yourselves

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:40.770
interested in having
kind of open-ended, kind

01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:42.355
of broader discussions as well?

01:02:42.355 --> 01:02:43.980
PEJMAN NOZAD: I always
found the people

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:48.070
who reach out that are very,
very specific, I respond.

01:02:48.070 --> 01:02:51.090
I always respond, but the
ones that are very specific,

01:02:51.090 --> 01:02:52.440
I make time.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.410
But the ones that say,
oh, can I have a coffee,

01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:57.750
I want to run an idea by you,
it's just not that specific.

01:02:57.750 --> 01:02:59.790
I don't know how I can help.

01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:01.500
We're just so busy.

01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:04.330
So just be very, very
specific and target the people

01:03:04.330 --> 01:03:06.030
who can really help
you and they're even

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:09.030
passionate about the topic
you want to discuss with them.

01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:10.960
MAR HERSHENSON: I think
I'd meet more people.

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:14.730
I'm like lower bar, I would say.

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:17.190
But I think for me when
people tell me their story,

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:19.920
again, like hey, I'm
at Google or I've

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.474
been working on
this for a long time

01:03:21.474 --> 01:03:22.890
and I'm thinking
of doing this, do

01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:25.440
you want to have a chat
with me, and if I have time

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.210
I definitely will do it.

01:03:27.210 --> 01:03:28.650
But again, sell yourself.

01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:31.119
If you don't have a company
to sell, sell yourself.

01:03:31.119 --> 01:03:31.910
PEJMAN NOZAD: Yeah.

01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:35.310
And actually, this goes back
to when you go fundraise,

01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:37.230
I think sometimes you
tell your story is

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:40.170
as important as your
product and metrics.

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:43.800
And most of the founders
shy away to say that,

01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:46.110
to tell their stories.

01:03:46.110 --> 01:03:47.200
They actually push them.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.930
They start the page
and say, where did you

01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:51.760
grow up, how did you do it?

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.590
So we just want to
get to know them.

01:03:53.590 --> 01:03:57.730
So when you go pitch, don't
be shy to tell your stories.

01:03:57.730 --> 01:04:00.399
AUDIENCE: What was
the hardest part?

01:04:00.399 --> 01:04:02.440
After you started VC, what
was your hardest thing

01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:05.191
that took to get used to?

01:04:05.191 --> 01:04:07.690
Where did the struggle, what
were some common pitfalls early

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:08.320
on?

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:12.616
You had mentioned like trying
to create a linear regression

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:13.990
with all these
parameters, trying

01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:17.790
to optimize and try to bring in
some complex optimization here.

01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:20.515
Other things that
you struggled with?

01:04:20.515 --> 01:04:22.390
PEJMAN NOZAD: I think
today when you look at,

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:25.000
this is like three
and a half years fund,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.490
we have over 60 companies
that we have invested.

01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:34.630
So finding the time to help
these people while we still

01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:37.520
serve the community, that's
a big challenge for us.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.210
That's why we are
building a team.

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:41.870
As an angel investor, so before
that I was an angel investor.

01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:43.770
When you are doing
an angel investment,

01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:45.250
you just keep investing.

01:04:45.250 --> 01:04:47.295
Just invest and every
new company you invest.

01:04:47.295 --> 01:04:47.920
You're excited.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.090
You go to the next one.

01:04:49.090 --> 01:04:50.810
When you are
managing a fund, you

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:53.260
want to invest in
30, 40 companies,

01:04:53.260 --> 01:04:57.710
so you have a discipline to
concentrate in portfolio.

01:04:57.710 --> 01:05:00.130
That's a big difference.

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:03.490
Every company we invest today,
that means one less company

01:05:03.490 --> 01:05:05.224
in the next three years.

01:05:05.224 --> 01:05:06.640
But when you're
an angel investor,

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.764
you never think about that.

01:05:07.764 --> 01:05:09.232
You just keep investing.

01:05:09.232 --> 01:05:11.440
MAR HERSHENSON: I think for
me, the hardest thing was

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.140
imagine you've being an
operator all your life

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:17.020
and all of a sudden
you're an investor.

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:19.660
So I think for the
first year, we didn't

01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:20.860
have that many companies.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:23.350
When you start, you don't
have any companies, right?

01:05:23.350 --> 01:05:26.530
So Pejman knows
this story, but I

01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:29.920
remember one Sunday I was
there and I was writing code

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.020
for one of the companies.

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:34.240
I'm like, OK that's not right.

01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.940
But there's a lot of inertia
in what we do as humans.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:41.890
So I am no longer
are doing that.

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:43.750
So that was my
hardest adjustment,

01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:45.070
knowing that I can do it.

01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:47.370
My job is to teach
somebody how to do it.

01:05:47.370 --> 01:05:50.140
I'll suggest how to do it,
they have to make the decisions

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:51.790
but I shouldn't do it.

01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:53.290
AUDIENCE: Every
several years, there

01:05:53.290 --> 01:05:55.660
are new big trends
in the industry.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.300
So there are a
lot of things that

01:05:57.300 --> 01:06:02.410
are very hot right now like
self-driving cars, VR, AR, AI,

01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:03.280
et cetera.

01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.482
So how do you
evaluate this field,

01:06:07.482 --> 01:06:08.940
how do you think
about those trends

01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:12.040
right now and then what
will be big things that

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:15.580
can change the world or change
the industry in the next five

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:16.862
or 10 years?

01:06:16.862 --> 01:06:18.070
MAR HERSHENSON: You're right.

01:06:18.070 --> 01:06:20.350
Every 10 years, there's
like this big change

01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:23.040
that has happened in
the Valley, right?

01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:26.800
And I like to tell the story
that in '76, it was the PC;

01:06:26.800 --> 01:06:30.400
10 years later in '86,
it was maybe the router;

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.810
and 10 years later, in
'96, it was the internet;

01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:37.360
10 years later, in
'06, it was the iPhone.

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.820
So people are like, what's
happened now in 2016?

01:06:39.820 --> 01:06:41.750
It's already passed, right?

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:45.190
And I tell people, it's probably
an Nvidia GPU processor.

01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:47.380
That's probably the next--
it's like an equivalent

01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:49.200
of that router.

01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:54.140
And a lot of things, the fact
that when I was doing my PhD,

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:57.430
I was doing convex optimization,
which is almost the anti-deep

01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:01.750
learning way of
solving a problem.

01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:03.760
And the deep learning
people at Stanford

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:07.930
couldn't even run a little
20-circuit amplifier,

01:07:07.930 --> 01:07:09.700
they couldn't size it, right?

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.430
And fast forward 17 years,
you can do amazing things

01:07:13.430 --> 01:07:14.340
with deep learning.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:17.380
So these platforms
that take place

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.940
like the iPhone or
the internet, it's

01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:22.810
not something that just
changes particular behavior.

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:26.005
It changes industry, it
changes the enterprise,

01:07:26.005 --> 01:07:28.490
it changes media, it
changes the consumer.

01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:30.400
It changes everything, right?

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.130
In the case of
that Nvidia GPU, I

01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:34.720
think the same is
going to happen.

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.670
We're at the very,
very beginning

01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:39.070
and a lot of technology
cycles, they're

01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:40.390
like second order systems.

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.600
They overshoot and then
they go back, right?

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.564
So the internet everybody
was like, overpriced,

01:07:44.564 --> 01:07:45.730
and then it kind of settles.

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:49.239
Same with mobile
apps, with everything.

01:07:49.239 --> 01:07:51.280
So now we're in the cycle
where everybody's super

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.400
excited about AI or VR and AR.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.560
Even VR and AR I
think it's even still

01:07:56.560 --> 01:07:59.650
a little early in
the investment cycle.

01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:04.200
But you have to do your
homework as an investor.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:06.190
It's in our job, right?

01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:09.910
When you say AI, not all AI was
created equal, I think, right?

01:08:09.910 --> 01:08:13.030
For some cases, you absolutely
need to be 100% accurate;

01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:15.740
for some cases, it's
OK if you're 80%

01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:17.740
and you can build a
product around it.

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:20.529
Maybe we won't be 100% for
another five years and so on.

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:24.850
And those are the sort of little
things that we are evaluating.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:28.600
But again, at the end,
we're thinking it all

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:29.710
goes back to the founder.

01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:32.859
Is the founder aware
of where they are

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:35.200
and where he is and the
limitations of what they have?

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.790
And so on.

01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:42.149
PEJMAN NOZAD: As a firm, Mar
and I, we are aware of trends

01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:43.779
but we don't follow trends.

01:08:43.779 --> 01:08:45.620
And if we think
when it's hot, it's

01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:47.779
already too late to invest.

01:08:47.779 --> 01:08:50.660
I think you want to
partner with founders

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:54.510
who see future before anybody
else and you partner with them.

01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:56.790
And if you look at the best
companies ever created,

01:08:56.790 --> 01:08:58.939
they were not in any hot space.

01:08:58.939 --> 01:09:00.189
It's like the stock market.

01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:02.461
When it's too hot,
it's too late to buy.

01:09:02.461 --> 01:09:04.710
You want to make sure you
buy those stocks at the time

01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:06.590
that not many people know.

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:09.890
And for us, it's
just really rather

01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:13.680
than looking for what is
hot, we look for outliers,

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.279
for those founders who are
determined to build something

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:19.340
really massive in the market
that they believe exists

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:21.109
and we can help them.

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:22.550
MAR HERSHENSON:
And in the cycles,

01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:25.580
it really is like
this overshoot.

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:28.250
The best companies almost
get funded four to five years

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:31.729
after the big change.

01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:35.310
It's like even when
Google was founded,

01:09:35.310 --> 01:09:38.460
it was not Yahoo, right?

01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:43.520
A little later, Uber; a little
later, after the iPhone.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.231
It's like radical change maybe
takes a little bit of time.

01:09:47.231 --> 01:09:48.189
JORGE CUETO: All right.

01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:48.855
Well, thank you.

01:09:48.855 --> 01:09:50.899
We are out of time, but
it was really great.

01:09:50.899 --> 01:09:51.800
MAR HERSHENSON:
Thank you, Jorge.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.430
PEJMAN NOZAD: Thank you all.

01:09:52.430 --> 01:09:53.055
Good questions.

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:55.780
