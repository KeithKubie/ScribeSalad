JUDY SINGER: Good afternoon
everyone, I'm Judy Singer,

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.530
I'm the Vice Provost for Faculty
Development and Diversity,

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.080
and I want to thank you all
for joining us this afternoon

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.110
for this panel on academics
writing books for audiences

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.460
that are beyond academia.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.400
We have been running, from the
Senior Vice Provost's Office,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.680
a number of book events
over the last few years,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.480
all designed to
bring Harvard faculty

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.150
together to talk about
the publication process,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.140
to try to facilitate
your publishing,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.260
getting contacts with
editors, and getting

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.810
an inside
behind-the-scenes look.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.940
This particular event
has proved so popular

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.690
we actually had to turn people
away, and so we're videoing it,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.270
so it will be up on the web to
be available to other people.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.270
The purpose of this
particular event

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.990
is to stretch
ourselves a little bit,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.130
and to think not just about
the audiences we typically

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.660
write for in terms of our
professional colleagues,

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.250
but also the wider world.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.190
Part of being a
Harvard faculty member

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.840
is having an impact
on your field.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.920
But part of being a
Harvard faculty member

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.070
is to have an impact
beyond your field.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.090
The context for this work
though is a little bit tricky,

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.940
and I'm going to quote from
this week's Chronicle of Higher

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.522
Ed, that had a story on Charles
Murray and his new book.

00:01:24.522 --> 00:01:26.230
And I'm going to read
through the opening

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.727
paragraph and the closing
paragraph to this piece.

00:01:29.727 --> 00:01:32.060
It's an interesting piece,
you can read the whole thing.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.230
But I think it sets the
context for today very well.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.110
"Publishers, forget
about carefully reasoned,

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.740
nuanced discussions of
the issues of the day.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.280
That stuff is for college
professors or yuppies

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.510
yammering away in their salons.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.510
If you print politically
oriented books

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.180
and you want to
make the big bucks,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.140
you need to think
like a boxing promoter

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.550
and stage fights that
will get attention.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.870
And nothing, but
nothing draws hype

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.280
like a match up between
liberal pundits and the man

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.825
they love to hate,
the belligerent

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:03.180
behind the bell
curve, the warrior

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.540
against welfare, the proudly
political, incorrect Charles

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.080
Murray."

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.990
And it goes on to talk about
his most recent book, which

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.300
I will not go into, and
the arguments for and con.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.190
But at the end of
the article, it's

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.930
summarized by saying,
"At the end of the day,

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.750
the cultural and economic divide
most illuminated by Coming

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.570
Apart--" that's
Murray's new book,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.050
"might be one found in
scholarly publishing.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.570
On one side are
authors and publishers

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.920
who produce nuanced books that
offer only conclusion stemming

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.000
from research and tend to be too
esoteric for wide readership.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.580
On the other side are
authors and publishers

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.670
who cash in by
producing best selling

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.820
polemics in which research
is used to buttress

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.397
foregone conclusions."

00:02:47.397 --> 00:02:48.980
So I think the
challenge for everybody

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.550
here is how to figure out
how to walk between Scylla

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.610
and Charybdis and come up
with something that you

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.280
can feel good about,
but, that also

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.620
satisfies the broader goals.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.250
I'm going to yield the podium
to my colleague, Amy Brand,

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.500
Assistant Provost for
Faculty Appointments who

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.750
helped organize this
particular panel,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:09.900
in fact all our book
publishing panels,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.760
and the one thing you
need to know about Amy

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.140
is she was an editor at MIT
Press for many, many years,

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.880
and so has a lot of experience
with the book publishing world

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.402
so, Amy.

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:19.860
AMY BRAND: As Judy
mentioned, we've

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.820
been doing a whole
series of events

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.740
on book publishing I count seven
or eight in the last two years.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.220
And the reason that we decided
to focus on trade books

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.040
is that in all of
these events questions

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.820
about how to write for a
broader audience keep coming up.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.574
So surely questions
about working

00:03:39.574 --> 00:03:40.990
with agents and
editors, and we'll

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.590
address those,
but also questions

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.170
about defining the crucial
difference in the writing style

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.580
that's required to reach
a broader audience.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.420
In other words, how to unlearn
how to write like an academic.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.910
So the great panel that we
have for you today is here,

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.980
not just to expound,
they're also here

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.390
to answer your questions
and engage in discussion,

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.920
and I trust you'll do your
part when the time comes.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.510
We'll start with Angela von
der Lippe, Vice President

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.850
and Senior Editor at Norton.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.670
Angela's also a
novelist, and among

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.220
her many other qualifications
for kicking off this panel,

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.690
Angela was an editor
at Harvard University

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.760
Press for many years, and has
also worked with many Harvard

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.640
faculty as authors.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.480
We'll then turn to
Betsy Lerner who's

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.670
a literary agent in New York.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.230
Betsy's author of the book
on writing that you now

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.410
all have, if you picked it
up at the registration table,

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.960
The Forest for the Trees.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.180
Betsy also has a
blog on publishing,

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.590
which in her own words
in part, "strives

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.140
to address complex
issues involving

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.390
writers personalities,
especially,

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.950
but not limited to their
self-destructive proclivities.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.840
But mostly, it's a
place to regularly vent

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.660
about publishing."

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.670
And then we'll turn to our
two eminent faculty members

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.580
and writers from the faculty
of Arts and Sciences,

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.430
Dan Gilbert Professor
of Psychology

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.950
and author of the New York
Times best seller, Stumbling

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.360
On Happiness, and Luke Menand,
Robert M Bass, Professor

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.480
of English, a regular
contributor to the New Yorker

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.060
and author most recently of
The Marketplace of Ideas.
