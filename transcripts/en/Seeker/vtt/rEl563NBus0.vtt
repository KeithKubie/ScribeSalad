00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:06.300
This is Enceladus, an icy moon revolving around
Saturn.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:11.580
Unimaginably cold, this white orb looks very
peaceful.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.450
Except that it’s actually home to ice volcanoes
that spew frozen chunks of slushy magma at

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.360
800 miles per hour.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.050
Cryovolcanoes are similar to the ones we have
on Earth, just swap out the molten lava with

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.730
sub-zero water.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.050
A cryovolcano forms when thick layers of ice
get heated by gravitational forces.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.790
Then pockets of water are created under the
moon’s icy shell.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.449
Pressure eventually builds in these liquid
pockets, and when a crack on the surface opens,

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.699
icy plumes erupt!

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:46.960
Those plumes are so cold, that if you were
standing next to an erupting ice volcano,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.250
you’d turn into a block of ice.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.940
Inside the plumes magma are a mixture of carbon
dioxide, water methane gas, and ammonia.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.940
These ingredients have scientists excited
-- because these elements are the crucial

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.649
building blocks for life.

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:07.110
But what kind of organism could possibly survive
in Enceladus’s ice cold waters and in pitch

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.110
black darkness?

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.520
It won’t be space dolphins and narwhals,
but if anything, it could be like the extremophiles

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.030
at the bottom of our oceans - the odd looking
creatures that feed on microbes near underwater

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.690
vents.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:41.579
So to reiterate, huge cold dangerous ice volcanoes
exist and they might birth alien life.
