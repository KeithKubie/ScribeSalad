00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, the answer is this one. This is the path that the light is taking in the end prime frame.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's moving at a slight diagonal that means the total d' this whole distance up and back down is 2ct'.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Okay, so this side is ct', this side is h, and this side well its vt'.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's the speed of the train, v times the time a lot that's how far the train has advanced.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, actually, I have this wonderful right triangle, base, height of h and hypotenuse is ct'.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm going to do the Pythagorean theorem, this squared plus that squared must equal this squared,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and when I do that, I get v²t'² + h² equals--well, this side squared

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and I'm writing the t' in red just so we can keep focus on them.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, actually, what I want to do is I want to solve for t'

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so, I'm going to move this term over to this side and what I've done here is I've factored out the t'²

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and then I'm going to divide both sides by this c²-v²  so now, I have this.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
My next step is a bit of a trick so what I'm going to do is I'm going to divide

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
both the numerator and the denominator on the left hand side by c²

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and since I'm doing each both the numerator and denominator that's totally fine

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and what I get when I do that is this

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and now, may be you can start to see why I decided to divide by c².

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I did that because when we look at these two equations.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
These are both d so I can set them equal to each other, 2h = 2ct.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
The 2 is canceled and t is equal to h/c.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Remember this is the unprimed t so what I can do is replace this h/c with t.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now, what I have is a relationship between the time measured on, well unfortunately I erased red,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but measured on red's clock and the time t measured on green's clock.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Let's just take the square root of both sides, and I find that the time measured on t',

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the red clock is equal to the time measured on this guy's clock

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
with this mathematical expression modifying it.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I would have no reason to believe that two identical clocks should ever run at different rates,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but what I found here is that it is not only that the clocks are running at different rates

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that time itself can't be universally specified.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
My time is not the same as your time if we're moving relative to each other.

00:02:21.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is amazing. Let's look at this equation in a little more detail.
