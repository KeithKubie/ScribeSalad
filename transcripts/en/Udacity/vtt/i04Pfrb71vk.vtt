00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:00.955
Okay, hi Michael.

00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:02.029
&gt;&gt; Hey Charles, how's it going.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.270
&gt;&gt; It's going pretty well, how's it going in your end of the world?

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.620
&gt;&gt; Very nice, what are we want to talk about today?

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:07.830
&gt;&gt; Well today we are going to

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.890
talk about supervised learning. But, in particular what

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.880
we're going to talk about are two kinds

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.309
of supervised learning, and one particular way to

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:17.940
do supervised learning. Okay, so the two

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.100
types of supervised learning that we typically think

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.830
about are classification. And regression. And we're going to

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.270
spend most of the time today talking about

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.860
classification and more time next time talking about

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.970
regression. So the difference between classification and regression is

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.060
fairly simple for the purposes of this discussion.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.750
Classification is simply the process of taking some kind

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.180
of input, let's call it x. And I'm

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.230
going to define these terms in a couple of minutes.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.400
And mapping it to some discrete label. Usually, for

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.130
what we're talking about, something like, true or false.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.380
So, what's a good example of that? Imagine

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.080
that I have a nice little picture of Michael.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.500
&gt;&gt; It looks just like me!

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.420
&gt;&gt; It looks exactly like you. So I have a nice little picture here

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.313
and I want to know whether this is a male. Or a female. So

00:01:04.313 --> 00:01:09.560
given an input like this I will map it to male or female. So

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.650
what do you think, Michael? Do you think this is a male or a female?

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.200
&gt;&gt; So you're, you're classifying me as male

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.450
or female based on the picture of me and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.160
I would think you know, based on how I look I'm clearly male.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.640
&gt;&gt; Yes. In fact, manly male. So, this would be

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.590
a classification from pictures to male. The alternative would be

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.840
something like a picture to female, and I'm just going to

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:36.310
take a completely stereotypical image of either a female or.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.250
&gt;&gt; I think it's actually, that's actually me when I let my hair go long.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.550
&gt;&gt; Right, so, so which

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.100
points out that this can be pretty hard. But this is where we're going to spend

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.600
most of our time talking about it first

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.750
as a classification task. So taking some kind

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.190
of input, in this case pictures, and mapping

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.530
it to some discrete number of labels, true

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.870
or false, male or female, car versus cougar,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.800
anything that, that you might imagine thinking of.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.810
&gt;&gt; Car versus cougar?

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:02.250
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.560
&gt;&gt; That, I guess that's an important thing if you're driving.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.937
You don't want to run into any cougars or probably other cars either.

00:02:08.937 --> 00:02:10.788
&gt;&gt; Well you know, you're sitting down and you're trying to

00:02:10.788 --> 00:02:14.330
decide whether you should ride this thing that you see or not.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.640
&gt;&gt; And if its a cougar maybe you don't

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.270
want to and if it's a car maybe you do.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.980
&gt;&gt; Excellent. Don't drive a cougar.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.290
&gt;&gt; Don't drive a cougar. That's the first lesson in machine learning.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.950
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.050
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's classification. We'll return to regression in a little

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.560
bit later during this conversation. But, just as a preview, regression is more

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.170
about continuous value function. So, something like giving a

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.410
bunch of points. I want to give in a new

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.260
point. I want to map it to some real

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.980
value. So we may pretend that these are examples of

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.660
a line and so given a point here, I

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.360
might say the output is right there. Okay, so that's

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.940
regression but we'll talk about that in a moment.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.220
Right now, what I want to talk about is classification.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.580
&gt;&gt; Would an example of regression also be, for example, mapping the pictures

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.500
of me to the length of my hair? Like

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.560
a number that represents the length of my hair?

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.230
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, for the purposes of, of the sort of things that we're going to

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.460
be worried about you can really think

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.860
of the difference between classification and regression is

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.620
the difference between mapping from some input

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.210
to some small number of discrete values which

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.906
might represent concepts. And regression is mapping

00:03:16.906 --> 00:03:20.060
from some input space to some real number.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.810
Potentially infinite number of real numbers.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.060
&gt;&gt; Cool, let's do a, let's do a quiz. Make sure we get this.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.440
&gt;&gt; Okay, I like that.
