ADAM GREEN: How
many people here are

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.450
familiar with the story
of Malala Yousafzai?

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.990
Excellent.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:18.020
We have her parents, Tor
Pekai and Ziauddin Yousafzai,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.260
and Ziauddin's
partner Jahan Zeb,

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.490
who together they have founded
the Global Peace Centre

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.340
Canada with the effort of
bringing peace to the world

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.250
through education.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.920
So we're going to have a
five-minute talk from them

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.500
on what the Global Peace
Centre is all about, and then

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.570
a moderated discussion.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.420
If you guys have
questions, then we've

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.220
got two mics on either side.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.847
There were also-- I think
we had an email in Dory

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:47.930
so if you want to do that.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.429
But we have a small enough group
that just put up your hand,

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.044
or ideally, come to the mics.

00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:55.460
So without any further ado,
guys, why don't you come on up

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.835
and give us your background?

00:00:56.835 --> 00:01:01.098
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.098 --> 00:01:02.348
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: Thank you.

00:01:02.348 --> 00:01:05.230
JAHAN ZEB: Thanks, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.660
ADAM GREEN: So yeah, I think
just five-minute background

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.290
on what the Global
Peace Centre of Canada

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.619
is, what your mission
is-- and then we'll

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:13.910
sit down and have a discussion.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:14.240
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: OK.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.452
Can you give me the mic?

00:01:15.452 --> 00:01:16.620
ADAM GREEN: You should
have one right there.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.161
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI:
OK, it will work.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:19.290
Good morning.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.380
How are you?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.260
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.301
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: Yeah.

00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:24.260
So we know about Google.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.120
Everybody knows.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.400
But I don't think that there
is any single day in my life

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:40.160
when I don't see Google logo
on my iPad-- not a single day.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.050
So you're a very
well-known organization

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.980
and well-known people.

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:48.900
And I'm very honored and feel
humbled to be amongst you.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.000
And if I want to
leave the stage,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.170
I can tell you that, OK,
just Google Malala Yousafzai.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.360
Leave me alone.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:56.800
But that would not work.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.430
This human story-- to share
the story on human base,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.570
it's very important.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.540
So my name Ziauddin Yousafzai.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.990
Jahan, if you can sit-- so
later on I'll ask you to speak.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.020
OK, thank you.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.530
So my name is Ziauddin
Yousafzai, and I'm properly

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.970
and mostly known as
Malala Yousafzai's father.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.570
And I tell people that
once she was my daughter,

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.350
but now I'm her father.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.350
And too much known by a
daughter-- now when people

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.040
introduce me as her father--
so they are a bit apologetic

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.020
and tell me, do you like
to be introduced like this?

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.960
And I tell them
that, yes, of course.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.070
I'm in a patriarchal society.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.560
In many societies, fathers
are known by their sons.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.890
I'm one of the few, hardly few,
who is known by his daughter,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.720
and I'm proud of it.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:07.640
So I think here we talk
about education and peace,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.130
because everybody has
a long story-- I mean,

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.720
every one of you in this room.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.570
And everyone's story
is worth listening.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.300
And when we share
stories with each other,

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.150
we learn from each other.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.030
Tor Pekai's here.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.250
She is my beautiful wife.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.730
Would you like to stand,
just that may see your face?

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.870
And now they will say
that Malala look like you,

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.740
not like me.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.350
It's OK.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.290
Thank you very much.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.390
So I was born in a small
village in north of Pakistan.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.850
So my story will tell
you how education

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.410
is important in the
communities which are developed

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.070
and in the communities
which are not developed.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.140
And the point I'm
making is that education

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:08.010
is the only road, only tool,
to providence, to success,

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:14.870
to human development,
to maintain and to keep

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.480
our human civilization.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.250
So living in a small village
in the north of Pakistan, Swat,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.260
the village I was grew.

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.740
And it was a small village,
not with big population.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:36.420
But in that village, I think
less than 50% boys went

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.860
to school, and
there was no concept

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.900
of girls' education-- no
concept of girls' education.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.950
You are very lucky here.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.700
I had five sisters and
we were two brothers.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.980
Our parents-- like my father
and my mother, both of them--

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.300
were very, very much
interested in my brother's

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.390
and in my education.

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.600
But they never thought
about the education

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.530
of the five daughters--
brilliant daughters--

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.450
which they had in their home.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.500
I also observed discrimination
in small things,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.240
like when a chicken was cooked.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.890
So the sumptuous part of the
chicken was given to the boys,

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.560
and like neck and poor
parts of the chicken

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.660
were given to the girls.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.490
We used to take cream with milk
in the morning with the tea,

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.650
and the girls only took tea.

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.870
So such it kind of
discrimination--

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.860
it reflects the attitude and
the behavior of the society

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.000
towards their girls.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.710
So I was in-- really, when you
don't know about human rights,

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:59.610
justice, equality, sometime
you enjoy that favoritism,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.880
which is for you.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.527
Like as a child,
I might not have

00:06:03.527 --> 00:06:09.170
felt that why I'm getting cream
with milk, and my sister's not.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.640
I might have felt , OK, good.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.120
I'm special.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.370
But later on, when
I got education

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.010
and I did my graduation,
I did my master,

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:27.280
I realized that that
education changed me.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.970
Education changed my
inner being-- inner being.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.240
And the things I was-- I
found in my childhood--

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.130
like I was bullied by
some of my cousins,

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.300
because of my stammering.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.830
I stammered when I talk,
so they bullied me.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:48.030
And I was also a little
bit discriminated

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.260
because of my dark color.

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.950
Fair color was more
popular in the community.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:02.830
And I tried to wash my face
with milk, but it didn't work.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:10.040
So after getting
education, I thought

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.870
that I should not retaliate or
respond, bullying for bullying,

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.000
or head for head,
or discrimination

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.620
for discrimination.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:27.170
My positive revenge was to fight
against all those injustices,

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.890
inequalities, and
discriminations

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:35.290
which exist in any form
in the human community.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:39.510
So my education-- I mean the
education changed my life.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.415
And when I married
Tor Pekai, she

00:07:44.415 --> 00:07:47.580
could not go to
school-- because there

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:52.090
was a school in her
small village, too.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.560
Her father took her
to school, but she

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.430
was the only girl
in the classroom

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:01.830
and all the rest were boys.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.620
And in the classroom,
she used to think

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.050
of our cousins, who used to play
in the fields, on the rooftops.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.160
And she said, [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.870
I will not-- let's stop
it, because she was missing

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:16.120
her other cousins and peers.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.685
So she left school
at very early age,

00:08:17.685 --> 00:08:20.540
but nobody asked here
where are her books--

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.840
why is she not studying, why
she's not really in school.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.740
So that was the end
of her education.

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:30.380
But after marrying her, I
realized that I married her

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.450
because she was very beautiful.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.690
Later, I know that she's
very wise-- wiser than me--

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:39.640
very prudent, very intelligent.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.299
And then I said,
I felt very sorry

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:45.850
that had she been educated--
she's still very good.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.230
But I was thinking
that how many women

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.050
we have lost their
potentials, their energies,

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:54.240
their contribution
to the community,

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.250
because of not educating them.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.340
And I thought that,
if I'm a father-- long

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:01.980
before marrying here, I
was thinking of marriage.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.010
Every young man thinks
of marriage, you know.

00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:10.290
And I was thinking that if I
marry and then I have children,

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:15.780
I must have a daughter, and I
will name her Malala Yousafzai.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:21.670
Because Malalai of Maiwand was
a legendary great Afghan heroine

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:30.390
who raised her voice against
the British army in Afghanistan,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.400
and who encouraged
the Pashtun freedom

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.330
fighters to go
back and fight big,

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.810
with bravery, who were
fleeing from the battlefield--

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:41.710
they bring back, and they
fought and they won battlefield.

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.670
And Malala of Maiwand, she gave
her life on that battlefield.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.940
And she became a legend
in Pashtun-Afghan history.

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.850
So Malala had a name of
her own, because I always

00:09:53.850 --> 00:10:01.900
tell that in patriarchal or
narrow religious societies,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.140
women are usually known
by their men-- mostly.

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.950
Even, I give an
example that when

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:12.810
they take a woman to a doctor
and the doctor asks, OK.

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.170
What is the name of the patient?

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.320
And they say, OK, right--
Mr. So-and-so's daughter,

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.360
Mr. So-and-so's wife.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:25.640
He feels ashamed telling the
name of his sister or his wife,

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.620
because even the name
is something private.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:32.170
And I'll share an
interesting thing with you.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:39.610
In Arabic, women
are called [ARABIC].

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.699
You know? [ARABIC] Can you
utter this word with me?

00:10:43.699 --> 00:10:44.490
AUDIENCE: [ARABIC].

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:45.698
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: [ARABIC].

00:10:45.698 --> 00:10:51.600
And [ARABIC] means the covered,
the hidden, the covered.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.340
You understand?

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:56.370
So when you call
them the covered

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.560
and the hidden, the
behind-the-scene,

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.550
this very word that you
give them collectively--

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:08.060
it tells your perception
and your ideology

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.430
about women, freedom,
and empowerment.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.550
So I thought that if I'm
a father, the first thing

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:20.390
I'll do that I will
educate her very seriously.

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:29.060
And I think that as I believe
in education, so I started

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.050
a school in the Swat valley.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:33.800
It was an independent school,
and I started from scratch,

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.650
from three children.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:39.870
We just recited the national
anthem of Pakistan, started it,

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:48.420
and in 2012 this school had
1,200 children-- 500 girls

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:52.120
and some 700 boys.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.460
So Malala was in
the same school,

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:02.750
and I realized when I
was operating and running

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:07.680
that girl's school-- because
I came close to the girls--

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.930
and I realized that
how much brilliant

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:16.090
these girls are-- the way they
think, how much critical they

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:20.990
are in thinking, how
much confident they are.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:24.360
And that's why, when Taliban
banned girls' education, so

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.130
we had to stand.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:30.140
And Malala wrote a BBC diary.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:33.180
She volunteered herself for a
"New York Times" documentary

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.610
to raise her voice.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.200
And her voice was the
most powerful voice

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.130
for girls' education.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:43.290
And what happened later on
is that voice was so powerful

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:48.600
that Taliban felt it is becoming
very popular in the country.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.930
And rather than getting
terrified of our violence

00:12:54.930 --> 00:12:59.120
and horror, people are
listening to the peaceful voice

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.380
of this girl.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.760
I mean, her voice
was more powerful

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:08.550
than the suicide attacks
and bomb blasts of Taliban.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.340
And they realized
that she should

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:15.320
be finished, because when
you don't have any argument

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:22.060
and when you are weak in your
argument, and you're violent,

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:26.910
then the only way you have
is to finish your opponent--

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.990
or finish the person who
doesn't agree with you.

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.520
But man proposes, God disposes.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.480
The voice which they wanted
to silence on a local level,

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.930
it become a global voice for
every child, for everybody,

00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.520
for the right of education.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.602
Thank you very much.

00:13:46.602 --> 00:13:47.310
I spoke for long.

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:48.622
Thank you.

00:13:48.622 --> 00:13:53.532
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:53.532 --> 00:13:54.370
Sure, OK.

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.120
My chair's there?

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.150
OK, sorry.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.750
It happens.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.490
ADAM GREEN: So Jahan,
could you give us

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.750
some sense of the Global
Peace Centre of Canada,

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:12.290
and where you're taking Ziauddin
and the Yousafzai's story

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.250
and pushing it out
to global peace--

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.680
taking that global voice
and making it one for peace?

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.760
JAHAN ZEB: Thanks,
Adam, for having us.

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:25.450
And I want to thank
Sabrina to bring us here.

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.360
And there was lots of work
done by Vera and Vern.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.520
Vern is in rafers
today somewhere.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:40.560
But let me officially and
publicly thank, welcome

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:45.810
Ziauddin Yousafzai to be here
for the fifth or sixth time,

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:46.471
here in Canada.

00:14:46.471 --> 00:14:47.470
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: Yes.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.060
JAHAN ZEB: But above all,
and beyond, Tor Pekai

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.620
is here with us, and she
is publicly coming forward

00:14:55.620 --> 00:15:01.720
to support education, and
Malala, and Ziauddin, and peace

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.460
and education
everywhere in the word.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.452
So thank you very
much, Tor Pekai,

00:15:07.452 --> 00:15:18.090
for supporting mainly--
$1.5 billion people

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:20.360
are living in
conflict-afflicted countries

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.290
right now, according to
the UN estimates recently.

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.760
They have published
the statistics.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.790
600 million are
young people, which

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:31.830
are living in
conflict-affected countries.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:36.680
In Pakistan-- the country
which Malala belongs to and we

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.390
envision Global Peace Center
taking Malala's vision

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:44.990
of quality education to
be given to children,

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.580
to be given to young people.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.270
And that vision is of
Ziauddin, and now I

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:56.000
found that the work which
Ziauddin and Malala was doing,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.130
Tor Pekai was
standing behind them.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.890
If she was not there, I believe
that-- I just don't think,

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.130
but I strongly believe
that-- they could not

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.130
have achieved what acheived--
a work they are doing

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:13.280
for us and for all of us
here in Canada, in US,

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:14.750
and in the world.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:17.360
What the Global Peace Centre--
I'm coming to your question

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:23.790
now-- Global Peace Centre, as I
mentioned, in 600 young people

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.540
are living in
conflict-affected countries.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.420
100 are in Pakistan only.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:34.820
So if we don't
provide those children

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.570
the quality
education-- the concept

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:40.290
and skills of peace--
what they will be doing.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.440
We don't have answers yet.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.450
We don't have answers yet.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:50.235
But what we can do together,
and through this initial start

00:16:50.235 --> 00:16:52.890
of our organization--
Global Peace Centre Canada

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:55.570
started-- we have
a very good support

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.270
at Conrad Grebel College
and University of Waterloo.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:01.820
They are taking administration.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.020
They are managing our
charitable status.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:08.550
So if you want to donate, we
hope that they can get it.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:13.089
Now, the Global Peace Centre
Canada-- the aim or the purpose

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:18.589
is to provide hope and
opportunity to young people,

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:26.980
to be educated, to be having the
skills and concepts of peace,

00:17:26.980 --> 00:17:31.320
and to be living like all
of us, like all of you.

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:39.880
And the vision for this is that
schools, colleges, universities

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:45.170
should have the
capacity to provide

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:49.340
those children, those
students the education

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.440
which they need-- which we
have usually in the West.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.590
In conflict zones,
usually it is not there.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.900
So I have a few statements
which I want to do go and to--

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.880
so the vision of the
Global Peace Centre Canada,

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.080
we envision that the root
causes of violent conflicts

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.600
are identified, are
analyzed, and conflicts

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:18.270
are transformed peacefully.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.010
And students,
educators, and leaders

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.680
have developed the concepts
and skills of peace.

00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.330
Schools, colleges,
universities, and leaders

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:30.300
have quality education.

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:32.760
And what that means--
quality education--

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:38.000
as Ziauddin mentioned, students
and educators, everyone,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.040
should have the critical,
creative, democratic,

00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.460
[INAUDIBLE] thinking.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.980
They should have acceptance.

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.460
They should accept diversity.

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:50.280
They should accept
multiculturalism,

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.490
identities, pluralism.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:57.130
In conflict-affected countries,
one major ethnicity or group

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:00.420
dominate others, and there
are questions of power.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:02.900
So they need young
people-- through education,

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:08.560
they need to question the power
of the-- it could be states.

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.890
It could be dominant groups.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:16.320
So when they empower themselves,
then they can live peaceful

00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.430
and fulfilling lives.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:25.090
And how we are going to do that,
to co-develop peace education

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:29.830
curriculum, working with
few University in Pakistan

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:34.790
and Wilfrid Laurier University,
Waterloo University, McMaster,

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:40.140
a few professors here at
University of Toronto--

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.740
so we'll be developing core
developing peace education

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:47.000
curriculum and provide
training to educators.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.010
We were there in Pakistan--
I took a delegation

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.140
from U Waterloo and
Laurier University.

00:19:54.140 --> 00:20:00.790
We spent a week and met with
150 graduate students, PhD

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:03.860
students, presidents
of six universities,

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.280
and professors of some
nine universities.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.130
And what they were
telling us we need--

00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:11.490
West has developed
a knowledge base

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:15.100
in peace and in the
concepts of education.

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.440
We need the training from you.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.450
We need your support
in education.

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.880
So I think they're
looking forward

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.200
to provide the training.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:29.170
They're looking forward to
provide peace curriculum,

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:30.411
support in peace curriculum.

00:20:30.411 --> 00:20:30.910
Them.

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:33.690
And so I think with
Global Peace Centre,

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.270
we are developing those skills.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:40.970
And we are honored-- we are very
highly honored-- that Ziauddin

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:42.310
is our honorary chair.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.470
And when he is
coming to Canada--

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:47.520
he came last year in June.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.670
Laurier University offered
a doctorate degree in Law.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.200
And what Ziauddin was asking--
they asked if what we can do.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.520
And he asked them, you
can provide a scholarship

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.320
to a young woman.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.740
So now they have provided a
scholarship to a young girl

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:10.390
from Pakistan, which hopefully
will be coming in September.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.030
Another talk-- which I
think Sabrina was at,

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.740
at WXN-- and
Ziauddin went, and he

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:20.011
received another support system
and came to Global Peace Centre

00:21:20.011 --> 00:21:20.510
Canada.

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:23.620
And one young woman
from Nigeria, she

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.430
received that scholarship.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:28.500
And she completed
her master's degree

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.380
in peace and conflict studies.

00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.030
So what Ziauddin is
doing here in the West,

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:39.680
as well as in conflict-affected
countries-- it is in Syria,

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:43.110
in Lebanon, in
Afghanistan, Pakistan--

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:45.070
we need to support him.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.230
We need to support his cause.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:51.224
So thank you very much for
your support and thanks, Adam.

00:21:51.224 --> 00:21:52.140
ADAM GREEN: Excellent.

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:53.940
You're most welcome.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.880
So you mentioned that a huge
part of your organization's

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.790
mission is to push peace
education into universities,

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.530
and colleges, and schools.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:08.300
But a lot of these people
who are fleeing conflict--

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.260
whether they're internally
displaced or refugees, they're

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.780
living in conflict
zones-- most of what

00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:17.330
we hear is to do with peace
is peace negotiations,

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:18.110
peace summits.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:19.800
It's all about the
political angle.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.520
What's at stake for
these 600 million

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.520
internally displaced people and
people fleeing conflict zones

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.999
if we can't get education in?

00:22:26.999 --> 00:22:28.540
Because most of what
we're focused on

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:31.387
is getting bandages, and
sutures, and doctors.

00:22:31.387 --> 00:22:33.720
And you don't hear a lot of
talk about getting books in,

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.780
about getting crayons in,
and getting chemistry sets

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:38.250
into those locations.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:41.469
What do we stand to lose as a
society, if we don't do this?

00:22:41.469 --> 00:22:43.010
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI:
You're asking me?

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:43.480
ADAM GREEN: Yeah.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.438
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: OK.

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:48.930
As Jahan Zeb has
mentioned, so you

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:54.170
see the-- in any human
disaster or tragedy

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:58.295
like violent conflicts,
which we see in Syria,

00:22:58.295 --> 00:23:05.100
in Pakistan, in Afghanistan,
and many other countries.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:12.250
And children suffer most, and
especially their education

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:13.310
is at the receiving end.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:21.990
Like when militants
started in Swat Valley,

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:26.910
their most favorite
and their most target

00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:29.940
was girls' education and
education in general.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:34.190
Taliban bombed more than
400 schools, only in Swat.

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:36.440
ADAM GREEN: This is during
the Talibanization of Swat?

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.440
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: Yes.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.960
They bombed more
than 2,000 schools.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.930
So a similar thing is
happening in Syria,

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:49.840
and according to
Malala Fund's data,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:56.020
2.7 million Syrian refugee
children are not in school.

00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:00.930
So 2 million are internally
displaced in Syria,

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:05.060
and 0.7 million are migrated
to the neighboring countries

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.785
like Jordan and Lebanon,
and these children

00:24:07.785 --> 00:24:10.460
are without school.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.230
Why their education is
important-- because generally

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:19.560
when global leaders, they come
together, are this discussion

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.480
goes on about
refugees' problems.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.792
So they talk about
shelter, food, and water

00:24:28.792 --> 00:24:29.500
and those things.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.050
They are important.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:35.150
Of course they are important
to survival and to live.

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:38.120
But I think, personally,
that education

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:42.520
should be in the category
of water, shelter, and food.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.450
It is as important
as food is, and I'll

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:49.740
tell you why--
because we have seen

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.950
a generation lost
in Afghanistan.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.110
When Afghanistan-- there was a
proxy war between Soviet Union

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.630
and America.

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.070
And that war was
fought on other land.

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:09.116
And other youth were
used as footmen soldiers.

00:25:09.116 --> 00:25:10.740
ADAM GREEN: This is
the 1980s conflict.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.100
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI:
Yeah, 1979 and later on.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:17.750
For 10 years it went on,
until the Soviet Union

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.200
disintegration.

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.180
And millions of Afgan children
who migrated to Pakistan,

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:27.200
they did not get education.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.710
Rather-- Jahan Zeb will
tell you about it--

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.550
but they were
indoctrinated-- few

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:34.860
who were sent to schools--
they were indoctrinated

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:43.420
and radicalized to love
war, and to be jihadi.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:51.130
So the big population
of the Afghan children

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.630
remained without education.

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:56.110
And now we see that those
children who grow up,

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:58.450
they are now young men.

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:03.210
And remaining without education,
they are a generation lost.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:08.650
They have gone to the
mountains, and they are isolated

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.550
from the mainstream society.

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:13.360
And now they
believe in fighting,

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.030
in getting power through wars.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:20.740
And they don't believe in the
Constitution of Afghanistan.

00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:23.730
They don't believe in
democracy, because the way

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.710
they were indoctrinated
or they remained

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:28.590
without education,
that has taught

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:30.030
them the way of violence.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:34.280
So when we talk of
education, we say that, OK.

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:38.690
It's very important that we must
provide all basic facilities

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:42.120
to Syrian refugees'
children to survival.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.540
But they should get the
education in their camps

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.690
or wherever they are,
because if a child remains

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.750
without education for
three years, four years,

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.420
education is
something that it has

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.700
a particular, specific time.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:01.790
When you lose that time, so
you lose your academic career.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:06.300
So that's why these children--
I mean the future of Syria

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.780
depends on its children.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:11.690
And the future of children
depends on education.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:15.020
And if the world leaders,
the developed countries,

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.650
and the developing countries--
if they don't come together,

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.980
and they don't
fund the education

00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.110
of the Syrian children,
God forbid-- one day

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.130
they will also be
a generation lost.

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:31.010
And we don't want to have
a generation lost in Syria,

00:27:31.010 --> 00:27:32.450
because they will go back.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.720
And if they have the skill,
they will rebuild their country.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.890
I remember that when Taliban
banned girls' education in Swat

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:44.430
Valley, and I was the principal
and head teacher of my school.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:50.700
And there was very much fear in
children and in the community.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.500
And most-- I mean,
some of the boys,

00:27:54.500 --> 00:28:00.460
especially girls-- they
even, when Taliban publicly

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.350
announced on their FM radio that
no girl will to go to school,

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.360
otherwise they will
face the music.

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.080
So there was a big drop out.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.920
I mean, children-- but what I
did, every day in the morning

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.240
assembly, I used to tell
to the girls and boys

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.840
that I know we are in
a very hard situation.

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.370
I know it is very
difficult while you

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:28.170
are worried about your life
and you think of education.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.730
But it's very
important, girls-- I

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:33.090
used to tell them-- because
whatever happens to you, if you

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:36.690
are displaced, if you
migrate, the only thing that

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:39.840
will help you that you
can carry with yourself

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.929
is your education.

00:28:40.929 --> 00:28:42.970
ADAM GREEN: That's a lot
to ask of a 12-year-old,

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:46.740
to stand up to the threat
of violence every day,

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.380
just by virtue of
coming to school.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.480
As they're sitting there
listening to that pep talk

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.420
from you, how many of
them said, OK, principal.

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:57.492
I see that.

00:28:57.492 --> 00:28:59.075
But there's a man
with a gun out there

00:28:59.075 --> 00:29:00.820
who's going to shoot me if
I come to learn chemistry.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:01.790
I have to stay home.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:03.740
And how many of them
stood up and said,

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:05.412
no, I'll keep coming to school?

00:29:05.412 --> 00:29:07.370
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: You
will believe it or not,

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.730
our girls were so brave.

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:16.230
And they got so inspired,
because when the leader stands,

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.150
the people stand.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.680
So I think I was a small
leader of my school,

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.920
and I was fighting
on every front

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:27.480
for the cause of education,
for the right of education.

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.220
And every girl-- and
you will astonish.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.540
One day, a girl
came late to school.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.110
And as usually principals
ask, I said, why are you late?

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:40.300
In a very dead mood, huh?

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.409
A very, very, very hard
mood-- why are you late?

00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:43.700
ADAM GREEN: I remember it well.

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.158
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI:
And she told me

00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:48.420
that, I'm late because
my father and my brother

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:51.240
did not want me
to come to school.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.960
And when they went
out for their work,

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.962
I stealthily came to school.

00:29:55.962 --> 00:29:57.670
ADAM GREEN: That's
the best student ever.

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:58.490
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: Yeah.

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:00.281
ADAM GREEN: Who sneaks
out to go to school.

00:30:00.281 --> 00:30:02.040
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI:
Yeah, but-- and I

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:05.510
tell you that when Taliban just
snaked this right of education

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.440
from girls especially,
they realized that, yes.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.380
This must be important, because
the bad guys are stopping us.

00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.010
So they realized the
value of education.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.580
And girls-- I mean,
they stood like rock.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:25.402
Not only one Malala-- every girl
in that valley was like Malala.

00:30:25.402 --> 00:30:26.110
ADAM GREEN: Yeah.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:28.380
That's a potent
opponent for the Taliban

00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:30.820
to stand up to, when
you've got thousands

00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:32.537
of little Malalas saying, no.

00:30:32.537 --> 00:30:33.870
We're going to get an education.

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:34.550
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI:
Yeah, of course.

00:30:34.550 --> 00:30:35.610
ADAM GREEN: Fantastic.

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:39.930
So a nuts and bolts question--
how do you get that education

00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:41.000
into those camps?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:41.500
Right?

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.305
When you've got all of
these organizations trying

00:30:44.305 --> 00:30:45.680
to get food, trying
to get water,

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.450
what is it that you
guys are doing to try

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:50.380
to get that education in there?

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:53.470
Because I know you're very
passionate about this.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:56.650
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: This is
everybody's responsibility,

00:30:56.650 --> 00:31:00.470
right from the UN to
the developed countries

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:04.061
in the global North, and to the
countries in the global South,

00:31:04.061 --> 00:31:04.560
as well.

00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:06.360
They should not
be always taking.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:09.040
They should give, as well.

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.430
As I'm honorary chair of the
Global Peace Centre Canada,

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:16.910
I'm also the chair
of Malala Fund,

00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:21.620
which is an organization
working for girls' education.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:26.810
And our top-most
priority, our focus,

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:30.070
is on refugees' education.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:32.560
And especially,
nowadays we are focusing

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:36.180
on the education of Syrian
refugees, girls and boys both.

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.350
And I must tell you that
the Fund has projects

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:44.440
in Zaatari camp, in Azraq
camp, and Jordan, where

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.440
there are hundreds and
thousands of Syrian children.

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:54.210
And on 18th birthday of
Malala, she went to Lebanon.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:32:00.550
And the Fund had constructed
a school in Bekaa Valley,

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:05.170
for 200 girls-- a
secondary school.

00:32:05.170 --> 00:32:07.920
And now we are making
one more school there,

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:11.310
so I think the Malala
Fund will be educating

00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:15.780
some more than 400 girls in the
Bekaa Valley, the Syrian girls.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:20.040
Also, the Fund is highlighting
12 years of education

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:25.190
for the girls, whether they
are in Nigeria or in Syria.

00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:30.110
Also, I should mention that
more than roundabout 30

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.240
girls are given
scholarships by the Fund are

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:38.530
who got free from the
imprisonment of Boko Haram.

00:32:38.530 --> 00:32:40.190
So this is the work
the Fund is doing.

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.880
But we also highlight
12 years of education,

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.620
because when world leaders,
they come together--

00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:53.010
because the world is led by the
global North, not by the South.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:54.490
They decide.

00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:58.240
They decide the values,
they decide the priorities.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.730
What should be done first?

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:00.650
ADAM GREEN: So by
global North, you

00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:01.300
mean Europe, North America--

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.341
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: By
the global North-- Europe,

00:33:03.341 --> 00:33:05.260
America-- you people
do all these things.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:06.010
OK?

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.300
So when they come together
and they talk about education,

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:14.960
so unfortunately it's not
their top priority, number one.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:19.250
Number two, when they talk
about education they say, OK.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.340
Basic education and
primary education

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:26.890
is enough for the children
in developing countries,

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:28.520
but we say no.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.240
Because the primary
education, this is important.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.720
You can't have
secondary education

00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:34.690
without primary education.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:37.420
But secondary education
is an education

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:42.590
that unlocks the potential
of the girls and boys.

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.780
And it gives them a wing to fly.

00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.610
So if you want to have a women
leadership in our communities,

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:52.550
we must give secondary
education to other girls.

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:58.180
And the Malala Fund has
been successful in changing

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:02.050
the language of global
partnership for education.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.890
They have now made 12 years
of free and quality education

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:06.920
compulsory.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.409
The Norwegian government,
and many other governments,

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:13.820
I think, in future-- they will
agree with us in principle,

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:15.820
that 12 years of
education should

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.210
be compulsory for-- a
free, quality education.

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.489
ADAM GREEN: Fantastic.

00:34:20.489 --> 00:34:24.190
JAHAN ZEB: I want to add a few
things to what Ziauddin said--

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:31.055
was Malala Fund is doing
huge work in her own Swat

00:34:31.055 --> 00:34:32.300
Valley, Pakistan.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.690
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: Of course.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:38.000
JAHAN ZEB: And there is-- in her
own, where Tor Pekai was born,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.810
Malala was not born there.

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:44.150
She was born in Swat, but
in Shangla in Swat Valley.

00:34:44.150 --> 00:34:46.730
Malala Fund and
Malala Yousafzai are

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.870
doing a huge amount of work,
and to provide that quality

00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:50.840
education.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.969
But one thing which I want
to add to what Ziauddin said

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:59.850
is, is it only civil society or
United Nations responsibility?

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:05.960
Is it only our governments'
responsibility?

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.560
Yes, civil society is playing
a big role-- United Nations,

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:14.750
and NGOs, and governments
are playing a role.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:20.790
But businesses need to be a
part, working hand in hand

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:21.900
with government.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:24.680
It is like a stool--
a three-legged stool.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:28.800
If only government is working,
the stool is imbalanced.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.420
If only civil
society is working,

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.840
still the stool is imbalanced.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.040
But when businesses comes, so
this stool becomes balanced

00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.300
and our society
becomes balanced.

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:47.000
So I think we need the
education, Malala Fund, Global

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.950
Peace Centre Canada, and all
civil society organization.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:53.540
And civil society
organization-- what to me, I

00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.940
mean from that is academia,
universities, schools,

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:04.630
colleges, comes part, and play
a big role into that equation.

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:07.130
ADAM GREEN: So it takes
multiple-- you're not going

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:07.980
to solve this all by yourself.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:08.140
The governments aren't going to.

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:10.306
JAHAN ZEB: It is not only
government responsibility.

00:36:10.306 --> 00:36:14.310
It is not only civil
society responsibility.

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:18.344
Everyone needs to be playing
that hand [INAUDIBLE] into.

00:36:18.344 --> 00:36:19.260
ADAM GREEN: Excellent.

00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.860
I think we have a
question from [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:24.970
AUDIENCE: First of all,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:27.580
My question is regarding
your point right there,

00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:29.410
about the role of the
Pakistani government

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.574
in promoting education.

00:36:31.574 --> 00:36:32.990
From a government
that spends most

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.710
of it's budget on
military, how receptive

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:38.010
have they been to your message?

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:39.426
And what are the
challenges you've

00:36:39.426 --> 00:36:42.907
faced, talking to the government
that's probably least focused

00:36:42.907 --> 00:36:43.990
on education in the world?

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:46.750
How do you go to them and get
them to buy into your message,

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.960
and start not spending
money on military, but also

00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:49.769
on education?

00:36:49.769 --> 00:36:51.560
JAHAN ZEB: Yeah, I want
to respond quickly.

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.750
And I know Ziauddin will respond
in a very thoughtful way.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:58.020
But I was in Pakistan,
as I mentioned.

00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:00.660
We took a delegation from
New Waterloo and Laurier

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.710
University, and the government
information minister--

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.660
the federal government
information minister--

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:08.840
I heard him.

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:13.880
And they were made accountable
in front of a few thousand

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.570
people in one of the peace
and social sciences summit.

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:19.770
[INAUDIBLE] that
you said that you

00:37:19.770 --> 00:37:26.210
were going to allocate a huge
amount of GDP to education.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:29.240
So they didn't, but the
recognized in front of people

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:32.160
that we are in a
war-like situation.

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:33.640
We are in war and conflict.

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.810
Yes, when this situation,
we overcome that,

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:39.660
we are going to allocate money.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:42.160
ADAM GREEN: So they're saying,
we're going to wait until all

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.260
the war is over,
and then we'll--

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.860
JAHAN ZEB: Yeah,
well, one thing--

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.070
the provincial education
has become, now,

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.500
provincial subject.

00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.930
And it is becoming
one of the priority.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:56.434
Now, what we will be
doing through different

00:37:56.434 --> 00:37:59.100
organizations, through different
universities-- developing peace

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.840
education curriculum
and provide training

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:06.970
in the concepts of peace
and quality education--

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:09.880
then the government is willing
to adopt that nationally

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.420
or locally.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:13.610
So I have trust in them.

00:38:13.610 --> 00:38:16.170
And only one-- like
teachers and students

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:19.480
can do that, not necessarily,
until this government

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.720
and businesses come on board.

00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.940
ADAM GREEN: Excellent.

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:23.660
Vera?

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.510
AUDIENCE: I just had
a question about what

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:27.500
role technology
has in solving some

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:28.750
of these educational problems.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:31.540
If you can't reach
people in person,

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:34.335
what can technology do to help
you reach people remotely?

00:38:34.335 --> 00:38:35.710
ADAM GREEN: So
for those of you--

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:36.900
I don't think that mic is on.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.316
For those of you
who are watching,

00:38:38.316 --> 00:38:40.320
the question was,
what can technology

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.527
do to help bring education
to people in conflict zones?

00:38:43.527 --> 00:38:45.360
JAHAN ZEB: Ziauddin,
do you want to respond?

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:45.510
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:47.000
JAHAN ZEB: OK.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.330
But anyway, I will still
ask Ziauddin to respond,

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:54.380
because his answers
are excellent, always.

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:58.160
We are working with University
of Waterloo, Laurier

00:38:58.160 --> 00:38:58.730
University.

00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:59.940
So we have [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.140
We have developed
some e-learning,

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:04.980
some online education tool.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:08.740
And I think technology
provides them those platforms.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.630
And we would like Google
to be supporting some

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:15.570
of those platforms
or partnering with,

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:17.310
of course, Global
Peace Centre Canada,

00:39:17.310 --> 00:39:19.940
but partnering with
the Malala Fund

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:24.170
as well, to be providing support
to young children and adults,

00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:26.130
as well.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:31.210
We also need to
educate older adults,

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:33.760
to unlearn some
of their behaviors

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.710
and learn some new things.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:41.770
So I think technology needs
to playing a huge part,

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:46.180
and education needs to be
accessible to everyone.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:51.760
And I think we were told that,
in Pakistan, that we need

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.480
to have access to journals.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:57.430
We need to have access to
books, which is very costly.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:03.130
And I think if technology, if
Google, if other technology

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.110
leaders-- if they partner
with universities,

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:09.550
we can provide that education,
those tools, to people.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.090
And they can educate themselves.

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:14.430
Another thing which is very
important-- Western government

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:17.740
are not issuing visas
most of the time.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:21.424
So I think technology can give
education people a doorstep.

00:40:21.424 --> 00:40:23.465
ADAM GREEN: So technology's
a window to resources

00:40:23.465 --> 00:40:25.230
that you would never
be able to fund.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.660
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI:
Yeah, I think

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:30.310
technology has hugely
transformed education

00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:32.970
in every part of the world.

00:40:32.970 --> 00:40:37.140
Once education-- I mean,
when technology was not

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:41.860
on this scale, you will astonish
that all the social media

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:46.320
channels-- like Google
and many other--

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:53.680
they are available in the same
village where girls were not

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:56.950
going to school, and where the
boys were not going to school,

00:40:56.950 --> 00:40:58.764
that now they have computers.

00:40:58.764 --> 00:40:59.430
They have iPads.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:01.050
They have iPhones.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:05.970
And they have access to
this flood of information.

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:12.685
And that's why we have virtual
universities, online teaching.

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:18.320
So this is a huge
transformation,

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:23.990
and information technology
has made modern education

00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:28.010
and knowledge as common
asset of the human being,

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:29.260
for every part of the word.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.220
ADAM GREEN: No longer locked
in certain institutions.

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:33.050
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: Yeah,
nobody can lock them in.

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:33.970
It's for everybody.

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:34.720
It's for everyone.

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:40.910
It's very secular, Google.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:46.010
And it's beyond gender,
color, [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:47.890
It's available to everybody.

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:51.200
And I find, sometime,
problem with this information

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.910
technology, as a father.

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.320
When my son is
busy on computer--

00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.410
so when we think of
computer, my age people,

00:41:59.410 --> 00:42:02.300
we think that there must
be some playing games

00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.610
and that's it, about computer.

00:42:05.610 --> 00:42:08.640
Because I'm of the
older generation.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:14.410
I didn't use computer in
my whole life as a student.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.840
[INAUDIBLE] I'm using.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.260
But until my master, I
never did any assignment,

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.380
nothing on computer.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.660
But my younger
son, in Birmingham,

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:28.340
when I see him busy at his desk
on computer I'll sometimes say,

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.410
Atal, you're not doing homework.

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.320
Because for me, homework
means having notebooks,

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.340
and writing something,
and reading something.

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:39.450
He tells me, but I'm doing
homework on computer.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:40.760
I can't believe him.

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:43.640
So this is a big change.

00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:46.505
ADAM GREEN: If he's doing it on
his Xbox, he's probably lying.

00:42:46.505 --> 00:42:47.720
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: Yeah.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.660
And so you see, this
modern technology

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:57.180
has given a platform
of change to people,

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.860
like many people
in our community.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:06.240
The girls are not supposed
to go out in the markets,

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.640
and they're not
supposed, sometimes,

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.720
even to send them to school.

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.340
But I see on social
media, the pictures

00:43:14.340 --> 00:43:18.470
of girls who share their
views or their pictures,

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:19.640
their mother's pictures.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.950
So this change is also
coming, gradually.

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:24.950
So we are very optimistic.

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:32.510
But I must support
Jahan Zeb's idea that--

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:38.510
I mean, this huge technology
and its organizations--

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:44.660
if they include
in their business

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:49.740
a mission to educate boys
and especially girls,

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.680
I think they can
contribute in a way which

00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.530
no other revolution can do.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:00.610
So the way they have
revolutionized the world,

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.890
through modern
technology-- if they

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:06.360
focus how to reach every
girl and boy in the world,

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.840
I think they can do it.

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:13.236
But it just needs a commitment,
and you are very rich in ideas.

00:44:13.236 --> 00:44:14.610
ADAM GREEN: There
you have it it.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.070
So it's on us, basically.

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:18.180
We have the tools.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.930
If we can make that part of
our mission, to educate--

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:20.590
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI:
Yes, exactly.

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:22.173
ADAM GREEN: We can
provide that window

00:44:22.173 --> 00:44:24.470
into all of human
knowledge for those people.

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.990
Fantastic.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:27.017
Well, I think we-- are
we out of time there?

00:44:27.017 --> 00:44:27.600
Or do we have?

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.808
AUDIENCE: Are we out of time?

00:44:28.808 --> 00:44:29.700
It's almost 1:00.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.679
JAHAN ZEB: Yeah,
we can take a few--

00:44:31.679 --> 00:44:33.470
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: If
they have questions.

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:35.200
If they are tired,
then we just wind up,

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:37.161
because we talk too
much [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:37.161 --> 00:44:39.466
ADAM GREEN: Yeah?

00:44:39.466 --> 00:44:41.200
All right.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.450
JAHAN ZEB: But we are enjoying
this conversation, so--

00:44:46.096 --> 00:44:47.220
AUDIENCE: Is this on, Adam?

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.390
ADAM GREEN: It appears
to be on, yeah.

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:50.556
AUDIENCE: This is a bit
more of a personal question,

00:44:50.556 --> 00:44:51.950
but I'm interested in knowing.

00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:54.530
Obviously, your
lives have completely

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:56.890
changed since this incident.

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:59.590
And I'd love to know,
what's one cherished memory

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:02.180
that's just beyond your
wildest dream that's happened?

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.552
And is there anything you
miss from your life before?

00:45:05.552 --> 00:45:07.635
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: What's
she saying, number one?

00:45:07.635 --> 00:45:10.990
ADAM GREEN: Is there anything
you miss, from your life

00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:14.365
before, when you were in Swat--
before everything changed?

00:45:14.365 --> 00:45:15.990
Malala got shot and
everything changed?

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:17.390
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: What
I miss now, of that life?

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.610
ADAM GREEN: Pardon?

00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:18.050
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI:
What I miss now.

00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:19.230
ADAM GREEN: Yeah,
what do you miss?

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:21.230
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: Yeah,
there are many things.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:25.390
I tell people that every night
in my dreams, I am in Swat.

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:31.965
I am in Pakistan, and I am very
engaged with my people on phone

00:45:31.965 --> 00:45:33.220
and on Skype.

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.430
I'm in contact with them.

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:39.050
Also, the most important
thing of my life, which I

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:42.360
had there-- my
role as a teacher.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:47.140
And I do miss children
sitting in the classroom--

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:50.660
when I used to enter, the
way they used to welcome me,

00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:54.050
and the way we used to
share ideas with each other,

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:58.140
because as a teacher my
class used to be very open,

00:45:58.140 --> 00:46:00.030
like with open discussion.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:01.820
Because I never
told the children

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:04.510
that I am the one who
will teach you, and who

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.510
has every kind of knowledge.

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:09.050
I used to tell them
that, let's share things.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:11.990
Let's share knowledge
or experiences.

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:15.010
And when I used to see
the light-- sharing

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:20.010
an idea, a motivation and
some inspirational thing

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.240
with children-- and
when I used to see

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.590
the light on the
faces of the children,

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:28.510
then I used to tell to
myself that, Ziauddin,

00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:32.555
you are the most blessed person,
as a teacher, on this earth.

00:46:32.555 --> 00:46:34.430
So I do miss my children.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:38.780
I do miss myself as a
teacher in Swat Valley.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:39.530
ADAM GREEN: Great.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:42.380
Any other questions?

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:44.512
No?

00:46:44.512 --> 00:46:45.430
Jahan?

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:47.760
JAHAN ZEB: Yeah.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.890
Just one thing, which
I want from you.

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.120
I think we provide
some solution.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:58.930
We cannot provide all solution,
but we provide some solutions

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:04.990
to children, to educators, to be
having some quality education.

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:07.930
And we cannot do that
only by ourselves.

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:11.360
We need all of
you here, which is

00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:16.760
sitting in this room, as
well as your colleagues

00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.450
all over the world.

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:23.490
So we need your support, and
please support this good cause

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:24.090
today.

00:47:24.090 --> 00:47:25.180
Thank you.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:26.340
ADAM GREEN: Excellent.

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.465
Well, thank you for coming.

00:47:27.465 --> 00:47:29.964
ZIAUDDIN YOUSAFZAI: Thank you
very much for listening to us.

00:47:29.964 --> 00:47:30.830
Thank you.

00:47:30.830 --> 00:47:35.080
[APPLAUSE]
