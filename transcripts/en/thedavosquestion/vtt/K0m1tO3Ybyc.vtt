Hi YouTube. I watched Pablo's video and I
really agree with him that it is slightly

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.870
different for CEOs and for doctors and lawyers,
I don't have very much to show you. But the

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.210
point that Pablo made about the fact that
making money should never be the only consideration.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.730
Is something which even the greatest proponents
of capitalism, whether it's Adam Smith or

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.000
Wayne Brown made very clear. It's one thing
to make money while you are doing good for

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.250
your company, for your shareholders, for you
workers. And it's another to make money while

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.800
you are taking your company down the drain.
And this is really what's been happening.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.220
Head CEOs getting bonuses while the companies
have been failing. We had John Thain redecorating

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.420
his office to the tune of a million dollars
while getting money from the tax payers to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:06.550
bail out his company. This is virtually unacceptable.
And that where a moral commons, a code of

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:16.130
ethics needs to be ready. So the rules should
be, don't make money for yourselves in terms

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:23.330
of bonuses or redecorating your office or
anything like that while you are taking money

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.250
from the tax payers. And don't do it while
your company's going down the drain. I think

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.960
these are two very, very basic and ethical
rules that our CEOs need to follow. Otherwise

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.260
they are becoming the Marie Antoinettes of
the economic melt down. Remember when we read

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.979
about Marie Antoinette we used to talk of
love. What could she of possibly have said

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.090
that could of been seen? She wasn't getting
it, and many of modern CEOs aren't getting

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.830
it either.
