00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:02.960
Here's another quiz. Just to kind of practice this idea of

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.120
what singling clustering does and to think about it a little

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.800
bit more. But also to wonder with, if maybe is

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.160
it, isn't exactly what we think of when we think of

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.060
clustering. So so here's a set of points that I

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.570
drew in the upper left corner here in black. And the

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.190
question is, if we run singling clustering with K equals two.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.310
Which of these three patterns will, will we be getting out?

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.260
&gt;&gt; Okay, I got it.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.810
&gt;&gt; All

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.870
right, good, let's let's give everybody a chance to think about it.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.310
&gt;&gt; Okay. Go.
