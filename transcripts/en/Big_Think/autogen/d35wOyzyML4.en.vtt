am in that state you know a half percent

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
am in that state you know a half percent
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.480

of the time but the poetry tries to get

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
of the time but the poetry tries to get
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.460
of the time but the poetry tries to get
into that a lot of it does anyway tries

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470
into that a lot of it does anyway tries
 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.310
into that a lot of it does anyway tries
to get into that state and arrest one of

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
to get into that state and arrest one of
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.160
to get into that state and arrest one of
those moments I have this kind of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170
those moments I have this kind of
 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.910
those moments I have this kind of
crackpot analogy which is that you know

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
crackpot analogy which is that you know
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.730
crackpot analogy which is that you know
if this is old atomic through but if you

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740
if this is old atomic through but if you
 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.530
if this is old atomic through but if you
took it you take an atom and you smash

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
took it you take an atom and you smash
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.249
took it you take an atom and you smash
it you know matter is composed of atoms

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
it you know matter is composed of atoms
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.030
it you know matter is composed of atoms
and you smash one and it releases this

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040
and you smash one and it releases this
 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.859
and you smash one and it releases this
staggering amount of energy time is

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
staggering amount of energy time is
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.440
staggering amount of energy time is
composed not of atoms but of moments and

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450
composed not of atoms but of moments and
 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.670
composed not of atoms but of moments and
if you smash a moment there is also this

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680
if you smash a moment there is also this
 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.859
if you smash a moment there is also this
amazing release and the way to smash a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
amazing release and the way to smash a
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.670
amazing release and the way to smash a
moment is not with a cyclotron but

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680
moment is not with a cyclotron but
 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.319
moment is not with a cyclotron but
through attention you smash a moment by

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329
through attention you smash a moment by
 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:00.590
through attention you smash a moment by
fixing it in your mind and and and I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600
fixing it in your mind and and and I
