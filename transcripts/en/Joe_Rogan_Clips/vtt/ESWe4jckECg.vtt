1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.860
Do you notice a big difference between like female athletes and male athletes?

2
00:00:04.861 --> 00:00:09.630
Like,
okay.
Cause fighting is a pretty,
I don't want to say exaggerated,

3
00:00:09.631 --> 00:00:11.790
but it's an interesting thing where

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.040
<v 1>okay,</v>

5
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.160
<v 0>you know,
you have men and women kind of differently,</v>

6
00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:19.130
but doing the same thing if you will.
Yeah.
Um,

7
00:00:19.131 --> 00:00:21.620
do you notice a difference in their mentality?

8
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.623
<v 1>MMM,</v>

9
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.550
<v 2>well they vary so much individually.
That's what's interesting.</v>

10
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.140
It's like you'll find even male fighters who are like super laid back and then

11
00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:35.950
you find other ones that are really intense and super emotional and uh,

12
00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:38.350
it's really hard to tell.
Like there's a,

13
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.160
there's Gunnar Nelson is a guy from Iceland,
you know,
is,
I know who he is.
Yeah.

14
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.850
But fantastic Jiujitsu guy.
You cannot get that guy to change his expression.

15
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.170
It doesn't change.
You could punch him,
kick him in the balls.
He stay stoic.

16
00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:53.980
It's a weird,
he's a weird guy.
Yeah.
He's very on one side of it.

17
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:57.280
And then there's like guys like Conor Mcgregor who's also his training partner

18
00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.080
who's on a completely different side of it.

19
00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:02.230
He's screaming and yelling and talking shit to everybody.
And you know,
that's,

20
00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:05.890
that's part of his flair.
You know,
they vary so widely.

21
00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:07.450
And that's true with girls too.

22
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.200
Some girls are brash and outrageous and they get another girl's faces and put

23
00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:15.400
their knuckles on their nose and they were at the stare down and other girls bow

24
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.560
and the hug and they take selfies together.

25
00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:21.120
It's like everyone has their own sort of approach to it.
It's very interesting.

26
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.550
<v 0>It is interesting.
I'm always,
I'm,
I'm in fighting and intrigues me in that.</v>

27
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.610
I think it's interesting that you're trying to be offensive and defensive at the

28
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:31.070
same time,
dealing with fear,

29
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.690
like all these things happening simultaneously.
And I then take it,

30
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.770
I look at it one step further with a female because

31
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.990
I don't know,
I,
I,
I'm interested to know how,
if,

32
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.460
if a female can fight from a,
not,
not a nonemotional place,

33
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.270
but without her emotion.
Like just like,

34
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:58.530
okay,
I'm in my mail,
I'm in my athlete and um,

35
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.340
I'm not going to be like,
oh,
she didn't just kick me in the ear,
you know,

36
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:04.200
and like freak out.
You know what I mean?
Like,

37
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.370
cause I think about myself and I'd be like,
you know,
like I,

38
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.510
I've only been in one fight in my whole life and,

39
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.410
and the girl hit me in the face and when I saw my blood I was like,
oh no,

40
00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:16.560
she did not just hit me in the face,
you know,
and then went crazy.

41
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.150
But if these girls could be like,
cause they're so well trained as an athlete,

42
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.720
how that can supersede or override actually like this im that feminine impulse

43
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.430
of like a,
you know,
reaction,
a reaction.

44
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.390
<v 2>That's a masculine impulse to though I think it's a human impulse.</v>

45
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:38.610
If a guy punches you in the face,
you get furious.

46
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.150
It's so hard for people to not get emotional when they get hit.
Yeah.

47
00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.100
Cause he wanted to get it back.
That's a good point.

48
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.480
It's a very bad way to react in a fight to fight with emotions because you

49
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:52.280
expose yourself,
right.
You leave yourself open for counters.
You Do,

50
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.180
you miss your rhythm.
You're not as deceptive and your,
your emotions,

51
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.810
you're too obvious in your pattern.
And so many times you,
you get hit a lot more.

52
00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.140
Yeah.
It's a,
it's a big problem with fighters.
That emotion.

53
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:08.620
It's a very big problem.
And uh,
the wanting to break people,

54
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.860
like letting them hit you so that you could show them that they can't hurt you

55
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.580
to get some masculine thing too stupid.
It's a very stupid,

56
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.140
take it on the face on purpose and then just like,
come on,
come on,
come on.
Hit.

57
00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.050
That's what you have.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Then that's a terrible emotion though,

58
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:26.590
cause you can get completely knocked unconscious doing that happens all the
time.

59
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.800
It's just the smart thing to do is to fight with correct technique and with a

60
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:38.470
correct strategy.
Meaning you have an understanding of how to execute best.

61
00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.190
It's not to just wait and let bombs fly.
It's,
you have to,

62
00:03:42.191 --> 00:03:46.750
you have to be very precise in your tactics.
You've got to be very smart.

63
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.690
<v 0>I think it's interesting though,
um,
those sports where there is that,</v>

64
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.400
I mean,
listen,
versions of it is football.
You know,
living with layered,
obviously,

65
00:03:56.401 --> 00:03:56.611
you know,

66
00:03:56.611 --> 00:04:00.450
he always says he appreciates mother nature because it's like you make good

67
00:04:00.451 --> 00:04:04.800
decisions.
You're rewarded,
you make bad decisions.
You,
you pay a price.

68
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.730
But I think it is very interesting when you have two humans strategically trying

69
00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:15.600
to deconstruct one another.
Um,
the chess,

70
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:19.560
the physical chest that goes on as like looking at it from another athlete's

71
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:21.600
point of view.
Um,

72
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.130
I think it's a unique person that wants to put themselves in that situation.

73
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.930
You know,
it's like,
I understand almost like,
uh,
you know,

74
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.340
a surfer and a wave and a rock climber and a mountain.
I get that.

75
00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.810
Like I'm going to be a part of that.
Um,

76
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.550
but I find it really interesting and even sort of,

77
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:45.330
I'm even more curious about women,
like who say like,
yeah,

78
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:46.740
this is going to be my sport

79
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.070
<v 2>wildly.
Uh,
like there's Holly Holm.
She</v>

80
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.330
<v 0>just seems like awfully sweet.</v>

81
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.270
She seemed like she'd bring you cupcakes or murder.
You just kick your fuck.

82
00:04:56.271 --> 00:04:59.410
I saw the pack.
I mean,
listen,
I saw that kick,
but then it's like,

83
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.940
I'm so sorry I made you these after,
you know,
chocolate chip cookies.
It's like,

84
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.650
okay,
I'll get it.
You know,
when I come back from the hospital,
um,
I don't know.

85
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:11.180
It's,
it is interesting when you see girls like that.
Yeah.
Well,

86
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.110
they're all different.
I always want to know,
do they have brothers,

87
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.240
like where they rabble rousing and that their whole time and it wasn't,

88
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.280
and they learn to play in,
it wasn't personal,
you know,

89
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:23.710
and like a little contact was,
okay.
