00:00:00.572 --> 00:00:02.217
- [Narrator] In other videos
we have talked about how

00:00:02.217 --> 00:00:06.098
ratification of the US
Constitution to replace the

00:00:06.098 --> 00:00:09.266
Articles of Confederation
was not a slam dunk.

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:12.010
After the Constitution
was drafted during the

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.818
Constitutional Convention in mid 1787,

00:00:14.818 --> 00:00:18.126
you actually have a
significant group of people who

00:00:18.126 --> 00:00:19.816
are against the ratification.

00:00:19.816 --> 00:00:21.865
And we study some of their
writings in another video

00:00:21.865 --> 00:00:26.029
on the anti-Federalist Papers,
in particular on Brutus I,

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.794
which is the most prominent of them.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:30.176
In this video we're gonna
focus on the other side,

00:00:30.176 --> 00:00:33.510
on the folks who are
aggressively advocating for

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.493
ratification of the Constitution.

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:40.458
Alexander Hamilton, James
Madison, John Jay were some

00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:42.774
of the most prominent of
these and they were the ones

00:00:42.774 --> 00:00:45.619
that wrote the Federalist
Papers that were focused on

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:49.357
convincing everyone to
adopt the Constitution.

00:00:49.357 --> 00:00:51.551
And what we're going to look
at in this video is, perhaps,

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.535
the most famous of the Federalist Papers,

00:00:54.535 --> 00:00:56.952
this is Federalist number 10.

00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:01.465
Or at least an excerpt of
Federalist number 10 that

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:03.167
we're going to look at right over here.

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:06.139
It was published November 23, 1787.

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:08.879
And if you remember the video
on Brutus I this is only

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:11.865
a few weeks after Brutus I,
which is now considered a

00:01:11.865 --> 00:01:14.104
famous anti-Federalist
Paper was published.

00:01:14.104 --> 00:01:17.452
So it's right in this time
period right over here

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:19.468
where people are going
back and forth deciding,

00:01:19.468 --> 00:01:21.824
do we ratify this constitution?

00:01:21.824 --> 00:01:25.764
And James Madison published
under the pen name Publius.

00:01:25.764 --> 00:01:29.032
And Publius is making
reference to one of the ancient

00:01:29.032 --> 00:01:32.976
Roman aristocrats who
overthrew the Roman kingdom in

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:37.527
the late sixth century to
establish the Roman Republic.

00:01:37.527 --> 00:01:40.517
So one way to think about
it is he is viewing himself

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.924
and the other Federalists
as trying to establish

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:45.592
a strong republic.

00:01:45.592 --> 00:01:48.051
This is in comparison to
Brutus, which we see as the pen

00:01:48.051 --> 00:01:51.627
name for some of the significant
anti-Federalist Papers,

00:01:51.627 --> 00:01:54.797
and Brutus played a significant
role in the assassination

00:01:54.797 --> 00:01:58.721
of Julius Caesar to keep him
from corrupting the republic,

00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:01.931
ending the republic and
turning it into an empire.

00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:06.537
But now let's read this excerpt
of Federalist number 10.

00:02:06.537 --> 00:02:09.727
And as I read this keep in
mind some of these ideas,

00:02:09.727 --> 00:02:12.229
these flavors of democracy
that we have talked about

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:13.309
in other videos.

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:15.886
Does Madison, in Federalist
number 10, does he seem

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:18.077
pro-participatory democracy
or anti-participatory

00:02:18.077 --> 00:02:18.910
democracy?

00:02:20.215 --> 00:02:22.899
Does he seem to think that
pluralism is a good idea

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.118
or a bad idea?

00:02:24.118 --> 00:02:27.816
And is he more pro elite
democracy or anti-elites

00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:29.483
running a democracy?

00:02:30.468 --> 00:02:33.075
"To the People of the state of New York."

00:02:33.075 --> 00:02:35.289
Like Brutus I, it's addressed
to the people of the

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:37.812
state of New York because one,
New York was a significant

00:02:37.812 --> 00:02:40.778
state and he's trying to
convince them, in this case,

00:02:40.778 --> 00:02:43.338
to support the US Constitution.

00:02:43.338 --> 00:02:46.606
"Among the numerous
advantages promised by a well

00:02:46.606 --> 00:02:49.921
"constructed union, none
deserves to be more accurately

00:02:49.921 --> 00:02:53.392
"developed than it's tendency
to break and control the

00:02:53.392 --> 00:02:55.546
"violence of factions."

00:02:55.546 --> 00:02:58.187
So a well constructed
union needs to be able to

00:02:58.187 --> 00:03:00.807
control the violence of a faction.

00:03:00.807 --> 00:03:02.367
In fact, this is the in
the title, The Union as a

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:06.111
Safeguard Against Domestic
Faction and Insurrection.

00:03:06.111 --> 00:03:09.710
"Complaints are everywhere
heard from our most considerate

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.328
"and virtuous citizens
that our governments are

00:03:12.328 --> 00:03:16.252
"too unstable, that the
public good is disregarded in

00:03:16.252 --> 00:03:18.894
"the conflicts of rival parties,

00:03:18.894 --> 00:03:22.307
"and that measures are too
often decided not according

00:03:22.307 --> 00:03:25.535
"to the rules of justice
and the rights of the minor

00:03:25.535 --> 00:03:29.348
"party, but by the superior
force of an interested and

00:03:29.348 --> 00:03:31.265
"overbearing majority."

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.799
So already outlining some of the problems.

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:37.684
This problem of faction,
this problem of majority rule

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:41.851
overrunning minorities or
the rights of the minorities.

00:03:43.573 --> 00:03:46.282
"It is in vain to say that
enlightened statesmen will

00:03:46.282 --> 00:03:49.265
"be able to adjust these
clashing interests,"

00:03:49.265 --> 00:03:51.442
the clashing interests of faction,

00:03:51.442 --> 00:03:54.000
"And render them all
subservient to the public good.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.167
"Enlightened statesmen will
not always be at the helm,

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.942
"it may be concluded
that a pure democracy,

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:06.535
"by which I mean a society
consisting of a small number

00:04:06.535 --> 00:04:09.786
"of citizens who assemble
and administer the government

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:13.954
"in person can admit of
no cure for the mischiefs

00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:15.591
"of faction."

00:04:15.591 --> 00:04:17.894
So a pure democracy, which
is about as close as you can

00:04:17.894 --> 00:04:21.286
get to a participatory democracy,
Madison here is claiming

00:04:21.286 --> 00:04:23.921
that it can admit of no cure
for the mischiefs of the

00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:26.061
faction, that it doesn't
really help the situation.

00:04:26.061 --> 00:04:30.411
"A common passion or interest
will, in almost every case,

00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:33.232
"be felt by a majority of the whole,

00:04:33.232 --> 00:04:37.888
"and there is nothing to check
the inducements to sacrifice

00:04:37.888 --> 00:04:41.278
"the weaker party or an
obnoxious individual.

00:04:41.278 --> 00:04:44.691
"Hence it is that such
democracies have ever been

00:04:44.691 --> 00:04:47.733
"spectacles of turbulence and contention;

00:04:47.733 --> 00:04:50.909
"have ever been found incompatible
with personal security

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:54.281
"or the rights of people; and
have in general been as short

00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:58.734
"in their lives as they have
been violent in their deaths."

00:04:58.734 --> 00:05:02.937
So what does Madison think
of participatory democracies?

00:05:02.937 --> 00:05:05.005
Right, he doesn't think
too highly of them.

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:06.820
He says, "Look, a majority
is going to take over

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.299
"and they're going to
trample over the rights of

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:10.721
"everyone else."

00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:14.888
So clearly he thinks that
a participatory democracy,

00:05:16.468 --> 00:05:17.301
not good.

00:05:20.636 --> 00:05:23.765
"A republic, by which I mean
a government in which the

00:05:23.765 --> 00:05:26.853
"scheme of representation takes place,

00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:30.953
"opens a different prospect,
and promises the cure

00:05:30.953 --> 00:05:33.210
"for which we are seeking."

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.764
So in his definition of
republic it's a situation where

00:05:35.764 --> 00:05:39.531
you have the people being
represented by others.

00:05:39.531 --> 00:05:42.921
"The two great points of
difference between a democracy,

00:05:42.921 --> 00:05:46.578
"or pure democracy, and
a republic are first the

00:05:46.578 --> 00:05:50.195
"delegation of the government
in the latter to a small

00:05:50.195 --> 00:05:53.159
"number of citizens elected by the rest."

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.274
So he's saying in a republic
you're delegating the

00:05:55.274 --> 00:05:58.444
government to a small
number of citizens elected

00:05:58.444 --> 00:06:00.150
by the rest.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.279
"Secondly, the greater number
of citizens and the greater

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.002
"sphere of country over which
the latter," the republic,

00:06:06.002 --> 00:06:07.465
"may be extended."

00:06:07.465 --> 00:06:09.392
So this is interesting because
in Brutus I the argument

00:06:09.392 --> 00:06:12.863
is made that republics
aren't good at ruling over

00:06:12.863 --> 00:06:14.274
large territories.

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:17.484
Here Madison is claiming
that a republic is better at

00:06:17.484 --> 00:06:20.590
ruling over a greater sphere of country,

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.423
over a greater number of citizens.

00:06:25.571 --> 00:06:27.399
"The effect of the first difference,"

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:29.489
and so this is a notion of
having those representatives,

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:31.741
having a representative democracy,

00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:35.584
"Is to refine and
enlarge the public views,

00:06:35.584 --> 00:06:40.172
"by passing them through
the medium of a chosen body

00:06:40.172 --> 00:06:43.769
"of citizens, whose wisdom
may best discern the true

00:06:43.769 --> 00:06:47.124
"interest of their country
and whose patriotism and

00:06:47.124 --> 00:06:50.818
"love of justice will be
least likely to sacrifice it

00:06:50.818 --> 00:06:54.114
"to temporary or partial considerations.

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:57.347
"Under such a regulation
it may well happen that the

00:06:57.347 --> 00:07:00.923
"public voice, pronounced
by the representatives of

00:07:00.923 --> 00:07:04.923
"the people, will be more
consonant to the public good

00:07:04.923 --> 00:07:08.498
"than if pronounced by
the people themselves."

00:07:08.498 --> 00:07:11.242
So this is really, really
interesting because we already

00:07:11.242 --> 00:07:14.512
saw that Madison's not a fan
of participatory democracy

00:07:14.512 --> 00:07:17.678
and here he's saying, "Look,
if you take the views and

00:07:17.678 --> 00:07:20.671
"pass them through the medium
of a chosen body of citizens

00:07:20.671 --> 00:07:24.278
"that these people might
represent the public good

00:07:24.278 --> 00:07:26.685
"better than the people themselves."

00:07:26.685 --> 00:07:30.852
This is really Madison being
very pro elite democracy.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.657
Where you have a limited
number of people who are

00:07:36.657 --> 00:07:39.160
really participating and
he's making the argument that

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.453
they might be better at
representing the needs of the

00:07:41.453 --> 00:07:43.363
people than the people themselves.

00:07:43.363 --> 00:07:46.150
"On the other hand, the
effect may be inverted."

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.141
So he is giving some
credence to the other side

00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:49.418
of the argument.

00:07:49.418 --> 00:07:52.080
"Men of factious tempers,
of local prejudices,

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.697
"or of sinister designs may,
by intrigue, by corruption,

00:07:56.697 --> 00:07:59.780
"or by other means first
obtain the suffrages and then

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.780
"betray the interests of the people.

00:08:03.721 --> 00:08:07.645
"The question resulting is
whether small or extensive

00:08:07.645 --> 00:08:11.198
"republics are more favorable
to the election of proper

00:08:11.198 --> 00:08:12.984
"guardians of the public weal;

00:08:12.984 --> 00:08:15.604
"and it is clearly decided
in favor of the latter,"

00:08:15.604 --> 00:08:20.579
so large republics, "by
two obvious considerations.

00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:23.836
"In the first place, however
small the republic may be,

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:26.622
"the representatives must be
raised to a certain number,

00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:29.912
"in order to guard against
the cabals of a few,

00:08:29.912 --> 00:08:32.690
"and that however large it
may be, they must be limited

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.358
"to a certain number in
order to guard against the

00:08:35.358 --> 00:08:36.862
"confusion of a multitude."

00:08:36.862 --> 00:08:38.323
So this is really interesting, he says,

00:08:38.323 --> 00:08:41.901
"Look, no matter how large
your republic you're going

00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:43.909
"to need a certain number
of representatives.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:45.860
"You have too small then
they're just going to be able

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.996
"to control everything,
but if you have too many

00:08:47.996 --> 00:08:50.556
"representatives it's just
going to be confusing."

00:08:50.556 --> 00:08:53.197
"Hence, the number of
representatives in the two cases

00:08:53.197 --> 00:08:56.814
"not being in proportion to
that of the two constituents,"

00:08:56.814 --> 00:08:58.764
you're not gonna keep the
same proportion depending on

00:08:58.764 --> 00:09:01.080
population, "and being
proportionally greater in the

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:04.494
"small republic, it follow
that, if the proportion of

00:09:04.494 --> 00:09:07.721
"fit characters be not less
in the large than in the

00:09:07.721 --> 00:09:11.642
"small republic, the former
will present a greater option

00:09:11.642 --> 00:09:15.036
"and consequently a greater
probability of a fit choice."

00:09:15.036 --> 00:09:17.416
So what he's really saying
is in a large republic you're

00:09:17.416 --> 00:09:20.723
more likely to find fit and
good representatives than you

00:09:20.723 --> 00:09:22.574
will in a smaller republic.

00:09:22.574 --> 00:09:25.844
Once again, he wants people
who he considers to be

00:09:25.844 --> 00:09:27.185
elite in some way.

00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:29.159
The more educated,
whatever you might consider

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:30.314
elite to be.

00:09:30.314 --> 00:09:32.098
For the sake of time I'll
leave you there in this part

00:09:32.098 --> 00:09:35.661
one video and in part two
we'll see James Madison

00:09:35.661 --> 00:09:38.523
continue to argue, not
only for a republic,

00:09:38.523 --> 00:09:42.162
but for a large republic
which the US Constitution

00:09:42.162 --> 00:09:43.869
provides for.

00:09:43.869 --> 00:09:47.056
Arguing that you'll have
better people representing

00:09:47.056 --> 00:09:51.034
in government and you will
also have a more pluralist

00:09:51.034 --> 00:09:53.662
society, which we'll see
is very different than the

00:09:53.662 --> 00:09:55.890
view of the anti-Federalists.
