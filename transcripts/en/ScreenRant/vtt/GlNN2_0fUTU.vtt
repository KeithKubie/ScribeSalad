00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.370
Star Wars is the most iconic Sci-Fi film saga
of all time, grossing over 6.5 billion dollars

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.950
with film tickets alone.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.740
George Lucas has created a world that is part
of our everyday conversations.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.110
With long gaps between trilogy’s fans are
eager to learn more about their favorite characters,

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.660
lands, weapons, ships and anything else Star
Wars related.

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.410
With thousands of talented artists working
on these films there is more than meets the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.720
eye when watching the first time around.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:43.640
Here is Screen Rant’s list of the ten Most
Paused Scenes in Star Wars Movies.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.030
Flags at Maz Kanata's Bar

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.050
The outside of Maz Kanata’s bar is ornamented
with flags that represent numerous moments

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.579
in the Star Wars saga.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.030
When the team walks into the bar look above
and see what famous symbols you can spot.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.390
The flags include several symbols from the
pod-racing scene in “The Phantom Menace”

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.720
but one is more important to fans.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.930
Boba Fett wears a symbol on his outfit in
“The Empire Strikes Back” and “Return

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.930
of the Jedi”; this symbol can be seen on
the flags also.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.490
Maybe Boba did survive the Sarlacc Pit!

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.640
Ralph McQuarrie Cameo

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.860
Without Ralph McQuarrie there would have been
no Star Wars, George Lucas knew his characters

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.510
and world he envisioned were perfect for the
silver screen but needed to prove it to 20th

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.530
Century Fox.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.610
He hired McQuarrie to help illustrate the
planets, vehicles, and characters that was

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.020
in his mind and the rest was history.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.250
Lucas gave McQuarrie a cameo in the film “The
Empire Strikes Back” to cement his place

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.610
in Star Wars history.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:51.170
He walks through Hoth’s Echo Base with a
sketchpad under his arm.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.970
Han Gets Friendly

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.060
Han Solo is a ladies man, so much that the
smuggler even stole the heart of the Princess

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.060
of Alderaan, Leia.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.580
In “Return of the Jedi,” during the climatic
battle on the planet of Endor Leia and Han

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.439
are being attacked by Stormtroopers.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.420
Pinned up against the entrance to the shield
generator bunker that they must destroy, Leia

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.420
is shot.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.489
As Han goes in to help her, he gropes her
breast!

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.889
Was it deliberate or was it an accident?

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:28.810
Either way Han made it to second base with
a princess.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.810
E.T.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.279
Makes a Cameo

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:35.989
During “The Phantom Menace” numerous Galactic
Senators from around the galaxy surround us.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.689
One group is all too familiar to fans of Steven
Spielberg’s film, “E.T.

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:40.980
The Extra Terrestrial”.

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.499
Lucas was kept a promise he made to Spielberg
after the release of E.T.

00:02:44.499 --> 00:02:50.840
Back in 1982, Spielberg included a Yoda cameo
and Star Wars toys in E.T. and Lucas promised

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.870
that he would add E.T. in his next Star Wars
film.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:03.409
Only problem was they turned out to be Palpatine
supporters.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.319
George Lucas Cameo

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.120
Alfred Hitchcock, Mel Brooks and Quentin Tarrantino
are all directors that enjoy making cameos

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.319
in their films, where is George Lucas?

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:17.150
After five Star Wars films you would think
Lucas would join in on the fun.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.139
In his sixth film, “Revenge of the Sith”
Lucas finally makes a cameo alongside his

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.400
daughter Katie hidden behind robes and blue
paint.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.579
Lucas plays Senator Baron Papanoida and his
daughter plays Chi Eekway, it only took six

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:45.879
films but the saga creator finally joined
the galaxy on screen.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.769
The 'Millennium Falcon' In the Prequels

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.810
The YT-1300 Corellian freighter was already
sixty years old when Han Solo and Chewbacca

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.379
made the Kessel Run in 12 parsecs.

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:00.799
So seeing the Millennium Falcon in the prequels
should not be a shock but spotting the ship

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:01.799
is hard.

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.620
In “Attack of the Clones” on the planet
of Naboo you can see three-yes three models

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.909
of the YT-1300 Corellian freighter.

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.790
A popular model on that planet.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.360
If you want to see Han’s falcon before he
took it for his first ride watch “Revenge

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:24.050
of the Sith” and see it dock on Coruscant.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.950
Boba Fett’s Face

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.320
Actor Jeremy Bulloch plays villain Boba Fett
in both “The Empire Strikes Back” and

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.650
“Return of the Jedi”.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.840
But to know what he looks like you’ll have
to watch for him in “The Empire Strikes

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.120
Back” outside of his titular villain’s
costume.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.650
When Luke is tricked into visiting Cloud City
he not only gets a glance of his friends before

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.490
they are taken away but we get a glance of
Bulloch.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.381
Bulloch pulls Leia back in this scene only
because the actor who was supposed to play

00:04:49.381 --> 00:04:56.210
the part was a no show.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.720
The Outrider

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.780
Fans of the novel, “Shadows of the Empire,”
by Steve Perry know that the book describes

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.931
the events that take place between “The
Empire Strikes Back” and “Return of the

00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:05.931
Jedi.”

00:05:05.931 --> 00:05:10.900
One of the main characters was Dash Render
a smuggler and freelancer that flew the Outrider.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.070
In the special edition of “A New Hope”
the CGI artists added the Outrider taking

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.840
off from Mos Eisley.

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.760
The Kitchen Sink

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.800
The film “Revenge of the Sith” opens with
the Battle of Coruscant, it is a vibrant and

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.320
eye-popping sequence.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:31.080
The fight involved so much CGI that the team
at Industrial Light and Magic through everything

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.000
at it, including the kitchen sink.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.800
No, we mean that literally.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.200
As Obi-Wan and Anakin fly by, a Repulic cruiser
destroys a Seperatist ship causing parts of

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.770
the ship to fly off.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.560
One of those pieces crashes into the Republic
ship and that part is the kitchen sink.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.470
At least we know they wash their hands during
battle.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:52.750
Rey’s X-Wing Pilot Doll

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.550
Fans have been speculating who Rey’s parents
are since they first saw “The Force Awakens”.

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.431
Many believe she is the daughter of Luke Skywalker
and one of the reasons is because of a doll

00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:02.431
they spotted.

00:06:02.431 --> 00:06:06.620
Rey doesn’t have many items in her home
and we only saw one item that was from her

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.210
child hood, the doll.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.240
The doll in Rey’s home is a Rebel Alliance
pilot, the same uniform that Luke wore for

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.270
quite a while.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.530
Was this a hint to tell us who her parents
are or just a childhood toy?

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.580
We will have to wait for the sequels to find
out.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.580
That was our list.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.110
Can you tell us any other moments you pause
during the Star Wars Saga?
