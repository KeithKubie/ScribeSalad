[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:08.060
ELENA FAVILLI: Please help
me give a warm welcome

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.566
to Francesca Cavallo.

00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:11.274
FRANCESCA CAVALLO:
It's great to be here.

00:00:11.274 --> 00:00:13.182
Thank you for having me.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.870
ELENA FAVILLI: So
tell us about yourself

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.190
and how the idea of
this book came along.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.470
FRANCESCA CAVALLO:
Well, we always

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.700
say that this book came
from a place of anger.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.150
Elena and I moved from Italy
to Silicon Valley in 2012

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.410
to start our children's media
company called Timbuktu Labs.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.840
And we did the whole drill.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.400
We looked for investors.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.560
We launched a beta version
of our magazine, which

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.960
was called "Timbuktu"
magazine, and we

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.000
got accepted into 500 Startups.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.110
And we raised a first
seed round of capital.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.150
And then the moment
came where we

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.260
needed to access more
funding to scale the company.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.280
And that was a very telling
moment in our personal story

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.900
as professionals because we
started seeing consistently

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.870
the same kind of
feedback, that--

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.030
and I'm reporting
literal comments

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.100
that we received when
doing fundraising--

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.000
that two girls alone
could not pull it off,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.540
that this was a nice
lifestyle project,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.020
but it wasn't going
to be a big thing,

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.490
that people, in any case,
were only interested in buying

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.530
Disney content, that they
would never buy our content.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.930
And the feedback that
we got was consistently

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.000
geared towards telling us we
don't think what you're onto

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.810
is particularly interesting.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.540
But if you did a platform for
user generated content, then

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.690
maybe we could revisit
the conversation.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.520
And we were explaining
that user generated

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.460
content was not particularly--

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.180
look where it led us.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.960
And that was not our
main asset as founders,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.560
that we were very good at
creating outstanding content

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.590
even with limited resources.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.040
But the conversation
wasn't going anywhere.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.090
And when you receive the
same feedback over and over

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.450
and over again, you start
questioning, you know,

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.530
maybe I'm wrong.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.730
Maybe they're right and I
don't have what it takes.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.774
My vision is not
going to happen.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.290
But there was something in the
form this feedback was given

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.420
to us that didn't
convince us that it

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.430
was coming from a good place.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.540
So we said, OK, let's
leave Silicon Valley here.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.470
This is probably not the right
place for us at this time.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.130
Let's give Los Angeles a shot.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.780
We didn't want to
leave California.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.400
We really love it.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.510
We really love California.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.610
But we wanted to try again.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.954
At that point we had
developed 12 mobile apps,

00:03:18.954 --> 00:03:20.370
but we had reached
the point where

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.990
we needed either more capital
or we needed to shut it down.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.410
And we moved to Los
Angeles, and for one year

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.260
we went into freezing mode.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.780
It was just Elena and myself.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.370
We didn't have any
other employees anymore.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.400
We rented a small one bedroom
apartment here in Venice.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.410
We worked out of our kitchen.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.510
And I wrote horror
stories for a company that

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.560
was doing text-based fiction.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.290
And we did some consulting work.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.110
And we got to the point where we
had $8,000 in our bank account.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.950
And we said, OK, we had
this idea of a newsletter

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.360
for parents who wanted to
discuss positive female role

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.760
models with their kids
at the dinner table.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.040
And the subtitle
of the newsletter

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.580
was "Good Night Stories
for Rebel Girls".

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:21.029
We had an email list by that
point of a few thousand users

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:22.320
from the apps.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.000
But we wanted to
start it from scratch

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.400
because we wanted it to be
very focused on people that

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.220
were passionate about
female empowerment,

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.970
not parenting in general,
not apps and education, just

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.047
female empowerment.

00:04:34.047 --> 00:04:35.880
So we started from
scratch from a newsletter

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:39.150
of 25 people selected
from our friends,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.420
from those friends who we
felt we had a connection

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.880
with on that theme.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.990
And this newsletter
started growing.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:54.780
We did a couple of
things to attract

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.550
even more people to sign up.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.580
But mostly it was growing
because people were

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.920
forwarding it to each other.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:07.440
And we got to the point where
we got about 4,000 subscribers.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.690
I like to speak about
numbers, the actual numbers,

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.200
because when you
don't say the numbers,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.920
you can think, oh, they already
had so many subscribers,

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.770
or when they launched
they had probably 100,000.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.810
No, when we launched the
Kickstarter campaign,

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.360
we had 4,000 subscribers.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.370
And at one point we said, OK,
we think this newsletter could

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.810
become a book.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.240
And this is how
the book should be.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:39.280
So we put together a Google
doc with a [INAUDIBLE] link

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.820
at the end explaining what
the book would be about.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.120
And it was just text,
like a book proposal.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.400
But instead of sending
it to a publisher,

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.700
we sent it to the subscribers
of our newsletter.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:58.440
And 5% of that list gave us
money based on a Google Doc.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.840
They gave us $35 each.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.510
So we were like, maybe we're
onto something, because this

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.940
is a pretty ugly Google Doc.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.410
So if 5% of people
are converting,

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.570
then maybe we're onto something.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.680
And we had been looking at the
crowd funding space for a while

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:22.680
because we were
interested in giving

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.840
the finger to the
investors who had said no.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.300
And that seemed like a
pretty cool way to do it,

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.300
so we had been studying
the platform a little bit.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.090
And when this idea
came about, we

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.360
were like, this could be the
perfect idea for Kickstarter.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.640
So we put together the campaign.

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.050
And because it was
just the two of us,

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.430
we basically had to put
together a domino of things

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.370
that needed to happen the
moment that we hit the launch

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:52.560
button on Kickstarter.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.200
So we did all the
things that we could.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:03.330
We used Boomerang to send the
emails to all the journalists

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.780
that we had selected
the day of the launch.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.600
I remember that the
day of the launch, we

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:15.360
had a schedule that was
starting at 5:00 AM.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:20.790
And it was divided in
lots of 15 minutes each.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.390
And so we had all
of these actions

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.910
that we had to do
in order to pretend

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:30.790
that there was a team behind
this thing, a big team.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:39.090
And so we launched the
campaign with a funding goal

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:45.100
of $40,000, which we raised
in the first 30 hours.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.780
And at the end of the
campaign, after 29 days,

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:54.690
the book had raised
$675,000 from 13,000 backers

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:04.350
from 75 countries, becoming
the most crowdfunded publishing

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.670
project in history,
record which held

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:13.160
until "Good Night Stories for
Rebel Girls 2" came about.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:16.740
And when we launched "Good Night
Stories for Rebel Girls 2",

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.610
we raised $100,000,
which was the funding

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:22.125
goal, in the first three hours.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:36.270
And we had developed before
this book 12 mobile apps

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:41.460
and we had published six
picture books before this,

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.555
just so you know what an
overnight success this was.

00:08:46.555 --> 00:08:48.180
ELENA FAVILLI: That's
an amazing story.

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:49.804
I'm going to sneak
in a personal story.

00:08:49.804 --> 00:08:51.750
I had met Francesca
at a party right

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:55.480
before they were launching
the Kickstarter campaign.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.194
And I remember receiving
a personal email from her,

00:08:58.194 --> 00:08:59.610
or a Facebook
message or something

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.020
like that, like just soliciting
the Kickstarter funding,

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.082
and it seemed so
well-organized to me.

00:09:07.082 --> 00:09:09.165
So happy to hear that it
was such a great success.

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:14.710
In fact, these books
are a great success.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.650
The issues are not new, though.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.320
I mean, female
empowerment and kind

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.350
of highlighting
the story of women

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.560
who did great things
is something that

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.920
could have been done long ago.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.290
But this book is
really successful.

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:34.560
And what is this book doing
differently with respect

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.150
to the previous--

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.240
not too many, but there were
previous attempts of telling

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.100
stories of important women.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.120
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: Yeah.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.620
Yes.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.440
First of all, as you
were rightly saying,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:51.220
there are not so many books that
tackle specifically nonfiction.

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.360
So there are a few books
with female protagonists

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.490
in the fiction world.

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.490
But there's not
so many nonfiction

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.720
talking these issues,
especially for this target.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.615
And so this is for
sure one factor.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:14.010
When we started
working on this book,

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:21.960
I was so sad when
I thought about--

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.510
Elena and I thought about our
childhood and about the books

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.420
that we liked as children.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:32.550
And we realized that none of
them had a female protagonist.

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.150
And not just that, that
throughout elementary school

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:39.840
and then middle school and then
high school and then college--

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.940
throughout high
school, for example,

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:49.360
I didn't study a
single female writer.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.600
If you look at
history and we think

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:57.070
about female figures in history,
or in historical movies,

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.880
they're mainly nurses.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:03.510
They're catering to the needs of
the men who are making history.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:07.050
And we felt so outraged
by that notion,

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:17.520
and we wondered what would
we be if we had studied

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.760
the women who had made history?

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.880
Is it possible that we would
have been more confident when

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.850
facing so many no's, and
that we would have second

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.690
guessed ourselves less?

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.510
Would it be possible
that we wouldn't

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.540
have taken so much
time to understand

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:42.540
that the problem wasn't us,
but it was the people that

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.000
were giving us feedback?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.680
And we thought that if you
bring this personal issue

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:53.550
on a global scale, that
becomes incredibly powerful,

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.730
and that learning
the story of women,

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:01.200
real women that before
us have made history,

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.060
could be incredibly powerful.

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:10.480
So part of it was when we
got started with "Timbuktu"--

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.720
our very first product was
"Timbuktu" magazine, which

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.670
was a news magazine for kids.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:18.840
So we've always had this
passion for exposing kids

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.500
to what's happening around them
in the real world in a new way,

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.920
in a way that could
spark their imagination.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:31.230
And this project has always
been political for us.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.120
We've always thought
that people like

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:36.900
to think and to say that kids
are the citizens of the future,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.960
and we've always looked at kids
as the citizens of the present.

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:44.460
You can't consider a person
a citizen when they turn 18

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:47.820
and they start to vote, and
then expect that all of a sudden

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.490
they are passionate about
the world that surround them

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:54.720
and that are involved and
engaged in their community.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.030
You have to start
early, and you have

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:01.380
to do all you can to make
them passionate about what

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.840
is happening around
them, and not push them

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.180
towards these worlds
of fantasy that

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:08.040
are beautiful and important.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.650
But it's not the only
thing that's there.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.380
Reality is fascinating,
and the impact

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.490
that your daily work
can have in real life

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:22.510
is one of the things that
make life worth living.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:26.910
So I think this
is what we wanted

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.130
to convey through this book.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.180
So even though there
are other anthologies

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.520
of notable women in history--

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.380
there have been many
more after our book--

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:47.590
there is a glue that holds
these stories together,

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:54.630
which is this very
deep desire of having

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.010
an impact in the world and
having a set of values,

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.600
this glue that that is around
these stories that holds it

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.950
together, that I
think gets to the kids

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:10.530
and to their parents in a
way that is more powerful

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.090
than other books.

00:14:14.029 --> 00:14:15.570
ELENA FAVILLI: One
other thing that I

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:18.840
appreciate a lot about the
book is the direct style.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:22.140
It's not over dramatizing.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.860
But it's also not shying away
to showcase even some figures

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:26.965
that were controversial.

00:14:26.965 --> 00:14:29.340
One that, for example, hit me
because it kind of reminded

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.420
of my childhood, was
Margaret Thatcher,

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.030
a very controversial figure.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:36.890
Still, she's
featured in the book.

00:14:36.890 --> 00:14:39.660
And I loved that
there was a quote

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.330
from each woman on each story.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.120
Was this a result of
some stylistic journey,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.900
or did it just come that way?

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.030
Or what was the journey
that brought you there?

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.720
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: There is this
very interesting piece of data.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:00.930
In Italy, where I'm from, if
you hadn't guessed, only 3%

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:08.700
of the streets and public
squares are named after women.

00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:14.040
And of these 3%, 97% are saints.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:20.690
So basically, to be
remembered in our country,

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.300
you literally need
to be a saint.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.490
So one of the things
that we didn't

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:28.250
want to do when we wrote
this book was to create

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:33.860
a book of saints because--

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.820
and aside from the
religious aspect of it,

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:40.710
there are not religious
figures in the book.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.320
You can create a
book of saints even

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.930
if you adopt the liberal lens.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:49.040
You can say a woman needs to
be perfect by my standards

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.710
in order to be
featured in this book.

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:54.630
And of course, my standards
are not universal.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:16:02.710
So we wanted to make sure that
we featured a variety of women,

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:07.580
and that we did not shy away
from featuring women who

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.470
were controversial
and who had been

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:15.350
controversial during their
life because one of the most

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:20.150
dangerous lessons that
we as women are taught

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.730
is that we always
need to be likable.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.310
And that is one of
the biggest detriment

00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:29.750
to develop leadership
skills when you are a girl,

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.430
and also when you grow up.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.850
If you're a good
leader, you have

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.610
to accept that at times
you will not be likeable.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.260
You will not be liked.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.590
And if you are not
able to deal with that,

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:45.710
you are going to
be a shitty leader.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:48.350
That's simply the truth,
because you are there

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.290
because you are making difficult
choices that other people would

00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:53.360
not be able to
make in your place.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.550
If you're not able to
go through that path,

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.790
that is just not
going to happen.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:04.390
So we really cared to
feature also figures that--

00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:07.160
I mean, personally
and politically, I'm

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.770
not aligned at all
with Margaret Thatcher.

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.790
But still she was one of
the most influential figures

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.670
in politics in
Europe in her time.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.540
And she came from a family,
her father was a butcher.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:28.910
So in the highly difficult
system, class system,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.180
that Great Britain has,
she was able to become

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:35.330
prime minister, which is a
quite impressive feat that

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.120
needed to be celebrated.

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.290
And the way we thought
about these stories

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:48.170
is also that each story
celebrates particularly one

00:17:48.170 --> 00:17:48.890
trait.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:56.000
And in her case, her story
was the most iconic story

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.640
to celebrate a woman
that was able to be

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:04.340
controversial to follow
what she thought was right.

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.770
ELENA FAVILLI: So you
started mentioning

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:09.490
how do you select
this, the stories.

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:11.670
So I wanted to know a
little bit more about that.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:14.020
You're saying that you're
trying to celebrate

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:16.550
one trait for each woman.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:18.350
What are the criteria?

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:21.710
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: There are a
few criteria that we adopted.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.530
One of them was that
we wanted every girl

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:27.300
to find a piece of
her story in the book.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.180
So we really cared
from the very beginning

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.940
to feature women from
all over the world,

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.790
and from different ages.

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:42.440
And so the book needed
to reflect the diversity

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.020
that women appear in the world.

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.280
If you look at cartoons,
this is not novel.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.470
We've seen it on Facebook
one million times.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.700
But usually the way women
are portrayed, also,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:01.460
in animation is much more
narrow than the way male

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.930
characters are portrayed.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:06.140
So we are led, from
a very young age,

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:10.970
to believe that there is only
one acceptable way of appear

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.780
as a woman, which is certainly
not the case because all of us

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:18.310
are different in this room.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:22.610
And it was important
for us to show

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.820
that women can be very
different from each other

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.610
and very different
from the characters

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:33.020
that we see normally on
TV and on the big screen.

00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:35.780
And another criteria
was that we wanted

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:38.990
to feature women from the
past and for the present.

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.940
We didn't want this
to be just a history

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:44.990
book that was just in
the past because it

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:46.220
mattered to us that--

00:19:49.210 --> 00:19:54.760
one of our goals was to help
people see the rebel girls

00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:00.520
around them, and to
learn how to celebrate

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.100
the women and the
girls in their life,

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:06.910
and to learn that incredible
women are our sisters.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.530
They are our work colleagues.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:09.850
They are our mentors.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:13.720
They are our
teachers, our parents.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.020
And it was very
important to do that

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.620
by mixing past and
present figures.

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.300
And of course, we
wanted to show women

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.360
from the past to show that
women have always been there.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:27.910
We haven't looked at them,
we haven't celebrated them,

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:30.460
we haven't recorded them
in our history books.

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:32.930
But they've always been there.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.880
And the other
criteria was that we

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:42.700
wanted to feature women
with all sorts of careers

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:47.790
to show girls that they
can be anything, really.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:53.650
And we were very
proud when every day

00:20:53.650 --> 00:20:55.450
we received letters
from our readers

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:56.890
from all over the world.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.830
And a few months ago,
we received this letter.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.680
They had a career day
in elementary school.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:05.620
And this girl said
that she wanted

00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:08.110
to be a surgeon
when she grew up.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:11.620
And one of her classmates
said, you are a girl,

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.390
you can't be a surgeon.

00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:15.250
And she didn't take offense.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.190
She was like, you didn't
read "The Good Night Stories

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:24.070
for Rebel Girls", which is
a reaction that hoped that I

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.290
had had during those meetings.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:28.750
It's like, you don't know
what you're talking about.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:29.770
Don't waste my time.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.630
ELENA FAVILLI: That's
an awesome story.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:39.220
So since you're touching
on the reaction of men

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.960
or in general, other gender.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.610
So making better for us
women, for all the genders

00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:51.400
should not be all on the
under-represented gender.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.360
How about titling the next book
"Good Night Stories for Boys

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.840
and Girls About Rebel Girls"?

00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.070
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: That
would be an awful title.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.061
I don't think it
would sell anything.

00:22:05.050 --> 00:22:06.910
Of course, there
is a provocation

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:09.340
in calling the book "Good
Night Stories for Rebel GIrls",

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.700
and it's intentional.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.160
But growing up-- and
I'm sure all of us

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.680
have read plenty of books
where we were not in the title.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:23.650
We were not even
inside the book.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.820
So isn't it ironic that--

00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:29.320
I mean, this is the
feedback that we

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.360
received of people
that are offended

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.370
that boys are not in the title.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:39.160
Isn't it educational to be
passionate about something

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.040
when you're not in the title?

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.210
This is our point.

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:47.080
When we are asked, are you going
to do a "Good Night Stories

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:51.670
for Rebel Boys", we
say no, because this

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:53.260
is the book for boys.

00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:58.090
It's very important to
learn that you cannot be

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:01.870
the protagonist in a situation
and still be involved and still

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:03.160
be supportive.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.870
It's been from the
beginning of history

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:07.720
that we've been supportive
of stories where

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.970
we were not protagonists.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.980
So we are not
asking for the moon.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:16.570
And this is one book.

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.540
Insert curse word in the middle.

00:23:21.397 --> 00:23:23.230
ELENA FAVILLI: How about
"Good Night Stories

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:25.790
About Rebel Girls"?

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:30.280
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: But this book
is not just about rebel girls.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.340
This book is about courage.

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.560
It's about life.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.780
It's not just about girls.

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:44.260
As women, we've been--
you know, female writers

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.930
have always struggled
with this and we still do.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:50.560
When men write a book
about a love story,

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:54.910
they are writing about
love and about life.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:57.760
When a woman writes
about a love story,

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.550
they are writing about their
own personal experience,

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:05.170
and they are writing something
that's very niche and very--

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:09.010
this is nonsense.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:13.930
I mean, why are we denying
women the possibility

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:18.010
to reflect and to make
assumptions about what

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.440
life is also for men?

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:23.260
We've lived all our life
with men making assumptions

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:25.150
of what life is for women.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:32.820
So it's quite time we start
talking about the issues

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.390
that we care about, whether
they are part of our daily life

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:39.390
or whether it's stuff that
we're simply thinking about,

00:24:39.390 --> 00:24:41.730
without having to
justify ourselves

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:47.400
and to hold off because
what if boys get offended.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:51.060
Honestly, who cares?

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:57.090
ELENA FAVILLI: So the
question wasn't too much

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:01.620
about boys getting offended, but
about making sure that actually

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:02.790
boys would read it.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:10.620
It's a big step to
convince somebody

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:14.760
that this is a book also
for boys, which I completely

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.810
agree with.

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.840
So what is the path
that we have to take

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.090
to make sure that we
have this [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.050
with the other gender?

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:23.425
And what is the
path that we have

00:25:23.425 --> 00:25:28.380
to take to make sure that boys
actually do read the book?

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.240
FRANCESCA CAVALLO:
Well, first of all,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.230
I want to say that many boys
are already reading this book.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.630
So there are so many
parents around the world

00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:40.710
that are buying this book
also when they just have boys.

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:43.470
And they love it, because
this is more of a thing

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.080
that grownups think,
that they are not

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:49.560
going to be into it because
it's called "Good Night

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.570
Stories for Rebel
Girls", but actually this

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:53.440
is a book of great stories.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.580
So when they are
exposed to it, they just

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.670
love the stories just as
much as we love the stories

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.490
when we grew up.

00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:07.110
So that's a very
important thing.

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.320
There is something that
happened to me last year.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.460
I have a friend who is very
passionate about gender

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.730
equality, and she
had a daughter.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:22.740
And so when I bought
clothes for her daughter,

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:27.180
I shopped in the
boy aisle as much

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.670
as I did in the girl aisle.

00:26:29.670 --> 00:26:36.330
And one year ago she had a boy.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:41.090
So there I was, a gay
shopping for her son.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:47.280
And I'm ashamed to say I
couldn't bring myself to shop

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:51.030
for a boy from the girls aisle.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.150
This is a problem
because it means

00:26:54.150 --> 00:27:00.270
that as much as I like to think
that I'm awake to these issues,

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:03.270
I still have so much
internalized misogyny

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:07.200
that I felt it would
diminish the value of her boy

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.010
if I shopped for him
in the girls aisle.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:14.040
This is the problem
that we are talking

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.680
about when we are
afraid of buying

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.020
a book like this for boys.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.950
And there is no easy solution.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:25.440
We need to realize that this is
the world that we grew up in,

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:28.140
and that this is part
of what we think when

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:30.030
we think about
ourselves and when

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.190
we think about our daughters.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.470
And we have to hold ourselves
to a higher standard.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:41.430
It's going to be uncomfortable
because oppression

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:46.860
and the patriarchy is so deep,
it runs so deep in our veins

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.400
that it's going to be
uncomfortable to get over

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.670
all these automatic
assumptions that we make

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.510
and all these automatic
choices that we make every day.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.600
But this is the
battle of our time,

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.900
and we need to be to hold
ourselves responsible

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.950
and to have the courage
to do what's uncomfortable

00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:09.510
because freedom is at stake.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:14.150
ELENA FAVILLI: Thank you.

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:15.950
If you would have
had a book like this

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.846
to read when you
were a child, how

00:28:18.846 --> 00:28:20.720
do you think it would
have changed your life?

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:26.660
FRANCESCA CAVALLO:
I hope it would

00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:30.990
have made me shop
in the girl aisle

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:34.200
without thinking about it.

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.080
ELENA FAVILLI: That's good.

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.100
This book is amazing.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.190
It's been translated
in so many languages,

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:46.410
so there's demand for
it in the entire world.

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:51.120
Is it just the result of demand,
or you had vision behind this?

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.670
Did you want to translate it
in all the language upfront,

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:55.230
or did you get requests for it?

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.496
How did that happen?

00:28:56.496 --> 00:28:57.870
FRANCESCA CAVALLO:
Well, it's not

00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:59.640
like you want to
translate something

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.152
in 45 languages a
book, and you do it.

00:29:03.152 --> 00:29:04.485
ELENA FAVILLI: Right, of course.

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:13.570
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: To be
honest, in our wildest dreams--

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:16.710
that are pretty wild,
I can assure you--

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:23.290
we would have never imagined to
have, between the both of them,

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:27.690
we sold almost three million
copies worldwide to date.

00:29:27.690 --> 00:29:31.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:35.040
So we would have never
imagined that the book was

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:40.140
going to be so successful.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:45.810
And the thought of families
around the world ending

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:52.500
their day reading these stories
in so many different languages

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.230
really moves me.

00:29:55.230 --> 00:29:57.210
It's something that--

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:05.730
I don't know, it's so powerful
that we could have never

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.260
imagined something like this.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:15.480
ELENA FAVILLI: So you told
us one story about a girl who

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.630
had read your book.

00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:20.010
Do you have any other
interesting stories?

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:23.760
I'm sure people reach
out to you all the time.

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:27.180
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: Yes, they
do, and it's interesting

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:33.910
how the range of people that are
reading this book is so wide.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:41.490
Another letters that really
hit me was from a guy--

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.560
I think he was in his 20s--

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:49.040
and he was going through rehab.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:54.510
He was an heroin
addict going through m

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:57.690
and he told us that
he had found strength

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:01.330
in these stories in that path.

00:31:01.330 --> 00:31:07.650
So it was very moving
for us because it's

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:12.750
like our readers are giving us
that feedback that these are

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:16.860
not just stories about
girls, because otherwise it

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.260
wouldn't happen that so
many people around the world

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.860
are identifying
with these people.

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.530
But one thing matters
about the fact

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:30.030
that these are all women,
that telling their stories

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:34.980
enables us to speak about
things that have not

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.110
been spoken about before.

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:40.470
When you are in the line of
work that you are a writer

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:42.960
and that you work on
stories, many people

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.100
like to say that all stories
have been told already.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.460
And this couldn't be
farther from the truth

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.370
because there are so
many of our stories that

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:54.840
haven't been told yet.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.300
We haven't heard any of it.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:02.730
And stories are so important
in shaping a person's identity.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:09.090
When we think about our
life, we tell ourselves

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:12.180
the story of our life.

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.620
We make it into stories.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:19.380
We divide it, we create causes
and effects and consequences,

00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:22.260
and we identify pivotal moments.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:23.430
But that's just--

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:24.810
I mean, it's not like life.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:32.070
It's that life can be also seen
as a chain of random events.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.030
And then it's us.

00:32:33.030 --> 00:32:35.280
We put order in those stories.

00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.320
And the fact that women
have been deprived

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.090
by the possibility
of being exposed

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:42.180
to the stories of other women
with similar experiences

00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:46.050
means that the story that
we are telling ourselves

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:49.420
about our life is lacking.

00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:52.950
We have a lot of holes that
we don't know how to fill yet

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:55.860
and that have been filled
with the perspective

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.740
that men have on
our stories, even

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.420
if they don't have
a clue of what

00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:03.630
it's like to go through
this world as a woman.

00:33:03.630 --> 00:33:08.040
So we hope that these
stories help girls fill up

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.420
those holes with a perspective
that is their own so

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.700
that empowering
people, more people,

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.810
to own the story of
their life and is

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:21.390
empowering them to choose
what their future is

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:23.040
going to be like.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:26.340
And this is the
reason why we are

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.500
so passionate about
telling these stories

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:33.450
and uncovering new
stories, and tapping

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:36.930
into the huge community of
readers that we now have

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:41.300
and asking them to help us find
new stories because we can't

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.400
possibly think
that we can access

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.260
all the relevant
stories in the world

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.670
just by virtue of being us.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:54.540
ELENA FAVILLI: I wanted to open
to questions from the public,

00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.050
if there are any.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:59.594
That's our microphone.

00:33:59.594 --> 00:34:00.760
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:01.080
Hi.

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.140
Thanks for coming today.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.390
It's been really great
hearing you talk.

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:08.699
My question for you is you
mentioned that you include in

00:34:08.699 --> 00:34:11.550
your book women from the
present, which is really

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:14.650
important, as you pointed out.

00:34:14.650 --> 00:34:16.770
When you write about them,
how do you figure out

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:18.480
which women to choose?

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:23.580
And are you planning on a volume
three and accepting submissions

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.590
for--

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:27.340
not me-- I mean,
obviously Marcia,

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:33.300
but I know a lot
of great women that

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.949
deserve to be potentially called
out in this kind of story.

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:39.989
How do you find the people?

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:43.500
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: It's a mix
of historic and journalistic

00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:44.250
research.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:48.989
And also we receive a
constant influx of names.

00:34:48.989 --> 00:34:54.040
And what we do is
we write them down.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.630
And then we go through this
list, and we research them.

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:01.650
And we start putting
the ones that

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:06.960
seem to have stories that
we are drawn towards,

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.950
we drag them to the top of the
list, and then we start again.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:10.950
And then we start again.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:12.690
It's a long process, research.

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:16.860
We always start from research
when working on our books.

00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:25.320
And we end up at some point
with a list of roughly 150 women

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:29.970
that we've compiled quite
an extensive research about.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:33.960
And then we try to
balance the book

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:40.020
so that it has enough
diversity, and also

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:44.490
that we look for stories that
can allow us to touch on themes

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.610
that maybe have not
emerged in other stories,

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:52.000
or that allow us to talk about
professions that we haven't

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.150
talked about yet in the other
books or in other stories.

00:35:57.150 --> 00:36:01.840
And little by little, the
book starts to appear.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:06.180
AUDIENCE: So do you have to
send the copies to the people

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.840
that you're writing about,
since they're actually alive?

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.480
FRANCESCA CAVALLO:
We don't have to,

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:19.410
but we like to because of
course, part of our work

00:36:19.410 --> 00:36:22.470
is to--

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:24.990
all the people working on
the book-- the researcher,

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:29.850
of course us, the writers, the
editors, the illustrators--

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:31.560
we are all women.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.250
And we like to reach
out to the women

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:38.670
that we write about
because this is also a way

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:40.470
to connect with each other.

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:42.180
We connect with the
artist and the artist

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.670
connect with each other.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:47.850
And so from the very
beginning, we've

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:55.620
seen this book as a platform
to elevate women's talent.

00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:02.610
And we're very proud of the
fact that something weird

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:05.070
happened after the first book.

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:08.930
Some people started to
write to us to tell us,

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:12.240
discovered the amazing story
of this woman in your book.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.100
And of course, in
many cases, the story

00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:17.280
that they were talking about
was actually in the book.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.070
But there were
also a lot of cases

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:21.840
where they were
telling us I discovered

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.330
the story of this
woman in your book,

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.270
and we're like, I don't
think we wrote about it.

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.010
So at the beginning we
were quite confused.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:35.970
But then what happened was
that basically the book

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:40.770
was like giving
people the ability

00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:44.370
to see stories that
they didn't see before,

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:47.070
to see talent in
people where they

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.050
didn't look for talent before.

00:37:49.050 --> 00:37:52.770
And this is incredibly powerful.

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:56.220
And we're very, very
proud about that.

00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:59.820
So when people write
to us with names,

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:01.890
we always take
note because that's

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:05.580
part of the miracle that is
happening around this book.

00:38:09.115 --> 00:38:11.490
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming
and giving this presentation.

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:14.730
It's really great to
hear directly from you.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:18.247
My question is are you
working on book number three?

00:38:18.247 --> 00:38:19.330
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: We are.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:22.530
Yes, we are.

00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:28.200
I don't know if you
know this, but we also

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:33.030
launched a podcast which has
the same title as the book.

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:39.930
And in that case, each episode
is an extended version of one

00:38:39.930 --> 00:38:43.830
of the stories contained
in Book One or Book Two.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:49.800
And we asked different
women to read

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.980
the episodes of the podcast.

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:56.550
We had Poorna Jagannathan
and from "The Night Of".

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.980
We had Melinda Gates.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.545
Today we released Freida Kahlo
read by Pamela Adlon of "Better

00:39:02.545 --> 00:39:03.045
Things".

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:08.700
We had Allison Mosshart,
the singer of The Kills.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:12.270
And in that case,
we asked ourselves

00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.810
what is going to be the
equivalent of the illustrations

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:17.250
in an audio production?

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.380
And it was voice, of course.

00:39:19.380 --> 00:39:24.330
So it was very important
for us to use the podcast

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:27.240
as a platform to
elevate women's voices

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:31.630
because we are not used
to the female voice.

00:39:31.630 --> 00:39:35.370
And when we look at
the impact that this

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:39.420
has on the general population
during elections, for example,

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:46.180
that is very annoying
and dangerous.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:48.780
So in that case, it's
been very important

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:53.340
for us to feature a
variety of female voices

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:54.450
that tell these stories.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:59.580
And we're very, very
proud of that, too.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:06.810
So if you haven't listened
to it, check it out.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:09.990
AUDIENCE: My question is
sort of following up on that.

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.920
You've done two books.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:12.128
You have another in the work.

00:40:12.128 --> 00:40:14.280
You're doing audio books.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.840
What's next?

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.850
Is it all just female
empowerment and rebel girls?

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.650
Is there some other
area that you're

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:26.622
going to try to shine some
light on and bring attention to?

00:40:26.622 --> 00:40:28.080
Are there other
media that you're--

00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:29.621
FRANCESCA CAVALLO:
Female empowerment

00:40:29.621 --> 00:40:31.350
is a large enough
issue for my life.

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:45.850
I grew up as a liberal woman
in Italy, as I mentioned.

00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:49.560
And I always read
liberal newspapers.

00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:55.980
And at one point, I realized
that I had spent all my 20s

00:40:55.980 --> 00:41:00.360
thinking that all the
important problems were

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:04.320
like in the economy
and health care.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:08.340
And then when all of
those important problems

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:13.420
would be solved, we could
possibly tackle women's rights.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.070
And for a very long time.

00:41:15.070 --> 00:41:18.000
I thought that was true.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.880
Then I was like, how
could I be so blind?

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:30.630
How can I consider this an
issue of secondary importance?

00:41:30.630 --> 00:41:36.380
So I think it's very important
that we own the fact that this

00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:39.470
is a central part,
and that we do not

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:46.670
vote for people who consider
this like an afterthought.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.530
We are half of the world.

00:41:48.530 --> 00:41:52.370
So if half of the world
is being held back,

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:57.920
that is a pretty big problem
for these communities

00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.630
that we are part of.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:02.780
Imagine what amazing
things will be

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:04.760
accomplished when
half of the world

00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:09.690
will cease to be held back.

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:13.550
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.810
AUDIENCE: I just want to add
to that, that at Google, we

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:21.140
struggle with this all the
time because there's obviously

00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.520
a lower percentage.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:27.770
It's not 50% of the engineers
at Google that are female.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:29.250
That's not even close.

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:32.390
I think it's more like 20%.

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:36.320
And that's something that people
in Google take very seriously,

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.780
and they're always
trying to change that.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.340
And the way they
try to change that

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:45.290
is by making sure that we
are open to hiring women

00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:46.370
when we're interviewing.

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:49.070
But we're not hiring them
just because they're women.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:51.320
We're hiring them because
they are able women.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.400
But the problem is that the pool
of women that they come from

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:58.820
is also small because the number
of women who were graduated

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.890
from college with a degree
that would help them

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:04.710
in computer science later on
is a small percentage as well.

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:06.920
So the problem comes
earlier in life.

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:09.420
And this is what I've argued
with people for a long time.

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:11.540
You can't just
increase the percentage

00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:14.030
of women in
engineering at Google

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:16.467
without fixing the
problem before that,

00:43:16.467 --> 00:43:18.050
without fixing it
before they even get

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:20.900
to college, without fixing it
when they're children, when

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.437
they're young and they're
trying to figure out

00:43:23.437 --> 00:43:25.270
what it is that I want
to do when I grow up.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:28.190
And this is a perfect solution
to that because this is--

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:29.690
I never had this
problem growing up.

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:31.910
I have three older
sisters and a mom

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:35.480
who are all very,
very strong-willed

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:38.830
and difficult people.

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:42.320
And so when I wanted
to go into computers,

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:45.020
there was never any question,
but I think for a lot of girls,

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:45.860
there is a question.

00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.860
They're like, I don't know,
is that too masculine?

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:50.960
Is that something
that maybe I shouldn't

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:54.500
be doing because no guy will be
attracted to me because now I

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.670
am a nerd?

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.880
It's a difficult
problem, and it's

00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:01.910
nice to see that you're
addressing that sort of issue

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:06.410
across all these STEM fields,
I imagine, not just STEM,

00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:07.330
but anything, right?

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:08.206
Like even literature.

00:44:08.206 --> 00:44:09.205
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: Yeah.

00:44:09.205 --> 00:44:10.490
And it's also a matter--

00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:14.330
I don't believe,
necessarily, in the way we

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:18.890
describe what a scientist is.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:21.380
So I think that a
lot of girls are

00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.970
very passionate about science.

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:26.870
But it's just that the
way we look at science,

00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:32.090
we don't consider their
way of thinking scientific

00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:36.470
unless it meets certain
stereotypes that we

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:37.790
have in our heads.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:40.190
And that is a way
to discourage girls

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:42.830
from pursuing
scientific careers.

00:44:42.830 --> 00:44:45.980
In other words, I
don't necessarily

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:52.820
buy that we need to just
re-skin male scientist

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:57.560
characters with female
bodies, and that

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:00.880
is going to solve the problem.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.590
In children's media
I see a lot of that.

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:06.440
I think it's more of a
matter of reframing what

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:09.680
having a scientific mind is.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:15.010
I'm sure you all
have experiences.

00:45:15.010 --> 00:45:17.210
Well, I don't have a husband.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:21.440
But I have the experience
of my mother and my father.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.560
And my mom is way more
scientific than my dad

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.610
in tackling problems
of everyday life.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:30.380
But it's just that
we are not used

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:35.180
to recognize a certain structure
in the way of solving problems,

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:37.400
unless it's applied
to computers,

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.200
as having a scientific mind.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.820
So for example,
one of the stories,

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:47.750
we met some of the women that
we featured in our books.

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:52.070
And last spring we
were on tour in the UK

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:56.240
and we met Mary Moore,
who is in the second book.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:46:00.890
And she's a professional
ballerina and a quantum

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:03.530
physicist.

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:06.680
If you think about
that, normally we

00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.440
tend, especially in
the United States,

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:14.170
to encourage people to choose
one field and one field only,

00:46:14.170 --> 00:46:19.890
and to become the expert of
whatever field you picked.

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:23.000
In her case, she fought
because she loved to dance.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:29.710
And she was like, I understand
physics better when I dance.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:36.880
So that's the kind of thing that
can help us attract more women.

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:39.340
And it's not like attracting
women to the STEM fields

00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:45.310
as if the STEM fields were a
place that was made for men.

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:50.860
And it's more redefining
what we think about science

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:54.730
and what we think when we think
about having a scientific mind.

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:59.490
That is, I think, solving
the problem at the very root.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:47:07.530 --> 00:47:09.282
So now that you're
talking about this,

00:47:09.282 --> 00:47:11.490
have you ever thought about--
because you are a great

00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:16.350
storyteller, and you reframe
things so that normal people

00:47:16.350 --> 00:47:20.370
could also see themselves in
the shoes of a great scientist,

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.800
or that isn't in the exact
field it's supposed to be in--

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:25.410
have you thought about
creating a template so

00:47:25.410 --> 00:47:30.749
that a mom or an aunt, or the
everyday life mom that maybe

00:47:30.749 --> 00:47:32.790
won't be able to be captured
in this amazing book

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:36.852
because you're looking for
bigger role models, perhaps--

00:47:36.852 --> 00:47:38.310
so that they can
do it on their day

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:40.930
to day, too, so that their
children can be inspired?

00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:46.900
So something like a quick
framework, a template, perhaps,

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.180
so that they can--

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:50.350
so I have a daughter.

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:52.960
The joke was I have a
daughter and two boys.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.805
But my two boys are
two and four years old

00:47:54.805 --> 00:47:56.020
and my daughter is six.

00:47:56.020 --> 00:47:58.270
So I'm overcompensating
on girl books.

00:47:58.270 --> 00:47:59.700
And so my kids,
my boys, are like,

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.360
I don't know anything else.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.110
It's really funny.

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:05.620
I'm like, they don't even know
that it's the other way around

00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:06.611
in the real world.

00:48:06.611 --> 00:48:08.610
But I was wondering if
there's any chance at all

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:10.359
that you would think
of creating something

00:48:10.359 --> 00:48:15.120
so that our sons, or even girls,
could see their moms reflected

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:16.162
there, too.

00:48:16.162 --> 00:48:18.120
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: You
mean a platform for user

00:48:18.120 --> 00:48:19.550
generated content?

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:22.070
AUDIENCE: I mean, without
having to put it in somewhere.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:24.060
But at least for them to
tell their own stories

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:25.518
in a way that makes
sense because I

00:48:25.518 --> 00:48:28.350
think it's the framework
that is difficult for them

00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:31.170
to bring it to life in a way
that makes sense for them.

00:48:31.170 --> 00:48:35.420
FRANCESCA CAVALLO: I'm
not particularly drawn

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.848
towards platforms.

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.620
So I understand.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:44.860
I mean, you work at Google.

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:49.350
So that's the way you--

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:50.300
yeah.

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.580
You want to templatize things.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:57.400
And I chose a line of work where
I can stay away from templates

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.320
as much as possible.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:07.590
So I would hope that reading
these stories will inspire

00:49:07.590 --> 00:49:13.500
your kids when they see
their moms going to work,

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:17.760
because one thing that I
cannot stand when I see movies.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.040
Whenever you see
working moms, it's

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:25.470
always like their kids are
neglected and they are--

00:49:25.470 --> 00:49:26.940
I hate that.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.120
And so part of the
reason why we wanted

00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.880
to celebrate the work
of women in the book

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:38.280
is that we wanted to
offer kids a framework

00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:40.380
to read the work
of their mothers

00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:43.080
with a different
set of expectations.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:46.830
And there was
something very touching

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:51.390
that happened during one of
our presentations in Milan.

00:49:51.390 --> 00:49:54.750
We were in this
bookstore, and it was

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.550
filled to the brim with people.

00:49:56.550 --> 00:50:00.150
And so we let the kids
come and sit in the front

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:02.040
so that they could see.

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.770
Immediately before the
beginning of the presentation,

00:50:04.770 --> 00:50:12.610
one of them opened the
book on the first page,

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:15.300
which is Ada Lovelace.

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:21.310
And he turned to the audience
and said, my mom did this.

00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:24.180
He was the son of
the illustrator

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:26.610
who created this portrait.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:31.800
And to see him standing so
proud of his mother's work

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:40.352
in front of all of the
people was very meaningful.

00:50:40.352 --> 00:50:41.185
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:48.650
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:55.190
I relate to a lot of the
stories in my own way,

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:57.170
and I really love it.

00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:59.240
And actually I get
this book and give it

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.840
to any female friend of
mine that has a daughter now

00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:04.880
as just a present.

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:08.810
I think it's the best
present that they can get.

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:10.820
But also, as someone that--

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:14.600
I'm in science and just
climbing up the ladder

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.920
and trying very hard--

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.580
I always wonder and
who is the rebel?

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:21.380
Am I a rebel?

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.170
Or am I normal?

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:30.440
Do we want our girls to think
of themselves, eventually,

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:34.610
that this is the normal,
to be equal to men

00:51:34.610 --> 00:51:38.510
and to be getting
the same education,

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:42.400
the same opportunity
should be the norm.

00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.970
And we are working toward
that to make it normalized,

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:47.670
not giving it the name.

00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:52.190
For example, we tend
to name girls bossy

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:56.930
if they are just a good leader,
or they want to be a leader

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:58.280
or they're working on that.

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:04.010
Or we call even people feminist
when feminism is really

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:06.830
believing in equality
of men and women.

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:10.880
And in no other category we
name people that are just

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:12.950
believe in equality a name.

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:17.220
That's just, to me-- is like,
well, isn't the ideal world

00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:21.920
that we want to be normal,
the normal means to be equal,

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:26.240
and every part of the
society gets its fair share

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.170
of success and progress.

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:31.730
So because you are
working on this,

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:36.330
and this is such a valuable and
progressive work, and every day

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:38.960
you probably meet
so many people,

00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:41.780
and so many ideas rush
through you, and so on.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:47.870
Do you see, in the future,
that this work kind of moves

00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:55.400
toward introducing the
education and women in STEM

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.870
as normal and not rebel?

00:52:57.870 --> 00:53:01.401
Do you know what I'm--

00:53:01.401 --> 00:53:02.900
FRANCESCA CAVALLO:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:03.500
Sure.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:05.101
AUDIENCE: Have you
touched that idea?

00:53:05.101 --> 00:53:06.600
FRANCESCA CAVALLO:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.540
I think that's a great question.

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:14.400
And of course we are
doing all this work

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.980
so that in the future,
people will take this book

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:23.390
and be like, why rebel?

00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:26.000
The point is that
we're not there yet,

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.330
and that for so many
women around the world,

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:33.080
being rebels is
not a matter of--

00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:35.480
it's not something
they can choose,

00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:41.690
or it's not a matter of
having their tongue pierced.

00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:44.480
It's a matter of
survival because we

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:49.105
have so many expectations
and such subtle--

00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:58.820
not subtle, but so many
strong, invisible laws

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:07.100
around us that we need to be
rebels in order to survive,

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:12.330
in many cases, and to
thrive, in most cases.

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:16.610
We need to be rebels to leave
an abusive relationship.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:21.350
We need to be rebels to
choose to go to school when

00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:27.240
the Taliban try to
close the school for us.

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:34.430
And if you look at this
from a global perspective,

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:38.240
rebellion is very much needed.

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:45.780
And when you think about rebel
boys, it's like the image

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:51.180
that forms in your mind is just
a very dynamic kind of person,

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.950
young man.

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:54.890
When you think
about rebel girls,

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:58.760
at least up until our
book came about, usually

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:03.170
rebel girls don't end up well.

00:55:03.170 --> 00:55:06.920
The image that
forms in your head

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.920
when you think of a
rebel girl is the image

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:17.000
of a woman that does not have
a bright future ahead of her.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.050
And we wanted to change that,
because to defy society's

00:55:21.050 --> 00:55:29.510
expectations is the first step
to gain a freedom that everyone

00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:30.350
tries--

00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:32.900
not everyone, but most people--

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:35.790
try to deny us every
step of the way.

00:55:39.678 --> 00:55:42.577
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:42.577 --> 00:55:44.910
ELENA FAVILLI: I want to thank
you very much, Francesca,

00:55:44.910 --> 00:55:47.460
for being here with us
today, and for being

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:50.250
so inspiring with your
stories and with your books.

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.100
Thanks again.
