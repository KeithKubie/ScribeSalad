Congress in Washington, D.C.

[ Pause ]

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.970
&gt;&gt; Pamela Jackson:
Wow, this is exciting.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.470
So good morning.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.100
I'm Pam Jackson.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.410
I am the Director for the Library
of Congress Center for the Book,

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.470
and I'd like to welcome
you here this morning,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.730
and thank you very
much for being here.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.510
Welcome you to The
Library of Congress

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.070
and to the Coolidge Auditorium,
and I'd like to welcome the staff

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.270
and leadership of the National
Campaign to Stop Violence.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.530
I'd like to welcome the students,
the parents, the guardians,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.790
educators, leaders, Department
of Education officials,

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.000
Foundation officials
that support the program,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.670
Do the Write Thing,
Challenge program.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.770
To my Library of Congress
colleagues I thank you

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.180
for your presence here, as well.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.720
It's an honor to have you all here

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.690
and it's a privilege
to be in your midst.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.130
It's a part of our vision here
at The Library of Congress

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.240
that we are the chief steward of
the record of knowledge for America

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.970
and for the world, thus, creating
a springboard to the future.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.700
And the future that I hope to see
is one of compassion and courage,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.520
one of industry and innovation,
one of remarkable accomplishment

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.020
and achievement, one
of peace and harmony.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.860
A part of the Library's
central mission is

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.950
to provide the American people with
a rich diverse and enduring source

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.810
of knowledge that can be relied
upon to inform, inspire and engage,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.120
and to support intellectual
and creative endeavors.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.280
The future I want to live in is one
where societies thrive and flourish

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.480
because we live in
caring communities,

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.520
strong, educated, empowered.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.530
We live as individuals contributing
to one another's intellectual

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.880
and creative endeavors consistent
with the Library's mission,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.840
a future where we care
about each other's success

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.210
and growth and development.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.680
The future I want is
one in which each of us,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.360
every one of us values
human life, honors it,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.850
respects it, cherishes it.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.030
And I'm clear today, we're
here today in this room

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.620
because that future has yet to
be fully and completely realized.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.280
We're here today in
this room because some

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.650
of us have been hurt and harmed.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.830
Others of us have suffered
and been helpless or silent.

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.790
Still others have been the
source of hate and injury.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:07.110
It may be you or the person next
to you, but really it's all of us.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.510
You all, in particular
the authors of the letters

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.850
in this fabulous program and
book, have my deepest appreciation

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.910
for your strength and
for your courage.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.700
I'm grateful you're here to share
your stories, to add your writings

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.700
to the collections of the
Library and to promote peace.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.250
The Library of Congress
Center for the Book,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.310
which does include the Young
Reader Center and the Poetry

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.570
and Literature Center promotes
books and libraries, literacy

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.140
and reading, poetry and literature.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.750
And we do so because we know
they are the source and the fuel

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.060
for informed and engaged societies
and communities, and we also do

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.750
so because we know they are
the absolute best weapons

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.350
against intolerance
and against ignorance.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.510
The Center for the Book was
established by Public Law in 1977

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.570 position:56%
and incorporates several
public-private partnerships designed

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.620
to implement programs and awards,
such as this one, and we are part

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.230 position:56%
of the National and International
Outreach Division within The Library

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.030
of Congress so it's our mission
to nurture and empower the network

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.110
of organizations with whom we
partner to strengthen our capacity

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.140
to serve communities and to
provide the broadest access

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.570
to the vast diverse
and rich collections

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.360
of The Library of Congress.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.060 position:56%
We are proud and completely thrilled

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.910
to count the Do the
Write Thing program

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.060
as our partner and our friend.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.980
And it's clear from my
reading of these letters

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.920
that we can win the battle against
hate and violence and intolerance

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:56.620
because of who you are, your
willingness to shine brightly

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.280
and be your best self,
and your willingness

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.320
to forgive and have compassion.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.700
So I'm profoundly convinced that
the future that I said I wanted,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.610
that will be, because
you're here today.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.510
Thank you for being here.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.850
Now please join me in giving a
very warm welcome to Dan Callister,

Chairman of the National Campaign
to Stop Violence, Chairman

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.790
and its Founder I just learned.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.090
Thank you so much.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.890
Please welcome Dan.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.370
It's great that you were
willing to let us come here

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.070
and continue our partnership
with the Center for the Book.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.990
I had no idea how eloquent you
are, a very impressive speech.

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:05.700
And I would like to say hello
to an old friend up here.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.290
John, would you just
stand up for one minute?

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.510
John has run the Center
for the Book.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:16.070
[ Applause ]

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.840
And been our host at this
event for many years.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.150
Now he's taken over as Historian
for The Library of Congress,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.100
and we wish you well in
this new position, John.

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.300
Now it's my opportunity to invite
four of our students to read

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.470
from their writings that are

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.640
in our book before we make
the official presentation.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.330
The first one is Stormy
Montez [Assumed Spelling],

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.800
this is an 8th grade
student from Coastal Bend,

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.120
Texas, Fulton Middle School.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.510
Stormy?

00:06:50.510 --> 00:07:08.260
[ Applause ]

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.810
&gt;&gt; Stormy Montez: I
started from my sleep.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.150
I could hear the roaring
boom in my father's voice,

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.230
like a train crashing
down the tracks.

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:22.540
Yelling and hitting, the
screams so loud and vulgar.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:25.640
I can see him hitting my
mom over and over again.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.400
This wasn't the first
time, they often fought.

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:30.200
This time was different,
my mom was hitting back.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.590
My sister and I watched,
crying and scared.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.120
We didn't know what to do.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.680
When my mom and dad saw us we
were told to return to bed.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.170
In the morning my dad was gone.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:43.050
We ended up losing
everything and having to move

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:45.410
because the money had
been spent on drugs.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.900
Sadly, I know my father
abused drugs and was abusive,

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:53.180
yet someday I just
want to say I love you.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:54.980
I wish this was the end
to my miserable story,

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.950
but surely things got worse.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:58.970
I was dreadfully bullied
starting around the third grade,

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:04.190
but began to gain weight and I no
longer looked like the other kids.

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:07.700
It made me a perfect target.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.430
I tried so hard to not
let words get me down.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:17.350
The fact is I felt worse, like
a burden to everyone around me.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.890
I wanted it to finally stop.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.580
I remembered the words
that my grandpa told me,

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.050
looking in my eyes, be strong.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.500
It wasn't long after I
started to bully other kids.

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.380
It was interesting how it happened.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.600
I was finally accepted
by the cool kids,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.150
even though I knew they
weren't my friends,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.110
they just enjoyed watching
me get in trouble.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.420
I felt horrible when I bullied
them because I know how it felt.

00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:44.120
I understand their
pain all too well.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.850
I had to break the circle.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:49.160
I needed to work on
myself and needed help.

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:56.010
It was taking a lot of work,
but I am much stronger now.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:01.020
So why do we behave like this?

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.370
Hurting others, ourselves
feel better,

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:07.640
acting violently by
hitting and injuring?

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:14.310
Honestly, there are
countless causes for violence.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:18.200
Most people do not want
to make poor choices,

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:25.120 position:56%
but we learn from what has been
modeled, be it positive or negative.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.530
Behaviors from violent video games
or movies in order to reduce,

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.750
to prevent acts of violence.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:37.810
We must work and help people
feel safe, cared and supported,

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:43.170 position:56%
also helping and develop healthy
sense of self-esteem and self-worth.

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:46.280
I could have become bitter

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.930
about what I have been
through, but I'm not.

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:50.620
Instead I've learned to forgive

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.330
and I will not be held
hostage by my past.

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.630
My slate is clean.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:59.960
These obstacles have been painful.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.430
Today can show and
use these experiences

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.690
to help the next generation
from being harassed and bullied.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:12.330
Though there may be one
person helping other youth

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.390
to see their value, I
personally challenge each of you

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.510
to break the cycle and help
influence someone for the better.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:37.580

now hear from Brenda Flores.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.400
Brenda is an 8th grader

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:48.510
in Brightwood Education
Campus in Washington, D.C.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:57.900
[ Applause ]

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.610
&gt;&gt; Brenda Flores: Violence
is a word with a big meaning.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.760 position:56%
Most of the people in this world use
violence to resolve their problems.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.360
When I think of the word violence
the first thing that comes

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.350
to my mind is conflict, death,
war, a lot of negative things.

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:18.960
In my opinion it's not necessary to
use violence to resolve a problem.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.900
You can talk and find a
way to solve your problem

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.480
without hurting or killing someone.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.230
Violence has affected my
life because I used to live

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:29.210
in El Salvador, now classified

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.350
as the most dangerous
country in the whole world.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.550 position:56%
I couldn't go to school because I
was scared I'd get killed on my way.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:37.790
I couldn't play outside
because my mom was scared

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.940
that I could get kidnapped.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.360
However, violence has
changed my life in a good way.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.230 position:56%
El Salvador was too dangerous, I had
to immigrate to the United States.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.380
The first day that I got
here I thought it was going

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.310
to be really hard on me because
I didn't speak English and I knew

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.920 position:56%
that everything was going to change.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.790
But now that I know the language
I have more opportunities

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.090
than in El Salvador.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.410
Because of the violence most of our
parents would be working all day

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.740
to give us what we need, but they
don't give us enough time to talk

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.360
to them and say what we feel,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.020
what type of friends we
have, who is around us.

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:19.290
From the age 13 to 19 it's
important to get orientation

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:24.830 position:56%
because at this age we are changing,
we're trying to find who we are.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:28.230
We should know that if
a person does drugs,

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.850
isn't a good person
to be around with us.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:33.510
We can't be friends with
someone that is part of a gang

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:34.810
because at some point they're going

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.220
to tell you you should
join the gang.

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:41.140
If you do this you are going to
get money, you're going to be cool,

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:42.910
everyone is going to respect you.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:46.080
But we don't think that at the
end you're earning problems.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.370
What I can do to reduce youth
violence is try to help.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:53.430
What I mean with this is if I
know someone that is doing drugs

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.270
or is part of a gang or is
thinking to join these things,

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:01.480
to think really good what they
are going to do or they are doing.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.030
Because doing these things
is like a cycle that goes

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:08.310
over and over and never ends.

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.030
And tell them the consequences.

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:13.420
If you do drugs you're going
to feel good at the beginning,

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.870
but a few months later you're
going to get addicted to this.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.020
And if you don't have money
you're going to start stealing

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.870
so you can get money
to buy the drugs.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.090
And at the end it's going
to end up killing you.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:27.150 position:56%
And if you're part of a gang, think,

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.120
your family is going
to be in danger.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.460
Why? Because if you don't obey
them they already know everything

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.440
about you, and if you run away
your family is going to pay for it.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:41.800
My advice is that don't let
people influence you or do things

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:48.540
that you don't want to do
because at the end the one

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:53.510
that is getting more hurt is you.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:56.180
So if you're doing
drugs ask for help,

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.600
and if you're in a gang think what
are you doing, and if you feel

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.980
like you need to talk to someone
talk with your parents or someone

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.050
that is going to tell you
the right thing to do.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:08.520
Because if you keep doing
this at the end you're going

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.920
to get more hurt than what
you're doing right now.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.440
And the consequences are worse

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.510
because in this world what
you do is what you get.

said the first prompt is

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:02.380 position:56%
about how violence has affected my
life, but I'd like to rephrase that,

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:04.580
how hasn't violence
affected my life?

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.200
Violence is everywhere and
affects my friends, my thoughts,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.010
and everyone on this planet.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.310
The definition of violence

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.870
from Miriam Webster is a great
destructive force or energy.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:16.030
This implies that violence
falls into the category

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:18.560
of physical violence
and mental violence.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:21.880
I've been abused mentally
before many times

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.840
and so it's almost made me do
some things I know I'd regret.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.430
I've been called an
idiot, a weakling, a retard

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:30.580
and other names I can't remember.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.210
Usually I don't let
these names get to me,

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:35.460
but sometimes it really
affects the way I think.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:38.390
I know it's stupid that it gets
to me, but I can't help it.

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:41.470
Once I was told I was worthless
and I'd never go anywhere in life.

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:43.090
It really made me think
about suicide.

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.150
I planned to kill myself just

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.250
because some people thought
it'd be delightful to make fun

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:48.800
of my insecurities relentlessly.

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:52.960
I realize now that I was just being
crazy for thinking that would work

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.260
and would be a good solution,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:57.710
but in that moment I really
wanted to end my own life.

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:01.100
I've learned recently that people
can't hurt me with petty insults

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.800 position:56%
and small stupid assaults anymore,
but if they hurt my friends it feels

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.610
as if something has
shoved a knife into my gut.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.430
I wanted to write this
paper because I wanted

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.880
to stop seeing good people getting
hurt because of someone else.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.880
I want to see violence removed
from the face of the earth.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.950
But I believe in something
most people don't,

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:22.540
violence can't be stopped,
it can be weakened.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.800
I know that's not the
answer you're looking for,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.750
but I also know why
it can't be stopped.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:29.600
Human psychology is probably one

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.070 position:56%
of the most fascinating things you
could ever learn about in my opinion

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:36.770
and answers the causes
of violence perfectly.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.950
Humans are social creatures
with complex thinking processes

00:16:39.950 --> 00:16:44.320
and a wide variety of emotions,
but it doesn't take a genius

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.530
to realize we express some
emotions through violence.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.770
Humans become angry when they
perceive something as a threat

00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.170
to their mental or physical health.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.630
It's how we've stayed alive,
if you think about it.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:58.090
Back in the Ice Age we were forced
to kill seal, commit violent acts

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.270
at a very young age if
we wanted to stay alive.

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:05.570
Violence can come from history,
genes and all sorts of things,

00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:08.480
but there are also animal
instincts and respect.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.490
We humans forget that
we were also animals,

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.770
not Godly beings among
other less of all species.

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:18.080
We may fight for territory,
food and other resources

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.810
because even though we're
the most of all species

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:24.650
on the planet we're still just
animals who strive to survive.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.380
We also do have some people
who will fight for respect.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.970
Many children thirst for respect,
and those who don't might pay

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:33.410
with it with a few punches.

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:36.050
Now after all those reasons
why we can't solve violence,

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.390
I'd like to present a few ways
we can lower the amount of it.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:41.730
We could easily do what people
are doing now with our schools

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.730
and education, but
that'll take generations

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.710
of people before it
comes into effect,

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:47.820
which we may not have time for.

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:50.120
I believe that without medicine
we could be more serious

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.090
about teaching why violence is
wrong to the smaller children

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.140
in preschool and kindergarten.

00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:59.360
Children are more impressionable
the younger they are,

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.130
which would make teaching
them not to fight much easier

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.290
than teaching someone my age.

00:18:05.290 --> 00:18:08.840
This would, in turn, make it so
the next generation doesn't fight

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.920
as much, but we'll still
have rule breakers and people

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.740 position:56%
with mental illnesses that will beat
down on people or even kill them.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:19.620
There is no perfect system to end
physical violence, but there can be

00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.290
for mental violence in my opinion.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.370 position:56%
Most children if they want to insult
someone will do it over the internet

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.740
where a victim cannot
retaliate easily.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:32.050
This leads to cyber bullying where
people may post private information

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.980
about the victim, insult the victim

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.730
and even hack the victim's
online accounts to say something

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.620
that they would not normally say.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.810
I say we should make cyber
bullying against the law.

00:18:42.810 --> 00:18:45.500
Both these ideas would
help solve violence.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.180
The problem is that
we can't solve it all.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.900
Violence can't be stopped, but it
can be less common than it is now.

it's a topic that has
haunted America

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:45.090
for the past few years
and is getting worse.

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.400
On the news we constantly hear
about juveniles committing crimes

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.740
so serious they are sent to jail
for a big part of their lives.

more young adults are making choices

that they will regret in the future.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.420
We have become so accustomed
to hearing about youth violence

00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:07.320 position:56%
that we don't stop and ask
ourselves why youth violence occurs?

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:09.360
First, I would like to
talk about a tragedy

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.470
that occurred in my community.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.960
On April 9th, 2014 a
sophomore student ran

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.760
through Franklin Regional
High School

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.610
with knives and stabbed 21 people.

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:22.940
He was subdued by the assistant
principal and a student

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:25.370
and taken into police custody.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.280
Fortunately, nobody died during
the stabbing, but it shocked

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.530
and scared a lot of people.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:34.560
That incident was the closest
I've ever been to youth violence.

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.280
I've seen that in the past
few years security measures

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.380
in public buildings, especially
schools, have been tightened.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.580
More security cameras are put up.

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:46.630
Metal detectors have suddenly
appeared in high schools.

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:49.710
Parents became more protective
and many efforts were put

00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:52.460
into measures to cease
youth violence.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.460
I think the question we should be
asking is not how can we stop youth

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.470
violence, but why does
youth violence occur?

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:03.440
If we know the answer to the
why then we can answer the how.

00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.160
Youth violence occurs
because of many reasons.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.930
In my opinion the biggest
reason is bullying.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:14.240
Nonstop harassment from peers does
a lot of scary things to a child.

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:17.310
Fortunately, a lot of people have
seen the disastrous aftermath

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.620
of bullying and have started
to alert the public about it.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:25.010
When a child is harassed over and
over they start becoming depressed.

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:26.820
Some children are bullied
to the extent

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.120
that they develop psychological
problems that make them do things

00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.160
that they would not do otherwise.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:37.260
Bullying is a big topic that is
a huge cause of youth violence.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:38.790
We have covered why
youth violence occurs

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.520
and now we can discuss
how we can stop it.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.620
The best way to fight youth
violence, in my opinion,

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.400
is to talk with your children.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.080
Parents know their own child best.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.640
Spend five to 10 minutes
each day with your children

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:54.160
and ask them how the
school day went.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:57.610 position:56%
Tell them to inform you if something
isn't right and they need help.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:22:00.270
The connection between parents
and their children will strengthen

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.900 position:56%
over time and will allow them to
feel comfortable discussing violence

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.770
and other related issues.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:10.380
Lastly, parents should monitor what
their children do on technology.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:13.830
Help your child make safe
choices on social media and talk

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.490
to other adults in
your children's lives

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.280
that have a strong impact on them.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.890
Most importantly, if you
see your child supporting

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:25.310
or committing violent acts sit down
and gently explain the consequences

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.950
that youth violence could
bring to their future.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.850
Tell them that you're proud
of his or her accomplishments

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.480
and how youth violence
can harm them.

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.360
Find out what caused your child
to support or commit violent acts.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.520 position:56%
Yelling at them or grounding them
might make them even more determined

00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.650
to lash out at others.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:44.820
I hope that you find
my essay enlightening

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:47.590
on the ever broadening
topic of youth violence.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:50.980
My hope is that using these
strategies less kids are attracted

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.590
to committing violent acts
and more people are informed

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:54.890
about youth violence.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.690
Thank you.

&gt;&gt; Dan Callister: All right,

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.180
I'd like to invite the other
three readers to come up

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:13.430 position:56%
and we'll do the presentation of
the book to The Library of Congress.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:17.060 position:56%
So if the other three could come up?

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.310
Stormy, Wyatt, and where is she?

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:25.440
Yes, okay, Pamela?

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:34.510
Let's go over here.

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:50.040
[ Pause ]

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:55.800
So this is the official version
[inaudible] and she'll put it

00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:02.510
in The Library of Congress.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:25.620
[ Applause ]

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:33.530
Is this one of the
books that got signed?

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:37.470
We also have, Pamela, for you,
this is a collection of the books

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:41.510
and all students have signed it.

00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:54.600
[ Applause ]

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.990
Okay, now we have - go
ahead and take your seats.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.580
Thank you, Pamela.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:08.410
We have a special speaker, a man
who has spoken here in the past,

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:11.420
I think we have counted up
today, four or five times

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:18.240
and has become a good friend of
me, of mine, and of our program.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.360
David Esquith, is sitting
over here to my left,

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.570
represents the Secretary
of Education.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:27.300
If I'm correct, David,
we have a new Secretary

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.770
of Education now, is that right?

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:34.020
And you can talk a little bit about
the new Secretary if you would?

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:38.770
But David has been a public
servant for most of his life,

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:44.250
started life as a lawyer,
decided to give that up

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:49.440
and actually do something
positive and went into Government,

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.170
and has worked in Government
in many capacities.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.580
I forgot to mention when he
was young he was a Peace Corps

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.750
volunteer, which gives
you an idea of the type

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.410
of personality that David has.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:09.170
He has five children, but what he
cares about is people with problems

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:12.220
and trying to find innovative ways

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.280
to help them solve those
problems through the Government.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:21.860
He's one of the people I admire
who have put their entire life

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:25.160
into being a public
servant here in Washington,

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:34.570 position:56%
D.C. And he currently heads the
Office of Safe and Healthy Students.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:40.510 position:56%
So David, representing the Secretary
of Education, will speak to us now.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:48.790
[ Applause ]

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.520
&gt;&gt; David Esquith: Good
morning, and thank you, Dan,

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:52.020
and thanks to all of you.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:56.210
This is one of my favorite events,

00:26:56.210 --> 00:27:00.710
and I've read through
all of the writings.

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:09.480
And every year I'm just
incredibly impressed by the honesty

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:16.030
and the thoughtfulness
and the courage that all

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:22.350
of you have exhibited
engaging in this program.

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:25.890
And I really have a lot of
affection for this program,

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:31.560
I think it surfaces
important issues and just

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.130
as importantly it surfaces
solutions.

00:27:35.130 --> 00:27:41.400
And so I always take a
chance, I prepare a PowerPoint

00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:45.000
and I prepare this
before I do the readings.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.120
It's just I try to get it done
a little bit ahead of time,

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:55.700
and I always worry a little bit
when I read through the book

00:27:55.700 --> 00:28:02.580
that I've missed the mark, that
there are kind of - there's wisdom

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:07.610
in these writings that I've
missed and that when I present

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:11.420
to you I will - there'll
be a certain dissonance

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.030
between what I say and
what you have written.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:18.620
And I hope this year that I've
- what I say is consistent

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:24.230
with what you've written because
I think you have great insight

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:29.420
into the experience of many
kids around the country.

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.590
And so my sincere congratulations
to all of you.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.960
So that's the name
of this presentation.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.260
That's my title.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:43.290
I do want to correct Dan, I'm not
a lawyer, I was never a lawyer.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.550
I was a Special Education
Teacher and very proud of that,

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:51.240
and have worked in
the educational system

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.520 position:56%
at one level or another all my life.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.230
And not only appreciate the
experience that you all have

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:01.950
as students, but I know there are
a number of parents in the audience

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:04.590
and parents go through school, too.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:08.080
Every time they have a
kid they go through K

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:11.510
through 12 again and
again and again.

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:15.140
And I do, I've got five
children and five grandchildren,

00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:20.590
so I've been through kind of
teenage years myself and I'm going

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:22.700
to go through another round.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:27.040
And someone told me once and it
just keeps resonating with me

00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:30.690
that parents are a
sorry lot, you know?

00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:34.240
It's just really hard to be
a good parent all the time.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:42.320
And I know that you all kind of
appreciate the love and dedication

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.480
that you must feel from your
parents, particularly those

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:48.920
who are kind of with
you today on this trip.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.670
So what do I do?

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.040
This is the portfolio of the Office
of Safe and Healthy Students,

00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:00.960
and I put it up there so that you
can get an idea of kind of the not

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.620
so much what my office does, but
the range of issues that kids

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.650
in schools are facing these days.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:13.850
And it is a long list,
it's a complicated list.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:18.480
So we deal with - and bullying and
cyber bullying is a constant theme

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.970
in so many of your writings, but
we also deal with school shootings

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:28.810
and drug abuse, gang
violence, teen dating violence.

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:32.920
My office administers the
Homeless Youth Program,

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.220
as well as the Neglected or
Delinquent Youth Program.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.910
We deal with natural disasters,
hurricanes and tornadoes.

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:46.750
The bottom four are things that
are kind of emerging issues

00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.740
that my office is doing a lot
of work with other agencies,

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:53.020
particularly the FBI, Homeland
Security and the Department

00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:58.420
of Justice, on recruitment of
young people by violent extremists,

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:03.210
sextortion, suicide
and human trafficking.

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:13.730 position:56%
And so I share this list with you to
illustrate just the complex problems

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:19.780
that schools are facing every
day, while at the same time trying

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:23.240
to provide the highest
quality education that they can

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:28.170
to all their students and promote
their academic performance.

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.540
Lots of challenges here.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:35.490 position:56%
And, as I said, I think some of you
in your writings have really touched

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:40.240
on many of the key variables

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:43.360
that will be our path
forward to deal with this.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.360
So how safe are schools?

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.160
And, you know, one of the things
that I - one of the impressions

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:54.340
that you get going through
the writings is that the lives

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:57.950
and the world that you all
experience are very violent

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:05.610
and threatening, and I
certainly kind of recognize

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:09.430
on an individual basis that
that is certainly the case.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.370
But I'm also from the
Department of Education,

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:13.670
so I'm going to inject
a math problem here

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.870
to kind of illustrate my point.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:17.450
So put on your thinking caps

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.700
and listen carefully
to the math problem.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:25.310
A bat and a ball together
cost $1.10.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:29.930
The bat costs $1.00
more than the ball.

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.140
How much does the ball cost?

00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:33.600
Raise your hand if you
think you know the answer.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.400
Yes, ma'am?

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.200
Nice and loud.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.500
&gt;&gt; Ten cents.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.800
&gt;&gt; David Esquith: Ten cents,

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:41.710
that was kind of the
answer I was looking for,

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:43.440
but it's not the right answer.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:50.720
And how many of you
thought it was 10 cents,

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.510
let's have a quick raise of hands?

00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:58.550 position:56%
So a lot of people, and what you
were doing is you were thinking very

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.780
fast, right, you were
thinking very fast.

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:04.820
It seems like the obvious answer, a
bat and a ball together cost $1.10,

00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.270
the bat costs more than the
ball, it's got to be 10 cents,

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:09.990
seems like the obvious answer.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:11.480
But what you didn't do was kind

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.370
of think statistically
through the problem.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:20.340
So does anybody now
have the correct answer?

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.510
Yes, sir?

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:26.470
[ Inaudible ]

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:29.450
&gt;&gt; David Esquith: I think you've
got the right answer in there.

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:33.620
The answer is the ball
costs a nickel

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:38.180
because if the ball costs a nickel
and the bat costs $1.00 more

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:42.010
than the ball then the
bat would cost $1.05

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.860
and together they would
add up to $1.10.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.020
So what's the point?

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:51.700
The point is that despite our
kind of personal experience

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:57.100
in thinking fast we also have
to think statistically and kind

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:00.640
of as you all become
leaders in your communities

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.100
and solve problems you have
to kind of move outside

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:08.930
of your own personal experience
to understand kind of the nature

00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:12.270
and extent of the social
problems that you face

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:14.040
in your community and its schools.

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:21.780
So the answer to how safe are our
schools is that schools are safer

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:24.870
and crime rates are declining.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:33.100
That if you compare 1992 to
2014 we've had an 82% decline

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:39.300
in students experiencing
victimization at schools,

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.450
and that the percentage
of public schools

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:43.910 position:56%
that reported students being bullied

00:34:43.910 --> 00:34:51.030
at least once a week
decreased from 29% to 16%.

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:58.310
This is a graphic display of kind
of the victimization at school

00:34:58.310 --> 00:35:03.860
between 1992 and 2013,
a clear decline.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:08.330
The big takeaway on kind of
schools across the country is

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.390
that schools are safer
than they've ever been.

00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:14.170
It's important to recognize that.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:19.960
At the same time there's important
work that needs to be done.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.880
Here are some examples.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:27.480
25% of middle school students
experience bullying in 2012, 2013,

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.540
so that's one out of
four, that's a lot.

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:36.550
And this is actually the statistic
that is more concerning to me,

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:41.850
50% of those incidents were
not reported to an adult.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:45.480
So you've got one out of four
kids who are experiencing bullying

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:51.050 position:56%
and 50% of those kids did not report
it to an adult, and many of you

00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:55.470
in your essays talk about why
things are not reported to adults.

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:59.500
And I think the primary culprit
and really this falls on adults is

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:03.520
that when you report it, they
didn't do something to take care

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:08.250
of the problem, that adults failed
you and that is something that we,

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:11.630
as adults, have to own up to.

00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:17.180
The other is that you're afraid
that or hoping that it'll go away

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.660
and that if you report it it
will bring attention to the issue

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:24.710
and it'll only make matters worse.

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.710
And I want to say something
about bullying,

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.890
just to kind of give you some
insights, because a number of you

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:31.560
in your essays talk about bullying.

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:34.180
And one of the questions

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.930
that I think you ask yourselves
is why do bullies do this?

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:42.150
Many times in your essays you said
to the person who was bullying you,

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.580
why are you doing this to me?

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:48.440
And a number of you kind of
hit the nail right on the head,

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.350
that we know two things about
kids who bully other kids.

00:36:53.350 --> 00:36:58.160
One is that they're being abused
at home or in their own lives,

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.290
they are victims of abuse.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:08.630
The other is that they are doing
it to gain social status, they are,

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:13.580 position:56%
if you kind of divide kind of the
social hierarchy into thirds they're

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:16.980
at the bottom of that middle third
and they're afraid of falling

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:22.060
into the lower tier, into the
bottom third of their peer group.

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:27.380
They're actually afraid of becoming
the kids who will be bullied.

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:31.970
And so what you see in both cases,
one, they're victims of abuse and,

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.740
two, they're scared kids.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:38.820
And I know that bullies don't come
across as scared, but lots of kids,

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.030
and I'm going to get to
this, lots of kids who engage

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:44.820
in violent behavior are
doing so out of fear.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.640
Even though they act tough and
they're big and bad and they seem

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:52.560
like they're not afraid of
anything, underneath that kind

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:56.500
of veneer is a great deal of fear.

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:03.360
Here's something else that's a
big concern to us in schools,

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:10.210 position:56%
that in 2011-12 10% of public school
teachers reported being threatened

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:15.970
with injury by a student from their
school in the previous 12 months,

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:19.380
and that in the same year 6%

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:23.880
of public school teachers
reported being physically attacked

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.780
by a student from their school
in the previous 12 months.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:33.930
This is a very serious statistic,
that we count on teachers,

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:37.960
teachers are kind of the
lynchpin in the whole system.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:43.480
If one out of 10 has
been threatened and six

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:52.290 position:56%
out of 100 have been attacked how do
we expect teachers to be effective

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:56.280
and comfortable and
engaging with their students?

00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.850
So the takeaway from these
statistics are, number one,

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.310
schools are safer than they've
ever been but, number two,

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:06.680
there's a lot of work
that needs to be done.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:10.410
What's the work that
needs to be done?

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:14.110
And this is a question that I
get all the time as the Director

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:18.170
of the Office of Safe and Healthy
Students I'm often asked what are

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:20.520
the biggest threats
to school safety?

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:23.450
And I want you to kind
of ask yourselves that

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:28.940
and if you have a good idea raise
your hand, take a moment to hear

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.240
from anyone who might be willing

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.020
to identify what they think are the
biggest threats to school safety.

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:42.840
Any of our authors want to take a
chance and take a guess on this,

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.850
or not a guess, what
is your opinion?

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.690
Because this is just my opinion.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:48.990
Nice and loud.

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:50.290
Can you stand up, please?

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:52.090
Nice and loud.

good, good answer.

&gt;&gt; David Esquith: People lashing
out at others by using weapons.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:22.710
Very good answer, and I
think that's certainly true.

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:27.490
What I'm looking for here are
kind of the underlying causes.

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:29.110
What are the underlying causes

00:40:29.110 --> 00:40:31.900
and what are the biggest
threats to school safety?

&gt;&gt; David Esquith: Would
you like to come and work

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:02.610
for the Department of Education?

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:06.900
Because that is a great,
great answer and pretty much

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.680
where I'm going with this, as well.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.980
So thank you.

00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:14.630
Here's what I think are the
biggest threats to school safety

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:18.940
that we face based on what we know.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.930
Loneliness, fear and hopelessness.

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:28.010
When you have students
who are terribly lonely,

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:32.860
who are terribly afraid and, in my
opinion, probably the most powerful

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:39.970 position:56%
of these characteristics, when they
are feeling hopeless they are a risk

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.680
to themselves and to others.

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:47.350
And that in order for us to
kind of get at the behaviors,

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:53.140
kind of the violent behaviors, we
have to get at these experiences

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.560
that these students are having.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:59.130
And so what happens when
students are lonely,

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:02.190
where are we seeing
this kind of manifest?

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:05.350 position:56%
We're seeing it in gang involvement,
people are looking for connections,

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:08.840
they're looking for
those relationships.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.120
We see it in abusive relationships,

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:22.140 position:56%
this is a particularly
significant problem with young girls

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:26.200
who are coming up into middle
school and getting into high school

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.810
and they get involved in
abusive relationships.

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:31.690
And somehow they think
those abusive relationships

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:32.990
when we've studied kind

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.920
of what they're experiencing
they think that's the norm,

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:39.880
they think that being in an abusive
relationship is somehow normal.

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:44.210
They might be seeing it at home or
they don't have any other norms,

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.710
but they are lonely and
looking for that connection,

00:42:47.710 --> 00:42:49.490
that personal connection.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:51.180
We see it in violent extremism.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:54.820
As I said, I've been doing a
lot of work around this lately

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:59.820
and you have young people
who are becoming radicalized,

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:04.030
they're sitting in front of
their - on their computer

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:08.370
and they are getting picked
up by these predators who are

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:12.620
out there looking to offer them
something that doesn't exist,

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:14.630
but it gives them a
connection with something.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:17.170
And human trafficking is the
same thing, and when I talk

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:19.660
about human trafficking
what we're experiencing

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.750
in schools particularly are
young girls being recruited

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:28.760
into prostitution by gangs,
which is a significant problem

00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:30.830
in virtually every
part of the country.

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:34.460
So these are some of
the kind of the traps

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.730
that people can fall
into if they are lonely.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:45.220
Fear, many of you kind of talked
about some kind of concepts

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:48.920
and principles in school
psychology and you may be familiar

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:53.650
with this idea that when you
are afraid you experience kind

00:43:53.650 --> 00:43:56.750
of one of two emotions.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:01.930
You experience either fight
or flight, you're afraid

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:09.570
and your reaction is to get in a
kind of an aggressive mood to fight

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:15.510
with kind of the person or
persons who is scaring you,

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:20.140
or there's flight, you leave,
you run away, and those are kind

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:24.910
of the two basic responses to fear.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:26.310
So what do we see in fight?

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:30.470
And this gets back to the point I
was making before about bullying.

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:34.240 position:56%
You have bullying and cyber bullying
and you have school shootings.

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:40.190
What we know about so many active
shooter situations is that,

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:44.170
number one, it is kind of an
act of suicide and, number two,

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:48.600
these are individuals who have been
living with a great deal of kind

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.390
of fear and alienation
their entire lives.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:55.940
And then there's flight,
we have runaways

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:57.980
and drug abuse and dropouts.

00:44:57.980 --> 00:45:01.460
And the Department has
done a study of absenteeism

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:05.060
and it's kids avoiding school,
sometimes they avoid school

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.570
because they're afraid
to go to school

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:10.740
and losing out on their education.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.590
So you've got kind of that
second characteristic.

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:15.490
And then third is hopelessness,

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:17.940
and as I said this I
just my personal opinion

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:22.890
but I think it is kind of the most
powerful and destructive emotion,

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:27.050
that if you have someone who
is feeling genuinely hopeless

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:35.260
and that is a kind of stark
reality they are prone to suicide

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:37.680
or drug abuse or again kind

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.450
of dropping out, just
kind of giving up.

00:45:40.450 --> 00:45:46.830
Young people giving up on their
education is just kind of a shame

00:45:46.830 --> 00:45:51.220
and a pity that with their
whole future in front

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:56.270
of them they don't see any
future and they drop out.

00:45:56.270 --> 00:46:01.310
So how do we combat loneliness,
fear and hopelessness?

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:09.130
I have two girls, Sally and
Daisy, who are 10 years old.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:13.680
And I think it was this year,
kind of the end of the year,

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.450
I was just curious and
I said to Sally, Sally,

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:20.140
who is your favorite teacher of
all the teachers that you've had

00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:24.360
from kindergarten through
fourth grade?

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:28.680
And she responded like
that, she said Ms. Jones,

00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.160
Ms. Jones is my favorite
teacher by far.

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:36.310
And I asked her why, what
was it about Ms. Jones?

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:43.410
And what she said was that Ms.
Jones believes in everyone,

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:47.090
which is really a very,
very profound statement.

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:52.280
I mean this idea of believing in
everyone, of a teacher believing

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.280
in everyone in that classroom, that
they all have something positive

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.520
to say, they all have a
contribution they could make.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:06.430
And from the top of the school
roster down to the bottom

00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:08.150
of it, that was Ms. Jones.

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:10.560
And Sally knew it and Sally
kind of falls, you know,

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:13.890
she's not at the top and
she's not at the bottom,

00:47:13.890 --> 00:47:18.160
but she knew that Ms. Jones
believed in everyone in that class

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.780
and for her that was kind

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:24.710
of the highest compliment
you could make to a teacher.

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:27.690
So how do we do this?

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:32.110
There's a person who I admire,
and if any of you have a chance

00:47:32.110 --> 00:47:34.890
to read any of his work or
follow anything he does,

00:47:34.890 --> 00:47:36.880
called Brian Stevenson
[Assumed Spelling],

00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:38.500
whose name is Brian Stevenson.

00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:43.210
And one of the things that Brian
does, he's a lawyer so I'm going

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:46.490
to say a good thing
about a lawyer here, Dan.

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:50.150
And he defends people
who are on death row

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:55.950
and is a death penalty opponent
because statistics prove

00:47:55.950 --> 00:48:00.010
that it's not a matter of kind of
whether it's the right thing to do,

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:03.650
the wrong thing to do, but
the system is so out of whack

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:10.660
that it disproportionately leads
people of African-American descent

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:14.220
and color to their
deaths disproportionately.

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.240
He said that one out of
every nine persons who is

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:24.280
on death row has been
exonerated, think about that.

00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:27.400
And one of the things that
Brian says is that if one

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:34.410 position:56%
out of every nine planes crashed how
many of us would get on an airplane?

00:48:34.410 --> 00:48:36.920
So one of the things, so
the people have asked Brian,

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.250
because some of these
crimes are heinous and some

00:48:39.250 --> 00:48:40.560
of these individuals just look

00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.960
like they have absolutely there's
no socially redeeming quality

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.660
about any of these individuals.

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:48.580
And one of the things
that Brian says

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:50.680
and I think it's an
important lesson to kind of,

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:55.570
as you put this mosaic together,
is that each of us is more

00:48:55.570 --> 00:49:00.920
than the worst thing we've ever
done and I think that that kind

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:05.270
of captures some of this idea
of believing in everyone.

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:07.280
I think the other thing that
has to happen, you know,

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.100
the Greeks had two sayings,

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:12.770 position:56%
the Greeks which was a pretty good
civilization that lasted a long time

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:16.430
and served as the foundation
for so much of what we do today.

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:19.930
They had two kind of
idioms that they lived by.

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:25.400
One was everything in moderation,
which is really a very good idiom.

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:32.230
The other was know thyself, that
in order for us to find the good

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:35.250
and believe in everyone we
first have to really kind

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:39.320
of know ourselves and our own
prejudices and our own biases

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.670
and what pushes our buttons.

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:44.690
So that when we encounter someone

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:48.840
who is not necessarily a
highly desirable individual,

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:53.090
who may have a lot of challenges
that are manifesting themselves

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:58.830
in doing things that are wrong and
bad, we're able to kind of know,

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:03.540
kind of separate ourselves and know
ourselves from our ability to try

00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:05.970
to promote what is good in them.

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:11.030
And so and I think this third
quality is what Sally was talking

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:17.840
about is that is if we can
see the strength in everyone,

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:19.210
that everyone has strengths.

00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:21.840
We all have weaknesses,
everyone here has a weakness,

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.100
everyone here has flaws.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:29.220
But when we look at an
individual and see their strengths

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:32.810
and see what is positive
about them and nurture it,

00:50:32.810 --> 00:50:37.380
as opposed to seeing their
problem that we want to fix,

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.230
then we're on our way
towards helping

00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:45.660
that person avoid loneliness,
fear and hopelessness.

00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:51.140 position:56%
And, finally, and this is really
kind of more directed to the adults,

00:50:51.140 --> 00:50:53.910
that we have to build
trust with young people

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:56.130
and we have to keep that trust.

00:50:56.130 --> 00:51:03.550
And so building that trust means
being there when we're needed

00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:07.350
and keeping that trust means
kind of following up on our word,

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:10.190
that when a young person
comes to us and tells us

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:13.940
that they've been bullied
that we don't drop the ball

00:51:13.940 --> 00:51:19.630
and that we follow-up and do as
much as we can to keep them safe,

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:22.140
but also kind of resolve
the bullying

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:26.010
in as positive a way as possible.

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:32.170
And so I want to conclude by just
kind of making this simple remark.

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:38.040
Number one, again, I'm just so
impressed and congratulate all

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:43.540
of you for everything that
you've done, and I hope that some

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:47.040
of the things that I've shared with
you today you kind of take back

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:53.290
to your communities to help kind
of see the good in everyone,

00:51:53.290 --> 00:51:59.800
and as challenging as that may be,
and I think in the long run if all

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.580
of us do that we will see
a significant reduction

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.930
in the violence that we all face.

00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:08.510
So thank you, all, very much.

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:17.070

&gt;&gt; Dan Callister: As we
mentioned last night, our primary

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.130
and long-term founding sponsor

00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:28.700 position:56%
for the program is the Quade America
Foundation [Assumed Spelling],

00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:32.190
Falsey Silton [Assumed
Spelling] is a very close friend

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:34.230
and Vice Chairman of the
Quade America foundation.

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:38.270
I'd like Falsey to
present to David two books.

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:42.300
One is for David and one is for
the new Secretary of Education,

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:44.030
containing the writings
of our students.

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:47.510
So if you'll do that,
Falsey, thanks.

00:52:47.510 --> 00:53:00.040
[ Applause ]

00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.340
&gt;&gt; Falsey Silton: Thank you, David.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.510
&gt;&gt; Dan Callister: Thanks, Falsey.

00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:15.040
Okay, you weren't a lawyer,
somehow that was lodged in my mind,

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:21.910
but I think it was actually because
good lawyers, I hope, really,

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:28.310 position:56%
really, really try to understand the
world that their clients are facing

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:31.520
and truly understand the
problems so they can be of help.

00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:35.270
and I think that is one of
your greatest strengths, David,

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:40.750
just listening to you speak today
I think we could all understand how

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:45.520
much time you spend really
thinking about human nature

00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.610
and what are the root causes of
the problems that we humans have

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:51.740
and that we visit on one another.

00:53:51.740 --> 00:53:54.700
And so I just thought it was
a brilliant job you did today

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:58.930
and appreciate all the work you're
doing for all of us in trying

00:53:58.930 --> 00:54:02.750
to keep our schools safe
and our children safe.

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:06.380
