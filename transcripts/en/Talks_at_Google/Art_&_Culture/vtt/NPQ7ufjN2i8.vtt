00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.203
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.760
SPEAKER: Please
join me in welcoming

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.806
Abdoulaye and Ibrahim.

00:00:09.806 --> 00:00:13.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.220
ABDOULAYE BARRY: My
name is Abdoulaye.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.400
And I would like to think
Craig for inviting us,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.530
and thank you all for coming.

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.410
And thanks to our guests
who came here to support us,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.790
from New York, from Guinea,
and from Portland, Oregon.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.650
This is my brother Ibrahim, and
we live in Portland, Oregon.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.010
So we're here to talk about
ADLaM, a story that begin

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.330
almost more than 25 years ago.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.080
And we'll try to see what we can
say about it within the next 30

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.770
or 40 minutes.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.680
So as you can see here, ADLaM
is the name of the alphabet,

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.510
and the Pular and
Fulfulde is the language.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.440
Next slide.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.230
So I just wanted to give
some background information

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.140
about Africa before we
start talking about ADLaM.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.480
So this is the map of Africa.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.340
It's got a diverse population,
all races and all religions.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.290
Almost all of them.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.100
And it's got six of the top
12 fastest growing economies

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.380
in the world.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.940
And it's got half
a billion people

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.030
who are subscribers
to mobile services,

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.940
and a quarter billion of
those who use smartphones.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.390
There are more than 2,100
languages in Africa,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.590
and those are grouped
into fives groups.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.725
As you can see here,
Afroasiatic and Saharan,

00:01:42.725 --> 00:01:46.600
Niger-Congo, Khoisan,
and Austronesian.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.000
And there are 54
countries in Africa.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.570
And Fulani, which is the
language that we speak,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.770
and for which we created
the ADLaM alphabet,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.554
is spoken in 23 countries
of those 54 countries.

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:02.970
And as you can see on the map
here, you can see up there--

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.570
you see it in the red--

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.620
that's the Niger-Congo subgroup.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.940
And Fulani is up there
between Guinea and Mali.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.370
Fulanis.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.940
There are more than 50
million of them in Africa.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.565
And you can-- if we
go to the next slide--

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.500
so this is actually a map of
Western and Central Africa.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.645
From Senegal up
here where it says

00:02:30.645 --> 00:02:32.970
Futa Toro all the way to Sudan.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.950
These are regions
where you can actually

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.020
find Fulanis in Africa.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.300
In almost all of the
countries of West Africa,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.530
the 16 countries plus some
countries of Central Africa,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.390
and then as far as Sudan,
around the Nile River.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.420
So you can find Fulanis.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.600
They are called
Fulanis by the British

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.110
and they got that name
from the Hausa people.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.110
And the French people
refer to us as Peul,

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.840
and they got those
names by the first tribe

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.540
they encountered when they
arrived in Africa, the Wolof

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.500
people.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:17.537
But we call ourselves Pullo if
it's one and Fulbhe, for many.

00:03:17.537 --> 00:03:18.620
And there are other names.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.730
The Arab people
use [? Fellata. ?]

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.340
And Fula is also at term
used by the Mandingoes.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.050
And there are also
some other subgroups

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.970
within the group of Fulani
people, the Wodaabhe,

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.950
the Bororo, the Wassulu people,
and the Toucouleur in Senegal.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.900
And we are historically
nomadic people,

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.650
and that's explain why we
are spread all over Africa,

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.760
because we are cattle
herders, so we--

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.080
wherever we find green
pasture, that's where we take

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.300
our cattle, and that's
the reason why--

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.000
one of reasons, and why we
extended all over Western

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.590
and Central Africa.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.110
And when we embraced
Islam in the beginning

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.350
of the 11th century, and then
we started spreading Islam,

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.940
and also used the
other reason that

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.610
explains why we spread
over from the Senegal delta

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.780
all the way to
Nigeria and Sudan.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.110
So this is the Fulai language.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.750
Like I mentioned earlier,
there are 50 million--

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.470
at least 50 million
Fulanis in Africa

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.210
and around the world at least.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.805
And we speak different dialects
of the Fulani language.

00:04:28.805 --> 00:04:33.850
It's called Fulfulde if you are
on the Eastern side of Africa,

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.720
starting in Mali and
all the way to Sudan.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.480
But it's called Pular if you
are in Senegal, or Guinea,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.980
or Sierra Leone area.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.530
Fulfulde-- the reason why it's
called Fulfulde in the others

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.010
regions-- basically,
Fulfulde means

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.640
dialect in the Fulani language.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.444
So basically the
version of the Pular

00:04:55.444 --> 00:04:57.860
that's spoken by the other
people is just called dialects,

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.330
and then that name stuck.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.870
And the language actually is
referred to now, globally,

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.040
as Fulfulde.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.900
Most people know
Fulfulde, and only

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.350
a few people except maybe people
from French speaking countries,

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.120
refer to the language as Pular.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.130
So as you can see
here, it's part

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.730
of the North Atlantic branch
of the Niger-Congo as Wolof

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.100
and Serer.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.460
And it's spoken at least
in two dozen countries,

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.230
and it's recognized
by the African Union

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.480
as one of the official
languages that will eventually

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.860
be used in addition to English,
French, Portuguese, Spanish,

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.510
and then we'll have Swahili.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.150
And also in the ECWAS, which is
the economic. community of West

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.260
African States, has
16 countries that are

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.250
members of the organizations.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.000
And Fulani is one of
the languages that

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.250
they looking into, because
basically in West Africa,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.530
we have three big
languages that can serve

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.550
to unite those countries--
we have the Fulani language,

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.460
we have the Hausa language,
and the Mandingo language.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.260
And those are the
transnational languages

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.440
in West Africa, spoken
in multiple countries.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:05.410
And originally the Fulani
language was written--

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.560
as you remember, I mentioned
the Fulanis embraced Islam

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.200
in the early 11th century--

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.350
and then we started using
Arabic, the Arabic script,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.200
to write the Fulani language.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.750
And we used it all over,
but there was no standard.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.450
So each region or each
person or each group

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.670
was writing the
Fulani language based

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.560
on their own understanding.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.296
Because the problem
is that we have sounds

00:06:30.296 --> 00:06:32.170
that are specific to
the Fulani language that

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.480
are non-existent in Arabic.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.230
So there was a--

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.630
how to create the
correspondence for the letters,

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.610
the sounds that
we have, in Arabic

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:44.009
that don't exist in there.

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.550
And then the fact
that the Arabs have

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:47.740
some sounds that we don't need.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:54.520
So people were using some
of those letters in Arabic

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.030
as a correspondent
one of the sounds that

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.100
existed in our language,
but it's not standardized.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.410
So every person was
doing their own thing.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.390
And I explain the
story of actually how

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.420
this whole thing started
that we'll get to later on.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.940
And the reason, in
the '70s, people

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.890
started using the Latin
alphabet, but also the problem

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.090
with that is, each
country, or each region,

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:17.640
was using their own standard.

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:21.250
In Guinea, actually,
during the first regime,

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.540
they used to teach the
national languages in Guinea.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.670
But we were using
an alphabet that

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.280
was different from any
of the other countries--

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.090
the Latin alphabet.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.400
So for example,
for the sound bah,

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.580
we were using bh, while
in other countries

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:41.950
they were using a sign that
looks like a 6, the number six.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.760
So there was a
problem also reading

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.000
what's written in Guinea versus
what's written in Senegal

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.025
or Mali, for example.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.300
And also one thing that I can
say about the Fulani language--

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.410
it's one of the most widely
spoken languages in Guinea.

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:09.660
It's actually the lingua franca
in the central parts of Guinea

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.910
all the way to the region--
the lowlands toward the ocean.

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:17.712
And also in Cameroon, northern
Cameroon in the Adamawa region,

00:08:17.712 --> 00:08:18.670
it's the lingua franca.

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.690
It's one of the most widely
spoken language there.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:25.560
And the fact that there
were these problems using

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:31.020
different sets of letters
to write the language

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.750
is actually what
will lead us to this.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.840
My dad lived in region--

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.188
unfortunately, I don't
have a map of Guinea,

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.160
but in Guinea we have
four natural regions.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.350
And the Fulani people
mostly live mostly

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.000
in the mountain regions.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
But my dad moved from
there to go and start

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.830
a business in the
forest region, which

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.700
was about 800 kilometers away.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.910
And you know, Fulanis
being nomadic people,

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:01.330
so that's how the
spread all over.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.360
Even though they abandoned
cattle herding, some of them

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:08.140
did, but they're still
engaged in other businesses

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.860
by traveling to other
regions and other countries.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.840
So the way people
stayed in touch

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:16.900
with their relatives
is by sending letters

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:21.640
to their relatives, and usually
they will write it in Arabic,

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.560
using the Arabic letters.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.810
And since there was
no standard, there

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.550
were only a few people
who could actually

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.400
read a letter for someone.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.980
So my dad was one
of those people who,

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.260
if people received letters from
their relatives back in Fouta,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:41.110
they will send the letters to
him so that he can read them.

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:44.110
So that's how we got into
reading those letters.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:48.640
We learned it from our dad, and
then we got really good at it.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.580
And then at the end, he
started giving us the letters

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.590
to read for the people.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:56.184
But what we noticed is
that, like I said earlier,

00:09:56.184 --> 00:09:57.100
there was no standard.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:59.140
So most of the time
you were just guessing.

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:00.640
Because you know the language.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.260
If you see something,
the word, you

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:04.690
can actually guess what the
person was trying to write,

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.930
even though it's
not exactly how you

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.350
think that they would write it.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.120
So that's how I got
to asking my dad,

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.840
how come we don't have
our own writing system,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.860
so that we can write in a
way that everyone can read?

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.920
Without having to guess,
without having any problems.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.430
And he told us that we
don't have a writing system,

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.840
and then that's how I told him
that maybe that's something

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.530
that we would looking
into creating.

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:35.650
And my mom also had a
rice bar restaurant--

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.630
a small restaurant
next to the market--

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.440
where I used to hang
out after school.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.010
And that's where I met
this guy who had traveled

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:44.590
a lot around West Africa.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:47.004
And he used to tell me a
lot about the Fulani people.

00:10:47.004 --> 00:10:49.420
He's the one who first told
me that the Fulanis are prison

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:51.790
all over, because I used
to think Fulanis are only

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.250
present in Guinea.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.190
But he said, because we are
present all over Africa,

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:01.000
we speak different dialects
and we write differently.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.310
And then he said that
people-- they've been looking

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:06.250
into unifying the languages,
and then you start reciting name

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.210
of people--

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:11.220
well-known peoples in
the Fulani community.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.790
And he told me all
of those people

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.520
have looked into creating
an alphabet so that they

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.500
can unify the language
that they-- but

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.060
have not been able to.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.620
So that combined with what
happened with my dad really

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.190
motivated me into looking
into ways to creating

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:29.710
an alphabet for our language.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:34.570
That's actually how the idea
and the motivation came about.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.150
And then I was always
with my brother.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:38.630
And then he talked
to me about it.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.280
And then we started the process.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.690
And this is how we started.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.110
Sometime after school, we
would go into our room,

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.630
we started drawing
lines, and then

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:50.830
we'll pick whatever looks like
a letter to us from those signs,

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.080
as you can see here.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.730
Or the other method
that we could use

00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:57.510
is that I would think
of a letter or a sound,

00:11:57.510 --> 00:12:01.510
and I would imagine how it would
look like when it's written.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.030
And then I'll draw
based on that.

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.210
And that's how we ended up
getting all the letters.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:08.900
We got 27.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.990
But later it would be
28, because we later

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:13.847
discovered there's one
more sound that we needed.

00:12:13.847 --> 00:12:14.930
So we added that later on.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:18.730
But originally we
had 27 letters.

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:22.750
And then when we created
all those letters,

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.920
we told my dad that we
finally created an alphabet,

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.690
and he didn't believe us.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.780
So he called one
of his relatives

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:33.685
who used to work
for the government,

00:12:33.685 --> 00:12:38.900
and then told that guy to come,
because his sons, his kids have

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.770
informed him that they
created an alphabet,

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:42.730
bu the thinks
they're just playing.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.320
So this guy came, and then
he started testing us.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.380
So he would ask me
to leave the room

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.920
and then he will tell
my brother to write

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.820
a word using the new alphabet.

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:54.950
And then my brother would write
the word, and then I'll come

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.409
and then he'll ask me to read
it, and then I would read it,

00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:58.991
and it would be
exactly what he asked.

00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:00.370
And then he did the same thing.

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.170
He asked my brother
to leave the room.

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:02.980
My brother left.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.870
And then he asked me
to write something.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:08.860
He asked me to write one of
the hardest words that he could

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.110
think of in Pular, which
is [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.600
and then I wrote it, and then
my brother came and read it,

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.180
and then he turned to
my dad, and he's like,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.910
I think these guys are
onto something here.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:25.090
And basically that's how
the writing system started.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:25.840
The ADLaM.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:28.690
But back then it
wasn't called ADLaM.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:29.770
We created the alphabet.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.690
We started working on it.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.510
And then we started teaching--
the first person that we taught

00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:38.170
was my sister.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:41.740
Go on to the next slide.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:42.750
This is her.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:46.790
And this is the one of the
first books that we used.

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:51.700
This is actually her
writing back then.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:55.712
So this is how we
started teaching people.

00:13:55.712 --> 00:13:58.170
We didn't have a name for the
alphabet, it was really hard,

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:00.545
and we just kept calling it
Bindi Pular which basically--

00:14:00.545 --> 00:14:03.260
literally means the
writing, the Pular writing.

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.610
And then we taught her.

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:07.010
And after that we started
going around to the market.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.030
The next slide.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:12.550
We started teaching
in the community.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.430
And my dad used to own
a shop in the market,

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:17.950
and that's where we
started, because there were

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.869
many Fulanis in the market.

00:14:19.869 --> 00:14:21.160
So we would go there and teach.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.850
This is me and my brother.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:24.530
My brother is in
the middle here,

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.710
in the yellow and blue jacket.

00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:29.710
I'm in the back.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:32.150
And those are some of the few
people that we taught then.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.940
And two years later,
this is the picture

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:40.330
after we had already
created the alphabet.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:44.650
And then the next slide
shows how the alphabet looked

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:45.850
in the 1990's.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.076
This is how we used to write it.

00:14:48.076 --> 00:14:49.450
And when we created
the alphabet,

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.030
because we were heavily
influenced by Arabic,

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.370
we started from right to left.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.490
But also since we
are going to school,

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.040
we are also influenced
by the French language.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.950
Instead of using diacritical
marks as in Arabic

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:08.410
to mark the vowels, we use
actual vowels in our language.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:11.860
Because our language is
not the same as Arabic.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.930
Arabic only has three
vowels, but we actually

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:16.450
have five vowels, as in English.

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:18.610
Actually, we used
to think we had six,

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.510
but it turns out
we only had five.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.260
So that's why we write
from right to left.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.200
And then we originally
also, all the letters

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.720
were joined, as in Arabic.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.430
So this is how we
started writing it.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:33.760
And these are the
first manuscripts.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.830
And then we started
writing books.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.240
Basically what we
were doing back

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.380
then is, the books
that we were studying,

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.890
either religious books or
books from our schools,

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.460
we would translate them
into our language in Pular,

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.805
and write them using
the new alphabet.

00:15:50.805 --> 00:15:52.930
And these are books that
we'll then show to people.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.330
And then after the--

00:15:57.330 --> 00:16:01.310
because few years
later, sense we

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.850
had had a lot of
practice writing,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:06.470
so then we started
writing this way.

00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:09.080
Experimenting writing
the letters separately,

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.240
as you can see on
the next slide.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:14.090
Then I started writing
books with the letters

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.590
not joined, actually.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.060
You can't really
tell here, maybe,

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.260
because the image
is not that good.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.350
But these actually--
these letters that are not

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:21.600
joined, as you can see.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.390
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:25.340
So we started
experimenting, and then we

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:29.960
noticed that this actually
was easier for people to read.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.120
So we continued on that.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:37.100
And then I'll let my brother
talk about the next slide.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:39.100
IBRAHIM BARRY: Like
my brother said,

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:44.460
we have many different phases of
the evolution of ADLaM script.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:51.410
So the first one we call the
first generation of book.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.980
We call this the first
generation of book, as he said.

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.810
It was just the
book and the stories

00:16:57.810 --> 00:17:00.860
we used to learn from
my dad and my mom.

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:04.069
We used to write them
and go around the city

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:05.150
and teach people.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.339
And people really liked them.

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:14.540
So by the time we move to the
second generation of book,

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:19.050
we started thinking about the
language, about the structure.

00:17:19.050 --> 00:17:21.619
About the laws in the language.

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:25.220
So we continued teaching
people in the market,

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:27.589
around the city, every
time when we come back

00:17:27.589 --> 00:17:30.410
from school and
during our break.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:33.180
We used to teach
people all the time.

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.560
So by the second
generation of book,

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.020
we have a lot of different book.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:42.350
But the third generation
of book started in 2000,

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:47.570
when I moved to the University
of Conakry, in my country,

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:49.370
in the capital city.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:53.270
When I moved there, I
started an organization.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:56.270
Because all the books from
the first through to second

00:17:56.270 --> 00:18:00.080
generation, of them was
writing by my brother.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.430
I used to help him
teaching around the city.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.470
So when I moved
to the University,

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.850
I started talking to
some of my friend.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.810
They were really interested
in teaching people.

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:15.260
And so they started
working with us.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.410
From the University we
have five different groups.

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:24.080
We have people going for
medical school, the people going

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.400
for engineering school.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.070
We have different
project, so we just

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:35.300
write books that really
affected the life of people.

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.430
So when we started
this kind of book,

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:40.260
the script become very poPular.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:42.530
So like this one--

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:45.830
some of my student
at the University,

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.550
who was going for
medical school,

00:18:47.550 --> 00:18:51.200
they started writing
books in our language.

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:55.720
How a woman can take care
of her kid, since he--

00:18:55.720 --> 00:19:01.530
when he sees that her pregnancy
into her kid is growing up.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.685
The kind of food you
have to give them,

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:08.150
how to take care of them, how
to clean their [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.160
So we started teaching people.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.830
And those book
become very poPular,

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.050
and people was
very happy to read.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:19.850
Because more than 80% does
not know how to read and write

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:23.630
in English language back then--

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:25.365
in French language,
in my country.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.070
We also wrote many
different book--

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:35.190
how to clean water,
because usually people

00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:39.870
take water from the well,
so we give them how--

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:40.900
teach them.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:45.090
Back then I was doing chemical
engineering for my first two

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:47.040
years at the University.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:50.370
So we learned the process,
and we developed a process

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:54.570
and teach them and show
them how to make those tool.

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.060
So around the country--

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.010
so after that, we
started a newspaper.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.630
I started a newspaper in Guinea
called [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.300
or The Pen.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:10.570
So I used to write all
the news, all the time.

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:14.100
And whenever people
read, they use

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.760
sometimes even to
have ears, to cry,

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:20.400
because they know now
how to read and write.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:26.460
Also we teach people
how to have basic math

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.290
to take care of their business.

00:20:28.290 --> 00:20:31.740
Because usually a lot of
people put money together.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:36.240
They will go to
Asia, buy goods, when

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.230
they come they have to find
someone who know how to read

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.830
and write in French
language to help

00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.810
them divided this stuff before
they start selling them.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.860
So I teach them how to
do that by themselves.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.620
We give them basic
math, how to divide

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.200
[INAUDIBLE] stuff
when they bring them

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.990
from Asia or Morocco.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.470
And I started having
problem with the government

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:07.650
because I was teaching
a lot of people.

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:15.120
And also I was one of
the leader of the student

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.010
movement at the
university, I was

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:21.450
the president of that movement.

00:21:21.450 --> 00:21:25.840
They called [INAUDIBLE]--
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Guinean.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.330
So finally I end up going
to prison for three month.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.660
So when I come out,
I continue teaching.

00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.950
And I used to have a lot
of issues after that.

00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.850
I went even to Senegal.

00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:43.350
I traveled to Senegal,
continue teaching here

00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:45.930
at the University
of Senegal with some

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:51.180
of my friend, who taught back
home who move also to Senegal.

00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:54.300
They have the same
problem I had in Guinea.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.830
So they was looking
to put them in jail.

00:21:58.830 --> 00:22:01.080
So they fled to Senegal.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.910
So I went back to
see them there.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.280
We continued teaching.

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.650
When I went to
Senegal, what really

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.360
struck I went to the market
with some of these people.

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.580
I found the book I was
writing in Guinea already

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:16.740
in the market with ladies.

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:20.790
So I started talking to
some of those ladies.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:22.810
They told me, can you read this?

00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:25.660
I say maybe,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.900
And one of them say,
I can teach you.

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:29.220
I really like this book.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.350
It's really helping me.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.020
And I ask them how
did you got this book?

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:38.610
Because they said, so a
lady is bringing the palm

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:42.380
oil from Guinea, she is the one
who brought those book here.

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.310
She is the one who
is teaching us.

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:48.630
But right now, whenever someone
takes something from me,

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.520
I write down.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.920
I am following all my
business with this.

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.660
And it's really helping me.

00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:58.510
And I already started teaching
people classes in the market.

00:22:58.510 --> 00:23:00.750
The other ladies.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.830
In 2007 I moved to
the United State.

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:06.120
When I come here,
my biggest goal

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.960
was to computerize
the writing system.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.445
Because back in the days, I used
to write everything by hand.

00:23:13.445 --> 00:23:15.870
It was very difficult whenever.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:18.720
You have a mistake
in one page, you're

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.890
going to lose all that page.

00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.770
You have to write again,
before you print the books.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.680
So when I come here
in 2007, I talk

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.470
to some of my community members
in New York if they could help.

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.920
We're going to have
a software that can

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:40.620
help us write in a computer.

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.230
So when I come
back to Portland--

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.615
when I come to Portland
to see my brother--

00:23:45.615 --> 00:23:48.120
he figure out to find
a company in Seattle

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.910
that could done that.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.690
Then we discuss with them.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:55.380
So we come back, we
didn't have the money.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:57.840
So we have to work
seven month straight

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.180
and save all the money,
100%, and make the software.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:06.330
We made the software and
we bought some computers.

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:10.950
My brother, in 2007,
went to Guinea.

00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.970
In 2008, he went to Guinea.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.130
He brought some
of those computers

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:20.070
and teach people how to use
them, how to write book,

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.580
and how to edit them.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:28.420
But this font was on
the Arabic code point.

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.550
So we have a lot of
problem using them,

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:34.120
but it makes everything easier.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.890
And we was producing a lot
of books, a lot of newspaper.

00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:44.420
And we bought a
lot of computers.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.880
One of the guy in New
York gave many computers.

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.390
We send it back home, we started
an organization here called

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:52.470
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:57.120
We bought computers, we send for
the teachers, for the writers

00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.040
back home.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.650
But we still have challenges.

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.980
Because we teach a lot of
people, and the internet

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:06.750
is coming back home.

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.440
Every villages-- they have
cell phone everywhere,

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.650
and people started
calling us all the time.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.300
How can I write this?

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.260
How can I text?

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.850
I said, we don't have
the solution right now,

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:25.080
but we are doing
some research on it.

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:30.450
That how I started learning
the different process

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:31.330
until we got--

00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:36.640
I discover, in order
to be in this system,

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:39.000
to be in Unicode phase.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.260
So this is peoples
teaching back home.

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:47.530
One of these guys, who used
to live in New York, he's--

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:52.620
he just moved back home
in Africa to teach people.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:59.160
Because he has a Master's degree
in one of the Arab countries,

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.300
Syria.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.370
So he will come to New York.

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:03.340
He went to school.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.720
He learned the English
languages, and went back home.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.990
Just, he said, he's moving
back just to teach people

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.880
how to read and write.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.880
And they put him
in contact with us.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.960
We taught him how to read
and write the script.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.920
And he found this is the
easiest way to teach people.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.645
The best way is
in their language.

00:26:24.645 --> 00:26:28.140
He have taught many different
people around Africa.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:34.230
So spatially, we focusing a lot
in womans, because most of them

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.040
don't go to school.

00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:42.090
And children, who parent doesn't
have the mean to go to school.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:45.340
So we teach them at least
how to read and write.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.700
And then we started newspapers.

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.940
We call this newspaper
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.800
Everything going around
the country and Africa.

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.890
Is monthly newspaper, it's
still going out every year.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:02.430
And right now we have some
of very outstanding brothers

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:04.740
who have finished school.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:07.710
They went for law
school and journalists--

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:10.440
they are the ones who are
running this newspaper back

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.250
home.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.970
But before, I am the
one who started it.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.960
I was writing everything.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:20.620
So now we have people
doing this back home.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:25.240
So we're still working on
the script and developing it.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:30.880
And going forward, we have
people writing biology book,

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.680
physics, mathematics.

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.680
Right now, the basic,
to teach people.

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:40.960
To give them a little
basic in their language

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.150
so they can follow what
going on around the world.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.850
But when we made the
software, we have--

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:56.710
I have some issues with
the way the letters was.

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:01.900
So I thought maybe to make
this one very attractive, more

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:05.440
beautiful, I have to take
some calligraphy classes.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:10.420
So I took those
calligraphy classes with--

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.430
in the next slide--

00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:15.410
with this lady called Rebecca.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.130
And the first day
of the class, she

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:20.810
used to ask every student, how--

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.090
why are you here?

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:25.100
So why are you
taking calligraphy?

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:30.090
So when she asked me, I told her
really why I am in that class.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:33.900
And I said, I am really
interested in calligraphy

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.460
to know some of the
rules and to apply them

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.840
into my writing system.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.790
So that how we started working.

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:44.720
She is the one who helped a lot.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.100
She is the one, get me
into different calligraphy

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.430
conferences.

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:53.030
And from those
calligraphy conferences,

00:28:53.030 --> 00:28:58.540
we get the help to be
encoded in Unicode.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:02.640
So this is the different--

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.150
I even have a font
called after her.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.710
I named one of these font--

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:13.770
this one-- is called
Rebecca, and in our fonts.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:17.422
We have this way of writing.

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:20.760
So yeah, in the next slide.

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.010
ABDOULAYE BARRY: So these
are just different-- once he

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.370
took the calligraphy classes,
what you see in these slides

00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:31.150
is how the writing
system evolved.

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.950
Oh, sorry.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.530
So yeah, so basically
that's all after he

00:29:35.530 --> 00:29:37.720
took the calligraphy
classes, he started

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.490
making many improvements.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:45.940
And actually, what was in
the first set of phones

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:49.180
that we created, that was
developed for us in Seattle,

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:55.014
is very different to
what we see today.

00:29:55.014 --> 00:29:57.625
AUDIENCE: Excuse me, is this
still being written from right?

00:29:57.625 --> 00:29:58.500
IBRAHIM BARRY: Yeah--

00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.416
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Yes--

00:29:59.416 --> 00:30:01.400
IBRAHIM BARRY: It's still
right then the left.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.640
ABDOULAYE BARRY: And
then it's also from this,

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.470
after he took this
class, then we started

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:07.440
thinking of creating not only--

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.450
because originally
we only had one set.

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:13.830
It's right to left,
and it didn't have low

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:17.890
or uppercase very present
in the writing system.

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.680
But after he took the
calligraphy classes,

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.100
he saw all the
different styles that we

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:26.340
can do with the ADLaM and the
improvement that can be made.

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.200
And also the necessity
of having it,

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:31.080
how important it
is for writing--

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:33.570
proper names.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:36.660
So we-- then he created
another set just

00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:39.449
for the uppercase for ADLaM.

00:30:39.449 --> 00:30:41.490
So this is just showing
all the different designs

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.800
that he's done of the letters.

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.910
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:45.826
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Yeah.

00:30:45.826 --> 00:30:46.720
IBRAHIM BARRY: OK.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:51.430
So as I told you, in
2014, I was invited

00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:56.720
to give a speech, a talk at
the International Calligraphy

00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.460
Conferences in Colorado Spring.

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:06.310
From that conference, we had
help from some of the peoples

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.132
there who help us.

00:31:09.132 --> 00:31:10.840
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Just
one thing before he

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.449
start talking about the thing.

00:31:12.449 --> 00:31:14.740
Remember how I told you when
we created the alphabet we

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.300
couldn't come up with a name?

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:21.490
So imagine, since the
1990s, all the way til 2012,

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:22.434
we didn't have a name.

00:31:22.434 --> 00:31:24.850
We actually experimented, we
thought about different names

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:25.870
on how to call the alphabet.

00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:28.120
Whenever people ask us, what's
the name of the alphabet?

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.203
We just call Bindi Pular,
which is writing system.

00:31:30.203 --> 00:31:32.800
Or, people would call
it the writing system

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.090
that came from N'Zerekore,
which is our hometown where

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:37.420
we were born.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.730
But one day,
because the alphabet

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.040
became so poPular in
Guinea, so the instructors

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.780
they gathered one
day and they say,

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.610
we have to give this
alphabet a name.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:49.640
And they found a
very simple thing.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.920
It's unbelievable.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:54.580
Because they just took the first
four letters of the alphabet,

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:55.789
and called it.

00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:58.330
And we couldn't believe that,
we couldn't even think of that.

00:31:58.330 --> 00:31:59.290
As simple as that.

00:31:59.290 --> 00:32:01.780
They call it ADLaM--
ah, dah, lah, mah.

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:05.740
And they gave you a
perfect definition,

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.720
which is the alphabet
that will prevent

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:09.010
the people from disappearing.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:12.790
Because that was
one of the things

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:17.110
that most African languages
are confronted with.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:18.880
You know, there's
French language

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.010
in Africa, which is--
actually, in Guinea,

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:22.570
that's the official language.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:24.740
The language of the instruction.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.430
But in our homes, we
speak our own languages.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.800
In the markets, we
speak our own languages.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.080
But if you go to school,
you learn French.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.530
And the government--
everything is done in French.

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:40.240
So there is-- our languages
are threatened by the French,

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:42.520
by the French language
or English language.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.780
IBRAHIM BARRY: Or Arabic.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.060
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Or
Arabic language, also.

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:49.690
So that's why it made perfect
sense for the alphabet

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:52.510
to be a way to protect our
language from disappearing.

00:32:52.510 --> 00:32:56.050
Because if the language is
really the vehicle of culture,

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:57.430
like we say it is--

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.659
because if your language dies,
your culture dies with it.

00:33:00.659 --> 00:33:02.200
Because there are
certain things that

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:08.990
are specific to cultures that
can only be shared within--

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:12.460
with codes or words
in that culture.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.530
So if you lose
the language, that

00:33:14.530 --> 00:33:18.430
means the culture is eventually
[INAUDIBLE] to disappear.

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:20.840
And if the culture disappears,
that means the people.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.020
Not the physical
people, but the people

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.030
as in their culture,
civilization,

00:33:25.030 --> 00:33:26.320
and their history.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.730
All of that goes with it.

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.280
So they came up
with the name ADLaM.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.870
And it was perfect.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.630
It was like, we
couldn't believe it.

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.290
And it was perfect
timing because we

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:40.900
were about to start the
process with Unicode.

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:44.200
And it would have been awkward
for us to submit a proposal

00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.880
and not even have a
name for the alphabet.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.720
So when I moved here, I
started contacting Unicode.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:54.010
And everything, most of you
know that probably, is--

00:33:54.010 --> 00:34:00.014
things move fast or quickly
when you have contacts.

00:34:00.014 --> 00:34:01.930
But if you don't have
contacts, usually things

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:04.420
don't move as fast as you hope.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.750
So when I moved in
2004, I actually--

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.900
when I started researching
in how to get our alphabet

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:14.710
encoded, I discovered that
there was a Unicode-- a UNESCO

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:18.250
project, a UNESCO-funded
project working

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:20.829
with the University
of Berkeley in trying

00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:23.980
to encode some languages.

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.409
So I wrote them but
never heard from them.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:29.710
In 2007 when my brother moved
here, we also wrote to them.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:31.527
And they replied back.

00:34:31.527 --> 00:34:33.610
We started talking a little,
but I didn't get far.

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.310
It's now, only when my
brother went to Colorado,

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:44.530
at his second
calligraphy conference--

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.540
that's when things
started going forward.

00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:47.350
Moving fast.

00:34:47.350 --> 00:34:50.914
Because that's where
he met some guy--

00:34:50.914 --> 00:34:52.580
at his first conference,
actually, there

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.659
was a conference in Portland,
where he met with Randy, right?

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.522
And then when he went to the
second conference in Colorado,

00:34:58.522 --> 00:35:00.730
Randy introduced him to
somebody called [? Stephan ?]

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:01.930
[? Rapp, ?] I believe.

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:03.470
And this is the guy
who said that he

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.600
know somebody working on
the Unicode project that

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.290
can help us.

00:35:08.290 --> 00:35:11.570
And then he sent an
email, I think, to--

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.085
what's her name--

00:35:13.085 --> 00:35:14.354
I forgot--

00:35:14.354 --> 00:35:15.270
IBRAHIM BARRY: Debbie.

00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:16.210
ABDOULAYE BARRY:
Debbie Anderson.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:16.810
IBRAHIM BARRY: Yes.

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:19.351
ABDOULAYE BARRY: And it turns
out it's the same person that I

00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:22.420
had e-mailed previously, but
I didn't get far with her,

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.150
but with [? Stephan ?]
[? Rapp's ?] help,

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:27.910
things got really
moving quickly.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:32.480
And then they put
us in touch with--

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:36.580
so this is Randy, the guy who
introduced us to [? Stephan ?]

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:41.050
[? Rapp, ?] who helped us
get all of this stuff moving.

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:43.690
And then when we talked
to Debbie Anderson, so

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.830
he said there's one
person who could

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:50.280
help us write the proposal,
which is Michael Everson.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.730
He's written many proposals
for many African languages,

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:55.390
and he is the one
who did our proposal.

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:57.842
And then he came to Vancouver,
and Washington, which

00:35:57.842 --> 00:35:59.550
is very close to
Portland, where we live,

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:01.200
and then we met with him there.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.920
And then we worked on
all the different styles.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:07.710
And he asked us all the
questions that he needed.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:09.960
And then he wrote a proposal.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:16.080
And in 2013-- everything went
really fast after [? Stephan ?]

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:17.530
[? Rapp ?] got involved.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:20.790
So in November, he already
had a preliminary proposal.

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:23.520
And then he was
invited in New York.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.600
We had a convention-- an
ADLaM convention there,

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:28.280
and then he came to [INAUDIBLE]
with a lot of the people who

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.390
are involved in helping ADLaM.

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:33.420
Because this thing, ADLaM,
if it is where it is today,

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.300
it is really with the help
of the people in New York.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:41.820
There are many people there
who understand the importance

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:42.729
of this alphabet.

00:36:42.729 --> 00:36:44.520
Some of them did not
go to a French school,

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:46.936
because that's the problem
that we have usually in Guinea.

00:36:46.936 --> 00:36:49.830
You If you didn't go to a French
school or an English school,

00:36:49.830 --> 00:36:51.330
you are called an
illiterate person.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:54.420
Even though you are valuable,
you might know certain things.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.820
So these people--
ADLaM has been a way

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.880
to bring those
people into the fold.

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.900
Or at least to get them
to share what they know

00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.104
or to contribute in
terms of knowledge.

00:37:05.104 --> 00:37:06.270
Because they have knowledge.

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:08.430
They have things that they
want to do for the community.

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:10.804
But without them, they could
not have been able to do it.

00:37:10.804 --> 00:37:12.870
And they're the reason
why, actually, ADLaM has

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:16.410
gotten, because with their--

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:20.250
with the few means, they don't
have a lot, by whatever they

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:23.190
have, they invest a lot of
it into ADLaM and trying

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.780
to make it move forward.

00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.060
And the first guy that my
brother showed you here

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:29.393
is General Boubabacar Barry
in this slide, teaching-- he

00:37:29.393 --> 00:37:30.930
used to live in New York here.

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.380
They are the ones,
actually, who helped send

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.430
our guy across West Africa.

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:37.870
That guy-- a few years
ago, he took a tour.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:40.800
That's how, actually, ADLaM
spread in all these countries.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.270
And people learned about it.

00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:45.310
Because he took it all, he went
to Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana,

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:49.350
Benin, all the way to
Nigeria to teach people.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:52.590
And wherever he
went, he left a mark.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.750
And eventually that's
what will take off,

00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:57.440
and you will see later in
these slides that today,

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:02.170
ADLaM is taught everywhere
across West Africa.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:10.880
So in May 2014, we received the
first ADLaM chart, the codes.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.380
And we were very excited.

00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.950
But there were revisions
that needed to be done.

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:18.250
And we were invited
to come down to--

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:21.560
they had a technical
meeting in October of 2014.

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.270
So we drove down here.

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:26.760
And then asked us
all the questions.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.660
And then we were told--

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:32.840
[INAUDIBLE] were given the
hope that ADLaM will eventually

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.820
be encoded.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.400
We were hoping for the
next year, in 2015,

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.290
but it didn't happen,
because everything--

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:40.910
we had everything
hanging onto that.

00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:43.160
Like my brother was saying,
people write us, asking us

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:43.820
how can--

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:45.380
when will I be able to text?

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.080
When will I be able to go
online and just use ADLaM,

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.570
and we know that's not
possible without Unicode.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:51.790
But once that happen--

00:38:56.499 --> 00:38:58.540
so we were hoping it was
going to happen in 2015,

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:00.430
but unfortunately,
it didn't happen.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:02.610
It happened with Unicode 9.0.

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.724
And we were very happy,
and ever since then--

00:39:04.724 --> 00:39:06.890
that's where we've met some
of the people we've met.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:08.707
[? Ruzbeh, ?] is that
his name, I think?

00:39:08.707 --> 00:39:10.081
IBRAHIM BARRY:
[? Ruzbeh, ?] yes.

00:39:10.081 --> 00:39:11.770
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Yeah.

00:39:11.770 --> 00:39:13.890
And we established some
contact with him there,

00:39:13.890 --> 00:39:18.305
and then they started
working on the font,

00:39:18.305 --> 00:39:21.890
the [INAUDIBLE] of font for us.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:23.530
But after that, in
May, that's when

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.830
we got notified that
ADLaM has been approved

00:39:26.830 --> 00:39:29.830
for the release in Unicode 9.0.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.720
And so that was a
huge thing for us.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:32.680
Yes?

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:34.390
AUDIENCE: When you
guys were very young--

00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:35.380
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Yes.

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:39.807
AUDIENCE: Can I ask, how old
were you when you developed it?

00:39:39.807 --> 00:39:41.890
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Between
10 and 11, and my brother

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:43.030
was around 14.

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:46.240
AUDIENCE: OK, so that paves
the way for my next question.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.710
I've been working on a project
for spelling reform for Brazil.

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:51.910
It's a similar situation.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:54.280
A lot of people
can't read or write,

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:59.140
and the system for
writing down Portuguese--

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.850
it doesn't correspond well.

00:40:00.850 --> 00:40:02.500
The alphabet isn't
very well suited

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.660
to the pronunciation system.

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:09.100
So I really appreciate
what you did as children.

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.190
But one of the
difficulties that I

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:14.140
faced in trying to
propose a spelling

00:40:14.140 --> 00:40:17.980
reform for Brazilian
Portuguese is

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.220
how phonetic versus how phonemic
do you want language to be?

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.430
So, obviously I don't
speak your language,

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:27.700
but an example in English
would be the word "better".

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.810
So that sound in better, no
word starts with that sound,

00:40:30.810 --> 00:40:33.610
it's not really a t, we don't
say beh-ter, it's not a d,

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:37.450
we don't say beh-der,
like in David, beh-der.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:38.860
It's some intermediate
sound that

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.590
only exists between
a stressed syllable

00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:43.670
and an unstressed syllable.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:46.000
That's why we say photo,
but we say photographer,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.860
we don't say "pho-dographer."

00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:49.420
So this is like a
really subtle thing

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:52.710
for, I would imagine
someone, who's 11 years old,

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.070
to appreciate that.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:57.940
But you have to teach the
language to other people.

00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:02.200
So is this alphabet--
is it very phonetic?

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.950
Is it really the way
you pronounce it?

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:07.390
Or is it more abstract,
like you use a symbol

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:10.150
that maybe some people will
pronounce it one way in one

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.670
situation, maybe they'll
pronounce it another way

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:14.020
in another context?

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.040
Maybe someone in one region will
pronounce the symbol one way.

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.110
Maybe someone in another region
will pronounce it another way,

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:24.650
like "bet-ter" in
London Or "bed-ah."

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:27.700
How closely phonetic
is this alphabet?

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.050
ABDOULAYE BARRY: It's
very phonetic, actually.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:32.200
That's actually the
thing that makes it easy.

00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.410
Because we say the difference
between the alphabet

00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.470
for the Fulani
language, and English,

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:43.420
and the Latin alphabet for the
English language, is actually,

00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.580
we write what we say.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.412
It's exactly the
way we pronounce it.

00:41:47.412 --> 00:41:48.370
That's how we write it.

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:52.120
There is no sound there
that can be tweaked or--

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.640
is very phonetic, basically.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.940
ABDOULAYE BARRY: If it's a
dah, you see it written dah,

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:58.400
it's going to be dah.

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.850
Whether it's in
Guinea or whether it's

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:05.530
in RCA-- in the Central
African Republic, CAR.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:06.042
Or Sudan.

00:42:06.042 --> 00:42:07.000
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.583
That reminds me of
a quote by, I think

00:42:08.583 --> 00:42:11.770
it was Joseph Priestley,
the discoverer of oxygen

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:14.230
and inventor of
carbonated beverages,

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:17.255
said the only true and just
representation for a languages

00:42:17.255 --> 00:42:18.970
is it's spoken form.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:20.230
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Yes.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:21.325
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:42:21.325 --> 00:42:22.450
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Thank you.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:23.450
Great question, yeah.

00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:30.430
So if you have questions,
you can feel free to stop us.

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:33.520
So the next thing that we will
just talk about, if you go--

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.860
keep going--

00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:37.920
these are the projects.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.320
After ADLaM has
been encoded, one

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.980
of the things that we started
working on with [? Ruzbeh-- ?]

00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:46.510
oh, [INAUDIBLE] introduced us.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:48.520
He connected us,
[INAUDIBLE] font,

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.560
trying to get an
[INAUDIBLE] font for ADLaM.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.920
This has been done, finally.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:57.100
And we're still working on to
make [INAUDIBLE] some changes

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:57.850
to it.

00:42:57.850 --> 00:42:59.620
And then what we
really-- we're also

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.050
looking into ways to create
additional fonts that really

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:03.640
reflect how--
because the problem

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.223
that we have with
the [INAUDIBLE] font

00:43:05.223 --> 00:43:08.530
is that since we were not here
to work with those people who

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.470
developed or designed
the font for us,

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.960
so we could make the changes
as they were creating the font.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.720
So basically, we just
thought-- we gave them

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:19.090
a sheet of paper where
the letters were written,

00:43:19.090 --> 00:43:21.130
and then they created
the font from that.

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:22.960
And then we saw
the final product.

00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:25.404
But the first font, for
example, we created in Seattle.

00:43:25.404 --> 00:43:27.570
We were actually working
directly with these people.

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:28.841
And we were heavily involved.

00:43:28.841 --> 00:43:30.590
So we made all the
changes that we needed.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:32.740
So that's why we're
looking into making font.

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.790
And Craig has been helping
us a lot, tremendously.

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:39.100
He's created some really
cool stuff for us, tools

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:45.470
that we are able to use even
to convert from the Arabic--

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:48.100
the font that was based on
the Arabic code points--

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.910
to the new ADLaM code points.

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:54.220
And then the other thing
that we were looking into,

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:58.650
because you saw how the Fulani
people are spread from Senegal

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:01.320
all the way to Sudan,
we're looking into creating

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.910
a platform-- an
online platform where

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:04.800
people can learn the alphabet.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.210
Because right now,
the way people

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.880
learn is actually
through the apps.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:10.700
WhatsApp.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:11.840
What's the other one?

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.840
IBRAHIM BARRY: Telegram.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:13.923
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Telegram.

00:44:13.923 --> 00:44:14.520
And Facebook.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.290
We have many, many
groups on Facebook,

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:20.130
many groups on WhatsApp,
and many groups on Telegram,

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:21.540
where people actually learn.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.330
So we want to actually convert
that into an online platform

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:27.630
where people can actually
learn the alphabet.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:29.370
Because there are
too many limitations

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.729
with WhatsApp or Telegram.

00:44:31.729 --> 00:44:33.520
And the other things
that people do usually

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:36.780
is they take a picture and if
they want to send us a message,

00:44:36.780 --> 00:44:38.610
they'll write it
with their hands,

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.010
and them take a picture of
it, and then send it to us.

00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.570
Because right now,
we can't really

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:45.630
type in any of the instant
messaging applications.

00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:47.430
You can't type using the ADLaM.

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:49.290
And so we want to
create applications

00:44:49.290 --> 00:44:51.240
for learning and communication.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.890
And then the other
big project that we

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:55.410
have is the annual convention
that happens in Guinea

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:58.350
now, every year, eventually that
will move to other countries.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.480
So the people-- all of the
people who are involved

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.120
in ADLaM-- from all of
the countries in Africa,

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.290
and around the world, whether it
is here in America or Europe--

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:09.610
they gather every year in
one place, in one location.

00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.250
It just happened in December.

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:15.510
So this year, again, it will
happen in December in Guinea.

00:45:15.510 --> 00:45:17.010
People will meet
there and then talk

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:18.990
about all the progress
that has been made,

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.500
and all the projects that
we're trying to implement,

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:27.240
and all the exchange ideas
and discoveries in ADLaM.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.820
So we are actually
inviting Craig,

00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:32.580
if it's possible to attend
to the one that will be held

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:37.170
in Guinea the end of this year.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.990
So the next slides, we just
showed the pictures of ADLaM

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:41.910
being taught in the
different countries,

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:43.110
where they see Guinea--

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:45.360
if you can just keep scrolling--

00:45:45.360 --> 00:45:46.010
and then--

00:45:49.362 --> 00:45:50.820
IBRAHIM BARRY:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.350
ABDOULAYE BARRY:
So this is Nigeria,

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:53.600
and the country of Niger.

00:45:57.380 --> 00:45:57.920
Same.

00:45:57.920 --> 00:45:59.419
IBRAHIM BARRY: Nigeria.

00:45:59.419 --> 00:46:01.085
ABDOULAYE BARRY: This
is Benin and Togo.

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.499
This is in Sierra Leone.

00:46:07.499 --> 00:46:08.290
And this is Guinea.

00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:10.800
Fouta Djallon is a
region of Guinea.

00:46:10.800 --> 00:46:14.750
This is a graduation
all-girls school.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:15.250
Same.

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:18.200
This is all in Guinea as well.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.720
Cameroon is actually one of the
most dynamic place for ADLaM

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:23.690
right now, and a lot of
involvement new people who've

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:26.300
been working already in the
Fulani language who are getting

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:27.830
now involved with ADLaM.

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:29.450
And they will actually
be attending--

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:32.090
Harvard is organizing
a conference,

00:46:32.090 --> 00:46:34.610
because [INAUDIBLE]
been chosen as the book

00:46:34.610 --> 00:46:36.280
capital of the world.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.510
And from April
21st to April 23rd,

00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:41.810
they will be having
a conference there.

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:43.880
And they've invited
people who are involved

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.384
in ADLaM from Cameroon,
Nigeria and Senegal,

00:46:46.384 --> 00:46:48.800
who will be attending there
to make presentations as well.

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:54.310
So some of the
challenges that we face.

00:46:54.310 --> 00:46:59.860
I mentioned some of them, is how
to get ADLaM into smartphones.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:05.050
I was saying earlier, we have
at least 250 million users

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.120
of smartphones in Africa.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.690
And the thing is, because
Africa started late,

00:47:10.690 --> 00:47:13.750
so we are more
into mobile devices

00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:16.730
than we are into the
older technology.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:20.920
So if we really want to get
ADLaM to touch everyone,

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.750
because smartphones
are being used even

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:23.950
in the remote villages.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.520
So we need to have ADLaM into
smartphones and computers,

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.170
and especially with all the
different platforms that exist,

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:32.713
Android, Windows and iOS.

00:47:32.713 --> 00:47:35.890
And one of the challenges
that we have is,

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:38.140
most of the people-- we do
have some people today that

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.970
work on ADLaM as full time.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:43.510
They make it as their
full time activity or job.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:47.170
But most of-- because
right now, since we

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:51.880
are the ones who started
the ADLaM, the project,

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:54.910
and my brother has done a lot
of research in the language,

00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:56.740
so usually when
people write books,

00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:59.770
they have to send it to
him to review or edit them.

00:47:59.770 --> 00:48:01.220
And that takes a lot of time.

00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:04.930
So if you're doing this as
a side job, or as a hobby,

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:06.970
so it's not going
to really work.

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:10.360
That's why we have a
backlog of at least 23 books

00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:14.110
so far have not been reviewed
or edited for publication.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:16.810
And so that's why we have
materials and publication

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:19.030
issues, and that also
comes with funding.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:20.869
And this is an example
of the messages

00:48:20.869 --> 00:48:21.910
that people will send us.

00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:25.330
They'll write a message and take
a picture of it and send it.

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:26.456
Because they can actually--

00:48:26.456 --> 00:48:26.955
Uh-huh.

00:48:30.859 --> 00:48:33.400
AUDIENCE: When you review the
books, do you standardize them?

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:36.070
Because you showed
the map of how

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:37.970
dispersed-- you're
a nomadic people,

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:39.760
you're dispersed
all over Africa.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:43.030
So naturally we would expect
major dialectal differences.

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:47.770
So do you standardize the
spelling to, for instance,

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:48.400
your dialect?

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:51.707
How do you decide how
to standardize it?

00:48:51.707 --> 00:48:53.290
ABDOULAYE BARRY:
Well, that's actually

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:56.170
one of the amazing
things about ADLaM.

00:48:56.170 --> 00:49:01.360
Because as you said, we
have Fulfulde being spoken

00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.550
across thousands of miles.

00:49:03.550 --> 00:49:07.720
And what ADLaM has helped us
is standardize the language.

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:11.107
Because right now,
originally at the beginning,

00:49:11.107 --> 00:49:13.190
when we would talk to
someone who is from Nigeria,

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:15.315
we would have difficulties
communicating with them,

00:49:15.315 --> 00:49:17.410
because they speak in
a different dialect.

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:21.510
But now, all the people
who are learning ADLaM,

00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:25.990
or who are involved
in the ADLaM program,

00:49:25.990 --> 00:49:28.040
we all understand each other.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.620
So usually when we
edit the language,

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.805
we are not only
using one dialect,

00:49:31.805 --> 00:49:34.180
because the reason why we have
so many different dialects

00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.970
is also because we are so
mobile, we are nomadic people.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:40.150
So wherever we go, based on the
environment, and the people who

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:44.230
are there, we will borrow new
words from that community,

00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:46.000
and out into the
Fulani language.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.680
But what we are
doing right now is--

00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:52.240
the standardization just means
going back to the original.

00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:54.820
Because we all speak
the same language.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.780
Structure-wise
it's all the same,

00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.480
it's just the words that
are usually different.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.220
So we usually-- if, for example,
something is called in Guinea

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:03.700
in a certain way,
and it's called

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.590
in a different way
in Nigeria, we just

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:08.560
find the way it's called
in Fulani, originally,

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:09.730
and then we use that.

00:50:09.730 --> 00:50:11.380
That's one way we use it.

00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.720
And then [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:16.070
IBRAHIM BARRY: We're also
working-- we already collected

00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:18.790
more than 75,000 word.

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:23.140
So we working on the
autography of those word.

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.590
And from those
word, I am planning

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:29.770
to produce a dictionary,
a Fulani dictionary.

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:33.700
So as he said,
ADLaM have already

00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:37.930
help the language to start to
be standardized, because they

00:50:37.930 --> 00:50:40.550
are all using the same books.

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:45.010
And I can say 99
of the book come

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:47.810
through me before they go out.

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:54.920
So I am editing all the
book, so all the people

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:58.620
learning from those book are
learning the same language.

00:50:58.620 --> 00:51:00.899
AUDIENCE: So what do you
do if, in one region,

00:51:00.899 --> 00:51:01.940
they pronounce the word--

00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:04.398
I'm going to make up a word,
I don't know if this is a word

00:51:04.398 --> 00:51:06.620
in your language-- one
region they say "poo-lah"

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.660
but in another region
they say "poo-rah".

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:11.510
Like with an R. And
then somewhere else they

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:12.980
say it with an L.
Or in one region

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:15.210
they say something with a
B, and in another region

00:51:15.210 --> 00:51:21.040
they say it with a V. How do you
decide which region to favor?

00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:24.920
IBRAHIM BARRY: Like my
brother said, most of the time

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:28.580
we don't have that kind of
problem, of pronunciation.

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:34.100
Usually we have-- like in
Guinea, some time before,

00:51:34.100 --> 00:51:36.770
we didn't know how
we called police.

00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:38.870
We only called in French.

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:43.400
But there was another dialect
of the Fulani who has the word.

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.560
We actually use that word.

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:49.520
And [INAUDIBLE] people,
this is how we call police.

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:53.690
Before I started
traveling around Africa,

00:51:53.690 --> 00:51:56.630
doing research on the
language, we already--

00:51:56.630 --> 00:52:02.120
in Guinea we already have lost
the name of the seven days

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.390
in our language.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:06.200
We used to call them in Arabic.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:13.740
So in my traveling, I saw
one of the group of Fulani

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:19.540
who still have the
seven days of the week,

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.350
in the Fulani language.

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:25.760
And I use that one in all the
book, in all the newspaper.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.330
And right now, I can say
most of the Fulani in Guinea

00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:33.890
are using that one,
instead of the Arabic one.

00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:35.080
That how we are working.

00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:40.850
And people really like
the idea using whatever

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:42.070
we have in the language.

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:44.080
Not to borrow that one.

00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:44.970
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:44.970 --> 00:52:46.095
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Thank you.

00:52:46.095 --> 00:52:48.800
And the other thing that is--

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.840
we was-- even though Fulani was
written in Arabic many years,

00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:55.460
and everyone was
just writing based

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:57.900
on their own understanding.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.270
So there was no standard.

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:03.140
But what ADLaM is doing
is helping with that.

00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:06.180
So if you've written something--
and since the environment also

00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:10.450
informs, in many ways, how
people see certain things,

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:12.830
or how words are
added to the language.

00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:14.330
For example, there
are certain trees

00:53:14.330 --> 00:53:17.225
that exist in Guinea that
don't exist in Cameroon.

00:53:20.155 --> 00:53:22.640
But the Cameroonians
know of that

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:24.680
only through reading
French books.

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.270
So probably they
call that in French.

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:29.630
But since the trees
in Guinea will just

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.710
use the word the name that's
used in Guinea for that tree,

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:35.270
so the Cameroonian
Fulanis don't have

00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:36.665
to use the French word anymore.

00:53:36.665 --> 00:53:37.790
But that's how we're doing.

00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:41.540
So basically what the
language is the same.

00:53:41.540 --> 00:53:44.420
But it's just the borrowed
words or the environment

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:46.760
that's creating some
of the differences.

00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:49.730
And also there are some changes,
because where the Fulanis are

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:53.630
a very tiny minority, or where
the language has been heavily

00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:55.920
influenced by people
who actually learned it,

00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.820
but who are not originally
Fulanis, like in certain areas

00:53:58.820 --> 00:54:01.310
of Cameroon, if the structure
has changed a little bit,

00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:03.350
we can actually tell
when we sees it written.

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:05.660
So we just correct the grammar.

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:09.227
Or how-- because people usually
write the way they speak.

00:54:09.227 --> 00:54:11.560
And usually the way you speak
is not necessarily the way

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:12.530
you should be.

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:15.320
So those are the corrections
that we usually do.

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.810
And people understand them,
because most of the time

00:54:17.810 --> 00:54:19.660
it makes sense.

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:22.370
I don't know if
anybody has questions.

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:25.770
So let's see, next slides.

00:54:25.770 --> 00:54:29.190
So the other thing that
been happening in Africa

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:32.730
right now is a lot of people
have noticed the limitations

00:54:32.730 --> 00:54:36.720
of teaching people in
English, French, or Arabic,

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.020
because like I said earlier,
if you go to your house,

00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:41.130
you speak in Pular.

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:43.200
You go to the market,
you speak Pular.

00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:44.910
But the only time
you hear French

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:46.454
is when you go to school.

00:54:46.454 --> 00:54:48.120
Or the only time you
will start learning

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.330
French is actually the first
day you sent to school.

00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:52.890
That created a
lot of limitation,

00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:56.640
and policymakers have
been looking into ways

00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:01.650
to bring in our local languages,
at least as a way of teaching

00:55:01.650 --> 00:55:03.780
kids in primary school.

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:07.020
There have been some pilot
programs being done either

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:08.490
in Senegal or Cameroon.

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:11.830
And eventually, what that
means with [INAUDIBLE] ECOWAS

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:14.970
and the African Union already
choosing certain languages--

00:55:14.970 --> 00:55:17.700
transnational languages--
is that one day,

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:22.140
Fulani will be spoken
not just by the Fulanis,

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.942
but by more people in
West Africa, for example.

00:55:24.942 --> 00:55:27.150
So right now if there are
50 million speaking Fulani,

00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:30.510
eventually there could be 100
or more than 150 million people

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:31.069
speaking.

00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:32.610
Because the language
will be adopted.

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:34.910
And the language is the
language of the community.

00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:36.730
The people, we know each other.

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:40.862
So it would be easier to teach
somebody in Pular or Fulfulde,

00:55:40.862 --> 00:55:43.070
than to teach someone in
English, which is a language

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:44.740
that he's not familiar with.

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:47.910
So maybe, instead of
doing instruction,

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:50.850
learning in French, we
will actually learn French.

00:55:50.850 --> 00:55:54.990
But we'll do the learning
in Fulfulde, or Mandingo,

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:56.940
or Hausa, for example.

00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:02.407
So also, the other thing
that's the great with ADLaM

00:56:02.407 --> 00:56:04.490
is that since ADLaM is
spreading a lot in Nigeroa,

00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:06.210
we have a huge Fulani community.

00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:07.360
The Hausas are also--

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:10.440
some Hausas are
looking into adopting

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.980
the ADLaM alphabet to write
their own language also.

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:19.050
And the director of the African
Languages program at Harvard

00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:20.840
has also expressed
interest in using

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:22.710
ADLaM to write the
Swahili language,

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:25.320
because he learned that
Swahili and Fulfulde are

00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:28.740
both non-tonal languages.

00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:31.470
Because he's already looking
into another script that's

00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:35.550
used in Africa for Kikuyu,
which is a tonal language.

00:56:35.550 --> 00:56:37.290
But Fulani is not
a tonal language,

00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:40.000
so he thinks that ADLaM will
be more appropriate for that.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.125
So he'll looking into that.

00:56:41.125 --> 00:56:43.650
And he'll be at the
conference in Conakry.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.390
So there's also
a huge presence--

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:47.800
if you go on Facebook,
you look up Fulani groups,

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:49.470
you will see hundreds of them.

00:56:49.470 --> 00:56:52.050
We are very active
on social media.

00:56:52.050 --> 00:56:54.840
And many groups are promoting
not only ADLaM but all

00:56:54.840 --> 00:56:58.650
the aspects of the
Fulani culture.

00:56:58.650 --> 00:57:01.290
And there are many
movements supporting

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:04.610
the ADLaM, especially
in Nigeria, in Guinea,

00:57:04.610 --> 00:57:05.850
and Cameroon.

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:08.070
And so if you go
on social media--

00:57:08.070 --> 00:57:10.860
because Nigeria is the biggest
country in Africa, it's like,

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:13.060
more than 180 million people--

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:16.170
and if you get a list,
even 10% of those,

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:19.237
to get involved in something,
you create a huge impact.

00:57:19.237 --> 00:57:20.820
And that's what's
happened with ADLaM,

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:23.040
because since
Nigeria got involved,

00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:24.460
it's gotten really big.

00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:29.970
Whether it's online
or on the ground.

00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:31.760
And so they've opened--

00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.010
the way things are so big
there is that sometimes when

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:37.115
they doing a graduation ADLaM,
they actually do at stadiums.

00:57:37.115 --> 00:57:39.240
Which is very different
from Guinea, because Guinea

00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.770
is a small country of
only 12 million people,

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:44.410
compared to Nigeria, so.

00:57:44.410 --> 00:57:47.451
So this is where we stand today.

00:57:47.451 --> 00:57:50.380
I don't know if there's
anything else left.

00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.620
So yeah, these are
pictures of graduations.

00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:56.764
But we have so many
pictures, but we

00:57:56.764 --> 00:57:58.680
didn't want to turn the
presentation into just

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.390
a slideshow of pictures.

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:03.690
But if you go on Facebook,
you do a hashtag #adlam,

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:06.846
you might see a lot of
stuff, or if you go online.

00:58:06.846 --> 00:58:08.220
We are actually
creating websites

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.870
where we will collect
all of this stuff

00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:13.020
and put it there, for people to
know what's going on on ADLaM

00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:13.860
today.

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:17.220
So thank you all for listening,
and thank you for coming.

00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:19.740
And if you guys have any
questions, we'll feel free.

00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:22.270
We actually wanted to do only
30 minutes presentation and 30

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:25.050
minute questions, but so
many things we talk about.

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:27.090
But yeah, thank you so much.

00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:27.600
Thank you.

00:58:31.744 --> 00:58:33.660
SPEAKER: So you'll be
happy to take questions?

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:34.540
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Yeah.

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:36.956
AUDIENCE: And my question was
about sorting your alphabet.

00:58:36.956 --> 00:58:40.290
So when you made your alphabet,
how did you decide how you

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:42.760
so-- like in Arabic, you
have [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],

00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.349
but you went with
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:47.140
ABDOULAYE BARRY:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH], yes.

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:49.269
AUDIENCE: How did
you decide that?

00:58:49.269 --> 00:58:51.060
ABDOULAYE BARRY: I
think the most obvious--

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:54.490
it was the way we came
up with the letters.

00:58:54.490 --> 00:58:58.360
So sometimes we would
just make signs,

00:58:58.360 --> 00:59:01.230
and then when we'd pick a
letter from those signs,

00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:02.850
we will call the--

00:59:02.850 --> 00:59:04.870
we'll decide to
call [INAUDIBLE]--

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:05.920
give it a name.

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:08.230
And that's how we actually
organized the alphabet.

00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:10.480
Or if I think of a letter--

00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.710
for example, I had a friend.

00:59:11.710 --> 00:59:13.960
When I would go to class, I
would start writing things

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:14.920
to share with him.

00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.980
And then if I start writing
something and I'm blocked,

00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.620
stopped somewhere, because
I don't have that letter,

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:23.710
so that day if I go home, that's
the letter I'll be creating.

00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:25.720
So then I'll add it to the list.

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.860
And that's how we
completed the list.

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:31.270
And we never really--

00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:33.025
after we completed
the set, the 27,

00:59:33.025 --> 00:59:36.580
we really never went back
and changed the order.

00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:40.082
So basically we made the list
as we created the letters.

00:59:40.082 --> 00:59:42.540
But we already knew we wanted
to-- the [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:44.950
wanted to be the first
letter we created, of course,

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:47.170
because it was the first
letter of my name anyway,

00:59:47.170 --> 00:59:51.400
so I wanted it to
be the first letter.

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:54.337
And it's the first letter in
every other alphabet, almost.

00:59:54.337 --> 00:59:56.170
AUDIENCE: I have kind
of a related question.

00:59:56.170 --> 00:59:59.260
I was kind of struck by
how much attention there

00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.940
was to the aesthetics of it.

01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:03.550
Like, you started out with
this sort of automatic writing

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:06.296
and visualization, and
then you talked about some

01:00:06.296 --> 01:00:08.170
of these decisions,
like, do we join letters?

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:09.580
Or do we split them up?

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.710
And then you go into
these calligraphy classes

01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:13.300
to really kind of polish it.

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:17.200
So I guess I'd just
like to know what--

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.500
anything you want to say about
that attention-- real attention

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:22.750
to appearance?

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:24.550
What your overall
strategy is, how

01:00:24.550 --> 01:00:27.370
you think that maybe
has been beneficial

01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:30.190
for adoption and
reception of the language?

01:00:30.190 --> 01:00:33.490
I mean, clearly ADLaM is
successful, and as you've said,

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:35.379
there have been other
efforts to do this.

01:00:35.379 --> 01:00:37.420
So I'm wondering if the
aesthetic attention there

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:39.010
is part of that.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.160
ABDOULAYE BARRY: Yes,
it has always been.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.130
When we first created
the alphabet, the more we

01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:48.190
wrote books, the
more we realized

01:00:48.190 --> 01:00:49.690
we can refine the letters.

01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:51.220
And that's how you
saw the evolution

01:00:51.220 --> 01:00:53.950
from how we were writing all
of them joined and then we

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.720
went to unjoined letters.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:01.150
And also what do we notices
is, the better the letters look

01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:06.460
to people, the more interested
they are to the alphabet.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:11.290
Because the colonization
has had a huge impact on us,

01:01:11.290 --> 01:01:14.680
and sometimes it's
hard for us to look

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:18.580
into things that come from our
own culture as very valuable.

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:22.180
Because basically, for
colonization to succeed,

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.760
you have to basically
make people think

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.950
that they're not that valuable.

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:28.930
They have to take
everything from you--

01:01:28.930 --> 01:01:31.630
the language, the culture.

01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:36.190
So that mentality still
exists in our community.

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:38.080
So aesthetics a
lot of part of it.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:44.572
And like my brother said, when
we created the first keyboard,

01:01:44.572 --> 01:01:46.030
and then we started
typing with it,

01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:49.420
he realized that it didn't
look as good as he wanted.

01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.910
And that's how he got
interested into calligraphy.

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:54.080
And he's been making
amazing stuff with it.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.890
And it looks--
some of it looks--

01:01:56.890 --> 01:02:01.230
way, if you took what
we wrote in 1990,

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:03.320
you compare it to
what's coming out today,

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.445
from some of the stuff
that he's developing,

01:02:05.445 --> 01:02:06.721
it looks very different.

01:02:06.721 --> 01:02:07.720
And it looks way better.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:10.060
And yeah, aesthetics is--

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.620
especially in our culture, if
you go on YouTube, actually.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:19.000
Go look up the Wodaabe, you'll
see how Wodaabe people--

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:23.210
W-O-D-A-A-B-E-- look
that up on YouTube,

01:02:23.210 --> 01:02:26.050
and you'll see how beauty is
important in Fulani culture.

01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:27.640
And so--

01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.910
AUDIENCE: I was wondering what
you do about other symbols,

01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:32.140
like punctuation?

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:37.150
Do you have commas,
dashes, parentheses, stuff

01:02:37.150 --> 01:02:38.950
like that in your system?

01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:44.020
Or do you have regular
Latin or Arabic punctuation?

01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:45.700
ABDOULAYE BARRY: So
since the writing

01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:48.430
goes from right to
left, we use many

01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:50.470
of the Arabic punctuations.

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:52.750
And we do have some
different ones,

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:56.020
because the Fulani language is--

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.510
so my brother is actually the
one who came up with that--

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:00.730
when we are talking,
sometimes you'll

01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:02.860
say an affirmative sentence.

01:03:02.860 --> 01:03:05.050
If it's written--
it's not a question.

01:03:05.050 --> 01:03:08.470
But it's only a question
by how it sounds.

01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:10.900
So that's how we came up
with different symbols

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:12.970
to indicate whether a
sentence is actually

01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:15.610
a question before
you start reading it,

01:03:15.610 --> 01:03:19.576
so you know how to
change your tone.

01:03:19.576 --> 01:03:21.950
AUDIENCE: OK, so that's also
part of your writing system,

01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:24.350
is some of this
additional punctuation.

01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:25.420
Thank you.

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:29.410
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
how you typically represent

01:03:29.410 --> 01:03:32.080
numbers in the script?

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:39.360
Do you use the Latin digits,
ASCII digits one, two, three,

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:42.230
do you use Arabic, or do
you have your own digits?

01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:46.090
And do you usually use a
base 10 numbering system?

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:49.090
Or do you use something else?

01:03:49.090 --> 01:03:52.440
ABDOULAYE BARRY: So we
have our own set of digits,

01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:56.620
the 10 digits from 1 to 0.

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.320
We don't use the
Latin or the Arabic,

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.530
because basically
the problem also

01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:06.165
is, since the writing system
goes from right to left,

01:04:06.165 --> 01:04:10.550
and the way we read numbers
is also from right to left.

01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:15.250
So we created, also, digits
to represent numbers that also

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:17.210
go from right to left as well.

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:20.580
So if we're writing 1996,
for example, it would go--

01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:25.450
if somebody is reading--
it would be like 6991,

01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:28.990
if it's in Latin or Arabic.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:33.160
So we have our
own set of digits.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.730
And also the thing with
ADLaM is that since people

01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:39.770
view it as original-- when
we first created this,

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:41.840
it was just a way
for us to maybe solve

01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:44.720
a problem of standardization.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:49.240
By now, it has become something
bigger, as a way actually

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.710
to educate more people.

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:53.350
Because like my brother say,
we have a huge percentage

01:04:53.350 --> 01:04:56.530
of people that don't
go to school in Guinea.

01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:58.750
Or everywhere in Africa.

01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:03.660
But that's because education
is not done in our languages,

01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:05.194
it's done in foreign languages.

01:05:05.194 --> 01:05:06.610
So basically if
you don't know how

01:05:06.610 --> 01:05:08.334
to speak French, or
English, or Arabic,

01:05:08.334 --> 01:05:10.000
you are considered
an illiterate person.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.820
So a newspaper-- you will
not have access to it.

01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:14.590
Or information
given on the radio--

01:05:14.590 --> 01:05:17.270
you will not have
access to that as well.

01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:19.390
And one of the most
amazing things that--

01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:21.040
or the most fulfilling
thing for me

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:26.610
is, when my mom came here to
visit a few years ago, in 2012,

01:05:26.610 --> 01:05:31.420
and this area is very
different from Africa.

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.770
In Africa we live in
communities where everybody

01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:36.250
is outside, but here what
was very different for her

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:38.230
is the fact that
everyone lives inside.

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.810
When you go in your
house, you lock your door.

01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:42.700
And you don't-- you know.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:43.870
So it was very hard for her.

01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:46.770
So if we go to work, she would
spend all her day at home,

01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:47.980
not have anything to do.

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:49.660
So the only way for
her-- she's never

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:51.490
been to a French school
or English school.

01:05:51.490 --> 01:05:54.220
So she doesn't know how to read
or write in English or French.

01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:56.650
So the only way she can
pass her time all day

01:05:56.650 --> 01:06:00.480
was reading the
ADLaM newspapers.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:01.450
And one day she said--

01:06:01.450 --> 01:06:01.750
IBRAHIM BARRY: And books.

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:03.125
ABDOULAYE BARRY:
Yeah, and books.

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:06.460
And she said she did not
realize how lost she was.

01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:08.231
Because now she can
read the newspaper

01:06:08.231 --> 01:06:09.980
and know what's going
on around the world.

01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:13.570
And that was really amazing
for me, it had a huge impact.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:16.370
Like, even if it was
just left to this,

01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:18.880
if this was where it
was actually with ADLaM,

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:20.420
I'm satisfied.

01:06:20.420 --> 01:06:23.890
AUDIENCE: One of my models
for success in a language

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:27.890
is that people are able to
use it for everyday things.

01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:30.530
And texting is one
of those things.

01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:33.340
If ADLaM were available
on mobile devices,

01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.841
would young people be
texting their friends,

01:06:35.841 --> 01:06:37.840
lying to their parents
about where they're going

01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:39.190
after school, things like that?

01:06:41.810 --> 01:06:44.350
ABDOULAYE BARRY:
Yes, absolutely.

01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:49.030
Because like I said, people want
to use so bad, sp even to text,

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:52.720
they'll just write it
on a piece of paper

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.910
and take a picture
of that and send it.

01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:57.010
Just because they
want to text in ADLaM.

01:06:57.010 --> 01:07:00.400
And like I-- also
we said, most people

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:04.030
don't go to French
or English school.

01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:06.640
So it's easier for them to just
text in their own language.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.670
And if ADLaM is
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:11.850
And it's also, people feel
more comfortable writing

01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:14.510
in Fulfulde using ADLaM
than actually writing

01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:15.970
it using another alphabet.

01:07:15.970 --> 01:07:18.290
Because if somebody texts
you or writes something,

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:22.300
make a comment on Facebook,
in Pular or Fulfulde using

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.960
the Latin script, it's an
exercise to actually figure out

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:25.870
what's written there.

01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:28.900
Because nobody goes to school.

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.580
Most people don't go
to school and learn

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:34.750
how to write in Pular
using the Latin alphabet.

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:39.820
And since, as that question
about phonetic sense,

01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.410
ADLaM is very phonetic.

01:07:41.410 --> 01:07:43.890
So the way you read it is
the way-- or the way you say

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:45.010
is the way you write.

01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:50.140
So the chance of
mistakes is very slim.

01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:54.750
IBRAHIM BARRY: And like
I said at the beginning,

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:57.790
smartphone are everywhere,
but the only thing people

01:07:57.790 --> 01:08:02.090
do with their smartphone is
just calling and receiving.

01:08:02.090 --> 01:08:07.090
And now they know they can read
and write in their language,

01:08:07.090 --> 01:08:09.730
but they cannot do
the other functions.

01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:12.010
They cannot write
the name and save.

01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:13.660
The most of the time--

01:08:13.660 --> 01:08:17.290
most of the people I meet
who didn't go to school,

01:08:17.290 --> 01:08:22.330
they just memorize numbers of
the people they really know.

01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:24.100
They don't save names.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.310
Or they have is
notebook they write.

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:32.410
But if ADLaM is in their system,
they can write their name.

01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:34.710
Save their schedules.

01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:35.855
It's going to be amazing.

01:08:35.855 --> 01:08:37.355
ABDOULAYE BARRY:
And the other thing

01:08:37.355 --> 01:08:39.279
is also the economics of it.

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:42.109
Because it's cheaper
to text than to call.

01:08:42.109 --> 01:08:45.310
So people prefer to
send text messages.

01:08:45.310 --> 01:08:47.200
And like I said, we
are nomadic people.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.170
And even though we don't
follow cattles everywhere now,

01:08:50.170 --> 01:08:51.956
but it's basically in our blood.

01:08:51.956 --> 01:08:53.080
Fulani people travel light.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.810
It's very rare to see
a Fulani person who's

01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:58.420
living in the region
where he was born.

01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:01.240
And for that reason, people
are always communicating.

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.520
Figuring out ways to
communicate with each other.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:07.870
And texting is one of the most
amazing ways people can text.

01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:10.580
So there are Fulanis
everywhere in the world.

01:09:10.580 --> 01:09:12.460
So you can go to a
city, big city where

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:13.590
you will not find a Fulani.

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:16.569
And there's actually a saying
in our culture, or in Africa--

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:19.600
if you go to a place and you
see no Fulani there, move.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.100
Because that place is not good.

01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:23.800
IBRAHIM BARRY: The other tribes
say that, like the Mandingo.

01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:25.300
ABDOULAYE BARRY:
So we travel a lot.

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.779
And we need to communi-- we
need to stay in con-- because we

01:09:28.779 --> 01:09:30.229
were the only few
people also that

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:33.160
use-- it was part of our
culture to write letters

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:35.170
and go to the market
or to your park

01:09:35.170 --> 01:09:37.300
and give it to some
random person and say,

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:41.590
I have one of my relatives that
live in the city called Lola,

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:43.523
and I don't know
exactly where he lives.

01:09:43.523 --> 01:09:45.939
So I give him the letter and
then the person would take it

01:09:45.939 --> 01:09:49.899
and then go looking for certain
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] from

01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:52.660
[INAUDIBLE] until they find
him and give him the letter.

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:55.660
And then he will take the letter
to somebody who will read it.

01:09:55.660 --> 01:09:56.780
So yeah, communication.

01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.310
Texting.

01:09:57.310 --> 01:10:02.530
If we were able to text, that
would makes a huge difference

01:10:02.530 --> 01:10:04.660
for ADLaM and for the people.

01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:08.080
SPEAKER: I would love
to thank our speakers,

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.390
and our honored guests
from around the world.

01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:13.240
And all of the Google people.

01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:16.120
And all of the people who will
be seeing this later on Talks

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.490
At Google.

01:10:17.490 --> 01:10:22.940
[APPLAUSE]
