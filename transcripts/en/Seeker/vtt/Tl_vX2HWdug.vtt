00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.530
What if I wasn't here, but instead I was there
-- floating right in front of you?

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.970
Holographics bro.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.799
They're coming.

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.920
Greetings programs, Trace here for DNews -- Yes,
I'm really here, I am not a hologram...yet.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.580
There may soon be a day where I'll just pop
into your livingroom, into the palm of your

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.700
hand or I'll walk alongside you down the street.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.430
The idea behind holographic technology has
been around since the late 1940s when British

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.070
scientist Dennis Gabor coined the word hologram
-- from the Greek words meaning whole message

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.890
-- but those are a little different... we've
got these laser-based holograms on everything

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.499
from novelty toys, credit cards and money.

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.680
Since those post-War years, holograms have
jumped out of their little two-dimensional

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.859
windows into three dimensional space!

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.969
The most famous one recently was probably
from last year's Coachella -- where a holo-Tupac

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:49.969
made an appearance.

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.510
But the most widespread recognition of holographic
technology is on Star Trek with the Holodeck

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.420
-- a place where anyone can put themselves
anywhere thanks to 3D, touchable holograms.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.250
We're not quite there yet, though people in
the business of holograms DO think we'll see

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.850
a holodeck someday.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.439
But so far, all holographic technology is
really just visual trickery.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.310
The Coachella-Tupac wasn't floating in 3D
space, but projected onto an angled see-through

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.540
mylar screen, a technique that's been used
since Victorian times with mirrors and glass.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.310
It's essentially the same thing you'd see
at Disney's Haunted Mansion, if less shiny-happy.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.400
Holograms work because our eyes are tricked
into seeing something closer to us than it

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.400
is.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.430
Using a concave mirror, the "hologram" appears
to separate from the projector, but it's an

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.430
optical illusion.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.490
Similar to 3-D television and movies, if you
only had one eye and you didn't use both,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.310
it wouldn't be floating anywhere.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.549
Another holographic problem is the brain's
tendency to see problems in the world around

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.549
us.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.380
The Uncanny Valley is something we've talked
a bit about on DNews.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.560
If a hologram looks real, but isn't done quite
right the brain doesn't process it properly,

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.870
and we become uncomfortable, afraid or sometimes
even sick.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.999
We know something's wrong, but our primitive
cerebrum can't comprehend it and experience

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:00.460
this fear response.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.909
We've also yet to figure out how to get rid
of something to project ONTO.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.970
I've seen "holographics" try using smoke,
water, see-through screens, mannequins and

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.970
animatronics.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.420
But they're basically movies on a different
type of screen.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.480
While someday we'll be able to project ourselves
out of a droid; we're still in the dark on

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.480
that one.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.019
And we still can't touch it, that's a whole
other thing.

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.159
What do you think?

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:22.290
Are holographics worth it?

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.550
Thanks for watching DNews today!

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.550
Holo-atcha boy!

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.320
Come find us on Twitter, Facebook and Google
Plus to see behind the scenes stuff, suggest

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.040
stories or just chat with us.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.290
Me, Anthony and Laci are around, why aren't
you?

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.230
Thanks for tuning in guys, see you next time.
