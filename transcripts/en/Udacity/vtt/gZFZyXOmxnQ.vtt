00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.820
OOA is a requirements analysis technique developed by Abbott and

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.770
Booch in the 1980s. It concentrates on modeling real-world objects based on

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.950
their descriptions in natural language to produce an object analysis model.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.240
We will express these models primarily using UML class model diagrams.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.990
Object oriented analysis pays primary attention to the objects with which

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.570
a problem's concerned. Prior to OOA, on the other hand,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.760
the predominant method of analysis is analysis and design. With structure

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.830
design, also called functional decomposition. In contrast with OOA,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.570
functional decomposition was concerned with the functions that the solution,

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.300
that the solution was required to provide rather than the objects.
