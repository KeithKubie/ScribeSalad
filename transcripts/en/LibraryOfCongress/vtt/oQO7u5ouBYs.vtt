00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.310
&gt;&gt; Kelly link was born in
Miami, Florida, where she lived

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.380
in a quote half-finished
development for seven years;

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.180
a place where her father
chased peacocks off the roof

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.320
of his car in the morning.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.620
The rest of her childhood was
spent moving around from Tennessee

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.630
to Pennsylvania to North Carolina.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.030
This is so good because
I speak slower.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.010
I really wish you were
with me all the time.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.310
[ Laughter ]

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.130
As a teenager, she spent
a lot of time in malls

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.890
and owned a pet boa
constrictor named Baby.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.460
Her parents loved books.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.080
They could always be talked into
reading just one more chapter

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.490
of the Narnia books, one
more chapter of the Hobbit.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.470
"I became deeply attached to an
edition of the Wonderful Wizard

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.690
of Oz that belonged to
the dentist's office,"

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.620
she told the New York Times,
"It wasn't in great shape,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.880
by which I mean someone had bled
on it, maybe multiple someone's.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.360
She wasn't happy about it, but my
mother finally bought it for me

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.930
so we could bring it home.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.270 position:56%
Shortly after graduating college,
Kelly won a sweepstakes while living

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.000
in Scotland and got free
travel around the world.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.300
This is true.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.100
She had to answer three
basic geographic questions

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.040
and then a forth question
to break a tie

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.090
which was why do you want
to go around the world?

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.070
And she wrote because
you can't go through it.

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.120
[ Laughter ]

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.700
Kelly met her Husband, Gavin Grant,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.480
working at a used book
store in Boston.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.940
And in 2000 they founded Small
Beer Press, a leading publisher

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.010
of literary fantasy an science
fiction including her first two

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:41.870
critically acclaimed collections of
stories Stranger than Fiction 2001

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.370
and Magic for Beginners 2005.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.220
Kelly's many writing accolades
include three Hugo Awards,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:55.590 position:56%
a Nebula Award, Locus Award, a World
Fantasy Award, and a NEA fellowship

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.690
in creative writing, which is a
highly competitive fellowship based

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.450
solely on artistic
excellence and selected

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.040 position:56%
through an anonymous review process.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.860
And any questions about the program
you can ask us right over there

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.280
at the literature staff at the NEA.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.530
My name is Amy Stolls, by the way,
and I'm the director of literature

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.150
at the National Endowment
for the Arts or the NEA

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.790
which sponsors this
poetry and [inaudible]

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.680
at the National Book Festival.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.930
And I first came across
Kelly's work in 2006

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.540
when she was an applicant
to our program.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.230
The story she submitted was the The
Hortlak from Magic for Beginners,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.550
still one of my favorite stories.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.280
And I remember when it came up for
review before the panel I loved it

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.920
so much I was really to give the
hairy eyeball to anyone who didn't

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.550
like it, but they all
did, every one of them.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.710 position:56%
And in 2009 I got to work with Kelly
when she agreed to be a panelist

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.480 position:56%
for us and judge the submissions
that year, and I was such a huge fan

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.930
that I kind of felt like a
teenager who was getting to hang

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.230
with her favorite pop star.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.530
[ Laughter ]

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.190
And there were lots of others
like my at the time who insisted

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.240
that all their friends
read her books

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.360
and we couldn't understand why
she wasn't super famous yet.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.430
"How can you not know about her?"

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.540
We'd say. Well now more of
you do, many, many more.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.720
And if you don't, you will.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.120
This year she was named a
finalist for the Pulitzer Prize

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.470
for her latest collection
of stories, Get in Trouble,

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.300
which garnered starred reviews in
Publishers Weekly and [inaudible]

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.290
and elsewhere and appeared on a
slew of top recommended reading

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.260
and best of the year lists.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.070
As with her previous books, it's a
collection of very real characters

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.510
in very real relationships
dealing with very real problems.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.270
But the realities she paints are so
often tinged with something magical

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.500
or otherworldly or
superhero-ish or just strange

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.250
and funny and inexplicable.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.870
Publishers Weekly describes her
mix of humor and existential dread

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.080 position:56%
as if [inaudible] were hosting
Saturday Night Live and I love that.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.900
I'll make one final plug for
Kelly and the NEA and that is

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.600
that we just added Kelly's
book Pretty Monsters

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.060
to our NEA Big Read program

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.310
which supports community read
programs around the country.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.680
And again, if you'd like to
know more about that program

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.130
or just find our more fun
background information on Kelly,

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.310
and I took some of that
information from our website

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.090
for this introduction,
ask us after or check

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.480
out our website at NeaBigRead.org.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.510
And with that please
welcome Kelly Link.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:42.190
[ Applause ]

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:49.320
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you for
having me here for this.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:55.770
Timekeeper can I ask how
long and how many minutes...

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.250
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.840
&gt;&gt; OK. All right.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.830
Awesome. All right.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:11.780
So I am going to talk a little
bit about this collection

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.980
and about what I write in
general and then there's sort

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.320
of an audience participation
part and I'm going

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.620
to do two very short readings, but
after that there can be questions.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.090
I'm going to try and leave a
bunch of time for questions.

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:35.430
And in order to give you an idea
of the things that I'm happy

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.850
to talk about, I have been writing
-this is my forth collection

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.150
of short stories.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.520
Of the stories in Get in
Trouble, four were written

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:53.000
for young adult editors for
anthologies of young adult stories,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.240
four were written for
literary magazines,

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.770
and one of the stories
I wrote for myself.

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.660
And so I am happy to talk
about young adult publishing

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.630
or about young literary
magazines or about science fiction

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.970
because when I started publishing
I started in science fiction.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:15.700 position:56%
For years I was the editor of the
anthology series Year's Best Fantasy

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:21.660 position:56%
and Horror with my husband Gavin and
with Ellen Datlow, and so we used

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.010
to read very widely
any kind of story

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.570
that had any fantastic
element for consideration.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:35.230
I am also happy to talk to
you about writing in general.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.380
I live in North Hampton,
Massachusetts.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:45.430
My working method is as often as
possible during the week I meet

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.320
up with two other writers, both
of them young adult writers,

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.350
Holly Black and Cassandra Clare.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:56.560
And we either go to coffee shops
or we go to one of their houses

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.350
and we sit and all work together,
by which I mean we all sit

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.590
and either typewrite or all sit
at our laptops and type and talk

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:03.890
about what we're working on.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:09.820
And I think that sometimes people
who write themselves or even people

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.640
when they imagine the writer
imagines writers is working

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.490
in isolation, and I have
tried that and I hated it

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.840
and I never got anything done.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.180
And in fact, the only way for
me to get work done is to be

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.570
in the company of other people
who are doing their own thing

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:32.160 position:56%
so that I feel that I'm in a very
casual office with a bunch of sofas.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.570
So I'm happy to talk
about my working method.

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:41.230
So think about that.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.340
Think about any questions
that might come up.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.600
I would love to be helpful
to people who are interested

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.900
in writing or in publishing.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.450
I can also talk about small press
publishing because my husband

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:57.990
and I have been running Small Beer
for fifteen years now and that is

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.670
as much my working
life as the writing is.

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:07.340
So having said all that,
what I'm going to start off

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:11.690
with is a series of
horoscope readings.

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.620
A friend of mine who also lives
in North Hampton that I work

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.950
with sometimes, Jedediah Berry,

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:24.000
wrote a project -Kickstarted
a project

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.540
for something called the Family
Arcana which was a card deck

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:34.730
of fifty-two very short stories
about a family in the Northeast,

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.590
in the mountains in the Northeast.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:42.970
And he asked twelve writers
to provide one horoscope each

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:47.210 position:56%
as a bonus level for the Kickstarter
and so I got to write Gemini

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.570
and enjoyed it so much that I ended

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:54.340
up writing eleven more
horoscope short stories.

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.250 position:56%
And these were eventually published
in a magazine called Monkey Business

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:05.010
that comes out twice; first in
Japan in Japanese, it's a mixture

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:09.090
of American writers and
new Japanese writers,

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.530
and then they publish it
again in the U.S. in English.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:19.670
And so what I'll ask is if
anybody wants to yell out a sign

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:20.970
and I will read you your horoscope.

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.270
&gt;&gt; Capricorn.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:23.570
&gt;&gt; Capricorn.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.870
All right.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.170
[ Laughter ]

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.470
I'm going to do six and
then we'll come back to it.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.150
So Capricorn -and two of these,
by the way, I'm just going

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:34.940
to read something very short from
the collection Get in Trouble.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.360
Capricorn.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.200
All those rock cairns to
mark your good progress.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.530
Who comes along behind
you to knock them down?

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.830
Nevermind.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:46.230
This isn't a horror movie.

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:48.920
Under those cairns
only the sturdy dirt.

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.020
The only thing hidden,
what you choose to hide.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.110
Keep going, keep going.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.010
Make dinosaur noises
when you get sad.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.410
Everyone gets sad sometimes.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:02.910
When it gets dark, whistle a
tune or tell a knock-knock joke,

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.130
see who answers, mark the time.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.750
Your map brings you home
if you read it right.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.950
If there's a knock at the door
later on, don't open it or do.

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.940
Did something follow
you the whole way back?

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.050 position:56%
Was that why you left those markers?

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:18.350
Consult your map again.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.030
Anybody else?

[ Crowd yelling ]

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.350

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.120
[ Laughter ]

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.450
most clearly, which says
something about Torus.

Let's stay in bed.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:37.450
I'll tell you a story about the
grasshopper who loved the ant.

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:41.880
I will bring you peaches on a
gold plate, wine in a tooth mug.

So Scorpio is -I'm going
to read something very,

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.600
very short from the book.

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.490
This is from a story called
I Can See Right Through You.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:30.050
And I will say that some of these
I wrote for specific individuals

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:34.430
and so the actual horoscope itself
I wrote for Holly Black and it's

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:40.390
about DND, but the story
is about some movie stars

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:43.910
and this is a very
short piece of it.

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.850
Maggie tells the demon lover
a story: Two girls and, look,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.120
they've found a Ouija board.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.760
They make a list of questions.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.060
One girl is pretty.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.590
One girl is not really
part of this story.

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.810
She's lost her favorite sweater.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:03.340
Two girls each touching
lightly the planchette.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.640
Is anyone here?

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.380
Where did I put my blue sweater?

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.070
Will anyone ever love me?

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.380
Things like that.

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.680
They ask their questions.

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.410
The planchette drifts.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.900
They start the list over again.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.520
Is anyone here?

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.960
Will I be famous?

Where is my blue sweater?

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.830
The planchette jerks
under their fingers.

M-E. Maggie says, "Did you do that?"

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.780

The planchette moves.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.640
There is something animal about it.

H-E-L -hello, I am with
you, I am with you always.

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.060

love you always.

she says. "Who are you?"

Maggie says to the other girl.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.520
She shakes her head.

to know where my sweater is."

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:01.840

Will there be a knock
at the bedroom door?

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:05.750
But no one comes.

thing the planchette says over

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:33.310

were a better place,

00:15:18.390 --> 00:15:21.370
you could settle down
and live in it.

if I can turn up Pisces.

of presentation and talking

about this book because one
these are short stories,

and two because mostly the stuff
in it that is really the kernel

at the heart of the story are
things that I made up; ghost stories

or monsters or fantastic things.

00:17:25.570 --> 00:17:29.800 position:56%
It's a little bit hard to talk about
the research that went into it.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.700
In fact, the most research that
I have ever done for a piece

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.810
of writing I think
was for the horoscopes

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:41.290
because I really didn't know
a lot about most of the signs.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:45.260
So I figured what I would
do rather than talking

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.470
about the stories themselves,

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:52.010
unless you guys have
specific questions later on,

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:56.760
is that I would tell you a
couple of the ghost stories,

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.940
the true ghost stories,
that were inspirations

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.090
for some of the stories in here.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:08.340
I've kind of made a hobby

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.730
of collecting other
people's ghost stories.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.320
And when I write it's
not necessarily

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.870
that I'm including these
ghost stories verbatim,

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.030
it's just that I am trying to
capture something of the feeling

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:23.940
of the ghost stories that
people have been telling me.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:28.550
So the first two ghost stories
that I was going to tell you are

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:33.430
about a friend, and I asked if I
could tell these and she said yes.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:39.070
She grew up in a house in a
small town in Massachusetts,

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:42.120
which is not too far
from where I live now.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.960
And she said it was a
house that during the years

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.950
that she lived there, nobody
in her family really liked,

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:51.660
they all thought it was
kind of a bad place.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.790
And she has a lot of
stories about this house

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.100
and these are two of the stores.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:01.360
The first is a story
about Christmas Eve.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:08.020 position:56%
And it was a house very typical of
New England houses which was a stack

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.840
or row of rooms in the
downstairs with a hallway

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.820
with a staircase going to
the upstairs where, again,

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.250
there was sort of a row of
rooms going towards the back,

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:20.960
they were all bedrooms
and then a bathroom.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.740
And her bedroom was the first
bedroom at the top of the stairs

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:30.470
and she had in fact moved her bed
away the wall next to the hallway

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.960
because the hallway
gave her a bad feeling

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.360
and so she slept on the other wall.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.440
But from her bed, if her room was
open, she could see that hallway.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.240
And so Christmas night she
said everybody had gone to bed,

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.250
all the kids, her sisters and
brother and she had gone to bed

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.390
and her mother was downstairs.

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:50.990
And she said that she
was lying in bed

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:55.070
and heard somebody begin
to come up the stairs.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.310
And she said when they got to
the top of the stairs she should

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.830
of been able to see
them on the landing,

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:03.380
but in fact there was nobody there.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:06.610
And so she was sort of trying
to figure out what was going on

00:20:06.610 --> 00:20:09.530
and then she heard the
footsteps start to go back

00:20:09.530 --> 00:20:11.860
down the staircase again.

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:15.710
And she said there were
twelve stairs in the flight,

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.610 position:56%
and so she counted and she heard
them go all the way back down again,

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:22.280
and then she heard them
come up the stairs again.

00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.320
And she counted and when she
should have been able to see them

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.030
on the landing, there
was still nobody there.

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.850
And so she said she lay there
watching the hallway as somebody

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:35.230
or something went down the stairs
and then back up the stairs again

00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:42.040
until finally her mother who was in
the living room downstairs yelled,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.610
"Would you kids go
the hell to sleep?

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:45.910
It's late!"

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:51.180
And she said that the
footsteps stopped.

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.410
And she said that she waited and
she still couldn't go to sleep.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:56.080
And about fifteen minutes
later they started up again.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.990
She said it just kept on
like that all night long.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:03.910 position:56%
And then the other story, one of the
things she had to do when she was

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:09.060 position:56%
in her senior year of high school
was keep a scrapbook about her life.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:13.210 position:56%
And so she had gone to a U2 concert,
and she was sitting at her desk

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:19.020
and she was putting the ticket
-she was drawing some stuff

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.320
and writing about it.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.660
And when she went to glue the
ticket into her scrapbook,

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:27.430
the glue stick wasn't there.

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:31.200 position:56%
And she's a very organized person
still, she says she always has been.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.910
And so she looked and it was not on
the table where she thought it was.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.380
And so she looked around the desk.

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:38.680
She looked to the side of the desk.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.430
She looked behind the
desk, she looked under it

00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:42.510
and there was no glue stick.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:45.880
And so she sort of turned
around to look at the room

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.050
and it was lying on her pillow.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.190
And so she went and took the
glue stick and brought it back

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:54.150 position:56%
to the desk and she put the ticket
in, and she did a couple more pages.

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.370
And then she reached for the
glue stick, and once again,

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:58.210
the glue stick wasn't there.

00:21:58.210 --> 00:22:01.110
And so she looked under
the desk and beside it,

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.820
she looked at the pillow
and it was not there.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.790
And so she went downstairs and
she was very discombobulated,

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:10.410
so she said, "I'll make
myself a sandwich."

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.270
And so she went through the living
room through the dining room

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.860
into the kitchen and opened
up the refrigerator door.

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.670
And when she pulled
open the cheese drawer,

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:23.460
the glue stick was
in the cheese drawer.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:25.910
[ Laughter ]

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:30.830
And so a couple of -actually, last
Halloween I got to do an event

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:34.570
at the Harvard Book Store where
they turned off all the lights

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:38.490
and they had me and one of my
favorite writers, Samantha Hunt,

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.260
come and do a very short reading

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:44.370
and tell some ghost
stories with the lights off.

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:49.660
And then at midnight they allowed
everybody who'd come to the reading

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.730
to go around the store
with flashlights and shot

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.870 position:56%
from midnight to 1 AM by flashlight.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:56.540
It was a great event.

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.680
It was a ton of fun.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.360
And I told one of those stories
and afterwards a woman came up

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.750
and she asked me what town
my friend had lived in.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.280
She said, "Oh it's
not the same town.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:09.270
I thought it might
be the same house."

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.530
[ Laughter ]

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.790
And she said that she had
lived in a very similar house

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:18.560
and she had lived there
with her mother, her cousins

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:20.800
and their parents and
her grandmother.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:26.820
And she and her cousin -actually,
I think her house had a hallway

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.790
down the center, she
had a bedroom one side

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:31.040
and her cousin had a
bedroom on the other side.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.500
And late at night when she
was supposed to be sleeping,

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.050
they couldn't cross the hallway
because it made too much noise

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.270
and so instead they would
each sit in their doorway

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.950
and they would play
cards in the hallway.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.450
And they were doing that
one night and looked up

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:50.490
and somebody was standing at the
end of the hallway, it was a woman

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.170
in very old fashioned clothing
and they didn't not recognize her,

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:55.470
it was not their grandmother.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:24:00.100
And she said, "Don't you think you
kids should be in bed right now?"

00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:05.120
And then this wave of terror came
over them and so they both started,

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.680
without saying anything,
leaving the cards

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.990
in the hallway, went to their beds.

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:12.920
And she said she got in bed and she
closed her eyes very, very tightly

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.700
and she felt the person come
down the hallway and stand

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.720
in the doorway just looking in
at her, but she wouldn't look.

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.110
And she said after that
they never talked about it

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:25.100
and they never played
cards in the hallway again.

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.190
[ Laughter ]

00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.730
But years later they were at
a -everybody had come home

00:24:29.730 --> 00:24:33.750
for Thanksgiving and she was in the
dining room setting up some stuff

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.470
and she heard somebody
drop a lot of plates

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:39.030
in the kitchen and break them.

00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:41.650
And so she came into the
kitchen and it was her cousin

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:45.090
that had dropped all these plates
and it was because her mother

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:47.710
and her cousin's mother had been
talking and one of them had said

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:49.510
to the other, "I saw that
ghost again last night."

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:52.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.690
And apparently saw the ghost,

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.510
but until this moment nobody
had ever talked about it.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.170

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:06.400
We live in a very old farmhouse in
North Hampton that has no ghosts,

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.160 position:56%
but any time that I drive through a
small town in Massachusetts I think,

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.020
"I bet there are a lot of
ghosts in these houses."

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:18.510
So I'm going to a couple
more horoscopes.

00:25:18.510 --> 00:25:19.810

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:21.200

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.280

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.690
All right.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:30.650
Who wouldn't prefer to be
the star of a romcom instead

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:34.120
of splatter her Thin Man
movies over [inaudible]?

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.500
Every present I ever gave you,

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.120
you divine the contents before
the lid came off the box.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.030
So you know the course of true
love never did run smooth.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:48.500
Into every life a little
reign of terror must fall.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:50.260
Into every life.

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.420
Remember when we didn't
know each other?

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.710
Our paths never crossed.

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:57.290
I hate to have to leave,
but here we are.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:58.590
Take good care.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.090
Watch old screwballs.

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:02.400
Nevermind the zombies,
they're from the other movie,

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.150
the one I watched coming
home on the plane.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:09.140
When I get home, we'll sleep in.

This is the one that I wrote for
Jed's project for the Family Arcana.

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:21.000
And the idea with Family Arcana
is that you either shuffle it

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.500
and deal yourself a hand or
else you do it with a group

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.090
and sort of takes turns reading.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.520
And so the story which is made

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.060
up of little stories
changes every single time.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.570
It's a ton of fun.

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:33.570
So the horoscopes that
people wrote were ones

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:35.590
that people could add
in if they wanted.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:39.590
Last night you had a realization;

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:43.300
no one will ever love you
as much as you love you.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:48.390
On the other hand, no one will hate
you as much as you hate yourself.

When you fell asleep you dreamed you
heard two voices in a room talking

about the possibility of
life on other planets.

the only one there was you,

half of you is divine.

some day, but let's not think

about that right now, OK?

even tell the difference?

up there, it's so much easier

to believe this will
all work out one day.

I'll tie it around my waste.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:13.110
to write something really scary.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:17.710
And it's a story that someone
told me at a dinner party.

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:25.400
She said that she lived in a small
town in Texas and that for years,

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:33.030 position:56%
sort of between the ages of ten and
fourteen, she had a recurring dream.

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:36.030
And in this dream she would
be walking down the street

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:40.650
of her home town and a man
would be walking towards her.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:44.020
And he didn't always look
the same from dream to dream,

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.520
sometimes he was older or younger,
sometimes he was clean shaven,

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.510
sometimes he had a beard, but
she always recognized him.

00:31:51.510 --> 00:31:53.890
And she always knew that
when they finally met

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:56.310
that something very
bad would happen.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:00.230
And so one night when she had
this -and the other thing was

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.950
that she would always wake up
before they encountered each other

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:05.250
and said anything.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.840
So one night she had this dream

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:11.920
and for the very first
time they met face to face

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.330
and she said, "What is your name?"

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:17.100
And he said, "My name is Sammy."

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.470
And she was so afraid at that
point that she woke herself up

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:26.270
and she could not go back to sleep
so she went to her sister's bedroom

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:29.540
and she said, "I just
had a really bad dream.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.570
Can I get in bed and
sleep with you?"

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:34.230
And her sister said, "What is it?

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.190
Is it Sammy?"

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:39.570
and she said, "How
do you know Sammy?"

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:42.240
and her sister said,
"I don't know Sammy,

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.820
you just brought him
in the room with you."

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.830
So she turned on the
lights and realized

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.780
that in fact her sister was still
asleep so she woke her up and said,

00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.080
"What did you say to me?"

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.700
and her sister said, "I
didn't say anything to you.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.570
I was asleep."

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:01.060
And the end of that story is
she never had that dream again.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:03.110
[ Laughter ]

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:07.010
But after I heard that story,
I laid awake for many nights.

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:08.310
[ Laughter ]

00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:11.460
Flat on my back until
finally I called a friend

00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.880
and told my friend this
story after which I was able

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:15.550
to sleep and my friend was not.

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:17.920
[ Laughter ]

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.370
So I tell that story as
often as I can in hopes

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:22.010
that you too will be
unable to sleep.

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:23.570
[ Laughter ]

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:29.410 position:56%
And eventually everybody will know
this story, even people named Sammy.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:34.650
So I'm going to tell
you the Cancer horoscope

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:38.390
and then I hope you
have some questions.

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:40.650
Everyone loves a good story.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:45.630
Scuba divers take paperback
novels to read on the way down.

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:47.930
All those Stations of the Cross.

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:51.580
Once you've opened a book under
water though, don't bother trying

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:53.970
to find your place on dry land.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:56.710
Anyway darling, it's
better downwards wetter.

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:59.110
Why are you always crying anyway?

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:00.890
Is it because you know
what happens or is it

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:02.980
because the pages are
all stuck together

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.020
and you're worried
you'll never find out?

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:08.050
If the sea gets too far
away, fill up a basin

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:11.540
and take a long bath,
let the water get cold.

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:15.110 position:56%
If the ending is sad, don't tell me.

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:19.930
And I'll say that that one -years
ago there's a friend of mine,

00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:21.230
the writer Karen Joy Fowler,

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:26.630
told me that scuba divers actually
do take paperback novels with them

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:30.790
on dives and you can read them
as you are sort of waiting

00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.390
for equilibrium for your oxygen,

00:34:32.390 --> 00:34:35.760
etc. And then aboard the ship there
will be a collection, a library,

00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.040
of all these paperbacks that
have been read under water,

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:46.260
which you can no longer read on
dry land, but when you go back

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:49.590
down under water you
can read them again,

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:52.110
and I thought that was incredible.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:56.160
So I've been waiting a long
time to use that in a story

00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.850
and it seemed appropriate
for Cancer.

00:34:57.850 --> 00:35:03.170
So does anybody have questions
about writing or about publishing

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:05.760
or about young adult
genre in general?

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.060
Yep.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.360
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible]?

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:16.280
&gt;&gt; That's a great question.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.510
So when I write short stories,

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:24.390
does the fantastic element
come first or the real?

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:29.330
I think what comes first
is often something weird,

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:35.540 position:56%
maybe a fantastic element or it may
just be sort of an idea of some sort

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:40.520
of strange thing that happens to
somebody which then I can sort

00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:45.410
of begin to add a fantastic
element to.

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:49.040
I think at least the stories that I

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:52.090
like best there is
often a supernatural

00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:54.050
or a fantastic element it.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:58.360
There's some stuff which feels
much more like everyday life,

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:01.930
and then there's stuff which is
neither supernatural nor real,

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.270
but is just kind of
what I almost think

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:07.290
of as the most interesting
kind of gossip,

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.080
the things that happen to people.

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.620
For example, my sister once told
me a story about a friend of hers

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.580
who went to a wedding and stayed
in a B&amp;B and there was a lot

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.110
of taxidermy in her bedroom.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:21.490
And so every night, she stayed
there I think two nights,

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:25.250
the first night there was a lot
of weird wrestling, and she turned

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:26.610
on the light and there was nothing.

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:28.150
The second night she
heard more wrestling.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.110
She turned on the light and
there were beetles flooding

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.750
out of this piece of taxidermy.

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:33.050
And I said, "What did she do?

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:35.150
And my sister said, "I don't know."

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.290
[ Laughter ]

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:41.710
The only part of the story that
stuck with her was the beetles.

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:45.740
And so things like that I often
think sure you can have a ghost

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.910
story, but there needs to
be something beside a ghost.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:54.230
There has to be something which
you think, "Yeah that could happen.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:56.910
That would be terrible,
but it could happen."

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.820
And then somehow that balances
out the fantastic element.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.030
And then usually the
last thing is...

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:04.040
[ Laughter ]

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:08.170
Thinking about the kind of people
who are either causing the things

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:12.600
to happen or who the
things are happening to.

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.690
And thinking about people
and their lives come last,

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.990
but it usually takes the most work.

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.290
Yeah?

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:24.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm a big fan
of you and John Crowley.

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah?

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:27.440
&gt;&gt; And I noticed that you
published his Endless Things.

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.740
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.970
&gt;&gt; And I didn't know if there as
an interesting story behind that,

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.260 position:56%
and if there isn't, I was curious...

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.500
[ Laughter ]

00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:37.500
Your writing and your publishing,

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:39.730
what's the relationship
between the two?

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:41.160
Does one fuel the other?

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:44.140
Are they parallel things,
activities?

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:52.860
&gt;&gt; Sure. So we published the last
book in a sequence by John Crowley,

00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:58.950 position:56%
who also has a long happy career in
sort of more traditional publishing,

00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:05.520
and he came to us I think
because I'm not entirely sure.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.860
We knew each other, I am
a big admire of his work.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.450
One of his books, Little Big,
is one of my favorite novels.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:17.150
And I think he wanted to do the
book in a very particular way

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.840 position:56%
and he wanted to run off this
series and meanwhile he was embarked

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:26.330 position:56%
on these other projects for his long
time editor and so we got to do it.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:31.360
I think it was not a book that
required a lot of editing.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:37.460 position:56%
And the only other interesting thing
about it was that he found the art

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:44.080
for the cover which was an image by
the photographer Rosamond Purcell

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:49.420
which was perfect which indicated
to me that he had a very clear idea

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.970
of the book as an object as
well as the end of a sequence.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:39:01.410
And we ran our first Kickstarter
in the spring which was

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:08.260
for another weird project
that he wanted to do.

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:11.390
He is somebody that I
would be happy to work

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:13.450
with anytime he has
something that doesn't fit

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:17.390
in with his regular
publishing schedule.

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:22.790
And the project that we
Kickstarted will come out;

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:29.250 position:56%
it's his loose translation of a
very old book, The Chemical Wedding,

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.820
and again he found an artist
that he wanted to work with,

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:37.440
it's what you call profusely
illustrated this artist.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.390
And I also love his short
stories; if he ever wanted

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:45.200
to do another collection, we
would be very happy to publish it.

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:51.500
In terms of publishing, I
spent about a third of my time

00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:54.890
on Small Beer work
editing novels or working

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:58.140
on cover design or
reading submissions.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:01.740
And we've gotten to
publish Le Guin, Joan Aiken,

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:05.040
Karen Joy Fowler, Ted Chiang.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.430
And some debut writers like Sofia
Samatar and Nicole Kornher-Stace.

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:13.700
So part of it is just
I really like the work

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.820
of producing physical books,
but it's also, as a reader,

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:23.120
I get to work with a lot of people
that I would have killed to sort

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.560
of work with in some capacity,

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.350
except we don't have
to kill to do it.

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:28.680
[ Laughter ]

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.110
Yes?

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:33.370
&gt;&gt; Hi. You mentioned at the
beginning of your talk -I'm sorry,

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:34.930
I'm like really short
and struggling.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:37.030
You mentioned at the
beginning of your talk

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:39.350
that you write specific
stories for young adults.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:40.650
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:41.950
&gt;&gt; And then specific stories

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:43.620
for literary magazines
and stuff like that.

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.000
So what do you consciously
do differently when you write

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.540
for each I guess genre, and
do you have a preference?

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:52.840
&gt;&gt; I don't.

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:55.260
I realized I think as I was
putting this book together

00:40:55.260 --> 00:41:01.040
that sometimes what I'll do
is I'll tackle a sort of idea

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.390
from the direction of a
young adult sort of thinking

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:10.250
if it's a young adult project and
then I will often come back to it

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:15.960
as an adult project with sort
of the same thematic material.

00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:20.640
And a long time ago I heard
an editor describe young adult

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:25.980
as any narrative in which
somebody is experiencing something

00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:30.850
for the first time; figuring
out something about themselves,

00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:37.430
finding a sphere in which they want
to exist, moving into that sphere,

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:43.260 position:56%
coming into a certain kind of power,
forming long-lasting relationships

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:47.760
that are voluntary, make
a family for one's self

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:50.630
or having an experience
which is sort

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:55.260
of a first betrayal or
something like that.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:59.380
I think that the difference with
an adult story is you get to write

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:04.980
about people who maybe this is
more recursive, maybe this is more

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.200
of a pattern with them, maybe it's
something that has happened over

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.600
and over again or maybe this time
is the time that is different.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:16.940
I think all stories in some way are
about the moment in somebody's life

00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:22.420
where something happens which is so
dramatic that it becomes a story.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:26.330
So there's a lot of overlap between
young adult and adult stories,

00:42:26.330 --> 00:42:31.210
I think the difference is -Holly
Black said to me, we were talking

00:42:31.210 --> 00:42:33.000
about the two different
kinds of stories, she says,

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.400
"Well I always read young adult
stories I always think they'll

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.010
probably be OK, they'll
figure stuff out."

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:39.450
[ Laughter ]

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:44.280
And I think when you read stories
that are adult stories you think,

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:47.010
"Oh buddy that was your last shot."

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:48.310
[ Laughter ]

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:50.550
I don't know that you
can recover from that.

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:52.930
So that's the difference;
it's you think

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:58.280
that person is a little more fixed
in their life and maybe has things

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:03.180
that have lasted a little longer
that are at stake for them.

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:08.340
But because all adults were
at some point young adults,

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:11.350
there is something universal about
writing from the point of view

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:15.880
of a young adult character or
about writing about those concerns.

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:19.380
I think that for many
people who like

00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:22.740
to read the reason why young
adult literature is so popular is

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.820
because you felt really
strongly when you were that age

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:30.460
and those emotions and that
feeling is still accessible

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.950
to you no matter how old you are.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:36.530
You think, "oh yeah,
I remember that."

00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:38.940
In fact, some of you might
think, "I still feel that way.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:40.240
That is a feeling that I have."

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.270
So I hope that...

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:44.570
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:45.870
&gt;&gt; Your welcome.

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:50.950
&gt;&gt; I've always liked how vivid
the settings of your stories are.

00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:55.570
Do you ever go to, I guess,
evocative places in your own life

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:59.110
like haunted houses, old
buildings, things like that?

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:04.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you because I
always feel in terms of description

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:08.010
that I do as little as I
can possibly get away with.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.310
[ Laughter ]

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:13.400 position:56%
And that the goal is to make the
reader -that that's one of the kinds

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.690
of work that, at least in
short stories, I feel I'm going

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:20.870
to shove off onto the reader,
I'm going to put in some detail

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:24.940
and then I imagine that what
they see is probably different

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:27.400
than what another reader sees.

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:31.220
Having said that, there are a
couple of stories in Get in Trouble

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:35.090 position:56%
that are different than the other
stories in the sense that I set them

00:44:35.090 --> 00:44:37.700
in places where I had
lived for a long time;

00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:42.210
Florida, Carolina and Boston.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:49.960 position:56%
And those are all places that I
lived as a child or as a young adult

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.720
and then came back to as an adult,

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:55.670
and so I had this double
layer of experiencing them.

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:59.270
And so I think probably
the most unusual location

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:03.480
in those stories is the Land of
Oz theme park up in the mountains

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:07.020
of North Carolina,
which was a real place.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:09.150
In fact, you can find lots
of pictures of it online.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:11.030
I went there many times as a kid.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:15.390
It was really kind of
a boring theme park.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:19.180
You walked down a yellow brick
road, there was a gondola,

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.910
there was a fudge shop,
and at different sort

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:26.390
of stations you would see
part of the story acted out,

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.820
so it was fun to put
that in the book.

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:31.320
And I see that we are at time so...

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.620
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:35.010
&gt;&gt; Yep. You can ask
me at the signing.

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:36.310

00:45:36.310 --> 00:45:38.110
