the emotions when it shows up and it's
 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.620

and rationality don't tend to interface

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750
and rationality don't tend to interface
 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.350
and rationality don't tend to interface
with one another very well and some of

the language that we're hearing from
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.860
the language that we're hearing from
from the extremes on both sides of the

from the extremes on both sides of the
 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.440
from the extremes on both sides of the
political spectrum I'm not sure that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
political spectrum I'm not sure that
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.180
political spectrum I'm not sure that
calling it a spectrum is really apt but

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190
calling it a spectrum is really apt but
 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.610
calling it a spectrum is really apt but
everyone's familiar with it so the

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620
everyone's familiar with it so the
 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.250
everyone's familiar with it so the
extremes on the right and on the left

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260
extremes on the right and on the left
 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.490
extremes on the right and on the left
are both using fear to further polarize

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500
are both using fear to further polarize
 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.830
are both using fear to further polarize
people and you know I the people on the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840
people and you know I the people on the
 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.899
people and you know I the people on the
right are easy the people on the far

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909
right are easy the people on the far
 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.209
right are easy the people on the far
right the extremists on the right are

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:09.219
right the extremists on the right are
 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.449
right the extremists on the right are
both I think a smaller group and better

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459
both I think a smaller group and better
 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.890
both I think a smaller group and better
armed

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900
armed
 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.979
armed
thus in some ways more terrifying but

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989
thus in some ways more terrifying but
 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.080
thus in some ways more terrifying but
there are so many fewer of them that

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090
there are so many fewer of them that
 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.660
there are so many fewer of them that
they don't seem to have as much voice in

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670
they don't seem to have as much voice in
 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.600
they don't seem to have as much voice in
society as the growing numbers of

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610
society as the growing numbers of
 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.199
society as the growing numbers of
extremists on the left who are using

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209
extremists on the left who are using
 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.140
extremists on the left who are using
words and increasingly in the case of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
words and increasingly in the case of
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.940
words and increasingly in the case of
some of the the group's violent tactics

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950
some of the the group's violent tactics
 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.199
some of the the group's violent tactics
but they don't they don't tend to be

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209
but they don't they don't tend to be
 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.759
but they don't they don't tend to be
armed and the way the extreme right is

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769
armed and the way the extreme right is
 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.490
armed and the way the extreme right is
and so it's easy for people to imagine

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500
and so it's easy for people to imagine
 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.920
and so it's easy for people to imagine
that I was dangerous but shutting down

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930
that I was dangerous but shutting down
 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.460
that I was dangerous but shutting down
dissent shutting down the ability to

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470
dissent shutting down the ability to
 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.660
dissent shutting down the ability to
discuss ideas is actually the beginning

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670
discuss ideas is actually the beginning
 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.890
discuss ideas is actually the beginning
of the death of democracy so why does it

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900
of the death of democracy so why does it
 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.280
of the death of democracy so why does it
work it works because since people have

work it works because since people have
 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.899
work it works because since people have
been social which is to say since before

been social which is to say since before
 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.099

people were people since since we were

people were people since since we were
 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.410
people were people since since we were
