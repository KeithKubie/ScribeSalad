00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.780
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hi everyone.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.180
My name is Erica Chung and I work in People
Operations and I also work on the @Google

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.010
Talks team in New York.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.290
And today, it is my great, great pleasure
to introduce Kristi Yamaguchi to Google [phone

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.420
rings in background].

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.990
Kristi, I think you guys all know, but she
is the 1992 Olympic figure skater Champion.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.090
She's also a winner of a recent season of
"Dancing With the Stars" and she had recently

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.880
added best-selling author to her litany of
accomplishments.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.710
[giggles] And her book is called "Dream Big,
Little Pig."

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.229
So, we're gonna ask her to actually do a reading
for us today.

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:45.249
Kristi's also--on a personal note--my childhood
hero.

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:46.550
So I am absolutely thrilled.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.309
[audience laughs] I can't tell you how excited
I am to be sitting here right now.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.969
So, Kristi, I thought we would just start
by talking a little bit about figure skating

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:57.969
and your journey.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:58.969
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: OK.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.750
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And I understand that--correct
me if I'm wrong--but I believe you had started

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.110
skating as a form of therapy to correct clubbed
feet.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.110
Is that true?

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.230
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Well, it did help with
strength and coordination.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:26.280
I was born with club feet and was in casts
for the first year or so of my life.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.090
And then corrective shoes and braces until
maybe two.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.740
I remember learning to walk with the brace
in-between my feet [chuckles].

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.260
But those corrections were pretty much done
early on.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.320
And when I started to do different activities,
like ballet and wanted to try skating, my

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.930
mom asked the pediatrician if it was OK, if
it was an OK activity.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.590
And I think he thought it was wonderful because
it would just help with the coordination and

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.590
everything.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.620
And I'm lucky that my parents took the initiative
and had the corrections done early on.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.810
And it didn't seem to affect my skating.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:06.810
[laughs]

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.950
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Was it your choice to
begin skating, or was that something your

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.519
parents came up with?

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.310
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: It was definitely my choice.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.310
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: OK.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.909
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: I had seen a local ice
show and remembered Dorothy Hamill had just

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.280
won the Olympics a few years earlier, so she
was my childhood idol.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.120
And I just wanted to try skating as well.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.040
So, my older sister, Lori, actually started
skating for a couple of months, but she didn't

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.189
really like it.

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.029
But being my older sister, I still wanted
to try it and just loved it the very first

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:40.029
time.

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:41.029
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: OK.

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:49.029
And did you, at what point did this drive
to actually keep competing and to pursue going

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.760
to Regionals and Nationals and Sectionals
and all of that, when did that kick in?

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.910
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Well, everything just
snowballed.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.639
I mean, you start out once a week going to
group classes.

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:00.659
And I was having fun.

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:06.109
And then, I think maybe a year or so after
I started skating, taking part in my first

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:15.480
competition that was just rink-wide and coming
11th out of 12th, wasn't what I was hoping

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.480
for.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.480
[laughs]

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.310
So, I think that stoked the fire . Like, "Well,
how come I didn't get a medal?"

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.769
And my mom's like, "Well, you have to be in
the top three to get a medal."

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.079
So, I think at that point I was like, "I want
a medal.

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.129
[giggles] [audience laughs]Every time I go
out there I wanna win a medal."

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:37.309
And I think that resonated with me and it's
like, "OK, I need to improve."

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:42.480
And when I'm competing, you have other competitors
that you're being compared to or whatever.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.480
So, I don't know.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.930
I think I just loved the skating so much and
competition, which was part of it.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.780
And pretty soon, you're competing in your
Northern California area.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.939
And then I was competing for the West Coast.

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.370
So, it just grew from liking the ice shows.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.370
[giggles]

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:04.629
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: You actually started--.

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.150
Did you start off as a single skater?

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.480
You were actually competing pretty, on the
National level, as a pair skater as well.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.480
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: I did compete in both.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.540
I started skating when I was six, so I skated
individual until I was eleven years old.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.830
And then that's when I met my partner, Rudy
Galindo.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.730
He was 13 at the time.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.880
He had just won the Novice National Championships
in singles.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.460
And I think people were going, "Oh, you're
both so tiny and cute.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.090
You should skate pairs together."

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.090
[laughter]

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.330
So I said, "OK.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.900
It sounds like fun."

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.650
So, we did it for fun, really.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:47.500
And our pair coach just taught us what he
could and we went to competitions.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:55.560
And before we knew it, we were at National
Championships in Novice Pairs.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.340
And then we won Junior Pairs, maybe I think
four years into our partnership together.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.700
So, we were having some great success.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.310
And I think because we were both strong single
skaters and coming together, but we had fun.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:14.390
We went as far as two-time US Pair Champions.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:16.390
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: At the senior level.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.570
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: At the senior level.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.340
Went to World's and we were fifth at the World
Championships two years in a row.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.970
And so, I think success came early and fast
for us as a pair team.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.420
And then at the same time, I continued on
with my singles career.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.670
So, keeping, developing there as well.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:45.650
But I think at the time, we were competing
against, in the pairs category, the top Russian,

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.560
the top Czechoslovakian and Canadian teams.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.080
So, for us to be fifth two years in a row
was really I think as far as we thought we

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.080
could go.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.120
And it was time to make a decision either
way 'cause juggling both disciplines was getting

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.650
more difficult at that World level.

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.050
And it was a tough decision, but I knew I
would always go back to, or continue on with

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.050
the singles skating.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.430
So, that's where I turned my focus.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:15.440
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: During that time when
you had to make that decision, did you ever,

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.590
what was that process like?

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.590
And did you ever second guess that?

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.240
Or, I mean, I think now looking back, you
guys have both individually and as pairs partners,

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.240
achieved so much.

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.090
I mean, Rudy went on to win the National title
as well.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.710
But looking forward, you couldn't have known
that.

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.730
And so, what was that like for you?

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.500
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: It was tough because we
had grown up together, literally, from eleven

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.380
to 17, 18 years old.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.350
And so, making that decision--.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.340
We had just imagined careers the rest of our
lives together.

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.930
But things change and your goals change.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.010
So, it was just time to make a decision.

00:06:56.010 --> 00:07:05.190
So, it was tough for a few months and I made
the decision and tried to be as positive as

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.190
I could.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.500
And I don't think it was as easy on Rudy.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:17.180
I think he was hoping that we would continue
on, but I was determined to continue to skate

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.990
and had, like you said, had some great success
as well, winning Nationals and then becoming

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.480
bronze medalist in the world.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:30.730
So, I think looking back it was a good decision
for both of us.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:31.730
[giggles]

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:32.730
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:33.730
I think so.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:34.890
What were the Olympics like for you?

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:35.920
What was that?

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.170
Can you tell us a little bit about that experience?

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.840
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Absolutely.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.060
Olympic year was just a whirlwind.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.260
And I think my goal was just to make the Olympic
team.

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:53.770
The year before, I had won World's and it
wasn't really until a year before the Olympics

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:54.770
where I thought, "Wow.

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:57.020
I actually have a shot at making the Olympic
team.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.350
Now I can let myself believe that I can actually
be there."

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:05.690
So, at the US National Championships, I went
in.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.420
I had never won a national title ever in singles.

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:13.389
I had already won two pair titles--actually,
three 'cause we won juniors--but I had never

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:14.389
won singles.

00:08:14.389 --> 00:08:17.530
I was always second in every level coming
up.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:21.150
So, I actually won my first national title.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:26.530
And so, that just gave me a lot of confidence
going into the Olympics the next month.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:30.190
And I was just so honored to be named to the
team.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:33.090
I think once I was there, it was like, "Well,
I'm here now.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:34.290
Whatever happens happens.

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:39.430
[presenter giggles] Of course, I want to skate
my best and skate well because I've trained

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:40.599
so hard to get here."

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:45.210
But the gold medal was something I didn't
wanna think about.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.210
I don't know.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.570
I didn't wanna jinx myself.

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.760
But I knew if I skated as well as I could,
I would have a good shot at it.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.490
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, I was actually listening
to a talk recently by an author named Joshua

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.630
Foer and he wrote a book called "Moonwalking
with Einstein."

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.860
And so in this talk he was talking about just
the importance of stepping outside of your

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:04.860
comfort zone.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.070
He actually used figure skating as an example.

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:12.640
So, what he said was the best figure skaters
actually spend more time falling than they

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.270
do practicing the jumps that they know that
they can land.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.620
Did you find that to be your case in your
situation?

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.230
'Cause I know when I was skating,

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:24.310
I'm like, "OK, let's stick to my axel.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:29.330
Coast on my axel for a while before moving
on to my double "sal"."

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:36.760
And it's probably why I didn't go to the Olympics,
[giggles] but did you find that to be the

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:37.760
case?

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.760
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Yeah, definitely.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.710
I think coming up as a skater, you know in
order to get to the next level or learn that

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.350
next jump or spin or whatever, you're gonna
make a lot of mistakes.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.790
So, definitely.

00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:54.330
I remember working on by double axel, which
is a big step--.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.640
It's the hardest double to learn.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:02.640
And just saying, "OK, I'm gonna work 20 minutes
on my double axel."

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.880
And it would just be literally skate around,
jump, fall, skate around, jump, fall, skate

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:07.880
around--.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:08.880
[giggles]

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:09.880
For 20 minutes.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.839
And you're just waiting for that moment for
it to click.

00:10:13.839 --> 00:10:21.260
And I think my coaches at the time were just
very good at instilling in me, "OK, you just,

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.980
this is just what you have to do."

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:27.830
[chuckles] And because you look around and
you see other people doing it and are landing

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:32.460
the jump that it motivates you to keep doing
it and finally get it.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.500
So, I think ultimately, finally, she offered
like a hundred dollars [laughter] if I could

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.500
land it clean.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:42.490
And that ramped up the practice a little more.

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:44.870
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And then how long did
it take you for it to click after that?

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:45.870
[laughing]

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:47.440
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Like a week.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.440
[giggles]

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.440
[laughter]

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.440
So, yeah.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.680
I mean, in skating, it's all about falling.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:56.839
And the first thing we learn as skaters stepping
onto the ice is how to get up when you fall

00:10:56.839 --> 00:10:58.540
because it's gonna happen.

00:10:58.540 --> 00:10:59.540
[giggles]

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:00.540
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.930
So, I thought we'd switch gears a little bit
and talk about your book.

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:09.150
What led you to wanting to write a book?

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:10.740
And how did you come up with this idea?

00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.080
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: I think--.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.870
I worked with children quite a bit.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:23.880
I've had a foundation for 15 years that has
centered on the needs of children for us,

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.360
so I've always wanted to do a children's book.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.770
But it was never, I guess, in the forefront
of my priorities.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:39.000
But I think, my own two children, becoming
a mother, really inspired me.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.930
When I started working on the book, they were
four and six, so perfectly in that age range

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.970
that I wanted to target.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.980
And I thought it would be just something special
for them to have that Mom wrote a book for

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:50.980
them.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:54.300
[audience laughs lightly]
So, I didn't know where to start, but luckily

00:11:54.300 --> 00:12:02.110
I had a book agent who approached me and said
that she would help me and got involved in

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.750
the process right away.

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:10.589
And luckily found a publisher in Sourcebooks
that came along and said, "OK, we like your

00:12:10.589 --> 00:12:11.589
story.

00:12:11.589 --> 00:12:13.310
Let's move with it."

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:18.460
So it was really a labor of love and I didn't
know what would happen with it.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:26.180
Of course, always hoping that the story would
grasp and take root and resonate with the

00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:29.100
audience.

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.940
And I guess the concept for the book came
as, well, if I'm gonna do this, looking at

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:38.600
some of my favorite books or children's books,
they all have some type of message.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:43.800
And I wanted a positive message to leave with
the kids and something, possibly, that I had

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.950
learned through skating to pass on to them.

00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.600
So, that's where the concept of the book came
about from.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.180
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: OK.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:57.380
So, we have, actually, a couple kids in the
audience here.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.050
I believe some Googlers brought their kids.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:04.410
[giggles] Did you wanna do a little bit of
book reading for us?

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.410
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Yes.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.410
Sure.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.410
Definitely.

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.410
All right.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.550
So, it's called "Dream Big, Little Pig," and
illustrated by Tim Bowers.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.050
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: All right.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.790
[children talking]

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:22.170
[Kristi Yamaguchi reads from book]

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.520
"Poppy was a pig--a pot-bellied, waddling,
toddling pig.

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:32.300
She was a pig with dreams and she was a pig
who dreamed big.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.810
She wanted to be a star.

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.630
Poppy had always dreamed of being a posh prima
ballerina.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:48.890
“She tried out for Swan Lake, a famous ballet,
but Poppy was not graceful.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:53.830
In fact, she was quite clumsy.

00:13:53.830 --> 00:14:00.770
'Follow your dreams!' said Poppy's mother,
who loved her no matter what.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:06.060
'You go, Girl!' said Poppy's grandparents,
who were her biggest fans.

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:12.149
'Dream big, Pig!' said Poppy's best friend
Emma, who was always there for her.

00:14:12.149 --> 00:14:16.649
'Dancing is just not for you,' said the people
in charge of the ballet.

00:14:16.649 --> 00:14:19.750
“'Try something else.'

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:28.149
So, Poppy tried out for Singing Stars, a popular
chorus competition.

00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:32.149
She'd always dreamed of being a soulful singer.

00:14:32.149 --> 00:14:34.890
But Poppy sang off-key.

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:37.060
And to be honest, she couldn't really carry
a tune."

00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.840
&gt;&gt;Child: Look at Poppy!

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:40.840
[laughter]

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.820
"'Follow your dreams!' said Poppy's mother.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.400
‘You go, Girl!' said Poppy's grandparents.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.450
‘Dream big, Pig!' said Emma.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.160
‘Singing is just not for you,' said the
people in charge of the competition.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.830
‘Try something else.'

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:03.670
“So, Poppy tried out for Supermodel Search.

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:10.310
[audience chuckles] She had always dreamed
of being a big time, splashy supermodel.

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:14.110
But Poppy was not very glitzy or glittery.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.800
And she even tripped on her fancy gown.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:23.640
'Follow your dreams!' said Poppy's mother.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:26.570
'You go, Girl!' said Poppy's grandparents.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.050
“'Dream big, Pig!' said Emma.

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:34.490
'Modeling is just not for you,' said the people
in charge of the search.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.920
'Try something else.'

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.740
But Poppy didn't know what else to try.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:48.910
And as she wandered through New Pork City,
she began to wonder if her dreams would really

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.950
come true.

00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:59.630
“Poppy was about to give up when she heard
her mother say, 'Just follow your heart.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.769
Remember, we love you no matter what.'

00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:06.950
And her grandparents cheer, 'We're your biggest
fans!'

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:10.600
And her best friend Emma's squeal, 'We're
here for you!'

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.980
Poppy smiled.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.180
“She knew just what to do.

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:20.200
When Poppy thought about all the things she
truly loved, her friends and family were at

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.720
the top of her list.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:27.950
So the next day, Poppy invited Emma for a
Pig's Day Out in the park.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:34.350
While giggling and strolling along, they spotted
an ice rink.

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:39.830
Poppy and Emma watched the skaters skimming
and spinning, swooping and swizzling on the

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:40.830
ice.

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:45.790
“Poppy realized that it was the most beautiful
sight that she had ever seen.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.810
Her heart danced with joy.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:53.550
Emma saw a twinkle in Poppy's eye and high-fived
her friend.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.670
'Dream big, Pig!' she cheered.

00:16:56.670 --> 00:17:02.690
So Poppy waddled and toddled right up to the
skating teacher and said, 'I'd like to be

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:05.220
a spectacular ice skating star.'

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:13.120
“'A pig on ice,' the teacher pondered.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.179
'Honey, I don't know if that's possible.'

00:17:17.179 --> 00:17:19.450
'Anything's possible,' said Poppy.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:22.150
'I believe in dreaming big.'

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.569
The teacher shrugged.

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:25.730
'As you wish,' she said.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.460
'We'll see if the pig's got pizazz.'

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:32.010
Poppy laced up her skates.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.360
She slipped and slid all over the ice.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.650
“And she fell.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:45.360
But this time, Poppy got up over and over
and over.

00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.080
She shuffled and stumbled and fumbled and
fell.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:55.960
But by the time the rink closed for the night,
Poppy was skating more than she was falling.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.320
And it felt like magic.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.820
Poppy returned to the rink the very next day.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.630
“Her cheeks were pink with winter wind and
excitement.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:13.170
She was so happy gliding, sliding, and tumbling
and bumbling on the ice.

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:16.910
She didn't even notice that she wasn't perfect.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:19.580
And nobody else did, either.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:26.820
Now a most persistent pig, Poppy learned to
twirl and swirl and do dips and lunges and

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.820
splits.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.900
Poppy learned to do jumps and spirals and
lifts.

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:40.360
“Before she knew it, more and more skaters
stopped to watch Poppy practice.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.890
She was quite a sight.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:46.580
She even had her picture on the front page
of the newspaper.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.360
Poppy felt like a star.

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:53.390
Some of her fans made t-shirts that read,
'Follow your dreams.'

00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.860
Other wore hats that said, 'Dream big, Pig!'

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:00.460
And tote bags declared, 'You go, Girl!'

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.929
Poppy's dreams had come true.

00:19:02.929 --> 00:19:08.740
“Time went by, but Poppy didn't stop dreaming.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.410
One day, she decided to be a pilot.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:16.560
She wanted to parachute and be the first sky-diving
pig.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:19.870
'When pigs fly,' said the other pilots.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.620
But they did not know Poppy.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.330
She was a pig who dreamed big.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.520
The end."

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.620
[applause]

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.809
Thank you.

00:19:30.809 --> 00:19:33.000
Thank you.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.100
Thanks.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:41.570
So, this is a fun little story about a little
pig who kept trying and finally found her

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:42.570
passion.

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:47.270
So, I thought it was a good thing for kids
and adults to keep dreaming.

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:51.280
You can never dream too big.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.760
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Have your daughters actually
started skating?

00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:00.360
I know between you and your husband, you're
both spectacular on the ice.

00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.020
Have they taken to skating at all?

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:05.560
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: They like to go out and
skate with their friends.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.910
We'll get on the ice with them every now and
then, but they run away from us because they

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:14.230
don't like Mommy telling them what to do.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.360
[laughter]

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:18.179
So it's almost better they take lessons from
someone else.

00:20:18.179 --> 00:20:20.100
And they're just beginning.

00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:21.100
They're in group classes.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:25.929
So as long as they can skate and move around
on the ice, that's all we care about.

00:20:25.929 --> 00:20:29.390
We don't expect them to do shows or compete
or anything.

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:34.110
But you have to know how to skate in our family.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:35.110
[laughter]

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:39.180
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And have you, do you still
skate pretty regularly?

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:43.540
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Well, unfortunately, I
haven't really been skating much lately.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.890
I think my last performance was almost two
years ago.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:54.100
So, it's, my priority now is my family and
keeping up with the girl's schedules.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:56.720
But we're still involved with skating a little
bit.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:03.100
I'm part of the US Figure Skating Mentoring
program, where some of their past skaters

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.210
are mentoring the younger skaters coming up.

00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:12.140
And then also, hosting a couple of the television
shows that are broadcast on NBC.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:15.200
So, a little bit here and there.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.010
But I miss it on the ice a little bit.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.669
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:24.530
And I mean, just listening to you read the
book, I mean it sounds like Poppy went through

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:28.260
a couple different things before stumbling
across skating.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.300
And how important do you think is raw talent?

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:39.340
I guess just sheer determination in pursuing
something that you're interested in and ultimately

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:40.340
succeeding at?

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.570
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: I think it's--.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:47.780
My grandmother always said, "You have to have
the three D's.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:51.740
Determination, Dedication, and Desire."

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:55.100
And if you don't have those, then you're not
gonna have success.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:22:00.660
And I completely believe that because I was
not the most talented.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:03.550
My mom would always say, "Well, they're learning
it much faster than you.

00:22:03.550 --> 00:22:04.550
And why can't you do that?

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:06.010
[laughs] They're already doing that."

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.070
And she knew.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:12.710
She's like, "Well, I think you just need to
work a little harder in order to progress

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:14.590
like the other kids."

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:15.660
And I think that was good.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:22.770
It taught me a work ethic and I wasn't afraid
to work and was willing to in order to learn

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:23.960
something new.

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:32.280
So, I've seen a lot of talented skaters come
up really quickly and when it got tough, they

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.280
seemed to fizzle out.

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:39.220
And I think you have to be willing to put
in that extra amount of work--stay on the

00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:44.520
ice an extra few minutes in order to separate
yourself from the rest.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:46.809
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:22:46.809 --> 00:22:49.310
And I think we do have a lot of parents in
the audience right now.

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:57.370
Do you have any advice for the parents here
as to how to encourage their children to be

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:58.370
physically active?

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:03.179
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Well, like all parents,
I'm still learning along the way, too.

00:23:03.179 --> 00:23:06.290
Mine are just five and seven now.

00:23:06.290 --> 00:23:11.590
But I think both my husband and I were so
involved with sports our entire lives and

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:15.550
knowing that being involved in sports taught
us a lot of things.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.030
I think it gave us a lot of confidence.

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:23.460
It taught us how to respect ourselves, our
competitors, our own bodies.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:28.570
So, I think those are all important things
that kids can learn through sports.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:34.950
And something that we're trying to encourage
our own children to get involved in because

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:38.360
teamwork and being part of that.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:45.559
And there's so many great lessons to be learned
that I think to encourage them, it's hard

00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:46.559
to keep pushing.

00:23:46.559 --> 00:23:52.539
But I think trying to help them find maybe
what their passion is and then supporting

00:23:52.539 --> 00:23:55.210
it once they do find it.

00:23:55.210 --> 00:23:57.220
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And you also--.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:02.169
Going along this theme of dreams, you also
run the Always Dream Foundation.

00:24:02.169 --> 00:24:04.460
And you've been involved with this for, was
it 15 years?

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:05.460
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Yeah.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.460
Actually, almost 16 now, yeah.

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.760
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Sixteen years.

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.010
So, can you tell us a little bit about that
and the work that you do through your foundation?

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.240
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Sure.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.410
It's Always Dream.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:20.550
We've, or I, established it because I was
inspired by the Make A Wish Foundation, which

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:23.840
does a lot of work with children and their
families.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:31.120
So, I decided to create something that will
help touch the lives of children out there

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.919
and in all genres.

00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:40.140
We've helped children with disabilities, to
disadvantaged children, under-served children,

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:47.150
children of tragedies like Hurricane Katrina
and the recent tsunami in Japan.

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:53.620
So, we've dedicated ourselves to embrace the
hopes and dreams of children in whatever way

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:55.110
we can.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:25:01.870
Now we are turning our focus more on education,
again, inspired by my children entering public

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:03.220
school.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:12.370
So, we really wanna try to help the literacy
component and really target early childhood

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:20.220
literacy and technology and finding a way
to combine those two and make a difference,

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:25.559
because we know that reading levels--and especially
at the 3rd Grade level--will help determine

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:28.590
your success in not only school, but in life
as well.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:33.840
So, if we can make a difference there, especially
in the under-served areas where these children

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:41.470
don't have access to books, and we want to
teach them to learn to love reading and to

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.860
love books as early on as possible.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.630
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: OK.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:50.100
I thought we could take some time to open
it up to the floor for questions.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.100
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Hi, Kristi.

00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:52.100
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Hi there.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.530
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: Thank you for coming to Google
today.

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:55.140
It's so nice to meet you.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:56.140
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Thank you.

00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:01.110
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #1: I'm wondering if you got nervous
before you competed and what you did to try

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:02.110
to control that.

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.150
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: OK.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:04.990
Can you hear me still?

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.260
Is this still on?

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.669
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:08.669
OK.

00:26:08.669 --> 00:26:14.290
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Definitely got nervous
every time I competed, even for every show,

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:16.210
almost every performance.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:21.950
But I think just a lot of positive reinforcement.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:23.740
The night before the competition,

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:30.840
I did a lot of imagery and walking through
what I wanted to do and going through the

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.770
entire routine, making sure it's perfect.

00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:38.660
[giggles] If it wasn't, I'd go back and rewind
and do it until it was how I wanted and then

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.080
I could fall asleep.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:45.980
But especially, right before stepping on the
ice, there's a lot of anxiety and it was just

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:53.580
common breathing techniques as well as telling
myself, "I've trained for this.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.580
I'm ready."

00:26:54.580 --> 00:26:59.620
I think the training that I did leading into
the competitions always was something I leaned

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.620
back on.

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:06.710
And I said, "I've done this a hundred times
at home, at my rink, in the comfort of my

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:07.710
surroundings there."

00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:14.260
I just wanted to take myself back to my training
rink and just tell myself it's just like any

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:15.260
other day.

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:17.710
"Just go out and do what you can."

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:24.170
But I think just preparation and the training
helped with the confidence.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:25.170
[pause]

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:30.400
Oh, I see a question here.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:34.810
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I think we have a question
over there.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.340
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Hi Kristi, it's nice to meet
you.

00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:38.980
Thank you very much for coming to Google.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:39.980
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Sure.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.100
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: First of all, I just wanna tell
you that, like Erica said, you've been one

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.260
of my idols growing up.

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:49.350
There are very few strong Asian American women
in the media to look up to.

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:52.309
So, thank you for being here and sharing your
story.

00:27:52.309 --> 00:27:57.610
And another question I have is I know that
you grew up in the Bay Area, specifically

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:59.590
Fremont, which is where I also grew up.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:05.659
So, I'd like to hear about how growing up
in the Bay Area in Fremont has influenced

00:28:05.659 --> 00:28:06.659
you.

00:28:06.659 --> 00:28:08.669
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Yeah.

00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:13.039
I feel like just any other California girl
I guess out there.

00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:19.090
I mean, Fremont was a great place to grow
up in.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:26.190
I remember it being very diverse and just
a great place.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:33.580
I think being in the Bay Area in general,
I think you have access to so much right at

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.910
your fingertips.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:37.590
And I don't know.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:44.380
I think my parents were great to support whatever
it was I dreamed of.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:53.180
[giggles] People ask, there's been Peggy Fleming,
Brian Boitano, Debbie Thomas, obviously Rudy

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:57.830
Galindo, and Charlie Tickner, and we're all
from the Bay Area.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:03.360
And it's like the Bay Area has produced some
very successful skaters.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.419
But yet, we've all had different coaches.

00:29:06.419 --> 00:29:08.780
We've all trained at different rinks.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:10.000
So, we kinda don't know why.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.190
I mean, I think we--.

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:18.460
Skating's popular here and we have a great
set of rinks, but maybe we just have a bigger

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.919
pool of talent to pull from.

00:29:20.919 --> 00:29:27.140
But I can't explain that, but I think it is
a great place as far as nurturing sports and

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:34.350
being open and allowing different--.

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:40.260
Skating's probably not the number one sport
to go into, but there's still places to train

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.260
and focus on it.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.260
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #2: Thank you.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:48.780
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: I want this energy.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.780
[laughter]

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.120
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: Hi Kristi.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.240
It's good to meet you.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.240
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Hello.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.240
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: I also grew up in Fremont, by
the way.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.240
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Oh, all right.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:01.000
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: I just wanted to ask, after you
achieved your amazing success at the Olympics

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.490
and such, did you ever have moments after
that saying, "How can I top this?

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:05.490
What do I do next?

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:06.600
Where do I go from here?"

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.640
Did you ever feel lost at all?

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.809
Or, you hadn't actually thought past that
point or anything like that?

00:30:11.809 --> 00:30:13.620
And how did you come to where you are now?

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:19.570
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: I probably have thoughts
like that more now than I did after the Olympics.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:27.260
I think I was really fortunate that in skating,
I was able to look beyond the Olympics and

00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.679
see a career path ahead.

00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:40.850
Back in 1992, there was a very rich professional
skating atmosphere to join, so I knew if I

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:42.280
didn't continue to compete,

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.710
I wanted to tour as a professional.

00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:47.500
And that was really my ultimate dream.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.390
When I was little, it wasn't really the Olympics.

00:30:49.390 --> 00:30:50.390
I didn't know what that was.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.559
It was to be a professional skater touring
the world.

00:30:53.559 --> 00:30:59.140
So, I knew I wanted to do that for several
years after the Olympics.

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.610
But there were times when like, "Is that like
the highlight of my life?

00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:04.080
How sad at 20 I peaked?

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.029
What does gonna happen now?"

00:31:06.029 --> 00:31:07.029
[laughter]

00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:15.250
But I think using that fear and then finding
other challenges to face kept me going.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:22.080
And dedicating myself to a ten-year professional
career was one, and then looking beyond that,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:28.850
I knew family was another that the timing
was just right.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:34.230
And then, once my kids were older and I felt,
"OK, I have time now to maybe do some other

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:38.640
things," then that's when Dancing With the
Stars came about and other projects.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.929
So, I don't know.

00:31:39.929 --> 00:31:46.960
I think I feel the most alive and the most
energy when I have something to look forward

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.080
to and a new challenge in front of me.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.820
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #3: Thank you.

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:56.039
&gt;&gt;Male Helper: So Erica, we might need to
take some VC questions .

00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:57.770
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Oh, hello?

00:31:57.770 --> 00:31:59.510
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: Hi Kristi.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.840
Thank you for coming.

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.500
I actually met you.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:04.080
This is the second time I'm watching you talk.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.130
The first time I saw you talk was back in
Iceoplex.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:12.440
And this was when I was in 7th Grade.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:19.210
You kinda showed up, in Logitech Skating or
something in Fremont off of Warm Springs.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.179
But I remember being in 7th Grade and seeing
you there and I was just so ecstatic.

00:32:23.179 --> 00:32:25.590
So, I'm glad to see you again.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:28.340
I had a quick question for you because I used
to skate.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:33.299
I mean, nothing really crazy or anything,
but the highest jump I could do was a double

00:32:33.299 --> 00:32:34.299
loop.

00:32:34.299 --> 00:32:39.409
And so, I haven't skated in a really, really,
really long time and I'm afraid to back because

00:32:39.409 --> 00:32:42.571
I just don't wanna be disappointed to not
be able to do anything except skate around

00:32:42.571 --> 00:32:43.750
in a circle.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:48.980
[laughter]
So, I wanted to see how you feel about going

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:53.640
back to skating 'cause you said you haven't
skated, or your last show was two years ago.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.880
And also, how do you feel if you can't do
a certain jump that you used to could do like,

00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.940
with your eyes closed?

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.799
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: I feel your pain, for
sure.

00:33:02.799 --> 00:33:08.529
[audience chuckles] I think my first experience
with that was taking a break for the birth

00:33:08.529 --> 00:33:09.630
of our first daughter.

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:15.900
I had never been off the ice for more than
probably three, four weeks or something.

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:19.179
So, after she was born, I knew I wanted--.

00:33:19.179 --> 00:33:24.220
I had a little bit more skating left in me
and so, it was just getting back on the ice

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:25.909
and getting back in shape slowly.

00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:30.350
But now, it's been a couple years since I've
really skated skated.

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:37.659
I mean, my best advice would be to start off
ice training a little bit first.

00:33:37.659 --> 00:33:42.980
I think just preparing the body to get on
the ice, because otherwise you'll just be

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.670
really frustrated I think.

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:51.470
[giggles] So, I think Pilates and all of that,
yoga, any type of cardio you can do off the

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.960
ice will help your body get prepared to go
on the ice.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:02.610
Because once you put the skates on, you wanna
be able to skate around and not--, and have

00:34:02.610 --> 00:34:05.840
the strength to do that and the stamina to
do that.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:06.840
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: Yeah.

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.250
I remember before, I had no problems like
launching myself into the air and falling.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:15.379
It was kinda fun, but now the thought of that
is just scary and I can't do it.

00:34:15.379 --> 00:34:16.379
[giggles]

00:34:16.379 --> 00:34:20.200
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Yeah, I think the older
you get, those pain receptors seem to become

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.200
more sensitive.

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.590
[giggles]So, it's, yeah.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:24.599
I tend to--.

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:25.619
It's hard.

00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:29.119
I know I can't do the jumps that I used to
and that's frustrating.

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:35.220
And my focus isn't on the training anymore,
so I know and I have to be realistic that

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:37.190
I'm not doing that anymore.

00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:42.280
But that's a big part of the reason why I'm
not performing anymore because when I knew

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.060
I used to perform at this level, it's hard
to accept that, "OK, I'm down here now."

00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:50.490
And maybe that's not how I wanna be seen anymore.

00:34:50.490 --> 00:34:51.490
[giggles]

00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:54.859
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #4: Thank you.

00:34:54.859 --> 00:34:58.350
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: Ask her?

00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:59.350
OK.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:00.700
I don't know.

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:05.119
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: How old are you?

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:10.270
&gt;&gt;MALE #1: How old are you, Mia?

00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:12.480
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: Four.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.690
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Four.

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:18.369
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: I'm really four.

00:35:18.369 --> 00:35:22.180
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #6: When are you planning on coming
out with another book?

00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:26.970
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Actually, I'm working
on book two right now--the follow-up to this

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:28.240
book about Poppy.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:30.990
So, it'll be the same character.

00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:36.600
And it's more of an international feel to
the book.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.480
And it will be released early March of 2012.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.230
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: Oh, nice.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:44.230
[laughter]

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.670
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Thank you.

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:51.290
Make sure you tell your Mommy you wanna see
the book, too.

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:53.230
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: Yeah.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.230
OK.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:36:00.530
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: While the mic goes around,
I wanted to ask you who are some of your favorite

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:01.530
skaters?

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.980
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #5: Excuse me.

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.450
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: The current competitors.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:13.250
I think my favorite skaters right now are,
which I, it would've surprised me ten years

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:18.540
ago if you asked me this, they're actually
ice dancers--Meryl Davis and Charlie White.

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.780
They're the US National Champions.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:25.230
Actually, just recently won the World Championships
last March.

00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:31.990
So, they're just incredible, fresh, and gorgeous
on the ice.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:37.290
And I think ice dancing has entered a new
era and I don't know.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:38.609
I really like it.

00:36:38.609 --> 00:36:42.180
I think they've done a great job representing
the sport.

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:47.040
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #7: Yeah, so I'm from Fremont, too.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:48.230
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Yeah!

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:49.420
Wow, there's a lot.

00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:56.320
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #7: And my daughter loves the Dreamland
playground, which I think is designed by you.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.839
The Dreamland.

00:36:57.839 --> 00:36:58.839
I think it's--.

00:36:58.839 --> 00:37:00.920
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Oh, at Central Park?

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.410
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #7: Yeah, at Central Park.

00:37:02.410 --> 00:37:05.660
I forgot exactly what's the name of it, but
she loves it.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:10.800
It's really unique playground from any other
place else.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:13.369
So, thank you very much.

00:37:13.369 --> 00:37:14.369
[laughs]

00:37:14.369 --> 00:37:22.910
And what brings you to design such nice a
playground and it is very unique and different

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:23.910
from other places.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:24.910
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: OK, yeah.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.010
She's talking about--.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:32.790
We, my foundation, built an Always Dream Play
Park, which is in Central Park in Fremont

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:34.480
at Lake Elizabeth.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.150
And it's one of the few of its kind in the
Bay Area.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:42.920
it's all-abilities playground.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:45.010
Another labor of love for our foundation.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:50.010
It was something four, five years in the making
from concept.

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:52.550
We were working with a lot of children with
disabilities.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:56.720
We actually did a summer camp in Hawaii with
kids with disabilities.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:03.750
And after the four days, from the children
to the counselors to our board members, we

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:11.070
were all just transformed and wanted to do
something that was more permanent and serving

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:12.140
than the four days.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:16.300
So, I had heard about these types of playgrounds
and we researched it.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:21.660
We found the right architect, actually based
in Berkeley, and came up with the designs

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.220
and ultimately tried to raise the funding.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.060
So, Fremont was a great partner.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:32.240
They're obviously my home town, so they welcomed
this idea.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:38.780
And so, we created this playground where kids
of all abilities can play side by side.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:40.440
And it's accessible.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:50.990
It's fun, even children with sensory issues
can find quiet spots to find solace in.

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:55.070
And then we're across the street from the
California School of the Deaf and Blind, so

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:59.950
a couple of things on the playground cater
to that as well.

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:00.950
So, yeah.

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:01.950
I don't know.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:07.160
It was I think the biggest capital project
that we had ever taken on, but obviously one

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.900
of the most rewarding as well.

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:16.860
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Any other questions from
the audience?

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:22.070
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #8: Thank you for coming.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:25.780
Sort of on the theme of dreaming big I guess,
so I've always wanted to write children's

00:39:25.780 --> 00:39:26.780
books as well.

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:31.240
And I was just curious if you have any advice
for someone who hasn't started or doesn't

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.450
even really know how to start.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:33.450
Any thought?

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:34.770
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Yeah.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:39.080
I mean, I think the most important thing is
come up with your concept first.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:43.650
Like, what you want to accomplish in the story.

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:45.790
And that's what I came up with here.

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:47.020
I said I want someone positive.

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.050
I wanna leave a great message.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:56.910
I want kids to know that it takes work and
failure to sometimes accomplish your dreams.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:01.080
You don't necessarily have to win, but it's
more about giving it your best.

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:05.390
So it's finding that concept and putting those
together and then finding the character that

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:12.980
you want to be the one to express these things.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.680
And then just writing it.

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.680
I don't know.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.680
It's just jotting down.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.100
I mean, I just did it on paper.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:20.930
And the second book, too.

00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:26.220
I wrote on paper and I'm scratching out and
throwing them away.

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.990
Just the old-fashioned way.

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:31.200
And when I finally got a manuscript that I
thought was presentable, then, well with the

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:35.760
first one turned it in and my book agent shopped
it around.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.300
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #8: And did you already have a relationship
with the illustrator or did you--?

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:40.300
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: No.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.450
That came after the publisher came in.

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:48.350
They had an idea of what they wanted.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:51.440
So, they introduced me to Tim via email.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.670
I've never met him, actually.

00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:57.839
[giggles] But everything was done through
approvals of sketches he turned in.

00:40:57.839 --> 00:41:02.119
And I was just really lucky that I really
liked what he did.

00:41:02.119 --> 00:41:03.119
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #8: Thank you.

00:41:03.119 --> 00:41:04.119
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: You're welcome.

00:41:04.119 --> 00:41:05.119
Right in front.

00:41:05.119 --> 00:41:16.970
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #9: Can you talk a little bit about
your experience on "Dancing With the Stars?"

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:18.290
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: The question was about
"Dancing With the Stars."

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.290
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Lots of fun.

00:41:20.290 --> 00:41:22.080
I mean, what can you say?

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.990
[giggles]You watch the show and you can tell
everyone's having a lot of fun on it.

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:32.261
But I think the surprising thing for me was
that it was not so physically demanding, but

00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:35.310
emotionally, mentally demanding as well.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:39.079
I think the first few weeks you're just on
a high and you're like, "OK, I wasn't eliminated

00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:40.079
first.

00:41:40.079 --> 00:41:41.079
This is great."

00:41:41.079 --> 00:41:42.079
[laughter]

00:41:42.079 --> 00:41:43.160
"I'm still on the show."

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:48.050
And then it slowly becomes harder and harder
and there's more pressure and they're expecting

00:41:48.050 --> 00:41:49.410
more of you.

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:51.150
But it was so much fun.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.450
I had a great partner.

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:55.420
Mark Ballas was my professional partner.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:42:02.530
Just talented beyond not only a dancer, but
his first passion is music.

00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:07.790
So, he writes and composes and performs his
own music as well.

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:10.480
So, just a great group of people.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:16.340
It kind of parallels the skating world a little
bit--the dance world--as far as the performing

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.900
side and the characters within it.

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:19.900
[giggles]

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.020
But it's a great show.

00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:25.450
I think they know what they're doing, obviously.

00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:27.720
The success of it is so big.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:37.040
But it was an honor to actually be asked to
be on the show.

00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.430
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #9: Just a follow up.

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:44.020
So, in tying in with your talk about dreaming
big, did you go into that competition thinking,

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.000
"I'm gonna get that mirror ball."

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Or just.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Sorry.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
What was your motivation?

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
[laughter]

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: My motivation?

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.040
My motivation was really just learning how
to ballroom dance.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:58.000
'Cause I didn't wanna do the show because
having been a fan of the show, sitting around

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.430
with my girlfriends and ripping on all the
contestants--

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:01.430
[laughter]

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:06.119
I was like, "Oh, I don't wanna put myself
out there like that."

00:43:06.119 --> 00:43:09.930
But when I looked past that, I was like, "OK."

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:15.130
I've always wanted to learn how to dance and
this type of dancing was so different from

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:17.510
anything else I have ever done.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:18.630
I said, "OK.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:21.180
Just let's give it a shot."

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.300
So, I don't know.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:24.300
I just went for it.

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.300
[giggles]

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:26.300
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Anyone else?

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.300
&gt;&gt;FEMALE #10: Hey Kristi.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:28.300
Thanks for coming.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:29.300
Me and my sister we're also from Fremont.

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:30.300
[laughter]

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.170
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Fremont hands go up.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:37.930
How many people are there from Fremont?

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:39.570
Oh my goodness.

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:41.340
Look at that.

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.340
Woo!

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:44.290
MSJ, any other MSJ?

00:43:44.290 --> 00:43:45.470
All right.

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.470
[laughter]

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:54.140
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #11: Just out of
curiosity, how come you chose a pig for the

00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.140
main character?

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.750
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: Oh, why a pig for the
main character?

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.230
I've always been a pig person.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:02.940
I'm actually born Year of the Pig.

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.960
Oh, yeah.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.200
And my idol was a pig growing up--Miss Piggy.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.200
[laughter]

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:14.109
My parents used to call me "Pigpen" 'cause
I was always such a mess when I was a little

00:44:14.109 --> 00:44:15.109
kid.

00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:16.109
I don't know.

00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:17.109
I've just always loved pigs.

00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:18.109
I collected pigs.

00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:20.339
A lot of my good luck stuffed animals were
pigs.

00:44:20.339 --> 00:44:25.440
So, when I decided not to have a little girl
as the main character, the pig was my first

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.440
choice.

00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:35.470
And I thought a pig would present its own
challenges as far as being a skater.

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:36.670
[laughter]

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.050
Anyone else?

00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:42.630
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: OK.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:45.850
So, thank you so much, Kristi, for joining
us today.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:52.330
I think it was a real pleasure for all of
us today.

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:53.330
[applause]

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:57.900
&gt;&gt;Kristi Yamaguchi: I just wanna say thank
you to Google for having me here today.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:45:02.160
It was fun to meet all of you and connect
with my Fremont people.

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.950
[laughter]
I mean, I'm obviously a big fan of Google

00:45:05.950 --> 00:45:12.360
and so it's an honor to be here, see your
campus, be invited in and to share just a

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.339
little bit of what I've done with all of you.

00:45:16.339 --> 00:45:22.790
So, thank you so much and look forward to
maybe chatting with you guys later.

00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:23.790
[chuckles]

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:23.880
[applause]
