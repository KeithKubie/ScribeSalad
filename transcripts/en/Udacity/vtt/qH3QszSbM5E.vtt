00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.135
So now, we found one polynomial function that has these linear factors as it's

00:00:04.135 --> 00:00:08.496
only linear factors. But is this the only function with just these linear

00:00:08.496 --> 00:00:12.383
factors? Please answer yes or no, think carefully about this.
