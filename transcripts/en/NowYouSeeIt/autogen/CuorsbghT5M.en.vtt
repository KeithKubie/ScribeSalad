00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.320
 Ok, they are here, sir; Mr. Creeps and his partner, Mr. Crawls. 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.380
 At the beginning of this column, someone asked me to make a video about the turning point of the story. 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.780
 But I always hesitate to do it because I don't want to go through a lot of major story transitions. 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.720
 I have always adhered to this principle until one day I accidentally saw an interesting study organized by the University of California, San Diego. 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.180
 The researchers spoiled the end of several famous books in advance to the participants, and then let them read the books. 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.320
 The other group did not spoil. 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.140
 After reading, each group indicates how much they like each book. 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.420
 Based on these studies, it turns out that if you are spoiled before reading, you may prefer these books after reading. 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.160
 I don’t just think that this study perfectly explains the important points of the story transition. 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.390
 I also like it because it finds a good excuse for my spoiler. 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.580
 I will spoil the contents of "Stunning Enchantment" and "First Fear". 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.180
 "Fatal Magic" will also have a little bit of spoiler. 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.800
 If you haven't seen it before, think about the research results. 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.660
 And use this video as a chance to reproduce the experiment. 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.080
 Well, I started to spoiler. 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.060
 "We have to follow these footprints to find the monster!" 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.600
 The general definition of "the reversal of the plot" is: a completely unexpected result of a story. 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.880
 In The Thunderbolt, Dylan Rhodes is an FBI agent trying to track the "four knights" 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.120
 However, after the dramatic reversal of the plot, he was always the "fifth knight." 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.980
 However, I do think that the next movie is very interesting because of a key factor: the turning point of this story has little effect. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.793
 Alfred Hitchcock: "Now you and I are sitting here, 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.560
 Suddenly a bomb exploded! ” 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.460
 Thaddeus Bradley: "And... FBI let them go. Not once or twice, but always." 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.920
 Just like them are the participants... 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.120
 *silence* 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.180
 Hitchcock: "Once the audience sees this scene, there will be a shock of 5-10 seconds. 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.120
 *Prelude to Scooby Doo 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.400
 "Scooby Scooby Doo, where are you?" 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.440
 "We have some work to do!" * Scooby Doo 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.480
 Even if the original play is fairly simple, it is quite easy to predict. 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.100
 "Scooby" actually adheres to the important principle of a good plot transition: 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.300
 The final outcome is always consistent with the established logic at the beginning of each event. 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.900
 "They are trying to scare away all the successors on this island." 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.600
 "Then no one will spend the night here, they will control all the wealth." 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.600
 We got enough information at the beginning, so when the reversal happens, it makes people very satisfied. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.820
 Because you always feel vaguely who is doing this. 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.600
 Mr. Creeps and Crawls. They must pick the right lawyer to do the job! " 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.260
 The reversal of "Stunning Enchantment" does not have this element, and it does not conform to the established logic. 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.320
 From clumsy FBI agents to awkward genius, completely rewrite this character, 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.060
 It means there is no way to see the reversal of the plot. 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.640
 This is why it is not very satisfying because it relies too much on people's shock. 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.820
 "Fatal Magic" is the shocking value brought about by the reversal of "Stunning Enchantment" 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.520
 And Scooby Doo predicts the perfect balance of logical reversals 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.300
 In the first twenty minutes of the movie, the film tells us exactly enough information to predict the reversal of this ending. 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.880
 But Christopher Nolan also missed enough information. 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.580
 Letting this ending be both shocking and consistent with the established logic. 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.280
 Hitchcock: "Now, let this scene start from scratch, we tell the audience: 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.076
 There is a bomb under the table and the bomb will explode in five minutes. " 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.420
 Outside the painting: "You are looking for secrets, but you will not find them." 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.000
 Because, of course, you are not really watching. " 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.280
 The best reversal of the plot is a reversal that can create the biggest surprise without destroying the established logic. 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.980
 Because at the end of the day, the reversal of "Scattered Thieves" is not so satisfying. 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.600
 It completely rewrote his character only for a cheap surprise. 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.659
 The character of the 100% adapted character is not particularly interesting because the character is built through the entire movie. 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.640
 So, how do you both be both surprised and interesting to do this? 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.320
 In Tier 1 Fear, this reversal is similar, but there is a key difference. 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.740
 In this movie, a boy who served as a servant of the altar was accused of murdering the Archbishop. 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.651
 The lawyer helped him get rid of the crime: "not guilty of mental disorder", 

00:03:30.651 --> 00:03:33.800
 Because the boy showed positive on multiple personality disorder tests 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.200
 Before the boy moved into a mental hospital, the film ended with a scene: 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.520
 He revealed that he has been pretending to get a short prison time. 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.140
 "Sir, there is never 'Allen'" 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.360
 This looks very shocking, but the ending is actually very close to the logic of the story. 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.260
 In the whole movie we are not sure which personality he is, and we don't know when he will change his personality. 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.160
 We always have the feeling that he is not the person he said 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.020
 But this still makes us extremely shocked. 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.620
 Because we are always with him, and with him deceive everyone in the play (including ourselves), 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.880
 At the end of the story, it turned into a rival 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.200
 We got clues and information, but the shock still exists. 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.380
 This is where the distinction between a good plot reversal and a bad plot reversal is made. 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.560
 Hitchcock: "In order to suspend, you have to give the audience enough information, 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.160
 Allen: "Get it, boy, I thought you finally figured it out." 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.980
 Hitchcock: "And keep the rest for them to imagine." 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.340
 Allen: "But let's be honest, I am very glad that you understand. 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.440
 Because I always wanted to tell you! Haha! 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.940
 The information should be enough for them to understand its appearance, but not let them anticipate it 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.620
 (whisper): "I saw the dead." 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.440
 I think the best way to test the reversal of the plot is to see if it has repeatability. 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.280
 Because once you know the end of the reversal, (if this reversal is good) 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.440
 Then when you look back and look for the clues of reversal, there will still be enough fun. 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.880
 "Are you looking at it?" 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.760
 I think this is also the result of this study: Why is it spoiled before reading but it makes it more enjoyable, the reason behind it? 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.620
 The suspense of the ending makes the process even more exciting. 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.380
 This is probably why many stories have spoiled the end at the beginning of the story. 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.840
 "As for me! It’s really stupid to kill him!" 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.120
 Because it is as important as the reversal of the outcome, it is the process of getting the outcome. 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.780
 So don't be stressed before you look at it, even if you know the ending of the story. 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.740
 Because - maybe you will like it more? 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.280
 "So let this puppy come in, others wait inside." 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.580
 *Dynamic music* 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.040
 Scooby Doo 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.440
 Thank you for watching 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.100
 * Prelude to Scooby Doo*: "Scooby Scooby Doo, where are you?" 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.460
 Fade out: "We have something to do!"
