00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.640
Solve for x.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.690
We have 8 times the
quantity 3x plus 10

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.940
is equal to 28x
minus 14 minus 4x.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.000
So like every equation
we've done so far,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.632
we just want to isolate
all of the x's on one side

00:00:13.632 --> 00:00:14.340
of this equation.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.923
But before we do
that, we can actually

00:00:15.923 --> 00:00:17.310
simplify each of these sides.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.130
On the left-hand
side, we can multiply

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.217
the quantity 3x plus 10 times 8.

00:00:21.217 --> 00:00:22.800
So we're essentially
just distributing

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.470
the 8, the distributive
property right here.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.550
So this is the same thing
as 8 times 3x, which is 24x,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.460
plus 8 times 10, which
is 80, is equal to--

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.910
and over here, we have
28x minus 14 minus 4x.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.140
So we can combine the
28x and the minus 4x.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.540
If we have 28x minus
4x, that is 24x

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.392
And then you have the
minus 14 right over here.

00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:50.350
Now, the next thing we
could-- and it's already

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.220
looking a little bit suspicious,
but just to confirm that it's

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.300
as suspicious as
it looks, let's try

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.790
to subtract 24x from both
sides of this equation.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.031
And if we do that, we see that
we actually remove the x's

00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:04.530
from both sides of the equation
because we have a 24x there,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.770
and we have a 24x there.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.570
You might say,
hey, let's put all

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.850
the x's on the left-hand side.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.920
So let's get rid of this 24x.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.929
So you subtract 24x
right over there,

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.095
but you have to do it to
the left-hand side as well.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.680
On the left-hand side,
these guys cancel out,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.390
and you're left with just
80-- these guys cancel out

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.670
as well-- is equal
to a negative 14.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.010
Now, this looks very bizarre.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.320
It's making a statement that
80 is equal to negative 14,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.040
which we know is not true.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.020
This does not happen.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.190
80 is never equal
to negative 14.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.240
They're just inherently inequal.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.300
So this equation right here
actually has no solution.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.770
This has no solution.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.920
There is a no x-value that will
make 80 equal to negative 14.
