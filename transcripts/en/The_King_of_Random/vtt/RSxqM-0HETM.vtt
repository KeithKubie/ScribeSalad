00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.540
[Captions by Judy V. at Y Translator]
Liquid nitrogen gets amazingly cold.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.440
And hundreds of you,
and we wanted to know,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.320
what would happen if we put
cotton candy into liquid nitrogen.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.960
And when we tried it out,
the result was very surprising.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.020
[Music]

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.940
[Music]

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.580
To show what we expect to happen when
we dip something into liquid nitrogen,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.960
let's take a few flowers and leaves,
freeze them in the liquid nitrogen,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.220
and smack them on this
brick and watch what happens.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.240
[Music]

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.300
Exploded.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.160
Let's try it with one of this flower.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.140
I don't know what this flower is
called, but we're going to freeze it,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.560
and then see if it shatters.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.380
[Music]

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.480
Shattered.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.720
Now we've got a little leaf.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.160
Let's try it with the leaf.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.500
[Music]

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.480
Breaks as if it were
an old dry leaf in the fall.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.200
Turns to powder basically.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.280
And then as it warms up,
it just goes back to being flexible.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.080
We know how flowers and leaves
react when we put it into liquid nitrogen.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.040
And so I expected something
similar to happen with cotton candy.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.300
It's very thin and I thought
that perhaps as it froze,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.780
it would become
less flexible and more brittle,

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.220
but that's not what happened.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.060
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.580
We'll take some cotton candy, quickly 
drop it down into the liquid nitrogen,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.640
pull it out, and smash it down in this brick,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.940
and see if it shatters or
if something else happens.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.420
We'll follow that up by
seeing if we get the same result

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.140
if we leave the cotton candy in liquid 
nitrogen for a longer period of time.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.860
[Music]

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.980
The cotton candy dipped in liquid nitrogen,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.440
acts almost exactly like a
normal cotton ball dipped in water.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.720
Normally, you can't have wet cotton candy.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.960
You put it into water and
it just dissolves immediately.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.300
But the sugar that cotton candy is made 
of doesn't dissolve in liquid nitrogen.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.920
As a result, the cotton candy
soaks up the liquid nitrogen,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.340
just like a normal cotton
ball soaking up water.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.340
Look at that.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.240
It's dripping out from cotton candy.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.420
Cotton candy is dry,
or it's dissolved normally,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.000
so this was really
surprising when we tried it out.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.640
Look at this.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.300
You can even squeeze the
liquid nitrogen right out of it.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.300
[Music]

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.360
Soaking it up like a sponge.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.560
It's now saturated with liquid nitrogen.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.660
[Music]

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.520
Ah, some of it splashed onto my neck.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.360
I know what cotton candy is like
normally if I eat it.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.080
I'm a little bit nervous about trying to eat
it when it's been dipped in liquid nitrogen,

00:02:40.086 --> 00:02:43.329
because as you've just seen,
it acts like a sponge almost.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.380
I think if I have the cotton candy dipped
in liquid nitrogen,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.540
and then put in my mouth,

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.820
it would just burn my mouth.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.460
All of that liquid nitrogen
would freeze inside of my mouth shut.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.120
So I'm going to dip it in, and then
try breaking off just a little piece of it.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.220
See how that goes.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.460
Here we go.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.340
I missed. Don't show that, or do.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.320
Whoa.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.960
That is very cold.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.940
I was keeping it rolling around
with my tongue the whole time,

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.200
and I think I still freezer
burned my tongue a little bit.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.380
Three. Two. One.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.980
[Music]

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.800
Water.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.240
Liquid nitrogen.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.480
It's clearly boiling the liquid nitrogen,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.820
because everything
makes liquid nitrogen boil.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.860
But when you put it into the
water, it just dissipates immediately.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.640
You can keep putting it in too.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.260
It just doesn't stop dissolving.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.780
It's dipped in the liquid nitrogen,

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:43.960
completely intact.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.820
And let's take the stuff in 
the liquid nitrogen,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.280
and now put it into the cup of water,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.140
and see what happens.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:56.120
[Music]

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.640
That is odd.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.760
[Music]

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.940
I think it's dissolved.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.560
So we expected our cotton candy
to just freeze in the liquid nitrogen,

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.960
and then kind of shatter,
the way it did with flowers.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.740
Flowers and plant life of course
are full of water on the inside,

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.500
and that can freeze very solid
causing things to be extra brittle.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.740
But I did think that cotton candy
would be a little bit more like a plant,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.800
and a little bit less like a cotton ball.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.660
Guys, there's more for you to see.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.540
That little box up at the top 
will transport you

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.100
to our last video in case you missed it.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.120
You should go check it out.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.800
The box at the bottom will show you what 
YouTube thinks you should be watching next.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.340
And this bomb here in the
center will subscribe to our channel,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.940
so you never miss another video.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.020
Don't forget to ring that bell.
And we'll see you in the next one.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.980
Talk to you then.
