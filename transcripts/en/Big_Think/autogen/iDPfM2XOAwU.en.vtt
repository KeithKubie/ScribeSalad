and so we're getting a lot better a lot
better data on that now and I think

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679
better data on that now and I think
 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.179
better data on that now and I think
because the data is now available some

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189

take it more seriously and therefore
 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.419
take it more seriously and therefore
when victims or would-be victims are in

a compromising situation we are
beginning to have a system in which they

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539
beginning to have a system in which they
 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:55.319
