00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:02.650
Let's see if we can come
up with the equations

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.572
for these different functions--
function A, B, C, and D.

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:09.030
And I encourage you to pause
the video right now and try it

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.800
on your own.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.820
So it might jump out at you
that these all look a little

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.400
bit like y is equal to the
square root of x, which

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.390
would look something like this.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.580
And we've covered this
in previous videos.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.250
y equals the square root of
x looks something like this.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.590
Except what we have here--
all the other things look

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.967
like at minimum we flipped
over the horizontal axis,

00:00:32.967 --> 00:00:34.425
and at least for
B and D we flipped

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:36.140
over the horizontal
and vertical axis.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.240
And in all the cases
we have shifted it.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.980
So let's think about
how we do that.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.750
So let's first flip over
the horizontal axis.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.740
So where we would have
expected a positive y,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.640
we're now going to
have a negative y.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.340
So essentially we're
just going to do

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.230
y is equal to the
negative square root of x

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.300
to get this thing.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.910
This is y is equal to the
negative square root of x.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.810
So put that negative in
front of the radical.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.080
We flipped it over
the horizontal axis.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.550
So that is y is equal to the
negative square root of x.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.890
Now let's think about how
we can shift this thing

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.702
to look like function
A. Well, there's

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:20.660
two things about function
A that are different.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.920
It's shifted to the left by
3, and it's shifted up by 1.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.070
And we've seen this
in previous examples.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.950
If we want to get to
A-- so I could write

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.720
a of x-- what we could do
to shift to the left by 3,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.300
we got to replace
our x with x plus 3.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.580
So this is going to be negative
square root of x plus 3.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.500
That shifted us to the left.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.160
And then to shift
up, we just have

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.660
to add a 1 right over here.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.405
So that right over
there is our a of x.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.425
Now let's think about B of x.

00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:02.300
And actually maybe I
should move on this side

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.890
so that I can clear my little
scribbles right over there.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.880
So that is our A of x.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.090
Now let's think about B of x.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.650
How is B of x
different than A of x?

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.820
Well, B of x starts
at the same point,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.490
but it's flipped over
the vertical line

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.650
x is equal to negative 3.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.910
So its domain is different.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.470
This function's
domain is defined

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.200
for x is greater than
or equal to negative 3.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.160
B is defined for x is less
than or equal to negative 3.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.820
And we saw that also
in the previous video.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.240
What we need to do is flip
the sign of everything

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.030
that's under the radical.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.600
So B of x is going to be equal
to the negative square root

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.970
of-- and going from A
of x to B of x, we're

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.640
going to flip the sign of
everything under the radical.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.620
So it's negative x plus 3.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:00.160
And then once again we have
the plus 1 right over there.

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.370
Now, to go from B of x to D of
x is reasonably straightforward.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.300
We just have to change
how it's shifted.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.790
D is shifted relative to
the original function.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.170
It's shifted up by 3
and to the left by 1.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.900
So D of x is going to
look very similar to B

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.170
of x except its shifting
is going to be different.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.710
So let me just
write the part that

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.650
is going to be very
similar to D of x.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.070
It's negative x plus something,
and then plus something.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.260
D of x has been shifted--
relative to the square root

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.110
of x-- to the left by 1.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.140
So this is going to be x plus
1 and it is shifted up by 3.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.810
So it's going to be
plus 3 just like that.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:51.300
And then finally C of x is just
like D of x, except everything

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.050
under the radical has to
have its sign flipped.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:05.457
So it is going to be negative
square root of x plus 1 plus 3.

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:07.290
Another way to think
about it, if you wanted

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.120
to go from A of x to C of x,
they look very much the same

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.160
except their shifting
is different.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.430
C of x is shifted up
by 3, instead of 1,

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.619
so that's that difference.

00:04:17.619 --> 00:04:19.160
And it's shifted to
the left relative

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.529
to the square root of
x by 1, instead of 3.

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.307
So that's why we have x
plus 1, instead of x plus 3.

00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:25.890
The one thing I
always want to stress,

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.194
it's very intuitive that
changing this value--

00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:31.360
if you make this larger
you're going to shift it up.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.568
If you make it smaller you're
going to shift it down.

00:04:33.568 --> 00:04:35.310
But it's a little
counterintuitive

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.710
that when you make
this value larger

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.560
you're shifting
more to the left.

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.510
And when you make this value
smaller, or even negative,

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.760
you start shifting
more to the right.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.560
And we go into this in some
depth in the previous video

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.780
where we kind of start
talking about all of this,

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.690
but it's just to think
about, especially

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.520
relative to square root of x,
when you think about just y is

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.990
equal to square root of
x, what makes y equal 0?

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.180
What has to happen
under the radical first

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.550
to be kind of at the starting
point right over here?

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.199
Well, everything under the
radical has to be equal to 0.

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.490
And so you could think about
that same thing over here.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.310
To be at this starting point,
everything under our radical

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.840
has to be equal to 0.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.670
When does everything
under our radical

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.470
equal 0 at x equal negative 1?

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.500
Well, if everything under
the radical was x plus 1.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.970
So I encourage you to think
about that as deeply as you can

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.178
and to play around with
things, and then hopefully it

00:05:27.178 --> 00:05:29.710
will start making a
little bit of sense.
