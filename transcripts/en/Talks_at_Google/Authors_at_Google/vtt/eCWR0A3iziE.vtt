00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.880
&gt;&gt;presenter: So, Kevin Kelly is not only one
of the foremost innovators and writers about

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.890
technology, but his personal story is an equally
interesting one. He rode his bike across America

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.320
and back, and wrote a haiku and drew a drawing
for every day of that journey. He spent seven

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.970
years walking across Asia and he published
a beautiful book of his photography from his

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.239
travels, called "Asia Grace." I first met
Kevin when I was five or six, when my dad

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:41.300
took over the role of editor from him at the
Whole Earth Review and Kevin Kelly was a founding

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.860
executive editor of Wired. He helped design
and launch the WELL, the famous, prototypical,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.310
virtual community, as well as HotWired, the
first commercial web scene. He is one of the

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.850
founders of the Long Now Foundation and he
also creates and publishes the website Cool

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.530
Tools. He's also a regular contributor to
the New York Times magazine, publishing features

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.650
on digital culture and one of the last ones
was an education issue about homeschooling

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.040
his son and the role that technology played.
His books include "Out of Control," "Rules

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.040
for a New Economy," several editions of the
Whole Earth Catalog and today, he's going

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.690
to be talking his latest book, "What Technology
Wants." So, please help me in welcoming Kevin

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.690
Kelly.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.680
[applause]

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:40.260
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Thank you, Mimi. That was great.
It's great to be back here. About six years

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:47.590
ago, I actually gave a talk in thinking about
this book, in this very same room on the history

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.070
and the future of the scientific method. And
that talk is now two pages in this larger

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.960
book, which is about the long term trends
in technology. And there's lots of things

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:07.020
that I feel I could talk to you about this
afternoon, but I think, or I could talk about

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.230
the future of media, the future of the Internet
and the Web and those kinds of things; all

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.819
of which you probably know a lot more about
than I do. And I think I'd rather, instead,

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:26.370
like to step back and talk about what technology
means and where it, where its place in the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:35.470
world, where it wants to be in our minds as
we make all this stuff. So, everyday, you

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.341
folks are involved in creating new things
and the problem is we don't really have a

00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:46.830
very good theory about what it is that we're
making. And so, the current idea about technology

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.030
is basically one thing after another. All
right? We produce one thing after another

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.120
and there's no larger framework about whether
these are good things, whether we want more

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.920
of it, where it fits into the cosmos, how
it relates to nature and what I'm trying to

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.780
do is basically, make a first draft for a
theory of technology; so you can think of

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:18.300
it in those terms. And so, that sounds kind
of really esoteric, but here's a definition

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.730
that most people think about what technology
is, is about anything that was invented after

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.780
you were born; it's all this new stuff, the
stuff that's coming out of labs here. And

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.650
if you're maybe a little more sophisticated,
you might think of it as stuff that doesn't

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.760
work yet and, or maybe it's the stuff that's
in your pockets. Or maybe anything that has

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:47.730
an on or off switch. And, I think, of course,
all those gadgets and all those things are

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.810
the stuff that technology is, but it's actually
something more than that. We can take two

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:01.500
pictures, these two artifacts that are approximately
the same size and shape and one of them can

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.550
easily be made by any of us here--not maybe
as well-- and that's the tool of the hammer

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:15.510
and that's prehistoric. Or the one on the
right, the mouse or the iPhone or whatever

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.560
you wanna look at, that one not only could
not any of us do, but even the group of us

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.110
here could not do. And, in fact, even everyone
in this building could not actually produce

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.889
that. And that's because that device requires
maybe a thousand intermediate technologies

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:39.550
to create it and maintain it and operate it,
and each of those technologies might, in turn,

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.710
depend on another hundred intermediate technologies.
So, what we have is the technology we have,

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:51.000
like on the right, is actually representative
of an ecology of technologies. It's a whole

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.860
set of interrelated, interdependent and codependent
artifacts and that that entire ecology, or

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.850
if you can like, if you wanna think of it
as a super organism of technology, is actually

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.130
what I'm most interested in. And to distinguish
that from the individual technologies or artifacts;

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:16.780
I call that the "technium." So, the technium
is this huge, super hive, super ecology of

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.650
all the technologies that we have as they
are related to each other and codependent

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:28.240
on each other. And what we know about systems,
that have that degree of complexity, there's

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.981
two things. The one thing that we know about
those kinds of systems is that, first of all,

00:05:32.981 --> 00:05:39.480
they exhibit behaviors that are not present
in any of the parts, ok? So, you can look

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.210
forever into a tin-, into a bee or an ant
and you'll never see the hive or the colony.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:52.960
So, that behavior is not present in the individual
components. And so, the pres-, the actual

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.919
behavior, the technium, is not present in
any of the devices; it has a larger system-wide

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:03.699
behavior. And secondly, those behaviors have
inherent biases and tendencies. That's what

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:10.560
we know about systems, ok? And the more recursive
circuits there are in this, the more tendencies

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.009
there are, and so, recursive circuit is the
idea here, the infinite loop or recursive

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:21.360
loop, where we see this in biology. We have
genes. A lot of the genes in our chromosomes

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.010
are turning on other genes; they're not expressing
protein, but they're turning on other genes

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.479
and some of those genes are turning on other
genes, and some of those genes are turning

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.520
on the first genes. And so, you have this
recursive loop. We have technologies that

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:39.520
make; technology A makes technology B, technology
B makes C, and C is involved in the creation

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:45.639
of A, so we have recursive loops within the
technium and whenever you have those, you

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:51.070
have biases, tendencies. And so, when I talk
about what technology wants, what I'm talking

00:06:51.070 --> 00:07:00.740
about is what the technium is biased towards.
So, it's, I don't mean "want" in terms of

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:08.270
the way in which an intelligence or conscious
being would want, but I mean "want" in the

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:15.139
way that plants want light. They're leaning
towards light. The tomato plant on your windowsill's

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:19.560
leaning towards the light; it's not conscious,
it's not intelligent. It has a bias in its

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.759
system, an urge and need, to move towards
light. And so, we have plants that want light

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:31.789
and that is what the technium has, is certain
wants. And the question I'm asking is, in

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:39.660
general, what are the biases in the technium?
And I begin, if, going back to plants, because

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:46.780
my premise is that, in fact, the technium
is an extension coming from us. It's not just

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:53.550
from our minds, it's also from a biological
past; from our evolutionary past, that the

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:58.789
technium is actually extending and accelerating
those same forces. And so, I ask what does

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:05.490
evolution want? Now, I have to say right away
is that there are some evolutionary biologists.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:10.580
Among the most prominent was the late Stephen
Jay Gould, who argued very, very forcefully

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:17.600
that there are no trends in evolution at all;
that it's trendless. That there's no trajectories,

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:25.380
there's no directions. And that is the orthodoxy
in evolutionary biology right now, but there

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:30.030
is, there are minority view and there are
other evolutionary biologists and many of

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:36.810
them young, who actually have more experience
with computational and computer simulations,

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:42.569
who actually make a different argument and
have evidence to show that there are trends,

00:08:42.569 --> 00:08:47.690
directions, in the long course of evolution.
And, and the foremost of those is the ones

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:54.870
that we all intuitively feel, which is that
over 3.7 billion years of life that life has

00:08:54.870 --> 00:09:00.500
gotten more complex. Now, the reason why that's
maybe not an obvious trend is, Stephen Jay

00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:04.399
Gould would say, "Well, if you're starting
off simple, you have nowhere else to go but

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:11.209
more complex." And so, the fact that the leading
edge is getting more complex is trivial; it's

00:09:11.209 --> 00:09:17.170
not important. The question is about the trailing
edge. And so, we can show, in fact, that when

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:22.249
you have moved along some evolution and you
are somewhat complex, is there any bias in

00:09:22.249 --> 00:09:30.489
which direction you go then? And we can show
that there's a mild drift towards increasing

00:09:30.489 --> 00:09:37.129
complexity, even at the trailing edge of evolution;
say bacterium. So, what does evolution want?

00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:46.600
Well, again, there is a trend. We have evidence
that there is a trend in greater complexity

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:54.410
over 3.7 billion years of life; that's one
trend. But there's also trends towards more

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:59.550
diversity; increasing numbers of different
species. And again, that increasing diversity

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:04.809
happens not just when you're starting off
with simple, but even wants to have some diversity;

00:10:04.809 --> 00:10:13.310
it rarely goes to less diverse. It generally,
on average, goes to more diverse. And we can

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:18.509
actually make a list of these things including
increasing complexity, increasing diversity,

00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:24.200
increasing specialization. The first cells
are general. There's one kind of cell that

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:29.720
does everything. Over time, they evolve into
specialties and so we have 250 different cell

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:35.889
types in our bodies. We can show the number
of cell types increases over time in evolutionary

00:10:35.889 --> 00:10:44.670
history. Increasing mutualism, codependency
on other organisms as for your life, increasing

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:50.629
ubiquity, increasing mindfulness, sentience.
We see the mind and the kind of learning that

00:10:50.629 --> 00:10:56.779
a brain does and neurons, even happens in
plants. We see it erupting throughout the

00:10:56.779 --> 00:11:03.749
kingdom of life many, many times independently.
There's increasing learning and evolvability,

00:11:03.749 --> 00:11:08.759
which is the ability to evolve and so we forget
the fact that the evolution process itself,

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:16.279
is not a singular, fixed process, but itself
has evolved in complexity and it actually

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:23.049
has made things easier to evolve over time.
So, it's actually, organisms can evolve faster,

00:11:23.049 --> 00:11:28.730
quicker and more degrees of freedom now than
they could two billion years ago. So, there

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:35.170
is actually the evolution of evolvability
over time. And exotropy, which is increasing

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:41.889
order, increasing self-organization and increasing
structure. So, those are the kinds of things

00:11:41.889 --> 00:11:48.899
that we see and the reason why that's important
is because, I think, one of the most amazing

00:11:48.899 --> 00:11:54.869
discoveries in the last 50 years has been
the realization that the essence of life was

00:11:54.869 --> 00:12:05.769
not water or some vital spirit or some mystical
force in the world, but actually was information.

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:11.629
We saw that with the discovery of the DNA
code; we can understand that the essence of

00:12:11.629 --> 00:12:15.929
life was actually information processing.
And, of course, that's the essence of technology

00:12:15.929 --> 00:12:23.679
and it wasn't too long ago, for the first
time, that we actually exported Darwinian

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:31.249
evolution and moved it in to a computational
world and they, for instance, we used it to

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:41.259
evolve computer code. Microsoft Word has parts
of its code that was evolved and not actually

00:12:41.259 --> 00:12:47.109
programmed by humans. So, we moved evolution
out of biology into computers and at the same

00:12:47.109 --> 00:12:57.179
time, we could take E. coli and assign numbers
to its genetic sequences and in parallel,

00:12:57.179 --> 00:13:02.329
as a proof of concept, used it as a parallel
processing machine to solve a travelling salesman

00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:09.709
program. So, we used the parallel processing
of E. coli genetics to solve a computer program.

00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:16.670
So, we have evolution moving in computers;
we have life and evolution moving from life

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:22.369
and doing computation, showing that in some
senses, that there's equivalency between life

00:13:22.369 --> 00:13:27.889
and the technium--that the division that we
normally think of them, as a gulf, is not

00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:34.259
there. In fact, there is a continuum between
the two. So, that means that when we look

00:13:34.259 --> 00:13:42.730
at things like this, this 17, 1800s, this
diversity of smoke catchers is almost like

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:47.079
a museum collection of different species of
butterflies and we see specialization, of

00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:54.189
course, happening in the technium in mechanical
things. We make a computer or a camera, and

00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:58.679
then we might make this specialized underwater
camera and infrared camera and a high-speed

00:13:58.679 --> 00:14:03.649
camera and then we can specialize that to
make a specialized infrared camera, and then

00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:07.499
a specialized infrared underwater camera and
so it goes on and on; that specialization

00:14:07.499 --> 00:14:16.600
is happening. And we can even map, in some
cases, the genealogy of different inventions.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:23.809
And I think that's, the parallels are so steep
that, in fact, we might even think of, these

00:14:23.809 --> 00:14:32.949
are the six kingdoms of life: plants, animals,
fungi and three kinds of bacteria. We might

00:14:32.949 --> 00:14:38.189
think of these six kingdoms of life as actually
producing the seventh kingdom, and I think

00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:43.100
of the technium as basically the seventh kingdom
of life because it shares so many of the attributes

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:47.720
as a system, again, as a technium; not the
individual artifacts, but as a system, it

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:54.749
exhibits so many of the same self-organizing
forces that life does that we, that I think

00:14:54.749 --> 00:14:59.940
of it as the seventh kingdom of life. So,
when I ask what does technology want, what

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:05.970
are the biases and the long-term trends in
technology, I get a very similar answer. And

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:15.879
again, I wanna go back to the idea that "want"
is not conscious, but is real that even unintelligent

00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:21.939
systems can have wants. So, this is the Willow
Garage PD2, I think, robot which has been

00:15:21.939 --> 00:15:30.290
programmed to find its own energy; to recharge
itself. And so, it will roam through its building

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:36.889
looking for outlets and then takes its tail
plug and it plugs in by itself, it plugs into

00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:42.180
the outlet until its recharged and then it
takes off again. And I had the privilege of

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:49.350
standing between it and the outlet and it
very definitely wanted energy. You could feel

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:54.970
it. And it was gonna find it somehow or another
and it was not conscious, it was not aware,

00:15:54.970 --> 00:16:02.959
it was not very intelligent, but it definitely
wanted electricity. And so, if we again ask

00:16:02.959 --> 00:16:07.790
what the technium wants, what it wants is
the same thing. It wants to head towards;

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:14.160
it's a general bias to drift towards increasing
complexity, increasing diversity, increasing

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:19.319
specialization, increasing mutualism, ubiquity,
sentience and evolvability, among other things.

00:16:19.319 --> 00:16:26.079
And so, what does that mean? Well, here's
one example of a long-term trend in technology.

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:33.229
If you take the power density--the energy
density-- of living, of systems that are in

00:16:33.229 --> 00:16:40.799
disequilibrium, like a galaxy, like a star,
even planets with atmosphere life, you find

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:45.809
that the amount of energy per second per gram,
so erg's per second per gram, flowing through

00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:52.129
this system for the duration of the system
that the highest energy densities are actually

00:16:52.129 --> 00:17:01.139
increasing over astronomical time. And that,
in fact, there's more energy flowing through

00:17:01.139 --> 00:17:11.889
the cells of a sunflower than there is in
the sun over its entire lifespan. And so,

00:17:11.889 --> 00:17:16.500
the most energy dense entity that we know
about in the world is actually the chip in

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:21.230
your PC, in your computer. In fact, that's
the problem for engineers is that there's

00:17:21.230 --> 00:17:26.630
so much energy flowing through here and it's
so dense that it's near explosion or meltdown.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:34.500
I mean, it's incredibly, incredibly energy
dense state and yet we can actually say that

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:40.731
where its gonna go is actually gonna be even
further in that direction. So, these systems

00:17:40.731 --> 00:17:44.231
have their own agenda of some sort, and the
question is what is the agenda? And one of

00:17:44.231 --> 00:17:47.860
the agendas is, of course, to increase itself.
I did a calculation that most of the power

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:54.100
in the technium is using to serve the technium
rather than us humans. When you're driving

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:59.370
your car, three quarters or more of that energy
that you burn is to move the car, not you.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:07.380
You're a minor passenger, literally, in this
thing and we have, your car then has a garage,

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.350
which may be needed to be heated as well,
even when you're not there. And so, we have

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:18.169
this thing in which the technium is trying,
is increasing, at least servicing more of

00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:23.200
itself. It's, there's more technology and
the more technology is, the more it needs.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:27.440
So, that's one sense. And the other one, and
another sense of having an agenda would be

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:33.500
Moore's Law. So, a great question that I tried
to answer was, "Was Moore's Law inevitable?

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:39.880
Or, is Moore's Law inevitable?" And Gordon
Moore and Carver Mead, who developed this

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:47.769
in the 60s, and this, of course, is this unwavering
line over decades of research, independent

00:18:47.769 --> 00:18:52.159
of the fact that people are constantly trying
to accelerate it by putting billions into

00:18:52.159 --> 00:18:55.630
a fad or whatever, or trying to ahead of it;
it still doesn't work, it's just very, very

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:59.779
straight. They believed it was actually just
a self-fulfilling prophecy, but, of course,

00:18:59.779 --> 00:19:07.190
the problem was is that this curve translated
into like, say operations per second, has

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:15.090
been going on way before they were aware of
it and we see similar kinds of curves in bandwidth,

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:23.669
storage, DNA sequencing and all these curves
are on the same kind of unwavering, fixed

00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:28.549
slope and they start long before people believed
them, even when they deny they are there,

00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:35.830
and so it's not just self-fulfilling prophecy.
It is built in to the mechanics of physics

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:41.409
and chemistry and the slope may be something
that depends on the economy, but the fact

00:19:41.409 --> 00:19:50.000
that it's straight does not. And another example
of an agenda is that most inventions throughout

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.519
history and currently now, are independently,
simultaneously invented. There were 23 other

00:19:56.519 --> 00:20:02.520
people who invented light bulbs before Edison.
When Alexander Graham Bell filed the patents

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:10.129
for the telephone three years, three hours
later, Elisha Gray submitted for his idea

00:20:10.129 --> 00:20:17.450
and neither, and both had been preceded by
an Italian years before. And in every case,

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:22.720
we, and we even, in places like, I looked
at the studies of work during the Manhattan

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:29.539
Project, when there was six different groups
working on things that were absolutely separated

00:20:29.539 --> 00:20:36.660
because of secrecy and wartime division. Even
the three groups in the US were on a need

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:41.039
to know basis and were not aware of the others'
work, they kept very meticulous records, so

00:20:41.039 --> 00:20:48.740
we have absolute proof, laboratory experiments
of people inventing things completely independent

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:53.710
and coming up with very similar things and
in the near at the same time. So, whenever

00:20:53.710 --> 00:21:01.440
the precursor inventions are in need, or excuse
me, are in place in this ecology, the next

00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:08.770
adjacent space is inevitable and it will happen
at that time whether someone is, I mean, that

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.740
the person who actually receives it is just
those who are putting themselves there. It's

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:18.510
not really dependent on the lone genius. And
this is the work of Stephen Johnson, showing

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:22.759
the same thing. The idea of the lone genius
is just incorrect. It comes from an ecology;

00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:28.940
an ecosystem of codependent inventions and
that the steps in these things are inevitable

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:34.600
and the progression is even inevitable. And
I showed that, in this book, looking at the

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.570
pre-history inventions on different continents
when they were separated and without any kind

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:43.000
of communication between them, the sequence
of inventions in pre-history were on the different

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.179
continents were very close to being the same
in each case, showing that, in a certain sense,

00:21:48.179 --> 00:21:55.700
that the technologies that are coming are
also going to be inevitable. And so, the Web

00:21:55.700 --> 00:22:00.830
was inevitable. Now, what was not inevitable
was what kind of Web we have. I think we,

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:06.799
the expressions of it are like the genre,
the genius level is inevitable, but the speciation

00:22:06.799 --> 00:22:11.809
is not. So the light bulb, incandescent light
bulb, was inevitable, but the actual, whether

00:22:11.809 --> 00:22:16.590
it was tungsten or not, whether what voltage,
whether it was AC or DC; those were not inevitable.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:22.149
And the same thing with the Web. The expression
of it, whether it's centralized or decentralized,

00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:29.230
transparent with the actual protocol is, those
are not inevitable and those differences actually

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:34.919
make a huge difference to our experience of
it. Ok, so, so, and I would say that as we

00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:41.600
look to the future, human cloning is inevitable.
Now, in what arena, how is it done? That's

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.149
not inevitable; we have some choices about
that. Computer driven cars, as you guys know,

00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:53.940
they're inevitable, but not what the regulation
is, not how we experience them, not the cultural

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:58.179
infrastructure that we built around them.
Those are things we do have choices about.

00:22:58.179 --> 00:23:05.549
And so, humanity, I think, is something we've
self-created. And whenever you have self-creation,

00:23:05.549 --> 00:23:12.179
that means that you, which we are; we've created
ourselves. We are both the created and the

00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:17.080
creators, so there's a tension that we have
about technology from the very beginning.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.759
We are self-created in the sense that very
early on, we started doing things like creating

00:23:22.759 --> 00:23:29.129
an external stomach to cook our food, to cook
food that we could not digest ourselves and

00:23:29.129 --> 00:23:33.529
that external stomach actually changed our
nutrition sufficiently that it actually altered

00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:42.139
over time the size of our teeth, the position
of our jaw, the enzymes in our body, and so

00:23:42.139 --> 00:23:48.710
we're now dependent on cooking, but it actually
has changed our genetics. So, we've modified

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.909
ourselves, through our brain, through our
technology, we have modified ourselves. We

00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:59.220
have remade, or made, or created ourselves.
And a lot of what we identify with humanity

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:04.630
is, in fact, from our laws, through our sense
of justice, to maybe even our language, are

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:13.110
things that we have made with our minds. And
we have, we're self-created. And as, again,

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:17.200
self-created, that means that we are both
the creator and the created. We are both masters

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:23.049
and the servant. That happens when you are
self-created. That invention of language,

00:24:23.049 --> 00:24:28.980
about 50 thousand years ago, changed the population
dynamics. We were only eight to ten thousand

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.879
in total maybe in the world and as soon as
we had language, we had a tool that will,

00:24:33.879 --> 00:24:37.889
gave us access to our own minds. I think the
Neanderthals were probably pretty smart, but

00:24:37.889 --> 00:24:42.649
didn't have any kind of control over that
because they didn't have language. Language

00:24:42.649 --> 00:24:46.779
is not just for communicating with others,
but communicating with ourselves and so, with

00:24:46.779 --> 00:24:51.340
language, we are suddenly, we had tools, we
had technology, we could deliberately make

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:57.190
things rather than just encounter them and
we spread very fast. In fact, we spread across

00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:04.490
every watershed in the planet at the scale
of one mile per year. That's how fast the

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:11.080
expansion of humanity was around the globe.
One mile per year, we settled the entire globe

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:17.340
in a couple thousand years. And so, with this
technology alone, for a long time, we actually

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:25.730
modified the entire planet. We, the early
hunter-gatherers eliminated 250 mega-, 250

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:31.399
species of mega fauna to extinction long before,
I mean, these were the kind of, the people

00:25:31.399 --> 00:25:39.750
living in harmony, supposedly. These people
completely altered the whole mix of, because

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:45.379
once you eradicate the mega fauna, it changes
all the speciation of the ecology. And even

00:25:45.379 --> 00:25:51.620
by the time we got to agriculture, ten thousand
years ago, agriculture started to change the

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:57.750
climate, so climate change actually preceded
the industrial age. So really, from the very

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:04.370
beginning of our tools, technology has become
a planetary force. And, in fact, I would say

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:10.220
that it's now the most powerful force in the
world. Most of the things in our lives, we

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:16.250
can draw back its origins to something that
we invented. And most of the change in the

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:20.940
future, of course, will all come from things
that we invented. And what I'm saying, of

00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:25.029
course, is that the greatest invention that
we made is our own humanity and, of course,

00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:30.600
we're not done yet and that's the whole point
of this. So, technology is selfish in the

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:39.649
sense that it has its own agenda. We are the
created, so it's selfish in that sense. But

00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:45.620
also, at the same time, it serves us. We are
the creators and that tension between being

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:51.460
created and being the creator, being the master
and the slave to technology is never gonna

00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:57.190
leave us and it's the cause of all our constant
tension. And a thousand years from now, with

00:26:57.190 --> 00:27:01.499
new technology, we'll still be wrestling with
the fact that we are both the created and

00:27:01.499 --> 00:27:07.159
the creator, that technology is both selfish
and serves us at the same time, and that duality,

00:27:07.159 --> 00:27:11.340
that tension, is never gonna leave. And, of
course, most people would embrace technology,

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:16.490
I think, but there's concern about is there
any limit to it? Is this gonna take over,

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:22.441
become the techno planet and wipe out the
biology? And what's interesting, if you take

00:27:22.441 --> 00:27:28.029
my assertion that, in fact, the technium is
an extension of the evolutionary force, that

00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:37.559
it's a continuation and acceleration of evolution
in life, that means actually that, what, so

00:27:37.559 --> 00:27:42.200
far, what we know is that there's no technology
that we discovered yet that cannot be made

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:49.040
greener, more compatible with life. And so,
while there's much about the technium that

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:57.679
is not compatible with life, that's grimy
and dirty and inhumane at scale, there's nothing

00:27:57.679 --> 00:28:07.129
inherent in the technium about that. That's
not inherent, so we can make more green stuff

00:28:07.129 --> 00:28:12.610
that is compatible with life and living. In
fact, when you make these chips for the computers,

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:17.450
they require a purity of water actually exceeds
what we're drinking. And so, in a certain

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:21.230
sense, you can say, "Well, yeah, even technology
wants clean water." So, there is a sense in

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:29.529
which that's necessary for technology, just
like for us. And so, I think, it's, the technium

00:28:29.529 --> 00:28:34.909
inherently is not compatible with life, but
is compatible with life. And I like the way

00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:41.139
to think of it, if we have a technology that
is not green--maybe it's actually very harmful

00:28:41.139 --> 00:28:46.120
to the environment-- I think of that as a
bad idea. So, what's the proper response to

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.100
a bad idea? Well, if somebody has a bad, if
somebody here had a bad idea, we're not gonna

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:57.139
say to them, "Think less." We're gonna say,
"Come up with a better idea." And I think

00:28:57.139 --> 00:29:03.059
that's the response to a bad idea, is a better
idea. So, when we have a bad technology, maybe

00:29:03.059 --> 00:29:11.639
you're spraying DDT across cotton crops on
plantation scale in millions of pounds a year

00:29:11.639 --> 00:29:18.899
and that's an environmental disaster, so the
response to a bad technology is not less technology;

00:29:18.899 --> 00:29:24.470
it's better technology. So, we can reform.
We take the same technology, the same chemical,

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:33.340
DDT, and we, if we apply it around households,
it is the most effective eliminator of malaria,

00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:43.450
saving tens of millions of lives a year. And
so, we can relocate a technology. So, most

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:49.159
of the problems in the world today are technogenic.
They have, they're caused by previous technologies.

00:29:49.159 --> 00:29:55.480
Every new technology will make new problems.
In the future, most of the problems of the

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:57.970
world in the future are gonna come from the
technologies that were invented today or in

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:05.070
the future, so we're all gonna be technogenic
as well. And so, so there's a tendency because

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:08.559
so many problems are technogenic is to say
that we need less technology, but in fact

00:30:08.559 --> 00:30:13.840
we just need better technology. Understanding,
of course, that the better technology is gonna

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:20.190
generate its own problems in the future. So,
I think our jobs as humans is to move that

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:32.450
DDT into a better job; to find the best jobs
for our mind children. And they're, just like

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:35.710
we have our children, we want to guide them
in the right thing; make sure they have the

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:39.840
right friends, put them in the right context
and the right environment and really try to

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.289
look for what it is that they want. And I
think there's, just as there's no bad children,

00:30:44.289 --> 00:30:48.820
there's really no bad technologies. There's
just technologies looking for the right place.

00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:53.470
And I think that even that's true about lots
of technologies that are weaponized. I mean,

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:57.679
it's not inconceivable to me that there might
be some place in space where you might want

00:30:57.679 --> 00:31:02.520
to have nuclear bombs. They are a terrible
thing for killing humans, but they might be

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:09.580
useful for other things and as long as we're
on Earth, we probably don't want them. So,

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:19.210
what technology wants, it wants increasing
diversity, increasing options, choices, opportunities,

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:24.600
possibilities; that's what technology gives
us, ok? So, I acknowledge that technology

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:30.879
and new technology will often produce as many
problems as solutions, ok? So, people will

00:31:30.879 --> 00:31:36.169
say, "Well, that means that technology is
just neutral." That's the orthodox view of

00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:41.679
a lot of technologists. It's a neutral tool;
use it for good, use it for bad. If it's a

00:31:41.679 --> 00:31:47.059
hammer, it can kill somebody or build a house,
ok? And in a certain sense, that is true,

00:31:47.059 --> 00:31:52.900
but there's one difference is that when that
hammer was invented, it presented you and

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:58.940
the world and us with a new choice we did
not have before. And I say that that new choice

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:05.600
itself is a good. Just the new choice itself
is a good. That tips the balance slightly,

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:11.659
very, very slightly in the favor of good overall,
ok? So, every new technology itself, while

00:32:11.659 --> 00:32:16.559
it can create new problems, the fact that
it is increasing our choices and our possibilities

00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:22.649
is itself in the good. And it turns out that
you don't need it to be a whole lot better;

00:32:22.649 --> 00:32:29.259
it can be a little bit better. So, if, through
technology, we can create one percent more

00:32:29.259 --> 00:32:34.840
than we destroy every year, compounded over
years and centuries, that one percent difference

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:40.889
is civilization. That's progress, ok? So,
we don't need to have that. Maybe it's only

00:32:40.889 --> 00:32:48.690
a tenth of a percent, so 49.5 percent of the
world could be crap and terrible and horrible,

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:57.600
but if 51, or even 50.5 percent is great and
good and increases our choices, that is progress

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.369
in my eyes. That's how we get progress. So,
that's why it's not just neutral. I think

00:33:02.369 --> 00:33:12.960
the long, there is a moral dimension to technology;
it's not neutral. And we are increasing our

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.669
options and possibilities. I did with my daughter;
I did a count of the number of objects in

00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:22.860
our house. There were about ten thousand different
objects. If you look at the inventory of the

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:27.860
king, King Henry the 8th of England, when
he died, they did an inventory of everything

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.869
in his household which doubled as the Bank
of England, ok? And there was 18 thousand

00:33:32.869 --> 00:33:40.029
objects; so basically, the wealth of England
was 18 thousand objects. And so we say, when

00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:46.149
sometimes we're approaching the wealth kings
of old in our normal, everyday life, but actually

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:52.809
it's even more interesting because the wealth
of King Henry, all his wealth in total could

00:33:52.809 --> 00:34:01.779
not have purchased a tube of antibiotics ointment
that could have saved his life or someone

00:34:01.779 --> 00:34:09.510
he loved. I think its Rothchild, the wealthy,
the first multimillionaires in America died

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:15.059
of an abscess that could have been cured with
two dollars worth of antibiotics, but his

00:34:15.059 --> 00:34:21.190
wealth could not have bought that. And this
guy, this rickshaw wallah in India could have

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:26.040
so many things that King Henry and all his
wealth could not buy, which was, King Henry

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:30.500
could not have a flush toilet and his wealth
could not buy refrigeration, could not buy

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:35.369
a comfortable ride for a hundred miles; all
these things. And this guy could afford these

00:34:35.369 --> 00:34:42.079
and so, in that sense, he and us are far wealthier
than King Henry ever was. That's what progress

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:49.730
is. That's what this stuff brings us and it
gives us not just progress, but choices, possibilities,

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:55.750
opportunities, longevity, increased education;
all these things which are pointing up over

00:34:55.750 --> 00:35:06.210
time. And I want, it's, what I want to emphasize
is that it's, when we spend our time making

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:11.010
new things, it's not just, I mean, we're sometimes
dismayed because we make things that people

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:15.510
forget very easily, or they throw away; we
seem like we're involved in just selling more

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.680
stuff and it's consumerism. And so, there
is a sense in which we're just creating lots

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:23.610
of stuff and we say, "Well, why are we doing
this? What's the value in it?" And I'm saying

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:29.240
what it is, there's a larger thing, which
is that we are actually increasing the choices

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:36.200
and possibilities and options of the world.
And the reason why that's good is because

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:42.130
we're actually partaking in something that
is larger than us. That this, this force itself

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:48.720
organization of increasing diversity began
at the Big Bang and it's been running through.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.849
This, this, the rest of the world, the universe
is running down and entropy is going down,

00:35:53.849 --> 00:35:58.250
but there are places where we can accelerate
the creation of entropy and increase local

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:03.349
order--exotropy--and that's, one of those
neighborhoods is this Earth and this life

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:11.440
on Earth, which is being increasing its order
by accelerating the creation of entropy. And

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:16.790
that self-organization is running through
the galaxies, which are maintaining the order,

00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:21.550
or stars, which are machines for building
up heavier atoms from lighter atoms and they

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:28.819
maintain themselves for billions of years.
And that self-organization is running through

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:33.319
life and into the technium and so, we are
actually, we can align ourselves with something

00:36:33.319 --> 00:36:38.640
much bigger than us, ourselves. It goes back
to the beginning and it's gonna run from the

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:45.059
beginning of the universe and actually beyond
us, go beyond us, even as humanities in the

00:36:45.059 --> 00:36:53.250
middle of something. We're not the end of
anything. And so, that long arc is actually

00:36:53.250 --> 00:37:00.410
bringing increasing choices and possibilities.
And the reason why that is important is because

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:09.680
I think that we often need these new tools
for each of us to express our inherent special

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:14.420
mix of talents and abilities. We all have
different faces because of the different mix

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:21.360
of genes and things we have. We all have different
niches of talents and abilities and the technology's

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:26.030
often required for us to find and express
that. So you can, I like to think of Jimi

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:33.609
Hendrix and the fact that the invention of
the amplifier--he played the amplifier and

00:37:33.609 --> 00:37:38.530
not the guitar--so, the amplifier actually
allowed his genius to be shared in the world.

00:37:38.530 --> 00:37:46.309
And then I think about, "Well, what a hole
in us we would have if he had been born before

00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:51.970
the amplifier had been invented." Or if Mozart
had been born before the technology of the

00:37:51.970 --> 00:38:01.100
piano had been invented. Or maybe Van Gogh
before oil paints, or Hitchcock before the

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:07.690
invention of the technologies of cinema. What
a loss that would be to us. And so, in a certain

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:14.839
sense, I think there are today, somewhere
in the world, a boy or girl, a genius of some

00:38:14.839 --> 00:38:19.680
sort who's waiting for us to invent those
tools and technologies that would allow their

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:27.359
genius to be shared. And so, I think we actually
have a moral obligation to create those things,

00:38:27.359 --> 00:38:32.990
those possibilities, to maximize those possibilities
for everybody in the world so they would have

00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:43.860
some chance to really find and share their
genius with us. And because we actually had

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:52.960
been benefitted by others in the past, who
had been making new things for us, and so

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:59.740
we have, we're here to make more technology
to increase those possibilities and that is

00:38:59.740 --> 00:39:05.720
part of this long, cosmic evolution; this
long thread of self-organization that's moving

00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:11.390
through us and beyond us. So, I thank you
for your time and if you wanna look at the

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:18.480
book, Amazon and others have it. That's the
general thesis and I think we have time for

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:22.141
a few questions. I'd be happy to answer them.
So, thank you.

00:39:22.141 --> 00:39:27.270
[applause]

00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:33.360
So, total agreement; I love it.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.820
[member #1 clears throat]

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:40.440
&gt;&gt;member #1: Hi. Two questions of--

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.440
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah.

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:45.490
&gt;&gt;member #1: clarification, I think. In the
middle of your talk, you were talking about

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:46.520
things being inevitable.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.520
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.910
&gt;&gt;member #1: Do you mean literal, like logically
inevitable, or just overwhelmingly probable?

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:59.440
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Tell me the distinction between those
two.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:05.589
&gt;&gt;member #1: Logically, the logically thing
that I was trying to get at is that there

00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:12.010
is no way that it could have been prevented;
it would just follow as a course of almost

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:17.480
mathematics versus probabilistically inevitable
means, yeah, sooner or later it's likely enough

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.660
that sooner or later it would happen.

00:40:19.660 --> 00:40:24.040
&gt;&gt;Kevin: I think the universe is basically
probalistic. I think everything about the

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:29.869
universe is probalistic. So, I would side
with probablistic rather than logically.

00:40:29.869 --> 00:40:38.049
&gt;&gt;member #1: Ok. So in that sense, arguably
it could have happened that we had bombed

00:40:38.049 --> 00:40:43.390
each other back into the Stone Age, in the
50s, and there were no iPods. There would

00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:49.299
have been no iPods for some period of time.
That's still consistent with what you mean,

00:40:49.299 --> 00:40:50.349
inevitable is that yeah--

00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:56.650
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Sure, sure. I mean inevitable in
a sense that there's inevitable progress in

00:40:56.650 --> 00:41:01.470
human development, meaning that you start
off as a fertilized egg, you grow into a fetus,

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:08.600
embryo, fetus, toddler and stuff. Now, and
so, it's inevitable that a human become a

00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:13.510
teenager. Now obviously, there's lots of humans
who die before they ever become a teenager,

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:20.230
so is it inevitable you become a teenager?
Well, if you die, then you say, logically

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:26.600
you can't. So, yes, there is, so probabilistically,
it's inevitable.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:31.840
&gt;&gt;member #1: Ok. The other question I was
gonna ask to clarify is that I think you used

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.760
the word technology in a couple of different
senses--

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:35.760
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yes.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:36.760
&gt;&gt;member #1: at least over the course of the
talk.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:37.760
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.859
&gt;&gt;member #1: The main thrust of it is when
you seem to be talking about as if it's something

00:41:41.859 --> 00:41:44.980
that has some kind of existence in itself--

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:45.980
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:46.980
&gt;&gt;member #1: in the way that society does.
Is that--

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:47.980
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yes. Right.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:48.980
&gt;&gt;member #1: what you were trying to--

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.420
&gt;&gt;Kevin: So, I use the word, in the book,
I'm a little bit more consistent, I use the

00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:56.990
word technium, but that's a word I've coined
so I was not trying to-- I was trying to ease

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:02.819
people into the idea, but the technium, as
I said in the very beginning, is the system,

00:42:02.819 --> 00:42:06.960
the interdependent system of things. It's
not the collection of the individual artifacts.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:14.910
It is a system, an ecosystem, you might think
of it as super system of all the things that

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:16.369
our minds create together.

00:42:16.369 --> 00:42:23.220
&gt;&gt;member #1: Right. Would you, you also used
the phrase that technology was a force.

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.220
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yes.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:27.800
&gt;&gt;member #1: Do you, so you view it as a system
and a force?

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:36.589
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right. I think that the force of
it is actually, it's the exotropic force.

00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:46.539
So, it's a force in a way that you would say
a big truck coming down the road is gonna

00:42:46.539 --> 00:42:54.420
hit me. That's a force, it's a force created
by an artifact. So, the force, in that sense,

00:42:54.420 --> 00:43:00.460
is not, it's, you're actually talking about
the energy of it and in my case, when I talk

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:04.490
about the force of technology, I'm talking
about the exotropic force that is within technology.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:09.051
&gt;&gt;member #2: Thanks for coming to speak here.

00:43:09.051 --> 00:43:10.051
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah.

00:43:10.051 --> 00:43:14.910
&gt;&gt;member #2: A lot of what you say really
rings deeply true to me and I'm struggling

00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:17.210
with what the implications are to take it
back down--

00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:18.210
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Sure.

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.940
&gt;&gt;member #2: because I feel that has a moment
of enlightenment reading what you've been

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:24.650
saying, but the fact is that on one hand,
a lot of these trends are inevitable and I

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:25.650
think we, like--

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:26.650
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:27.650
&gt;&gt;member #2: if you work at Google, you realize
like, on the one hand, we're trying really

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:28.650
hard to move ahead on it--

00:43:28.650 --> 00:43:29.650
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Sure, sure, sure.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:32.369
&gt;&gt;member #2: and the wolf's on our back the
whole time, right? So, I think it's pretty

00:43:32.369 --> 00:43:36.620
clear. But that in any kind of short meaningful
period of time in terms of product cycles

00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:40.089
or competition or what people are working
on, it's totally not inevitable; in fact,

00:43:40.089 --> 00:43:43.869
totally contingent on what we choose to work
on or what other people choose to work on

00:43:43.869 --> 00:43:44.869
and--

00:43:44.869 --> 00:43:45.869
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Sure, sure.

00:43:45.869 --> 00:43:47.980
&gt;&gt;member #2: so, I was actually fascinated
to hear, and I forget if it's in your book

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.650
or in other writings that you actually have
a lot of very specific ideas about what technology

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.680
you do and don't use and keep near your house
and keep in your family. So, even--

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.680
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:57.059
&gt;&gt;member #2: though we're all here bullish
about this, do you think you can actually

00:43:57.059 --> 00:43:58.059
intervene--

00:43:58.059 --> 00:43:59.059
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Sure.

00:43:59.059 --> 00:44:00.059
&gt;&gt;member #2: in lots of meaningful ways?

00:44:00.059 --> 00:44:01.059
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Sure, sure, sure.

00:44:01.059 --> 00:44:02.059
&gt;&gt;member #2: And it may be the longer term
trends, are they appropriate for government

00:44:02.059 --> 00:44:05.000
policy and things like that, or, in other
words, how do you bring it back down for you

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
and for others?

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.859
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Sure. So, one thing I would say about
inevitabilities is that there's a certain

00:44:08.859 --> 00:44:14.480
sense which, and if you use the word inevitable,
they're fighting words. It brings up lots

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:19.630
of reactions and I think rather than flee
from inevitabilities, I think I would use

00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:27.950
them as like a helpful signal; the fact that
we can prepare for them. We can prepare our

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:34.250
education, we can prepare our businesses,
our models to anticipate and maximize their

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:40.190
good when they come and minimize the harm.
And so, if you knew, I mean, if you went back

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:45.460
to the – say, Moore's Law, in the 1960s,
you believed Moore's Law and realized that

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:50.800
this was inevitable. Think of all the things
you could do in the following 50 years, if

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:55.510
you really knew that every year, computers
would get twice as fast and half as cheap,

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:59.799
you wouldn't have to know anything about IBM
or Apple or Google to make a lot of money

00:44:59.799 --> 00:45:04.590
first of all just on that one simple acceptance,
but there's also lots of things you could

00:45:04.590 --> 00:45:11.840
do for culture and education, really understanding
that it was inevitable. So, the question you

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.090
asked, though, about how do you go back and
how do we make into our own lives, is yes.

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:19.869
One of the things that's interesting is that
while I'm preaching, in a certain sense, if

00:45:19.869 --> 00:45:23.640
you want to actually increase the amount of
technology in the world, I, myself, am actually

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:28.869
trying to minimize it in my own life, ok?
And the reason why is that what it turns out

00:45:28.869 --> 00:45:35.640
to be is to find that place that those tools
that are best for your genius, you, it's not

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:39.920
all technology; it's gonna be a very select
amount of technology and those other technologies

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:43.840
are actually distractions. And so, in a certain
sense what you're actually trying to do is

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:48.520
find that small set of technologies that are
appropriate for you and ignoring the rest.

00:45:48.520 --> 00:45:53.250
And so, what, that's what the Amish do in
a certain sense. There's a chapter in the

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:57.270
book about the Amish, which I hung out and
I was in great admiration of them. They're

00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:01.280
very, very selective, they're not anti, they're
not Luddites, they're just very selective

00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:07.590
in a curious way. I mean, they have horse
and buggy and bonnets and stuff, but they

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:12.089
still, they use disposable diapers, they're
really into chemical fertilizers, they use

00:46:12.089 --> 00:46:17.530
genetically modified crops, ok? So, they're
very, very selective, but the reason why I'm

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:21.880
not Amish is for, because they only do one
half of it. They're trying to minimize the

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:26.480
technology in their lives, but they're not
trying to maximize the technology for others.

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:31.260
They're actually dependant on us to do that.
I think we have to do both. I am interested

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:38.660
in minimizing my selection while I maximize
the larger pool for others to choose from,

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:45.280
ok? So, I think that tension, again, is also
going on and I think we have, there's more

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.609
technology that's being invented and there's
more of it every year that we could possibly

00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:54.369
ever ourselves adopt. So, we have to have
some criteria. I mean, we can't just randomly

00:46:54.369 --> 00:46:59.309
try stuff; we have to begin to cultivate some
kind of criteria, narrow it down while we

00:46:59.309 --> 00:47:03.930
encourage the increasing choices for others.
Yes.

00:47:03.930 --> 00:47:07.150
&gt;&gt;member #3: So, earlier in your talk, I was
really struck by something you said about

00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:09.220
our expectations about technology, the rules--

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:10.220
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:14.160
&gt;&gt;member #3: and the purpose. For me, my belief
is that someday the universe is gonna kill

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:17.980
us all, right? I mean, a supernova or a comet
strike or eco-catastrophe or whatever.

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:18.980
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:23.210
&gt;&gt;member #3: And nothing lasts forever and
I see technology as our best bet for postponing

00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:24.650
that day as long as possible.

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:25.650
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Ok.

00:47:25.650 --> 00:47:27.029
&gt;&gt;member #3: Do you, would you say that's
the way to bet?

00:47:27.029 --> 00:47:34.099
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Well, I'm gonna bet on technology;
yes. I mean, I think, I think, what I'm trying

00:47:34.099 --> 00:47:38.170
to suggest is that the difference, I mean
I think that we becoming more technological,

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:42.480
that we are part of; the technium is not something
that's out there, it's something we're part

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:50.860
of and so I don't see much distinction as
we go along between us and technology. We

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:57.119
are already cyborgs. We're already there.
So, so, and it's not just, I think we may

00:47:57.119 --> 00:48:00.829
have multiple species. I mean, that's the
real question. There are gonna be people who

00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:06.920
say under no circumstances am I or my children
ever gonna manipulate our genes, and there

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:11.790
are other people who say yeah, sign me up
tomorrow. And we may become multiple species

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:16.410
and so, I think the very definition of what
humans is, is we are in the process of redefining

00:48:16.410 --> 00:48:22.410
it. Every time there's a new innovation in
robotics or AI, we have to redefine who we

00:48:22.410 --> 00:48:27.400
are. We thought we could do this, and what
humans are. And it's not just what we are,

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:33.280
I think there are huge problems out there.
The huge challenge we have is that we can

00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:38.079
define who we can be and we don't even have
any kind of process for that, for collectively

00:48:38.079 --> 00:48:44.180
deciding what humans wanna be. So, I think
we're at the beginning of this in terms of

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:46.130
even defining who we are. Yeah?

00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:52.680
&gt;&gt;member #4: So, I guess one of the underlying
principles here is that culture and technology

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:55.021
are evolutionary systems--

00:48:55.021 --> 00:48:56.021
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yes.

00:48:56.021 --> 00:48:59.070
&gt;&gt;member #4: as for share a lot of interesting
attributes with the evolutionary systems that

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:00.070
created life.

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:01.070
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:49:01.070 --> 00:49:03.630
&gt;&gt;member #4: I think this is a very interesting
area of study, but something that's hard for

00:49:03.630 --> 00:49:04.640
a lot of people to swallow--

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:05.640
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Sure.

00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.589
&gt;&gt;member #4: just because I think our general
understanding of evolved systems is still

00:49:08.589 --> 00:49:09.589
very weak.

00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:14.390
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right. We have the problem with evolution
is we have a case of one, which is really

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:15.480
to journalize about.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.549
&gt;&gt;member #4: Exactly.

00:49:17.549 --> 00:49:18.549
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:22.359
&gt;&gt;member #4: Now we're getting more of these
cases, but what can we do to enhance this

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:27.660
understanding, or further the study of evolutionary
processes in general and what they, what they

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:31.160
could mean and how we could use them?

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:37.791
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Actually, I changed my mind about
evolutionary systems when I realized we could

00:49:37.791 --> 00:49:42.690
actually make another form in computers. We
could do evolutionary studies and we can let

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:48.569
Darwinian evolution run in computers. And
I think simulations and other things we actually

00:49:48.569 --> 00:49:53.140
make more powerful systems and we let them
go and we let them invent things; I think

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:59.990
will teach us more about evolution than studying
more stuff in the field would be. So, that's

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:05.020
what I would say. I think the power of simulations,
as a tool of science, has just begun. And

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:10.270
again, referring to my earlier talk on the
evolution of the scientific method, I think

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:13.480
that's one of the big things that we're looking
at in the future and the scientific method

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:18.069
is a role that simulations will play. So,
yeah?

00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:23.390
&gt;&gt;member #5: Great talk, thanks for coming.
Lots of interesting ideas that provoke tons

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:24.390
of--

00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:27.380
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yes. Then I'm useful. That's the
whole purpose of the book.

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:31.260
&gt;&gt;member #5: So, I have a question, though,
about doesn't this actually reduce to something

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:32.859
else and this is a half measured [ ]?

00:50:32.859 --> 00:50:33.859
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Ok.

00:50:33.859 --> 00:50:36.380
&gt;&gt;member #5: Technology, you know you talk
about simulation and--

00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.380
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah.

00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:40.430
&gt;&gt;member #5: indeed, we can simulate evolutionary
systems, but as soon as we pull the plug or

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:42.130
the power supply no longer has coal--

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:43.130
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:45.210
&gt;&gt;member #5: it's done. It will not self-perpetuate.

00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:46.210
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right, right.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:48.990
&gt;&gt;member #5: And so, at some point it may
be inevitable that it will self-perpetuate,

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:50.020
but I kinda doubt it at this point.

00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:53.289
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right, right, right. Right now, we
are the sexual organs of technology. We're--

00:50:53.289 --> 00:50:54.289
&gt;&gt;member #5: Right.

00:50:54.289 --> 00:50:55.289
&gt;&gt;Kevin: necessary for it to reproduce.

00:50:55.289 --> 00:50:57.819
&gt;&gt;member #5: So, when you say what technology
wants, that personification makes me think

00:50:57.819 --> 00:51:03.279
actually we are the creators of technology,
so it's what we want and even the supporting

00:51:03.279 --> 00:51:06.450
technologies that are necessary to support
other technologies--

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:07.450
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:10.539
&gt;&gt;member #5: are just back chaining the complexities
and dependencies, but it's still ultimately

00:51:10.539 --> 00:51:15.589
what we want and if we're driven by the selfish
gene, which is driven by some even more primitive,

00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:16.589
prokaryotic--

00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:17.589
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:18.589
&gt;&gt;member #5: bacterial messaging--

00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:19.589
&gt;Kevin: Right, right.

00:51:19.589 --> 00:51:23.230
&gt;&gt;member #5: or whatever, then ultimately
doesn't this reduce to what does information

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.230
want?

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:25.230
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah.

00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:27.309
&gt;&gt;member #5: And so, does this bias and why
are you framing it this way?

00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:33.609
&gt;&gt;Kevin: No, I mean, I think it's a really
good question if you trace back and say, "What's,

00:51:33.609 --> 00:51:40.809
how did life self-organize? Where did that
want come from?" It's a huge mystery. And

00:51:40.809 --> 00:51:46.700
that's not even the beginning of the mysteries.
If you go back and say, "Well, it's all about

00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:51.060
information", we have no idea what information
is. Ask any cosmologist, any astronomer, "Is

00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:57.319
information being conserved in the universe
or not?" And they say, "Don't know." What's

00:51:57.319 --> 00:52:03.670
the definition of complexity? "Don't know."
And so, the mysteries in this are profound

00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:08.720
and I'm not suggesting that there's, this
isn't gonna solve any mystery, I'm only suggesting

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:15.750
that in fact, we can place technology in this
frame of reference to these other mysteries.

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:16.760
Maybe that's the best way to say it.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:21.020
&gt;&gt;member #5: Ok. Is there like a key, take-away
piece of utility you get from that?

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:27.500
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yes, and I think that is that the
distinction between life and between technology

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:34.839
and life is very thin. That, basically, think
of the technium as an extension, an acceleration

00:52:34.839 --> 00:52:39.390
of evolution and that we will do, we'll have
much better understanding where technology

00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:44.880
is headed if we understand that it's actually
closer to an evolutionary force than it is

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:46.450
something that we're just inventing with our
minds.

00:52:46.450 --> 00:52:47.819
&gt;&gt;member #5: Thanks.

00:52:47.819 --> 00:52:48.819
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah,

00:52:48.819 --> 00:52:53.720
&gt;&gt;member #6: So, to me it's surprising and
also encouraging that you take such an optimistic

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:56.880
view of what technology wants--

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.880
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:52:57.880 --> 00:53:01.950
&gt;&gt;member #6: with respect to creating more
choices, possibilities, making people's lives

00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:07.900
better, because if, so, I mean technology
is this extension of evolution and it is this

00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:14.441
sort of by-product of this process that we
are just one part of--

00:53:14.441 --> 00:53:15.441
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:53:15.441 --> 00:53:21.109
&gt;&gt;member #6: our subjective experience and
our feeling of good versus bad is independent

00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:26.120
of this in some sense, except in that it causes,
at the system level, these things to continue

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:31.260
happening. To me it seems like, I mean, if
you look at, for instance, the evolution of

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:39.069
multicellular life, right? This was a tremendous
win for life in general, but for single cells--

00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:40.069
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:42.290
&gt;&gt;member #6: for instance, this may have actually
been terrible. Now you've got things that

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:43.290
need to--

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:44.290
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Sure.

00:53:44.290 --> 00:53:45.819
&gt;&gt;member #6: spend their entire existence
as a stomach cell, say.

00:53:45.819 --> 00:53:49.210
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Or – well that's the same kind
of thing with the invention of oxygen--not

00:53:49.210 --> 00:53:54.580
the invention-- but the creation of oxygen,
which killed off all of the previous, a lot

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:58.079
of the previous life was killed by oxygen,
which of course was necessary for the other

00:53:58.079 --> 00:53:59.079
life. So, yeah.

00:53:59.079 --> 00:54:04.560
&gt;&gt;member #6: Exactly. So, I mean, you have
this thing where actually the individual actors

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:08.860
instead give rise to this next level of evolution,
tend to not always get the best deal out of

00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:09.860
it.

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:13.569
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right, right. So, one of the things
that actually, I think, that evolution is

00:54:13.569 --> 00:54:18.349
moving towards and this may speak to it, but
I didn't put it on this list because it wasn't,

00:54:18.349 --> 00:54:24.059
this list was not complete, is actually, we
actually, is making increasing choice and

00:54:24.059 --> 00:54:31.480
freedom of choices and degrees of freedom.
And so, as individuals, we actually have right

00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:36.650
now, compared to say, ten thousand years ago,
we have far more free choice than they had

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:42.980
ten thousand years ago. We, cause there's
this, we actually have more free choice, both,

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:47.819
I mean, in terms of our minds because we're
more aware than say, someone who had no language

00:54:47.819 --> 00:54:54.980
at all. And so, I think that even as individuals,
we do have increasing free choice. So, it's

00:54:54.980 --> 00:55:02.520
that and in the fact that we realize that
our choices are part of something larger and

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:08.730
I think that dichotomy between being masters
and servants will never leave us. It's not

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:14.980
gonna be nature/nurture. You can't unravel
the two. Master/servant, you can't unravel

00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:15.980
the two.

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:17.180
&gt;&gt;member #6: Thanks.

00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:18.510
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yep.

00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:25.450
&gt;&gt;member #7: So, I'm wondering how this, how
you take, say, security technologies into

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:32.160
account in this. I think there's a situation
where, let's say, in a video game, for example,

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.789
if you just give everybody more power--

00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:34.789
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah.

00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:37.859
&gt;&gt;member #7: and they become, so everybody
is a superhero, then we can all essentially

00:55:37.859 --> 00:55:42.769
attack each other and it becomes not very
interesting anymore because everyone is just

00:55:42.769 --> 00:55:44.710
ridiculously overpowered.

00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:45.710
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:50.760
&gt;&gt;member #7: And it seems like by giving people
more choices, you're giving more power to

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.710
interfere with other people's choices.

00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:56.130
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Well, there's something, Barry Schwartz
has talked about the tyranny of choice; this

00:55:56.130 --> 00:56:02.369
idea that if you give people too many choices,
they become paralyzed. And so, here's a solution.

00:56:02.369 --> 00:56:07.650
Again, I'm -- this is my techno-centric view.
I think the solution to overwhelming number

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:12.650
of choices is more technology that helps us
make those choices. And that's what Amazon

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:18.039
recommendation is, that's what those collaborative
filtering is. And so, the solution to like,

00:56:18.039 --> 00:56:24.940
more choices is another choice to use choice
filtering, choice aiding technology. And I

00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:32.230
think the same thing with what you're suggesting
is if there's all these choices, well, the

00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:37.030
solution's gonna be--sorry to say it-- more
technology, better technology.

00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:40.190
&gt;&gt;member #7: Well, I guess my question is
when people have different ideas about what

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:41.190
they want to do--

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:42.190
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right.

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:45.089
&gt;&gt;member #7: and they can interfere with each
other, then having more choices isn't this

00:56:45.089 --> 00:56:50.630
benign thing. It affects, it can negatively
affect other people. And one of the things

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:53.210
that you wanna see created are these like--

00:56:53.210 --> 00:56:58.940
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Right. But the only other solution,
I mean, if it isn't a better choice or better

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:03.569
technology for choices, is less choices and
I just don't think that--that's what I'm saying.

00:57:03.569 --> 00:57:09.670
That goes against the entire arc of evolution,
so I would not bet on that. I would always

00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:14.069
bet on better technology for making choices
than less choices.

00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:15.380
&gt;&gt;member #7: Uh-huh. Fair enough.

00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:16.380
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Ok.

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:18.250
&gt;&gt;woman moderator: Do you have time for one
more?

00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:22.910
&gt;&gt;Kevin: I have a last question and then,
I guess, you're almost seven minutes after.

00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:24.750
I guess it's time to move. Yeah?

00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:28.869
&gt;&gt;member #8: So, you said humanity was the
sexual organs of technology?

00:57:28.869 --> 00:57:29.869
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Yeah, well. Ok.

00:57:29.869 --> 00:57:30.869
[Kevin laughs]

00:57:30.869 --> 00:57:31.869
&gt;&gt;member #8: Do you think that'll--

00:57:31.869 --> 00:57:32.869
&gt;&gt;Kevin: That's not my line; by the way, I
think it's from Kluun.

00:57:32.869 --> 00:57:35.760
&gt;&gt;member #8: Will that continue or do you
think that'll change eventually?

00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:42.201
&gt;&gt;Kevin: No, that's, so right now I'm arguing
that we are giving the technium a little bit

00:57:42.201 --> 00:57:46.220
of autonomy. So, autonomy is not binary, it's
not like you're there or you're not there

00:57:46.220 --> 00:57:49.950
or you have little bits of it, including us.
We're not totally autonomous. So, I think

00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:54.380
we're going to increase the number, the amount
of autonomy. Can the technium ever be autonomous?

00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:59.250
Well, in the sense that we're part of it,
not really. I mean, we will always be part

00:57:59.250 --> 00:58:04.319
of the technium. So, it's not as if we're
gonna be separate from it, or ever separate

00:58:04.319 --> 00:58:10.680
from it. So, can it, I mean, yes, I think
there's gonna be certainly increasing amount

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:19.559
of technology, of excuse me, of autonomy in
the technium. Will it need us to not reproduce?

00:58:19.559 --> 00:58:24.780
I don't know, I don't know, I can imagine
different scenarios; lemme put it that way.

00:58:24.780 --> 00:58:31.410
I think there's multiple scenarios. Yeah,
it's inevitable that it would in some cases,

00:58:31.410 --> 00:58:38.260
but there may be other cases, other things
that we do where it isn't. So, I, in the sense

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:45.059
that you want to have, it wants to have multiple
possibilities, I think, what I'm saying is

00:58:45.059 --> 00:58:50.349
I don't think it remains one species. I think
we see a divergence. So there's some possibilities

00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:57.150
where it will be completely without us and
there's others where we're still essential.

00:58:57.150 --> 00:59:02.210
Those, most of the time, the future is not
a single, I'm not talking about a ladder where

00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:07.010
we climbing up a single race. These, these
trajectories are not, these trajectories are

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:15.630
like explosions. They're not like going along
a series on a ladder. So, again, I, thanks

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:21.260
for sticking around. I really appreciate the
questions and I hope you enjoy the book. Thanks

00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.260
for having me here.

00:59:22.260 --> 00:59:22.261
