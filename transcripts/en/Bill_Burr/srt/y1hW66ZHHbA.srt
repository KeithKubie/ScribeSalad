6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,130
You gonna blame society like all

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,980
Is it ever their fault? Um, anyways,

8
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:27,600
I have a special guest as promised on
the Monday morning podcast. I said,

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,810
God dammit. And I delivered.
We have the amazing,

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,080
the unbelievably talented
and hilarious Bill Hader,

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:39,090
star of the new incredible show on Hbo.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,100
Barry starring Henry Winkler. Stephen

13
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:47,310

15
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,450
it's eight incredible episodes.
Thank you.

16
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,470
I saw the first two and then
my link expired and then
I couldn't get it to play.

17
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:00,990
I got a new link and then I
melted down and my wife said,

18
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:03,930
you're bringing tension into the house.
So that was,

19
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,880
that's been my experience so far. But
having said that, I absolutely loved,

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,950
loved the first two that I saw.
And there's another ad.

21
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:17,890
The other actor, they with the alopecia
there. Anthony? Yeah, Anthony Carrigan.

22
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,860
Oh my God. No, Hank [inaudible].
Great Name. Incredible actors. So, um,

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,710
I was actually tested,
give people background.

24
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,420
I was going to interview all of you
guys at the now defunct nerd melt.

25
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,630
Yeah. That's gone because of
that incident I believe. Yeah.

26
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:35,590
Because what happened to
me, hey, yes. So you, you,

27
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,650
you were supposed to come down
there with Henry, Steven and uh,

28
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,370
the other guys and uh,
you have a peanut allergy.

29
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,930
So not allergy in the game they
gave me, well, here's the thing,

30
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,200
it's my own. I, I blame
myself so I can have almonds.

31
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,450
I'm okay with almonds or other nuts on
bandwidth. So like, oh, coffee and go, Oh,

32
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:57,030
can I have almond milk in it? And again,
like a racist, but with just like nuts,

33
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,070
just nuts. Those are the,
you stay with your own.

34
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,860
You stay with the almonds. All these
other ones. Get them out of my house.

35
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:10,200
All right, here, you're a peanut
supremacy. I've never heard of that.

36
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:14,820
I thought if you had like a peanut
allergy, I found that out on a movie.

37
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:18,240
I had something, a whoa that has almonds
in it and I had it and I go, I'm fine.

38
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:23,241
And then I went home and I had an Epi pen
and sat there with almonds and ate it.

39
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:27,710
And what is an Epi pen?
That's what you take in case you haven't,

40
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,990
you're doing a stabbing motion in
your way. Do a stabbing motion into,

41
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:34,890
you're like, yeah, I stat
you stab yourself with the
epipen. So it takes what?

42
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,750
Like your blood pressure that like,
no,

43
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:39,570
it just shoots you full of adrenaline
basically. And then you just,

44
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,030
you're able to breathe. It gets a big
shot of so, so when you drank this,

45
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,830
so you were supposed to come in and all
of a sudden somebody basically gave the

46
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:50,250
equivalent to, you have a couple of these
boys and they gave me will almond milk,

47
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:53,340
but it was this fancy coffee
place and they were like, well,

48
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:57,960
we have an almond cashew blend that
comes in. I can't have cashews.

49
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,540
Oh. So I had that and I took
a drink of it backstage,

50
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:06,040
excited about to go on and I went,
I got to go. When you drink that,

51
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,840
how quick do you know this is like
getting bit by a Cobra? Yeah, yeah.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,330
Like you just know that wasn't good.
I need the answer. You don't get,

53
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:17,050
you don't get bit by a Cobra and go, I'm
going to wait. We can do this 20 minutes.

54
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,970
I could do the podcast,
I'm fine.

55
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,260
My legs all black and blue and I can't
really feel my feet anymore. And Yeah,

56
00:03:23,261 --> 00:03:26,680
you bet. I'm fine. It was just one
fan. Yeah, I'm fine. And my dad was,

57
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,470
the biggest bomber is my
dad is a giant fan of yours.

58
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,030
And my dad was really excited too.

59
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,750
And he flew in because we had the premiere
and so he wanted to see it and I go,

60
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,920
I gotta go. And he was like, what? Oh No.
And he's like, fine. He goes, you're fine.

61
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,510
Shake it off. I go, no, no,
no. And he's like, you're
fine, you're fine. I go, what?

62
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,660
I want to see bill brewer. And I'm
like, well, I gotta go, I gotta go.

63
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:49,210
You can stay here, go. And he's
like, oh, I'll go, you know,

64
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:52,310
let's get you some Benadryl
and all that stuff. Okay. So,

65
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,720
so what happens is you with your
throat closes up. Yeah. And so guy,

66
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,070
someone ran out and got me Benadryl and
that, that was fine. And then I got home.

67
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,870
Did. But how bad is like, how much are you
laboring breathing? I'm breathing fine.

68
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:06,100
It's just, I said I, I,

69
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,310
it was in my mouth for only a couple
of seconds and then I spit it out.

70
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,510
But it was enough to make everything
start to kind of look like hives inside

71
00:04:16,511 --> 00:04:19,810
your mouth and your throat. Oh my God.
Oh yeah, that's, yeah, it was awful.

72
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,370
So then when you take the Benadryl,

73
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:24,280
how long does it fills that
out and then you get groggy.

74
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:28,870
And then I did the Epi pen,
which then makes you all jacked up.

75
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:33,470
And then I went and did the
premiere and yeah. Sucked. Oh,

76
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:37,390
so you able to work then that night? Yeah,
I had to, yeah. It was like HBO was like,

77
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,740
we need you yet.

78
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,260
So do you travel when you travel?
Do you have those things with you

79
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,110
have my backpack out right there.
Yeah.

80
00:04:47,111 --> 00:04:50,330
And that's the whole reason I buy one of
those. Yeah, you can go. Yeah. You get a

81
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:53,050
prescription for it.
Yeah.

82
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,680
Cause I didn't do that for
like the writer's room on
efforts to family. You know,

83
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,650
when you just get like burned out,
like I can't think of any more funny.

84
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,120
Should Epi pen just stab yourself.
Yeah, let's just do that. Be Pins. Yeah.

85
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:08,440
Well No, it's like this dumb thing though.
When you do it, everyone thinks it's,

86
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,730
but it's, it's, it's just more,

87
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:12,100
the motion of it looks more
severe than it actually is.

88
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:15,640
It's just like a little pin prick,
but it's like buried into this.

89
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:17,500
You go through your pants.
No,

90
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:21,490
you gotta pull your pants down and go
right on your leg. And then, but uh,

91
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,180
so you stab it and then you push the push
the thing down at the same time. Yeah.

92
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:28,110
You can't tell me you don't feel a little
bit like John Rambo when you do. Yeah,

93
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,970
no, you totally do. Yeah.
You station yourself up.

94
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,170
That's awesome. But I'm such a
wimp that, um, you know, well,

95
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,910
I want you to know you not being there
really threw me off my game because I've,

96
00:05:40,911 --> 00:05:44,410
I've never hosted one of those before.
So it was an honor that I got to do it.

97
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,760
And one of my goals was like,
I was just like,

98
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,790
I am not asking Henry Winkler about
playing Arthur funds early. I am,

99
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,200
I am going to, I'm going to do anything.
I'm gonna talk about night shift.

100
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,070
I left you and

101
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:01,460
nothing, which, and then by
the end, I was just like,

102
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,400
they were helping me through the
interview and then somehow I just said,

103
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,640
I go, you know, I'm running out of stuff,
but my goal is I'm not bringing up,

104
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,990
you know, who, and then he just broke into
the character. Just say like, you know,

105
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:17,390
that character maybe a lot of money
and put my kids through college.

106
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:21,550
I can't do the fonts. And then I was all
excited. Like, oh my God, he did the fun.

107
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,580
When he does it

108
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,160
you, it's like, it's like, uh,

109
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,460
you know Mickey Mouse showing I am John
Malaney said it's like Mickey mouse

110
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,470
showing up or something. It's like
a thing I grew up, I'm like, oh,

111
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:33,380
that's television.
Is that terrible and heal.

112
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,490
He said it to Alec Berg and I
wants an Alec cocreative Barry,

113
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:39,860
he's not a very effusive guy.

114
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,040
And he was standing behind
me and Henry told this story,

115
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:47,160
we're going to be non emotional. Yeah.
He's, he's, he's Swedish, Swedish,

116
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:53,180
Swedish, you know, cause like,
Huh. Yeah, I've done stand up.

117
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,310
I've done stand up through the hole.
Uh,

118
00:06:55,311 --> 00:06:59,900
that whole region up there
was the funniest one. Well
I would just sitting there,

119
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:01,900
they were trying to solve
the problem of the day.

120
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,950
Like I would sit there and I'm doing
the joke and it was just quiet and quiet

121
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,800
and quiet. And then if
somebody is just fine, goes,

122
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,550
why didn't you just blah blah blah.
And I was just like,

123
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,670
is that what you fucking guys are doing?
I go, you don't need to solve these.

124
00:07:16,671 --> 00:07:18,140
This isn't like a self help thing.

125
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:21,360
It's just she'll just kick your
wife out of the house. Yes.

126
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,120
Battery out in the backyard and say
she went to a mothers to do that yet.

127
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,560
So that was Finland. Oh Bye. If

128
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,690
we noticed there was a huge
difference was that the Baltic Sea,

129
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:38,290
like Norway and Sweden as a certain level
of emotionally disconnected and then

130
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:44,741
when you go to the over there where this
spooning with Russia and they actually

131
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:49,130
defeated Russia and had to give up part
of their land because they paired up

132
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:51,540
with Hitler, you know, they had,

133
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,400
they wouldn't between the two
craziest people in the last century.

134
00:07:55,430 --> 00:08:00,050
It's like who we went to, the crazier
one. Which and who lost. Yeah.

135
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,440
Don't ever go there. I don't know if
he, they went to the crazy one. They,

136
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:07,430
they were equals they would
peers. Yeah. They were like,

137
00:08:07,431 --> 00:08:10,750
if there was a way that they both
could have won the war and lived, yeah.

138
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,250
I guess the other guy lived right style
live. I don't know shit about history.

139
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,550
Like they could sit back like, you
know, old NBA players. Yeah, exactly.

140
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,530
Like when wilt and Bill
Russell get together,

141
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,560
they could be talking about murdering
people and their knees are bad.

142
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:25,250
They can't really walk around much.
They're exaggerating their stats,

143
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,700
but no, they, yeah, it was this,
yeah, no, Alec is a, he's hilarious.

144
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:35,360
I mean he wrote on Seinfeld and curb your
enthusiasm. He's, he's a very funny guy,

145
00:08:35,361 --> 00:08:38,780
but he's not, he's very
kind of quiet and, and uh,

146
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,220
Henry did the Fonz, he just
told a story and I said, Oh,

147
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:46,760
I had to tell all these people, you know,
because Henry and life is very kind of,

148
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,610
hello, how are you? Oh,

149
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,940
that's what makes it when you
meet him or you seem just taught.

150
00:08:50,941 --> 00:08:53,960
And that's what makes it even more
incredible. That guy came out of this guy.

151
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,290
Yeah. He's like, I was on the phone in
my car, hands free. And I'm like, okay,

152
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,490
be safe, being safe. And then, you know,
and then it'd be like, Oh, you know,

153
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:06,780
the Fonz would say a part like the Red
Sea, you know, he would do something.

154
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:11,610
And Alec was behind me and he went,
oh my God. You know, it was the most,

155
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:15,440
he just went, I can't,
I can't believe why he,

156
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:18,840
it was the most effusive I've ever
seen. And like he just went, oh,

157
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:22,980
I can't believe that it gave us chills,
you know? Well, because it it like,

158
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,540
like you said, when you talk to the
guy, it's nowhere. It's like Mel Blanc.

159
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,940
When Mel Blanc with different
voices like you, you'd be like this,

160
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:32,700
there's no way this guy does bugs
bunny or does you send to me Sam?

161
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,700
I couldn't hear him and any of it.
And I feel like with him,

162
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:38,460
when he's just talking you,
it's just like,

163
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:41,640
this can't be the guy that played that
guy in. All of a sudden he does the voice.

164
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,430
This is hilarious.

165
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,270
Now I'm going to sit here and
talking about and being the fonts.

166
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,370
This whole flipping the interview.
Sorry,

167
00:09:47,371 --> 00:09:50,790
I left you with nothing though because I
left and then you were stuck with that.

168
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,020
It sounds to me like you blew off the
interview and I'm not buying this whole

169
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:59,160
fucking stabbing yourself.
Then somehow you made it was a premiere.

170
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:00,830
There was no,

171
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,190
there was no fucking nerd melt to
talk about some jackasses podcast.

172
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,660
I get it though. Super bottles
that an HBO Premiere for Barry.

173
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,350
No, it was all like gastric does
checks. They weren't done over,

174
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,680
they were working there. No, no,
but I, they, they had me. Um,

175
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:17,940
no,
I,

176
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,140
that was a thing where it was one of the
things that you leave and then HBO is

177
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:25,340
going, Oh my God. Oh my God.
Well, you know, the thing
is, it's his show. You gotta,

178
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:29,090
you know gotta be, well, what do we
got? Can we send a doctor over there?

179
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:30,710
Can we do anything?
What can we do?

180
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:34,310
And they going old school centered
hookers in April. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

181
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,960
It's like,
this is Dr feelgood and yeah,

182
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:41,130
it's my badge briefcase. All right.
You're going to be up in notes

183
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:45,150
done buddy. Well, everybody I know that
has been watching it. It's just been like,

184
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,690
you know what I love about it and what
I wanted to talk to you about is I love

185
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,990
when somebody that's known for doing
comedy gets to do some drama stuff because

186
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:56,520
for some reason they think that a,

187
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,460
I don't know who the comedian was
that screwed it up for the rest of us.

188
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,620
I want to know who that person was and
also who the person was that fucked up so

189
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:08,130
bad that we all actors now have to get
there like nine hours before you're gonna

190
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:08,270
get

191
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:12,350
called. You just sit there with a
fake mustache glued on your face.

192
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,420
It's just like,
who fucked up?

193
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,960
Who fucked up fatty Arbuckle?

194
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:22,280
Who was the fire fatty Arbuckle
just was always 20 minutes.

195
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,210
You had 30 hours late, 30 hours late.
So now they got to bring you in.

196
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,800
Got to get the Arbuckle rule. I want
all these assholes here now at my worst,

197
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
my worst, whenever I got you, I got

198
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,290
called. I was went to a
set at four o'clock in the
afternoon and I didn't work.

199
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:36,990
Didn't utter a word until
one in the morning. Oh,

200
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:41,340
I've done that where I got called on a,
I remember a tropic thunder.

201
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:45,660
There was this huge a party scene and
it was just one of those things where I

202
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:49,380
just learned that it's all communication
where Ben Stiller's directing and Ben

203
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,490
and Ben, I think he kept saying,
rob, my character's name is rob,

204
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,260
but there's also an actor named rob.
And he was like, rob should be in there.

205
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:03,150
Right. You know, and the first
aid went, oh, Bill's not,

206
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:07,680
Bill's not working the day. So they
would wake me up, oh, call me flooded.

207
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,760
The Columbian,
I would go in at two in the morning,

208
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:14,890
is that one wherever shooting
like Hawaii or something, go in,

209
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,001
put me in makeup.

210
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:19,450
And I would just sit in my trailer and
then finally I get hired, you know,

211
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,940
kind of like, what am I doing? You
know, and I'm not in the scene.

212
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,310
And I would go to set and Ben would
go, well, the fuck are you doing here?

213
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,560
And then two days later, hey, we need you
to come in, what's going on? And like,

214
00:12:30,561 --> 00:12:34,260
well, what are you doing here? And
he goes, no, Rob, rob the actor, rob,

215
00:12:34,261 --> 00:12:38,970
not the fucking, you know,
and I showed up twice.

216
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,380
Oh, it was terrible. Waiting in those
trailers actually understood my dog more.

217
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,680
Yeah. I was just thinking, why is
this thing fucking sleep all the time?

218
00:12:46,681 --> 00:12:49,290
And it's basically,
if you have nothing to do,

219
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,210
it goes back to sir survival where it's
like we're gonna shut down your body and

220
00:12:54,211 --> 00:12:56,970
just store up this energy.
So like the level of tired you get.

221
00:12:56,971 --> 00:13:00,330
But how does my dog, no, every
episode of the Tyra banks show,

222
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:02,490
cause that's seems to be
the only thing on television

223
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:08,000
or do you go to the trailers?
I've never had the TV work. Oh,

224
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,440
they got a flat screen TV inhibit.
It never works.

225
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:15,120
It's just some like whatever signal you
just hear the other actor next to you

226
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:17,850
clearing this road every
couple of hours. Yeah. Yeah.

227
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:21,810
On the phone with their agent.
I'm not going to do that.

228
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,540
They want me to do this. I'm
not going to do it. Well, let's,

229
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,580
let's promote it a little bit here because
uh, uh, as far as like, it's on Hbo.

230
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:32,850
Okay. The final episode is this
Sunday? Yeah, there's eight of them.

231
00:13:32,851 --> 00:13:35,250
And if people want to go
back and watch all of them,

232
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:40,251
I imagine in 2018 HBO has
a way to create an HBO go.

233
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,720
You have that, you can go check it
out. And I think, uh, Amazon, Hulu,

234
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:50,430
those places, well I'm old school
in that. I like to watch an episode.

235
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,780
I liked the old way where you watched it
and then you had to wait a week for it

236
00:13:54,781 --> 00:13:59,130
to come out. And then, and then another
one went and, and like, like, um,

237
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,980
I don't know all the shows that I watch,

238
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,330
you try to guess what was going to happen.

239
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:06,970
And now like there's all these
great shows that just dump it on.

240
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:08,370
People just sit down and it's like,

241
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,050
it's like the greatest bottle of
wine every night. Shotgun it. Wow.

242
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,490
It was amazing. And then like what
else can I have now? And it just,

243
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,510
and I also have, I feel for like the
amount of work that was put into this,

244
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,780
cause that's what happens with the fucking
cartoon I'm doing. Which just this,

245
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,440
I actually did a cartoon after because
of those getting called at four in the

246
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:31,010
afternoon. Not Work until one. I'm
like, dude, fuck this live action shit.

247
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,450
I'm going to do a car too.
Well,

248
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:35,690
I just show up in a baseball
hat and sweatpants and I
didn't realize that it was

249
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:40,400
like 90 times slower and then the thing
comes out and people will watch it all

250
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:43,160
in one night. That's great. When's the
next season coming out? He's just like,

251
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:47,300
he can't, well, might as well
just be a movie. You know
what I mean? It's like, Oh,

252
00:14:47,301 --> 00:14:49,400
put it in the theater. I
Dunno, but I, I like it.

253
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:53,480
But you do this and for eight
weeks people are talking about,

254
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,070
there's like a level of the
high intensity level of go, go,

255
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,190
go. I have no idea where this is
going to go. Yeah. And that's,

256
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,980
it's fun having people come up to me,
you know,

257
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:08,930
at my kid's school or whatever going,
hey, so this is what's going to happen,

258
00:15:08,931 --> 00:15:12,260
right? Yeah. So I'm still going to kill
you. Yeah. One guy came up and he's like,

259
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,920
Stephen Root. He's a figment of his
imagination. Right. It's not real.

260
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:20,970
Yeah. You might be Ryan, you know, I
got you figured out, asshole. I'm like,

261
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,100
all right. Yeah. I used to watch lost. I
know where you're going with this. Yeah.

262
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:28,820
The, it's all figments of a,
some else's imagination, right?

263
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,320
It's all a figment to get eight seasons
or whatever the hell it is. But then,

264
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,500
you know,
something I actually,

265
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,890
something I want to bring up before
I forget is that, you know, uh,

266
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,630
that you're from Tulsa,
Oklahoma,

267
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:45,980
and I was telling you earlier that that
is one of my favorite cities to perform

268
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:48,020
standup.
And they got the Brady theater there,

269
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:53,090
which evidently some ridiculous race
riot happened. Really? I guess so.

270
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:55,760
I mean, I walked in, there was a white
guy, I'm like, Oh, this has a nice vibe.

271
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,220
This feels like really great.
And this, why is this so
comfortable? Yeah. And it's,

272
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:04,630
um, it's, and then they've got
all this great cause all these,

273
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,870
all these people who'd never been there.
When I told him I'm in Tulsa, Oklahoma,

274
00:16:08,871 --> 00:16:10,730
and everyone's like, oh
Jesus Christ, you know,

275
00:16:10,731 --> 00:16:14,090
what are you gonna fucking go ride a
bull out there? Like go cow tipping.

276
00:16:14,091 --> 00:16:16,430
And they don't understand
like how like the,

277
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:21,460
the food there is incredible massive
amounts of hipsters at see exact opposite

278
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:25,390
thing that you would a picture.
But that old theater there and I said,

279
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,460
George Carlin, they're ones, I remember
there was a first comedy show ever.

280
00:16:28,461 --> 00:16:32,990
So what year did you see him?
I don't remember. I was young.

281
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,410
I remember my dad. It was a thing where
I got to get snuck into the thing,

282
00:16:36,411 --> 00:16:41,240
but my dad, God, I don't remember how to
be in the 80s. I saw him in the 80s too.

283
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:41,840
Yeah.

284
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,400
And I started seeing him and just my
face hurting from laughing and just it,

285
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,470
and not knowing that he did like
two hours or I don't know why I was,

286
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:55,760
it was just super long. But
to me I was like, oh, keep
going, keep going, you know,

287
00:16:55,761 --> 00:17:00,200
and uh, and just leaving on this high
and just going, wow, that was good.

288
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,290
That have an effect that
you like at that point,

289
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,530
did you already know you wanted to
get into comedy or, no, I mean I,

290
00:17:06,531 --> 00:17:11,160
to me that just seemed like a,
I mean I was someone, I didn't,

291
00:17:11,161 --> 00:17:12,490
I and I still have,

292
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,690
you have very anxious and having to
get up in front of people. And so I,

293
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:20,330
I the idea of going up there alone and
telling jokes and how quick he was,

294
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:25,331
but I loved watching stand up my dad's
giant fan of Stan to stand up and so,

295
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,620
and in the 80s and that, you
know, every TV, you know,

296
00:17:28,621 --> 00:17:32,310
you had the a and e the
evening at the Improv, MTV,

297
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,230
half hour comedy hour, those a
hundred watches. I saw those. I mean,

298
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:38,570
I would run into like
Jeff Garlin and be like,

299
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,850
do you remember he used to do that,
I think Adam West,

300
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,680
Adam West and going to be what Bagel
and he gets hit with a, you, you,

301
00:17:43,681 --> 00:17:47,600
you have our comedy on TV. Yeah.
And he went, what? How did you know?

302
00:17:47,601 --> 00:17:51,360
And then when I met Judd Apatow for the
first time, I go used to do a bit about,

303
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:55,530
uh, uh, you know, your nose, uh, you know,

304
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:59,130
being stuffed up and how it
switches, you know, w w you know,

305
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:02,760
you get congested in one nostril
and goes in a stolen. Yeah,

306
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:06,660
though I remember that. Yeah. But, uh,

307
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,870
yeah, I can freak people out. I remember,
I forget the name of the comedian,

308
00:18:09,871 --> 00:18:13,410
but he had this great bit he was
talking about, I ran into the guy,

309
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,550
I don't even remember his name,

310
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,850
but I was one of my favorite bits that
I saw from one of those evening at the

311
00:18:17,851 --> 00:18:18,331
Improv.

312
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:22,560
And he was talking about how he was the
youngest kid in this big family and how

313
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:27,540
strict the parents were with the older
kids. And by the time it got down to him,

314
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,570
it was, uh, you know, uh, it
was basically the only rule was

315
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,940
no heroin in the living room. And then
one of my favorite tags of all time,

316
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:37,790
it was just like, Brian, you're
not using one of the good spoons.

317
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,620
And that was just like,
you know,

318
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:42,950
for a clean joke and all I really love
and I got to actually run into him and

319
00:18:42,951 --> 00:18:43,251
tell him.

320
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:46,070
And I remember just talking to that
guy and him just looking at me like,

321
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:51,290
how the fuck does this kid, oh my God,
Bob Nelson, that guy, there's a guy,

322
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,210
Bob Nelson, I'm a dual
crazy. And then the,

323
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,830
I saw him open for Rodney Dangerfield
right after back this back to school.

324
00:18:57,831 --> 00:19:02,540
Came out dude, that summer and
great woods. Yeah, in Mansfield,

325
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,730
Massachusetts.
I saw Rodney Dangerfield.

326
00:19:04,731 --> 00:19:09,260
And then a few weeks later I saw Eddie
Murphy on the raw Toro and the weather

327
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:12,110
girls weathered girls opened up.
They sing,

328
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:13,940
it's raining men and they were big girls.

329
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:16,730
And I remember he came out and was doing
all these jokes about I got to check

330
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:19,790
out the stage cause the weather girls
can fuck up the stage back when you could

331
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,920
fat shame people.
And um,

332
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,250
he had like the purple suit
on and all of that stuff.

333
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,350
He always close with his daddy, didn't
tinker toys and the, the, the, the,

334
00:19:30,351 --> 00:19:34,530
the toy thing. Remember that the, I don't
remember what he closed. I mean, Eddie,

335
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,620
Eddie, we would eat our tinker toys. Any
of that whole thing that he would do is,

336
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,220
because that was a thing seen raw, which
now you watch raw and you're like, Geez,

337
00:19:43,221 --> 00:19:47,570
there's some stuff you can do now.
And then. So, yeah. But that, uh,

338
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,980
that the end bear to him, I know, I
know, but it's just lazy as 30 years ago.

339
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:56,480
But you go like, uh, yeah, at SNL
you would watch something, oh,

340
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:58,760
you guys gotta watch raw and
then they would come back and go,

341
00:19:58,761 --> 00:20:02,890
why did you find that funny?
It was so offensive and
everything and go, wow, yeah.

342
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,500
Oh Man. You know, uh, what about
the thing at the end? You know,

343
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:09,980
I would just try to concentrate on the
thing I found. Oh No. When I watched that,

344
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:15,160
it makes me sad that he stopped
because he was 25 years old.

345
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:19,600
And, uh, when he was
talking about, uh, you know,

346
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,530
the level of success he got to and
thinking about getting married and seen

347
00:20:22,531 --> 00:20:25,750
Johnny Carson getting divorced and all
of that stuff and saying, well, you know,

348
00:20:25,751 --> 00:20:29,230
women get half, that's bullshit.
No, somebody, when we get
half and the woman goes,

349
00:20:29,231 --> 00:20:31,300
that's right. He goes, Nah,
that's bullshit. And was like,

350
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:36,010
he was going to that next level where
it's like, oh no, this guy is gonna,

351
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,650
you know, start saying what he thinks
about all this stuff. Cause you know,

352
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,730
the delirious was amazing.
Yeah. But it was uh, you know,

353
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,530
Ralph Kramden having sex with,
you know,

354
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,980
yeah, yeah. That's so goo and all
stuff. And then all of a sudden

355
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,930
he was like, you seen this
guy finding his voice and uh,

356
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:55,660
and then, I mean, who knew that I would
go see him and that that was actually

357
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,010
you like the farewell tour?
Yeah,

358
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,150
well I think when he did the thing
at the end of raw was a thing I saw,

359
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:05,110
you know, as he, when I
was young and it went, wow,

360
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:10,030
he's just by himself and he might as
well buy and be by himself in his room.

361
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,920
You know what I mean?
It was like he went into this other place,

362
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:19,180
you know, it wasn't like
jokes, you know what I mean?

363
00:21:19,181 --> 00:21:23,920
It was like [inaudible] he's just talking
and he just went to this place and

364
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,800
it's the thing I, I'm never as funny. I,

365
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,060
the funniest I'll ever be is in the lunch
room with my friends and they were all

366
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:32,710
funnier than me,
you know what I mean?

367
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,710
Everybody was high school with his
funny than I was way funnier than me.

368
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:39,880
And I still see those guys and they'll
just like, they'll send me a text about,

369
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,950
one of my friends hated three billboards.

370
00:21:41,951 --> 00:21:46,360
That movie in his text made me laugh
harder than anything that I've read.

371
00:21:46,361 --> 00:21:49,530
Any comedian. I know. All I do is hang
around with comedy people and I'll,

372
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:54,430
and I'm like, what? You know, he
works at a window store in Oklahoma,

373
00:21:54,431 --> 00:21:55,840
some plebes so funny.

374
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:59,500
Well, just how they live their
life. I got a buddy of mine, uh,

375
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:03,270
Joe de Rosa was open and for me and
you know, it was after the show,

376
00:22:03,271 --> 00:22:06,220
he didn't Boston, I got all my boss at
Fred's, you know, hanging out or whatever.

377
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,120
And uh,

378
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,800
one of my buddies offered to buy around
the drinks are all ordering drinks and

379
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:16,830
my buddy Joe ordered a white Russian
and my friend was just done with them

380
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,570
and he came up and he goes, dude, what's
up with your boy? I go, what's the matter?

381
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:25,270
He goes, he just sorted a white Russian
and I didn't really think about it.

382
00:22:25,271 --> 00:22:27,520
I was like, I only drink white
Russians. He likes, you know, whatever.

383
00:22:27,521 --> 00:22:30,750
That movie with the Dude, he likes
big old ass guy. He's a big Lebowski.

384
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,750
I didn't think anything about it.

385
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,900
And then the end of the night I'm walking
back with Joe and he's just like, hey,

386
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:37,210
you know, like hanging out
with friends. He goes, yeah,
that's cool. He's like, dude,

387
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:37,961
what are you friends?
Was,

388
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:39,820
he was like really friendly
and he was like talking to me.

389
00:22:39,821 --> 00:22:44,070
Then all of a sudden out of nowhere,
he just stopped talking to me like it was,

390
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:49,140
it was all based on the fact that he
ordered a white Russian and we were well

391
00:22:49,211 --> 00:22:54,211
into our thirties late thirties
and this guy still to this day,

392
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:57,000
I remember a long time, I
don't trust that guy. I don't,

393
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,410
I don't know anybody like that.
I remember a long time ago,

394
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,010
he for some reason was giving the
responsibility to watch the house of this

395
00:23:03,011 --> 00:23:05,860
married couple and of course,
so he immediately has this all over there

396
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,960
and we're getting hammered and um,
and he's taking care of the house.

397
00:23:10,961 --> 00:23:14,770
He went down into the basement and there
was some sort of a faucet nozzle is

398
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:16,360
something you had to turn on or off.

399
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:19,450
And The lady left the
post it note on it saying,

400
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:23,290
you might have to turn it a little hard
on. My husband said it's a little fussy.

401
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:26,320
And my buddy just went out
and just immediately turned
it with no problem at all.

402
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,710
And he just, it gets
mudders, this guy's a post,

403
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,030
we're in his house and he probably, he
just said that to his wife, just being,

404
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:39,310
you know,
gentlemanly to a woman.

405
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:44,311
And then this my friend just
totally judge this guy that he was,

406
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:46,070
he was not a man like his man.

407
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,980
Like that's what I love
about my friends back there.

408
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,770
How easily you could lose your
man card and you have no idea.

409
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:54,470
And they won't even tell you why
they just stopped talking to you. Oh,

410
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:56,150
it's the worst.
When my friends,

411
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,510
they visited the set
of Barry and you know,

412
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:03,580
I'm doing all these things or whatever
and I have been assistant. Uh Huh. Oh,

413
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:08,750
okay. It's over. She
walked over, here's your,

414
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,470
here's your coffee. Well man, you
can't get your own coffees now. What?

415
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,050
What do you see machines? The
machines right there, dude,

416
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,720
just go over and get your own goddamn
coffee bill. And I'm like, well,

417
00:24:17,721 --> 00:24:21,380
I'm focusing on, I don't give a shit.
You Go, why are you making her get your,

418
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:23,090
and I'm like, no, not,
you're right, you're right.

419
00:24:23,091 --> 00:24:26,090
I shouldn't be machines right there. I
don't know. You're not in, you're right.

420
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,240
You know what I mean? I just feel
like an asshole. And then I'm like,

421
00:24:29,241 --> 00:24:33,980
why did I invite you here to, you
know, uh, make me feel bad and then,

422
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:36,770
hey man, did you try the dessert? I,

423
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:41,090
and I'm trying not to eat anything bad
because you know the guys in the military

424
00:24:41,091 --> 00:24:45,830
and you're like, oh fuck you
man. Now you're dining now.

425
00:24:45,831 --> 00:24:49,910
And I'm like, why? I yeah.
They just keep you real.

426
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,910
[inaudible] I ended up, I just go back
harder at them. I can't say, you know?

427
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,630
Yeah. We're really trying
to work on my man tits.

428
00:24:56,631 --> 00:25:00,380
Like you have miss the only way to keep
them off. You do that. Another friend,

429
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:05,240
the exact same party he was telling me,
he was telling this story.

430
00:25:05,241 --> 00:25:06,170
He's going,
where are you staying?

431
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,630
I told him the hotel I was staying at p
and he was a construction guy. Goes, oh,

432
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:11,450
I worked on that. He goes,
crazy story. We will,

433
00:25:11,451 --> 00:25:16,370
we will put in a flagpole or something
up and he goes, stuff the fucking cable,

434
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:18,500
Bro. This guy was underneath
directing the cable broken,

435
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:22,730
just came slamming down on this guy.
Oh Geez. I go, Jesus Christ. I go,

436
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:26,270
did he die? And he goes, did he
die? He was in fucking pieces.

437
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,610
And I go, well, what happened?
He goes, oh, guys were puking.

438
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,600
Some people jumped in that truck and drove
away and they got, his dad was there,

439
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:39,170
he had a heart attack. So we're all
just sitting there like dead silence.

440
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:43,530
And then he just out of know where
he goes, Eh, kid was kind of a dose.

441
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,910
And then he goes, he goes,
his dad was a good shit.

442
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,960
And that actually broke the tension in.
Everybody started laughing.

443
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:52,910
And I just remember thinking like,

444
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:56,300
you couldn't teach somebody
no in an acting class,

445
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:00,260
how to take to somebody to such
a dark place. And he sensed it.

446
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,280
He sensed that a laugh needed. The
comedy knew exactly where to go. Yeah.

447
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,050
Intuition as my friend.
Uh, I used to be a PA.

448
00:26:09,051 --> 00:26:12,350
I was a production assistant for a long
time. And then I worked on this movie,

449
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:14,690
James Dean in an invented life there.

450
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:18,940
James Franco played James Dean
and this Guy Jason Lt Airy,

451
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,280
who's now a big first d now,
but he was a PA.

452
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:26,360
And again, what we're
talking about, he had a,

453
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,290
he had a real like Rambo knife,

454
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,620
like he got it from the props truck and
he's just taking chunks out of this tree

455
00:26:33,621 --> 00:26:34,010
with it.

456
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,310
And he's just hitting this tree with
this giant knife and we're all kind of

457
00:26:37,311 --> 00:26:39,680
sitting there whining. He's just
bullshitting with us. Was like,

458
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,110
look at this fucking thing. Wow.
Look at them like, look, it's really,

459
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,050
it's like an ax, you know, standing out.

460
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,910
And this other guy,
Bill Hardy,

461
00:26:47,911 --> 00:26:51,390
this big guy walking over and you
use another PA smoking's here.

462
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,210
You guys are good. And Jason, he's weird.

463
00:26:55,211 --> 00:26:59,070
This [inaudible] he pretends like he's
going to stab him. He just goes, hey, hey,

464
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,640
hey, don't fuck it. That's not
funny. Don't do that. Don't
do that. That's not cool.

465
00:27:02,641 --> 00:27:05,790
Don't do that. [inaudible].
So bill walks away,

466
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,650
the props guy comes over and goes,

467
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:12,390
I have that same knife but the exact
same night, but it's retractable,

468
00:27:12,391 --> 00:27:15,080
it's plastic, it's fake, you
know, and he goes, get it.

469
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,160
He takes it and he is the best
piece of acting I've ever seen.

470
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:24,990
Just totally calm pretending to like,
you know, cut up the tree, do everything,

471
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:28,740
just waiting for bill to come back.
Bill walks back, hey, how's it going?

472
00:27:28,741 --> 00:27:31,930
Hey how you doing?
And he does the does the thing and,

473
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,290
and it just rears back
and stabs him in the

474
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,150
Oh God.
And Bill Goes,

475
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,740
oh no,
he is screening his reaction with water.

476
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,800
Like you just murdered

477
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:55,240
my just, he legitimately was
like, my friend just murdered

478
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:01,650
down laughing and we felt bad. And I've
told that story to other people and go,

479
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,830
that's horrible. That's not nice at all.
And I go, I know, but if you were there,

480
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:08,020
it was the funniest thing
I think I'd ever seen.

481
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:10,530
And because you're literally got
to see what was your friend do,

482
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:14,890
what would he do if he died? He would say,
why if he got murdered. But then Jason,

483
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:18,190
to your point, the reason I thought of
it was that he was such a good actor.

484
00:28:18,191 --> 00:28:18,851
He was just like,

485
00:28:18,851 --> 00:28:22,270
you couldn't have taught like anybody
else I think you would get and they would

486
00:28:22,271 --> 00:28:24,430
want to run over to him and go,
hey, look in the night. And then,

487
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,440
you know what I mean?
When I would,

488
00:28:25,441 --> 00:28:29,110
I would take the knife and walked up to
him and done it, but he had the patient,

489
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:32,980
the patients to keep like, no,
no, I have to keep this, this,

490
00:28:32,981 --> 00:28:37,060
this lie up where he was pretending to
do that and we sat there waiting for him

491
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:39,880
for like 15 minutes and then he
kind of would meander back like, no,

492
00:28:39,881 --> 00:28:41,760
we can't call him over.
We can't do this.

493
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,630
I want to be able to keep a
straight face. I'm the worst. Hey,

494
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:48,760
when you watch somebody do
something like that as an actor,

495
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:52,750
do you get something out of that?
Watching that guy like that? Yeah. Yeah.

496
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:53,920
You kind of go,
Oh wow,

497
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:58,921
that patients are so much of it too is
just kind of impersonating people are,

498
00:28:59,831 --> 00:29:01,240
you know,
or doing nothing.

499
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,940
That was the thing he did that was
good was he didn't do anything.

500
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,561
Do you know what I mean?

501
00:29:05,561 --> 00:29:08,440
He just was doing what he did before
and he kind of instinctively knew like,

502
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:10,540
well, that's how, that's
the best way to do this.

503
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:13,120
That's the best way to set the trap
is to make it look like nothing.

504
00:29:13,121 --> 00:29:17,620
Nothing happened. Instead of, I would
have gone over there, I've been,

505
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:21,880
hey bill, come back or whatever. Are
those some of your favorite actors?

506
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,180
Are you a character actor guy as far
as like the guys that you watch because

507
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:30,010
you're acting on the series is, is
phenomenal. I kept, I kept calling, uh,

508
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:33,790
uh, my wife and go look at this is
like the best. It's, I'm telling you,

509
00:29:33,791 --> 00:29:36,700
it's like the best work I've seen and
I love all this stuff that you've done,

510
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,440
but like this to actually,

511
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,790
I love it when they give a
funny guy a to show that, hey,

512
00:29:42,791 --> 00:29:45,280
I can do these other things
too. Oh, thanks. Yeah.

513
00:29:45,281 --> 00:29:49,990
So I was just curious now that I see
that you have that in the toolbox,

514
00:29:49,991 --> 00:29:54,910
like who are some of your favorite actors?
Um, well, I mean it's not, I mean the,

515
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,850
I had a tape that, this is
kind of everybody, but, uh,

516
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:02,110
I had a VHS tape that had taxi driver
and raging bull on it and I would just

517
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:06,460
watch those a bunch and just watch Robert
De Niro on those movies. He does does,

518
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,760
it's kind of what we were talking about.
He doesn't do much, but he did enough,

519
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,410
you know, like he just, the way
my, it was behavior, but to,

520
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:18,280
to be honest, like I
like, uh, you know, uh,

521
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,210
um,
I like a lot of actors,

522
00:30:22,211 --> 00:30:26,800
but I was always more excited by the
story. I, we watch a movie for a story,

523
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:32,080
but to me it's just more, it's more about
observing behavior of people. You know,

524
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:36,280
you watch like a documentary or I would
watch a guy like Jason Lt Arie do that

525
00:30:36,281 --> 00:30:38,080
thing or whatever,

526
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:42,580
but it was the actors who could modulate
behavior instead of pushing and making

527
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:46,480
it like a performance. Right.
There's a movie called CAS.

528
00:30:46,481 --> 00:30:50,390
It's this British movie from the late
sixties and then this is non-actor,

529
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:55,330
this kid in it who's phenomenal and
it just is because it's all just very

530
00:30:55,331 --> 00:30:57,310
genuine. Right. You know what I mean?

531
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,670
Oh, okay. It's time for a little bit
of advertising. Oh, look who's back it.

532
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:07,440
Sold Zip red fruit up.

533
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:13,050
Talk about the challenges of finding great
talent and how the way you went about

534
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:16,410
it just did not work. Oh,
was inefficient. You know,

535
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:20,550
I tried to dig down deep into myself to
try to be a good comedian and it turned

536
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:24,240
out all I had was a bunch of Shit and
Dick Jokes down there and it was really

537
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:27,900
tough. And then I use ZipRecruiter
and all of a sudden, you know,

538
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:31,680
I started talking about Pussy Toe am I,
my comedy went to,

539
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,420
I don't fucking hire people, but I know
this app, this, this, is this an APP,

540
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,130
this product, this service. Let's
go with that. I know it works.

541
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,010
Ziprecruiter knew there was a smarter way,

542
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,850
so they built a platform that finds
the right job candidates for you.

543
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:53,130
These invitations have revolutionized
how you find your next hire.

544
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:53,641
In fact,

545
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:58,440

actors w when they'll,

637
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:23,300
while I'm playing a new guy so the guy
can't walk like me and they'll come up

638
00:37:23,301 --> 00:37:27,030
with like a walk. Yeah, I don't know
those drones that are bring him up again.

639
00:37:27,031 --> 00:37:27,520
And he told me,

640
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,230
he was talking about John Travolta one
time you saw him and John Travolta was

641
00:37:30,231 --> 00:37:33,450
like, well, Vinny Barbarino
walked like this, Vincent
Vega walk like this, and boom.

642
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,940
It's just like, dude, he does the walks.

643
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,520
And I was thinking of the
little acting that I've done.

644
00:37:37,521 --> 00:37:42,320
It's like every character I've done walks
like me, they would have to rewrite it.

645
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:45,280
He's, he's a serial killer
from Boston and he's a, yeah,

646
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:50,030
he's a Hawaiian guy from Boston.
Yeah. [inaudible] from Boston.

647
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,440
I didn't want him, they couldn't
justify why I wasn't from the Midwest.

648
00:37:54,441 --> 00:37:58,760
So they said you went to college in
Boston and he picked up the accent,

649
00:37:58,761 --> 00:37:59,011
but still,

650
00:37:59,011 --> 00:38:02,120
for some reason he came back here and you
didn't go back to the accident that he

651
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:06,920
used to. He was raised by some assholes
from Boston, but in the middle,

652
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:11,240
which is a lot of reality TV, there's
always the loud Boston guy. So, um,

653
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:15,090
he likes watching interviews with
the Mark Wahlberg and uh, yeah,

654
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:19,820
but he doesn't have, he doesn't
have an accent. And Mark Wong. No,

655
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,470
I'm always amazed at how you
forget that he's, he can,

656
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:28,150
you can knock that out somehow. And I've
watched some, like I started out with uh,

657
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,060
Patrice O'Neal and Dane Cook and I saw
like an old Dane Cook stand up thing in

658
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:36,130
the last couple of years I saw it and in
like the mid nineties he had really big

659
00:38:36,131 --> 00:38:39,760
time Boston extra. Now he doesn't.
Oh Wow. Like I don't know how,

660
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:42,490
I think you're really one of those
people like you just sort of like,

661
00:38:42,491 --> 00:38:43,990
if he gets somewhere new you just sort of,

662
00:38:43,991 --> 00:38:48,390
it just floats away or it's just stuck
in you. I think I'm, I'm sort of a,

663
00:38:48,391 --> 00:38:51,220
I mean I don't have like a, you
work on it. Oh yeah. People work.

664
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:55,720
That's what Erin rid it. People do work
on it to get rid of it. And it's weird.

665
00:38:55,721 --> 00:39:00,490
We have bill Hader here from air
inc I am going to pronunciate. Hi,

666
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:05,270
I'm from Boston, Massachusetts
now. I think that, yeah,
it that weird, vague way,

667
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,250
but I don't know. Yeah. It's like, I saw
this cooking show recently and this guy,

668
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,760
he was doing something, you know this
fucking guys travel and he goes, Boston,

669
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,540
you come here for a beer and a beating.
And I just moved.

670
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,120
I was looking at my life. I go,
Oh, you go to look at the foliage.

671
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,390
It's just like,

672
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,530
how many times did you watch good will
hunting before you went there to steam

673
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:30,820
your asparagus that you felt you had
to go that hard? You know, it's like,

674
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,560
there's also MIT, there's Harvard hate,

675
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,680
tasty, putting our hasty pudding.
There's a lot of like, you know,

676
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,750
you could go get some oysters.
Oysters be here in a beating,

677
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,880
because I live there for 27 years.
I never took a PT.

678
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,360
I walked away from fights and I was fine
with it. Yeah, you're tougher than me.

679
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,940
Your Dad was angrier than my dad.
You when I'm out of here.

680
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:58,290
Steamier his spirit. Yeah, with you.
Little poached egg on top of it.

681
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,100
I fucking hate the food network now.

682
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:03,580
They used to just have people they're
cooking and then teach you how to cook.

683
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:08,450
And then it became, you had to
have a personality and you know, I,

684
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:12,790
and I respect his cooking,
but I blamed that fucking Emeril Lagasse.

685
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,370
He's the guy I'm going to
fucking put some damn right.

686
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,960
And he had a studio audience in a band.
I used to be the assist

687
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,160
as an editor on a lot of those shows on
like iron chef America. I was, uh, uh,

688
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,620
I don't get that fucking show
is supposed to be real relaxing,

689
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:33,270
loving thing that you do and they take,
it's like death. You got to make waffles.

690
00:40:33,271 --> 00:40:37,050
We got stones and,
and carpet.

691
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,460
How the fuck am I going to do
this? The fuck am I going, Mario,

692
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:43,050
let's see what you got.
And they're like, oh,

693
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,980
we used to have a thing of a Bobby flay,
a leg electric

694
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:50,240
Putin himself. He accidentally
electrocuted himself. It
was really fun. We did.

695
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,690
Yeah,
they cut it from the thing,

696
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:55,500
but he grabbed the ladle and something
happened and he just went and just

697
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:00,240
dropped out of frame. Oh Shit. Yeah, yeah,
yeah. We had to just have a thing of him.

698
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,440
It is his heart stopped.
I don't know.

699
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:06,180
But he dropped and then kind of
came up in a daze and we were uh,

700
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,260
he always seemed like he had into gestion
to me cause he would always be like,

701
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,740
okay, today we're going to
make, it's just like dude,

702
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,170
go off camera and Burp. Cause I, I
liked him. I like all of those guys.

703
00:41:19,171 --> 00:41:21,030
They all taught me what little I know.
But like I,

704
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:24,090
I w I used to watch molto
Mario [inaudible] all the time,

705
00:41:24,091 --> 00:41:25,200
which to me was a perfect one.

706
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:28,390
It's like you went over his
house and he cooked for you. Yes.

707
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,330
Like being his friend.
Yeah.

708
00:41:30,331 --> 00:41:33,950
And then all of a sudden it just became
like that fucking guy yelling on iron

709
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:37,100
chef. Yeah. Or the diners
drive ins and dives guy,

710
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,120
which is hilarious because like he just
looks so burnt out on that show. Yeah.

711
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:44,900
What's his name? A guy. A guy fear.
He just says what you're doing.

712
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:48,180
Like you could make like a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich. So you are,

713
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,830
you're putting some peanut
butter on the bread and, okay.

714
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,400
And you get some jam in there.
That's gonna uh,

715
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:56,120
take a little edge off the peanut
butter and he makes so much money.

716
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,580
So much money. Oh my God.
It's to get the hard top.

717
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,060
Cause he's going to die a skincare,
but I looks like a fucking lobster.

718
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,500
This is coming from a redhead. I'm telling
you. He's got to get some sunblock. Um,

719
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,400
so what can we talk about about the
everybody, because this is a podcast.

720
00:42:13,401 --> 00:42:15,110
It's not like people are dipping in here.
Yeah.

721
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,990
People know that the show
is on so they can, uh,

722
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:20,980
HBO is their Hbo streaming.net Org.
Yeah.

723
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:26,200
When you go to like, uh, well no, I
mean Amazon or Hulu or uh, uh, uh,

724
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,250
HBO go is the thing that's
gonna go. Yeah, it's great.

725
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,090
What would be best for you? Where should
they watch it? I, wherever they want.

726
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,750
I don't. Okay. I wasn't sure.
Louie had his show on Fx.
It would be like, you know,

727
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,820
can you please watch it?

728
00:42:39,821 --> 00:42:44,170
So I get credit for people like watching
the advertising because everybody would

729
00:42:44,171 --> 00:42:48,160
then it would record it and then fast
forward. I don't know. I know, yeah, they,

730
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:52,030
I mean to me it's just, yeah, just
watched. He'll be watch this show.

731
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:55,690
Hbo Has Been Amazing to work with the
fact that we could go in and pitch this

732
00:42:55,691 --> 00:42:59,260
show to them and we're pitching a
half hour comedy and the two movies I

733
00:42:59,261 --> 00:43:04,050
mentioned, or taxi driver and
unforgiven, you know, how did they,

734
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:07,120
how did they react to it? Like you coming
in and think, okay, it's bill Hader.

735
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:09,520
This is going to be funny. And
they thought it was going, yeah,

736
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:10,840
he come in with this and they go.

737
00:43:10,841 --> 00:43:14,830
And to their credit they
were really excited about it.

738
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:16,930
It actually made them more excited.

739
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:21,460
See how many places you did you pitch
this show or there's just HBO because I

740
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:25,930
had to deal with them. And so I had this
kind of development deal with them and,

741
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:29,500
and I was shooting train wreck actually
in the whole time I was on a train wreck

742
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:33,880
going, what? You know, what am I going
to to, I have this deal now with Hbo,

743
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:35,230
but I got to write a show.

744
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:38,890
And so I met with Alec Berg
and then we came up with this.

745
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:43,150
And then I remember pitching it to them
and thinking, oh, they don't like it.

746
00:43:43,151 --> 00:43:43,440
They don't like it,

747
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,260
but this is what I would rather want to
do it if I could do anything and be this.

748
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:52,570
And um, they, the, the, the fact
that they were the ones going, oh,

749
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,840
you know, I said, you know, the violence
has to be very real. It's not fun.

750
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,110
Have violent. The violence is not
funny at all. When he fights people,

751
00:43:59,111 --> 00:44:03,160
I like it to feel real. I just don't,
I don't want it to be cool, you know?

752
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:06,640
And uh, they are absurd. Yeah.

753
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:10,240
Like weekend at Bernie's jokes,
you know what I mean? Like,

754
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,100
which you could easily do in this, you
know, there's a lot of times where you,

755
00:44:14,101 --> 00:44:16,990
you know, there's a scene in
episode three where I, you know,

756
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,610
have to strangle a guy and
there's, there's in his
backyard, there's all these,

757
00:44:21,611 --> 00:44:24,250
a child's, you know, kid toys and stuff.

758
00:44:24,251 --> 00:44:28,450
And I remember Alec Berg and I were
shooting that scene and I said, you know,

759
00:44:28,451 --> 00:44:31,150
any other place they would be
like, hey, can we make it funny?

760
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,080
Can you kill them with the
kids jump rope or, you know,

761
00:44:34,081 --> 00:44:37,140
can we get some jokes in there or, you
know what I mean? And it's like, no,

762
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:40,110
it's not like the merger is
going to be too depressing. Yeah.

763
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:42,750
Because it's like you should be,
no, no, no, but he should kill him.

764
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,620
He should still kill them. But just funny,
you know, and you're like, no, but, uh,

765
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:49,710
we can't do that. I said this
before in the podcast, you know,

766
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,780
that's why I could never really watch,

767
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:53,910
I watched extra cause I
liked the performances,

768
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:57,750
but I couldn't fully commit to it cause
I could just hear the industry note.

769
00:44:58,090 --> 00:45:00,330
Whereas like they went,
he's a serial killer and it's just like,

770
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:02,820
well how can we root for that?
And it's just like, all right,

771
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:07,380
he just kills the bad people. He's killer
with a good heart. And then I just was,

772
00:45:07,381 --> 00:45:09,600
I just never was able,
well that's the hard thing.

773
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:13,590
That's been the nice thing with
Barry, at least as HBO, you know,

774
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:17,910
when we would turn in the drafts, you
know, and we get to later in the season,

775
00:45:17,911 --> 00:45:18,750
especially,

776
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:24,080
it starts to get a very definitely
is not just killing the good people,

777
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:28,150
you know, bad people he's killing.
I gotta know I gotta go home.

778
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:31,770
I got to see it gets
terrible. And where he, he,

779
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:36,120
he ends up going, is, is a
pretty rough, but it was,

780
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:40,060
that was always just being honest to
that guy. You know what I mean? And that,

781
00:45:40,061 --> 00:45:44,010
that's the thing that HBO has been
great about is that we'll say, hey,

782
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:46,950
is this too much? And they go, well,
what else are you going to do? You know,

783
00:45:46,951 --> 00:45:50,640
they see it from a character standpoint.
They're like, well, what's his choice?

784
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:53,940
I saw at the two episodes and I, I, uh,

785
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:59,670
actually felt for the guy as far as like
how he became, that's another thing,

786
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,670
like he just, he's just not
like, oh, okay. He, Joseph's
born of psycho. It's like, oh,

787
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:07,440
this guy went to Afghanistan.
I can say this about Afghanistan,

788
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,520
did what he did over there and then got
into this line of work where you say

789
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,830
hitman. And he basically wants
to get out of it. And uh, and,

790
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:18,270
and just Henry Winkler's characters
with like the acting class.

791
00:46:18,271 --> 00:46:20,440
And I took a bunch of acting classes.
I had a lot of,

792
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:25,770
I had some great acting
teachers and I had,

793
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:31,380
but the, but those words sums, you know,
when they became like the guru and,

794
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:33,000
um,
I met,

795
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:37,620
I can't remember this woman's
name and I only audited her class.

796
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,650
I audited to clay. I mean,
one on one class I audited,

797
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:44,610
it turned out it was Scientology.
Oh really? Oh, it was
hilarious. I went in there,

798
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:49,680
this actor who was in Scientology, he
goes, oh, you need an acting class.

799
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:54,450
And she sent me there and it was acting
class, but it was also like Scientology,

800
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:58,350
which I felt like she should have said,
right. That should have been, it's acting,

801
00:46:58,351 --> 00:47:03,150
but there's a little extra thing. So
I go there, I go there and I remember,

802
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:07,400
uh,
we were sitting there and the,

803
00:47:07,401 --> 00:47:12,280
and the guy teaching the class goes
a, does anybody have, uh, any, uh,

804
00:47:12,281 --> 00:47:14,250
news they want to walk,
you know,

805
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:18,480
share with the class and someone
raised their hand and be like,

806
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:20,820
Oh, I, uh, you know, I,

807
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:24,720
I just book a three episode arc on a,
you know,

808
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:29,070
who gives a fuck on ABC? And then
the whole crew, the whole audience,

809
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,320
like ridiculously

810
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:35,090
lab or go
like this positive and I can put it,

811
00:47:35,091 --> 00:47:39,970
it was crazy high. And I, I was sitting
there like, what the fuck? Right.

812
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,080
It's like five people did that and
then they go, hey, we have, we have,

813
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:48,220
we have two people auditing
the class. Uh, this guy is,

814
00:47:48,221 --> 00:47:51,100
he's just fresh here from New
York. He's, he's an actor,

815
00:47:51,101 --> 00:47:54,490
he's trying to get some parts, blah, blah,
blah, blah. Please welcome bill burr.

816
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:57,640
And they clapped.
Like I won a lifetime achievement award.

817
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,940
I remember my face turned red.
I was embarrassed.

818
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,510
So you know, and then I saw the scenes
in the actors would go and everything.

819
00:48:04,511 --> 00:48:05,231
And then during the break,

820
00:48:05,231 --> 00:48:07,840
like I remember the teacher was looking
at me and goes, what's a, was that,

821
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,280
was that too much? Did I push? Was that,

822
00:48:12,281 --> 00:48:13,980
was I pushing? I'm sorry. Yeah.

823
00:48:13,981 --> 00:48:18,010
So then I went in and I sat down
with them and they were just,

824
00:48:18,011 --> 00:48:20,770
and he just kept saying everything was
their own. We have our own parking,

825
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,520
we have our own security, we have our
own this. And I swear to God, I said,

826
00:48:24,521 --> 00:48:26,380
Jesus Christ,
I feel like I'm joining a cult.

827
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:29,530
Like I was trying to make a joke and he
kind of looked at me and his eyes were

828
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,510
like going from my right item. I
left that red. I was just saying,

829
00:48:31,511 --> 00:48:32,440
what the fuck is going on?

830
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,630
So I got out of there and then I went
down to this call. I swear to God,

831
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,900
this is true. Went down to the
comedy club and I mentioned,

832
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:42,970
I say I took this acting class because
the actors were really good, but it was,

833
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,400
there was this just as fucking weird vibe.

834
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,370
And then I told him like the name of
the acting class, this guy goes, dude,

835
00:48:48,371 --> 00:48:52,570
that's fucking Scientology.
And uh, I dunno,

836
00:48:52,571 --> 00:48:56,710
I kind of felt like, you know, the next
time I saw that person I had that vibe.

837
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:59,920
Like, like they put something in
my drink like you should said,

838
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:02,500
I don't listen guys. Here's the
thing. Like I don't judge that.

839
00:49:02,501 --> 00:49:04,570
Like I hate when people act like,
oh my God,

840
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:06,130
those people are out
of their fucking minds.

841
00:49:06,131 --> 00:49:08,320
It's like my religion is
out of their fucking minds.

842
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,310
It's just they got enough people where
they can add cool now and they don't care

843
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:15,850
if you leave. Like Scientology needs
people. Yeah. So they got it, you know,

844
00:49:15,851 --> 00:49:17,950
they got to lock in a room or
whatever it is. You need to say,

845
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:21,700
this is where you're going. You
need to say like, by the way,

846
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:25,210
you're going to a church.
I liked how they had their own network.

847
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:30,211
Now to come back cause that one woman
did like the Sh Alina Yemeni or whatever.

848
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:35,140
She did all this episode's
about how like crazy that was.

849
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:37,780
But I always feel like there's another
actor that could do the one about the

850
00:49:37,781 --> 00:49:41,230
Catholic church. He bought them
anything. Yeah. Bang and kids.

851
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:46,000
And they made it seem like it was okay.
And that was the thing.

852
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,550
And you bought into it.
Um,

853
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:53,090
we're getting off track here.
Oh man, that's great. Well,

854
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,740
what I'm trying to do is I just don't
want to fucking sit here and ask you about

855
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,930
SNL and all of that shit
that I know. You've answered
a Zillion, a zillion times.

856
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:04,150
No, I'm, I'm loving this. I have no,

857
00:50:04,151 --> 00:50:09,151
that's every a thing I go to is like
this is the word Stefan from or whatever,

858
00:50:09,551 --> 00:50:13,900
you know. So how did you come up with
that and how did you come up with, so, um,

859
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,760
I will tell you my favorite thing I ever
saw you do was laughing uncontrollably.

860
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:23,110
Well, uh, uh, it was a lock.
The locker room thing. Oh,

861
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,590
foretastes 14. Yeah. Oh my God.
First he told me about that.

862
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:27,980
You literally have the towel.

863
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:31,520
I have a towel wrapped around
my face cause you know why?

864
00:50:31,521 --> 00:50:36,230
Cause Forte did this dance and he did
it at the table read on Wednesday.

865
00:50:36,231 --> 00:50:37,430
And I just said I can't,

866
00:50:37,431 --> 00:50:39,110
there's no way I'm going to be
able to make it through that.

867
00:50:39,111 --> 00:50:43,250
That's too funny cause he's a coach
trying to get us all riled up to go back

868
00:50:43,251 --> 00:50:45,950
into the second half of the
game and to get us riled up.

869
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:48,290
He does this herb Albert,
this dances, her balance

870
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:49,243
Birdsong

871
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:57,200
and he does his dance. And
then, and uh, and then so yeah,

872
00:50:57,201 --> 00:51:00,260
then I go, so before we went
on air, I go, Hey, will,

873
00:51:00,261 --> 00:51:02,840
can you just do it for me a couple
of times just in my dressing room.

874
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:06,090
Can you just do it so I can like
laugh and get it out? That's great.

875
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,600
So can I just get it out?
So he did it,

876
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:12,670
but then on air he added a move.
Of course he just to fuck with me.

877
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:17,510
He added this thing. He went like
that. Like he couldn't hear me and uh,

878
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,660
and I lost it.
I just completely lost it.

879
00:51:20,661 --> 00:51:23,240
And I started going and then I
remember said Degas was next to me.

880
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:28,241
You wanna know because I started going
and then Keenan Thompson started going,

881
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:33,560
cause we just hate pretty much Manny
lost it. Peyton a straight face. Oh no,

882
00:51:33,561 --> 00:51:38,300
he, he kinda, he starts to put a towel
around his face. He gets, cause I just,

883
00:51:38,420 --> 00:51:42,410
but I completely lost it.
Cause for it also was just,

884
00:51:42,411 --> 00:51:47,330
it was such a forte thing, forte
just, he's not like I'm on,

885
00:51:47,331 --> 00:51:51,230
you know, he's the one of those guys
very, hey man, I just very cool chill guy.

886
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,770
And then he would do these ideas or
something would happen to him and you go,

887
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:57,110
where's that, that he's, you know,

888
00:51:57,111 --> 00:51:59,840
he would make me laugh that whole period,

889
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:03,260
all of those like you are you and you're
one of those guys like that was like,

890
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:07,660
that was like murderers row.
He, he, he had, he pitched,

891
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,120
he goes on a bill,
I'm going out with a movie and I go,

892
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:11,120
it's the movie you're doing.

893
00:52:11,121 --> 00:52:15,270
He was I to do a movie
about a two brothers who,

894
00:52:15,271 --> 00:52:19,460
who's switch bodies. And I go,
yeah. He goes, here's the thing,

895
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,593
they're identical.

896
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:28,140
It doesn't matter. And I go,

897
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:28,983
okay.

898
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:32,040
I go, how do people know
that they switched bodies?

899
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:34,970
All that's the joke is everyone acts
like, whoa, you're acting differently.

900
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:38,800
That's not like you, but they're just
acting. There are these two boring guy.

901
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:42,560
So tell me he was doing to sustain
that for heat for 90 minute that out.

902
00:52:42,620 --> 00:52:46,340
And I was like, he told me that
and I laugh for, I just want it,

903
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,010
where the hell did you come with that?
And you know,

904
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:51,380
I'm going to write this movie
about these two guys. So yeah,

905
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:55,280
he's just a genius and a
great guy too. But yeah, no,

906
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:59,860
I felt very lucky when I was there with
all those people, Kristen and, and uh,

907
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:03,440
Andy and Fred Armisen and all those
guys. I mean, it was crazy. Yeah.

908
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:07,040
And you guys have all gone on to do
stuff. So right now are you, uh, are you,

909
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,140
when do you start back
up with the next season?

910
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:12,260
Or do you get the writing it right now?
We're writing season two right now.

911
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:14,060
Oh God.
Did you get any of the,

912
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:16,640
how much of a break did you get
to cheat a bit of a break? Yeah.

913
00:53:16,641 --> 00:53:21,510
I mean we finished all this in August,
so Barry was done in August. Oh, okay.

914
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,660
Then it starts airing and then,
you know,

915
00:53:23,661 --> 00:53:28,410
we opened up a writer's room
and you know, HBO uh, told us,

916
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:28,951
you know,
yeah,

917
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:33,951
you guys can we do more is it's going
to be another eight as of right now,

918
00:53:34,231 --> 00:53:37,050
who knows? We might change that,
but as of right now it's eight.

919
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:38,640
I kinda liked that people,

920
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:44,040
I like being able to craft eight episodes
and kind of make it a very, you know,

921
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:48,210
kind of a tight season, you know,
and with a good story to it.

922
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,270
Back in the day when there was a great
album is a lot of times it was eight

923
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:54,960
songs. Yeah. But then when the 10
song came out, it's like, all right,

924
00:53:54,961 --> 00:53:58,830
here's the fucking valid. I'm just
trying to fill it. I get it. I get it.

925
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:01,260
It's the same thing with TV
in a way where you go, oh,

926
00:54:01,261 --> 00:54:03,480
when are we going to watch an
episode that's all about, you know,

927
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:07,140
the gardener or something and you go,
I don't care about this. You know,

928
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,200
I want to know. I don't want
to, I want to know what else is.

929
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,150
I know JD that I don't consider that
groundbreaking. I'm just like, yeah,

930
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:15,460
you guys wanted an episode.

931
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:22,130
I think the series regulars are bitching
about their contracts. That guy,

932
00:54:22,131 --> 00:54:25,830
but we got to keep the train moving.
Let's, so let's do something about it.

933
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:30,210
That guy, that guy, guess what? You're
starring in the show, the sweat asshole.

934
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,300
You're carrying the shelf
and if it goes down,

935
00:54:33,301 --> 00:54:37,890
you never play a gardener in
this town again. You piece
of shit. Um, well anyways,

936
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:41,350
thank you so much for,
uh, for coming on. Oh Man.

937
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:46,950
Oh my head hurts. I'm laughing so much.
That was great. That's all my interviews.

938
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,170
Want to be good. I don't want
anybody to learn anything about you.

939
00:54:49,171 --> 00:54:51,960
I just want to give you a break
from the same fucking 20 questions,

940
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:54,180
but I'm so happy for you,
man. Thank you buddy.

941
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:57,510
That means a lot to be already done. So
much brilliant work. And the fact that,

942
00:54:57,511 --> 00:55:01,630
you know, HBO shout out to them
for being so cool to let a,

943
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:06,210
a comedic actor, I don't know
how to define what, what,
what, what it is sketchy.

944
00:55:06,211 --> 00:55:09,580
I don't know how, I just know
comedian. What, what, what,
what do you, I don't know.

945
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:10,860
I don't know,
like sketch,

946
00:55:10,861 --> 00:55:15,690
act or to SNL and they let
you do something like that
as a pen to write it and

947
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:19,590
direct. I never directed before and
they let me direct stuff and I mean, uh,

948
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:23,940
you know, I directed the first three
episodes and to write and all that and so,

949
00:55:23,941 --> 00:55:24,241
yeah,

950
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:29,241
just to be able to have so much faith
and crazy Eddie Murphy 48 hours.

951
00:55:30,841 --> 00:55:34,770
Stephanie's, yeah, the acting that
he does in that he so God damn funny,

952
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:37,940
but when it has to be real, he's
incredible. And then what was the,

953
00:55:37,941 --> 00:55:41,280
what was the one who got nominated for
the, uh, flipping name? Girl dream girls?

954
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:46,050
Yeah. I, for the life of me,
I don't understand why he
doesn't get more stuff on d.

955
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:48,050
I will say it,
not of it,

956
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:52,520
but that 48 hours scene when he goes
into the redneck bar and you know,

957
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:57,540
the cowboy is one of the few scenes
in movie history where you're like,

958
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:01,830
that's a movie stars just been born.
Yeah. We're what, with one scene,

959
00:56:01,831 --> 00:56:05,280
it's very rare where you can go, you
know, like John Wayne and stage coach,

960
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:07,830
they always say they push in on
in his first shot and stage coach.

961
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,560
And everybody went, wow,

962
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:14,690
But Eddie Murphy in that scene, I just
remember, I remember I didn't see, but my,

like this cannon. Unbelievable.

00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,990
Unbelievable. And, you know
something. I actually, uh,

973
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:57,520
I got to talk to him about
being on 48 hours. Wow.

974
00:56:57,830 --> 00:57:01,710
Uh, he's like, God dammit.
Jacked up joke Joe don't,

975
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:06,880

he also got thrown over the buffet table,

976
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,970

977
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:14,350

979
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:19,900

to 20,000 feet. What an answer.

980
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:26,740
He's the guy on the radio
or watching like, yeah. This
guy to see that again. Yeah.

981
00:57:26,741 --> 00:57:29,620
He just, they cut away to
him. He was like, oh, I just
went from, it's like, yeah,

982
00:57:29,621 --> 00:57:34,450
25,000 feet to 7,000 feet. What

983
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:37,660
I just don't remember. That was, that was

But he's great. I mean, that's one of
the best, the best movies. But yeah, no,

987
00:57:49,121 --> 00:57:52,960
the gunfight, the gun sounds in 48
hours. All those Walter Hill movies,

988
00:57:52,961 --> 00:57:57,760
he always had like a really cool sound
design in his movies. He's great. Yeah.

989
00:57:57,940 --> 00:57:59,650
Although the whole thing I
actually want to, I about,

990
00:57:59,651 --> 00:58:02,140
well this is like the epilogue
of the plot. Just this point.

991
00:58:02,141 --> 00:58:06,450
I was on the subway and the actor
that played Luther w, you know,

992
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,490
the guy from warriors, he was sitting like
right across from me. He had, you know,

993
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:13,720
he looked great. I mean, it's like
I'm be 20 years ago I saw him. Wow.

994
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:18,640
What am I just the way he
delivered that line, uh, when he,

995
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:23,260
uh, when Nick Nolte is beating him up
with the door and he goes, you know,

996
00:58:23,261 --> 00:58:26,170
system like, well, I think you're
lying. And the line is, yeah. Well,

997
00:58:26,171 --> 00:58:30,490
who gives a fuck what you think?
And he doesn't yell to the Word Fuck.

998
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:34,550
He just goes, yeah, well, who
gives a fuck what you think?

999
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,530
Why would you yell at Fuck?
Who gives a fuck what you think of?

1000
00:58:38,531 --> 00:58:41,950
Who gives a fuck what you did?
The way he did that he has?

1001
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:46,330
That was like the catchphrase
in my family. Yeah. Who
gives a fuck what you, yeah.

1002
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:50,140
He has such weird rhythms. That guy
all the warriors to, I mean like,

1003
00:58:50,141 --> 00:58:54,820
he's such as Drake.
He has such a cool way of speaking.

1004
00:58:54,821 --> 00:58:57,690
You just are like, yeah, well you
can learn a lot from that guy.
