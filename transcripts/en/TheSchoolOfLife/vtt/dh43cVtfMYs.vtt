00:00:04.539 --> 00:00:09.219
Everyone knows that at the beginning it happens
all the time…

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.080
...and then as relationships gets longer,
it doesn’t.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.070
We say it’s because we’re too busy, or
tired - or just not IN THE MOOD

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.880
But why does this important ‘mood’ disappear?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.509
To understand excitement, we have to go back
the early days, when we were deeply in the

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.210
mood pretty much every hour.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.210
What was exciting was our ability to touch,
hold, stroke

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.160
in short, POSSESS
someone who wasn’t entirely within our reach:

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.460
someone who was independent and free to walk
away from us - and yet miraculously was choosing

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.580
not to do so.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:54.240
Expressed as an equation:
SEXINESS = POSSESSION + FREEDOM

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.150
The thrilling desire to be within and inside
the body of another person stems from an active,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.030
mesmerised wonder that they’ve allowed us
to be so close and, somewhere in the semi-conscious

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.120
mind, a worried sense they might
not do so forever.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.950
Unfortunately, liking someone means we almost
always want to reduce their ability to survive

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.549
without us: in the nicest way, we relentlessly
try to erode the freedom of the person we

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.010
love.
And so gradually, we kill the very spirit

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.090
of independence that had underpinned our desire
from the outset.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.630
There’s something else that wears away at
the sex drive: FEAR. Odd though it might sound,

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.880
asking someone to have sex with us generally
has an element of risk attached to it.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.729
The other person might say NO or even, at
the limit:

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.979
Sex is a REQUEST.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:51.850
And in order to make a request, we have to
feel reasonably safe about rejection.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.070
At the start, we do feel that safety because
- even though we don’t know our lovers so

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.299
well - we’re independent: we have our own
routines, options and autonomy…

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.200
If it didn’t work out, we could walk away.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.349
Out of love, we throw away the supports to our
independent lives.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.980
We knit ourselves together. We no longer have
very much we can squarely call our own any

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.629
more. We also have to make requests of them
all the time: we want them to buy that sofa

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.180
we like,
we want very badly not to go and see their

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.769
parents for Christmas…
we rely on their income while we go back and

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.709
study for a new qualification...
In the circumstances, yet another request

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.010
seems like it might really be one too many.
So we don’t bring up that thing we want

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.549
to do with the mask.
or with the thigh high boots

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.689
We no longer have the will to lose face
 in front of our daily negotiating

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.019
partner.
It might just be easier to leave things alone

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:55.799
Strangely, there is one thing that’s almost
guaranteed to revive sex: a huge argument

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:01.859
with a genuine possibility of separation
Major bust-ups have a curious habit of ending

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.099
up in the bedroom
because they bring back to light two things

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.849
whose apparent absence had gravely undermined
sex.

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.799
Firstly: the sense that you could both theoretically
walk away

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.659
And secondly, the sense that you could, though
it wouldn’t necessarily be easy, survive

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.650
independently
You could, if you really wanted, build up

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.819
you own castle once more,
recover your own destiny, and greet existence

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.319
as an independent soul.
Good sex needs all this. It is built out of

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:37.760
a feeling of freedom and of buoyant self-confidence
- the very things that can become oddly so

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.959
scarce with time.
To get back to the thrill of the early days,

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.559
we need to learn the deepest and best lessons
of breaking up, ideally without having to

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:51.579
go through the very sad and painful process
of actually doing so.
