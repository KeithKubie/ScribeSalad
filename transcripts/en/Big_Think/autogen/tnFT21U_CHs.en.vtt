you know we never really looked into

point zero we might say about what the

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170
point zero we might say about what the
 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.240
point zero we might say about what the
ideal thing to do there would be instead

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250

we took a program that goes back to the

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:45.039
we took a program that goes back to the
 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.060
we took a program that goes back to the
original World Trade Center in the early

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070
original World Trade Center in the early
 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.529
original World Trade Center in the early
60s and it was never really that

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539
60s and it was never really that
 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.179
60s and it was never really that
effective or successful for most of its

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189
effective or successful for most of its
 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.999
effective or successful for most of its
life and decided to replicate it and

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
life and decided to replicate it and
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.830
life and decided to replicate it and
then came all the complex political

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840
then came all the complex political
 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.069
then came all the complex political
things that flowed from that so it's

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079
things that flowed from that so it's
 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.529
things that flowed from that so it's
taken in inordinately long time its cost

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539
taken in inordinately long time its cost
 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.160
taken in inordinately long time its cost
a huge amount of money and we still

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170
a huge amount of money and we still
 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.960
a huge amount of money and we still
don't really have anything that I think
