00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:12.869
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: My name is Eric Chu. And I'm responsible
for the Android Developer Ecosystem. To help

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:18.100
us get started this session, let me assemble
the context for Android Market. We launched

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.820
Android Market about 2 1/2 years ago with
the first Android device. Our simple goal

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.900
was to connect developers from around the
world with great products, with users from

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:36.530
around the world who were interested in these
products. During this period we saw tremendous,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:45.070
tremendous growth in adoption by carriers,
by OEMs, by developers, and by users in the

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.360
Android community. But for today what we want
to do is talk about Android Market from the

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.870
perspective of developers.
So there are four things we wanted to cover

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.800
today. The first one is customers. So who
are these users downloading applications from

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.000
the Android Market? What are they interested
in?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.730
My goal is to help you get more information
to help you better plan your target and better

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.920
plan your business. Second thing is distribution
tools. It's very important for us to make

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.640
sure that Android Market provides the best
tools to make it easy for you to distribute

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.750
your products. So I'm going to share with
you a few things that we've been working on.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.740
Third is merchandising. Android Market is
a marketplace. It's important for us to make

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.090
sure that we do everything we can to help
you merchandise your product on Android Market.

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.960
So I think you're going to like what some
of the things we're announcing and launching

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.979
today.
And the last thing is monetization. We actually

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.470
have investing and increasing investment in
this area over the last six months. So I'm

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.620
going to share with you some of the earlier
results we've seen based on the investments

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.670
we've been making.
So why don't we get started? First is customers.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.829
Who are these customers?
Yesterday at the keynote we announced that

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:11.050
we're now activating 400,000 devices on a
daily basis. I'm sure many of you agree that's

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.120
a very, very impressive number. But what's
even more impressive, if you look at the growth

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.849
rate, in terms of how fast we're adding these
new users. Last year at Google I/O, we announced

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.819
we were adding 100,000 new users on a daily
basis. So what that means is, within a span

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.030
of 12 months, we quadrupled the number of
new users we added on a daily basis. Not only

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.419
are we adding a lot of new users every day,
we're increasing the rate in terms of adding

00:02:42.419 --> 00:02:47.769
new users. But, having a larger install base,
while it's important, is only part of the

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.209
equation. The other important part of the
equation is are these users actually downloading

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.230
applications?
So we went back and looked at 2010 data. What

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:04.839
we found is that, by the middle of 2010 last
year, the number of applications users on

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:11.169
Android Market were downloading already exceeded
all the application downloads in the previous

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:18.639
year and a half. By the end of last year,
only a few months ago, Android Market users

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:24.299
download eight times as many apps that they've
done previously. So we've seen tremendous

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.840
growth in terms of these users's interested
in downloading applications.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:36.779
And we're looking at 2011 data, we're seeing
the same pattern. By the end of Q1 we exceeded

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:44.040
the first three quarters in terms of download
numbers compared to the Q1 this year. And,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.339
looking at data today, as you watched the
data yesterday, we exceeded the number of

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:56.839
users download in all of 2010. So, as you
can see, the increase that we're seeing in

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:02.670
terms of device activation is clearly translating
into rapid increase in application consumption.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.659
And that's good news.
Now let's take a look at where the action

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:13.659
is coming from. So the first thing we looked
at is, in Q1 of this year, if you look at

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:19.120
the U.S. numbers compared to the same period
last year, we activated three times as many

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.919
devices as we did last year in the same period.
That's very impressive. But what's even more

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.900
impressive, if you look at all the device
activation outside the U.S., we activated

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:40.220
18 times as many devices as we did outside
the U.S. market. So the international market

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.080
is really, really picking up. This is thanks
to, for example, in Korea. We saw within the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:50.930
same period Korea activated 50 times as many
devices as they did in Q1 of last year. Japan

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.659
40 times followed by U.K., Germany, and France.
All these countries seeing a huge increase

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:04.020
in device activation. To put in context, last
year at this time we activated about 70-plus

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:13.509
percent of the devices we activated were from
the U.S. Today about over 60% of the devices

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:20.430
we activated are outside the U.S.
So, if you guys have been focusing only on

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:24.789
the U.S. market, it's time to pay attention
to the international market.

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:30.199
We've seen the same pattern from a consumption
perspective. U.S. currently represents about

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:36.810
40% of the application consumption on Android
Market followed closely by Korea and Japan.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.740
The key piece of information I want you guys
to take away is that U.S. is definitely growing

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.740
very, very fast.
It continues to be a very important market.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.530
But even more important is to pay attention
to international market.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.229
We also took a look at the download of applications
by users on different versions of -- device

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:02.530
with different version of Android. Contrary
to common sense -- and, for those of you who

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.580
are familiar with install base -- majority
of the devices we have currently running within

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.840
the Android Market are running either 2.1
or 2.2.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.050
However, what we're seeing is that Android
2.3, Gingerbread devices, these users are

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:27.930
downloading on the average more than two times
as many apps as the users running 2.2 or 2.1.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.180
On Honeycomb those users are downloading more
than 2 1/2 times the applications. So not

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.219
only should you pay attention to the size
install base. It's also important to pay attention

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:43.689
to the behavior of these users and really
understand which group of users are heavy

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:50.060
consumption applications.
So now let's go in a little further and look

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:55.690
at what's happening within the different categories
of applications. So, if you look at overall

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.969
in terms of overall application across all
the different categories, what we're seeing

00:06:59.969 --> 00:07:05.900
is that entertainment, games, or tools continue
to have largest applications. Developers love

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:10.710
to build these type of products. The good
news is users also like these products. So

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:15.650
games, entertainment, tools remain the three
most popular types of applications people

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:22.009
are downloading. But what we're also seeing
is that media -- audio, video, travel, logo

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:26.919
in these areas -- these are also extremely
popular with users. So what we've seen there

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:33.409
is that users gravitate toward branded products.
They gravitate toward branded services that

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:38.039
access the premium services. In this case
fewer applications account for larger percentage

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:44.919
of download.
Now we look a look at pay apps alone. Games,

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:53.050
clearly, is the number one leader. Android
users love games. And arcade is the most popular

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:58.779
across all different game categories. The
other thing we're finding interesting is that

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:03.349
we find Android users to be more -- at least
we think they're a little more technically

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:07.550
savvy. They're very interested in purchasing
tools and utilities that add additional capabilities

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:17.050
to their devices. Ever since we launched Live
Wallpaper, the combination of Live Wallpaper,

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:24.379
widgets, alternative launchers, we see the
personalization propel into the number three

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:31.930
spots. And we see -- as a matter of fact,
one of the developers in our sandbox has an

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:36.630
alternative launcher. And, you know, he launched
a product I think maybe a couple months ago.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.589
He's extremely, extremely happy with the number
of downloads and the amount of revenue he's

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:45.060
generating from his application.
The last thing I want to mention on this slide

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:50.019
is productivity. Productivity has remained
one of the top categories on Android Market

00:08:50.019 --> 00:08:57.670
since the beginning. But in this category,
what we see is that a few applications, documents-to-go

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:02.410
or exchange connectivity, represent the bulk
of the revenue. So in these cases these are

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:07.600
not applications that are $1 or $2. These
are relatively expensive applications. They're

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.860
doing really well in terms of the number of
downloads and also doing very well in terms

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:17.870
of revenue.
So I hope the information we share with you

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:23.550
is going to help you better understand, you
know, who some of the users are and what they're

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:27.390
interested in. And our goal is to help you
to better target your investment and take

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:32.190
advantage of the install base that we have.
So the next thing I want to talk about is

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:37.240
distribution tools. As I mentioned earlier,
this is a very important area for us. We want

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:42.089
to make sure that Android Market makes it
the very marketplace to make it easy for to

00:09:42.089 --> 00:09:46.390
you distribute your applications. But, before
I go into it, I think it's also important

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:51.440
for me to also spend a few minutes to address
some of the common questions we get from developers

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:56.089
in terms of how they should package their
application for Android and Android Market

00:09:56.089 --> 00:10:00.430
for distribution.
So the number one most common question we

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:05.530
get from developer is what advice do we have
for them in how they should package their

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.959
Android application with different versions
of Android?

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:14.990
Well, this is precisely why we make this information
available on developer.Android.com. As you

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:23.779
can see, Android 2.2 and 2.1 represent the
bulk of the install base. If you look at the

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:28.340
number of these entries we've done over the
last 2 1/2 years, we've been very aggressive

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:33.160
innovating and adding new features on a very
rapid pace. But what we've seen is that our

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:38.140
carrier and OEM partners are actually keeping
pace with us. We've been looking at this pie

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.910
chart, actually, for about 12 months. At any
given point, we typically see two releases

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:48.320
of Android being dominant at any given point.
So our partners are actually tracking with

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:54.650
us and updating their devices with the latest
release of Android as quick as they can. And,

00:10:54.650 --> 00:11:00.009
in case you missed the announcement yesterday,
many of our top partners -- Verizon, T-Mobile,

00:11:00.009 --> 00:11:08.860
Sprint, Samsung, LG, HTC -- all announced
that they're committed to upgrade their devices

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:15.360
for 18 months to the latest release of Android.
What that means for you guys is that you can

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.670
count on even more rapid convergence to the
latest release of Android and give you a great

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:25.240
platform to innovate. However, what it also
means from a developer perspective is that

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:30.870
Android is a platform that should give you
a lot of flexibility. You can easily build

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:35.040
your application with one binary and, because
of a commitment to backward compatibility,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:42.899
that application should work across many different
versions of the OS. In addition, we also are

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:49.330
allowed to use features like Reflection that
allows you to have one binary that can both

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:54.951
take advantage of new APIs on new devices
at the same time as still run on Android device

00:11:54.951 --> 00:11:59.940
running older versions.
Another question we get asked a lot is what

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:05.709
about all the different screen sizes?
Again, this information is available on developer.Android.com.

00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:14.320
Two screen sizes, HVGA, a wide screen, represents
93% of volume. As a matter of fact, wide VGA

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:19.720
represents over 75% of the volume.
If you go to developer.Android.com, you get

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.910
all the details. What that means for you,
as a developer, it means that, if you decide

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:27.630
to build your apps in such a way to target
only a few screen sizes, you can easily do

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:34.149
that and get to the bulk of the install base.
But why limit yourself?

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:39.050
Android, as a framework, actually, has a lot
of facility, makes it easy to help your application

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.540
scale and look good on devices with different
screen sizes. You can easily build your application

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:49.089
as a single binary with a single resource
and have it run on many different devices.

00:12:49.089 --> 00:12:53.670
For those developers who -- you know, in some
cases, a lot of these cases are game developers

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:57.720
who want to have a lot more precise control.
They want to have the perfect graphics for

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.650
screen sizes, we also provided a facility
for them to have a single binary that's supported

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:09.790
by multiple research bundles.
What about 3D? Many of you ask can I count

00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:15.889
on OpenGL ES 2.0?
The answer is yes. About 90% of the -- over

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:22.040
90% of the devices today that are touching
Android Market support OpenGL ES 2.0. You

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:28.380
can absolutely take advantage of these advanced
reading capabilities. Or, again, the framework

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:33.300
provides the ability to build your application
in such a way you can run across both types

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:38.470
of devices.
So many of the developers today are already

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:43.209
taking advantage of this capability. They're
running many applications on many devices.

00:13:43.209 --> 00:13:48.459
So I decided to go to Android Market and look
for a few examples. The first example I found

00:13:48.459 --> 00:13:54.560
was Pulse news. It's a popular news application.
This developer built an application to run

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:59.240
on Android 1.5 and higher devices. Make it
-- it's designed to run on all the different

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:05.129
screen sizes of Android devices, all the densities.
So, consequently, this application runs on

00:14:05.129 --> 00:14:11.709
99% of the devices that access Android Market.
As a matter of fact, this developer had never

00:14:11.709 --> 00:14:16.959
seen Android 3.1. So we just launched Android
3.1 yesterday. And Pulse news worked flawlessly

00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:24.010
on Android 3.1.
Now let's shift gears a little bit. Let's

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:31.509
talk about gaming. Rovio Angry Birds -- Angry
Birds Rio is a popular 3D game. In this case,

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:37.740
this developer decided to target an application
for Android 1.6 and higher. This supports

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:43.061
small, normal, large screen sizes, three densities.
And, in this case, because they decided not

00:14:43.061 --> 00:14:46.640
to support Android 1.5 devices, which is a
very, very small segment of the population,

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:58.199
Angry Birds Rio runs on 97% of the devices.
So Kenneth Lui is an Angry Bird addict. I

00:14:58.199 --> 00:15:04.920
know he's going to show us what we've been
doing with Angry Birds here.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:25.610
&gt;&gt;Kenneth Lui: Thanks, Eric. We're going to
switch over here. So this will give you a

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:31.709
visual of what Eric was talking about. Rovio
decided that they wanted to address a wide

00:15:31.709 --> 00:15:52.870
range of users. And, in order to do that,
they needed to address -- can you switch this?

00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.559
Let me play it upside down. There we go. So
-- I'm sorry.

00:15:56.559 --> 00:16:08.889
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: I thought you knew how to play

00:16:08.889 --> 00:16:17.800
this game upside down.
&gt;&gt;Kenneth Lui: So they needed to address a

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:22.959
wide variety of different devices. As you
can see here, we have, coming up from the

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:29.379
HTC tattoo here, all these devices support
1.6 and above. We're ranging from QVJ devices

00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:37.740
to HVGA to wide VGA all the way up to the
Galaxy tablet and wide zoom screen sizes.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.889
Because of the way I developed this application,
as you can see, it runs very optimally across

00:16:42.889 --> 00:16:47.839
all these different devices. What's even more
important to note, I think, is that, when

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:54.500
they developed and deployed this application,
many of these devices already existed. So

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:59.110
it ran on those devices.
But, since that application has been deployed,

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.170
many new devices have also appeared on the
market as well. Obviously, you do need to

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:07.970
do some testing on some of these devices,
which they've actually done a very good job

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:12.470
of scaling to different devices. But it shows
that you can actually use one APK without

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:19.140
having to target a specific device and be
able to address a large range of devices.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:24.470
And I think the result shows, because a lot
of people downloaded lots and lots, and also

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:26.501
the rating is very good from the users as
well.

00:17:26.501 --> 00:17:29.370
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: So this Zoom tablet is running
Android 3.1, right?

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:33.240
&gt;&gt;Kenneth Lui: Yes.
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: So Rovio had never seen this happen

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.300
before?
&gt;&gt;Kenneth Lui: Right. We put it on, and it

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:40.710
worked.
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: Great. Thank you. So another application

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:46.020
I want to highlight is some of you may say,
what about more sophisticated games?

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:51.910
So Glu has a game called Gun Bros. It's a
3D multi-user game. And, in this case, they

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:57.090
decided performance is really important for
them. So they target 2.0 and higher. They

00:17:57.090 --> 00:18:02.320
target screen sizes normal, large, extra large.
They know about tablets. They are going to

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.320
design an application to also go on a tablet.
And, in this case, their application with

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.450
multiple resource bundle -- because, in this
case, they really want to have more control

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:16.940
of the graphical asset on different screen
sizes -- runs on 94% of devices. So, even

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:23.830
for a very high-end 3D game, it's absolutely
possible for you to build your application

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:29.940
with, in this case, with additional resource
bundle and support many, many different devices.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:35.440
So stepping back, what we really tried to
do with Android as a platform is give you

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.750
the flexibility to build your application
for extremely, extremely wide distribution

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:43.520
both in terms of from a geo perspective, from
a hardware capability perspective, and also

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:50.430
in terms of API perspective. At the same time,
we also recognize that there are developers

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:55.920
who want very precise control and precise
targeting how they deploy the application.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.830
So this is where Android Market comes in.
So Android Market is designed to complement

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:07.130
Android as a platform, working hand in hand
to make it extremely easy for you to, number

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:12.080
one, from a business targeting perspective,
target your application to run on all countries,

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:19.540
subsequent countries, or any of the carriers
within these countries. At the same time,

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:24.470
from a capabilities perspective, we also give
you the built-in flexibility to, if you choose

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:30.650
to, target specific OS versions, specific
screen sizes, specific OpenGL versions or

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:37.930
whatnot. So we give you a lot of control on
how you can target your application. However,

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:43.380
we've also heard requests from a lot of developers,
from those developers who really want to target

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:47.180
an application, they really want to have more
tools to help them understand. If they choose

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:51.850
to only, let's say, support two or three versions
of Android platform, what devices will be

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:57.100
available to them?
So I'm pleased to announce starting today

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:02.950
on the Android Market site, based on the manifest
of your applications -- you get to declare

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:08.820
and define it -- you can easily upload your
publication, either publish or draft, see

00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:15.720
all the devices that your application would
be visible to. You also have the option, if

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:21.700
you want to, to basically opt out of some
of the devices. So, Kenneth, why don't you

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:28.350
walk through and show us what this looks like.
&gt;&gt;Kenneth Lui: Sure. What you see on the screen

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:34.590
here is the developer publishing site. We're
looking at an application which is timeriffic.

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:44.350
If I scroll down to where some of the target
options are, we have the country and carrier

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:51.860
targeting Eric talked about earlier. We also
now, in addition, you see a section called

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.870
supported devices. Within supported devices,
it will tell you what screen layouts are supported.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:21:02.521
It also gives you an account. If you notice,
there's a number here which says this application

00:21:02.521 --> 00:21:08.720
is available to over 388 devices. So we can
actually click into it and see what those

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.570
exact devices are. So, if I click into it,
it will be listed by manufacturer. Each manufacturer

00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:19.990
has different models. And let's pick one of
these. Let's say Acer show more. And I can

00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:25.460
actually see what devices are included in
that group of devices -- group that this application

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:29.110
is available to.
I can also choose to exclude them. But let

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:36.040
me show you another application that -- timeriffic
in draft mode that we're about to launch.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:42.530
So this is an application that actually has
a higher platform requirement. It's the same

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:49.900
screen size layout. But you see that, in addition
to what we saw earlier, we have now a smaller

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:54.610
number of devices. So now this application
is available for 346 devices. This is a paid

00:21:54.610 --> 00:22:00.210
version of the one that I just showed you.
Now, if I go into show devices, we see the

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:05.850
same lists. But, if I click on to, for example,
Dell, you will see that there are Dell devices

00:22:05.850 --> 00:22:10.330
that are supported up there. But there are
also devices that are not supported. So the

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:14.980
Dell, for example, in this case, is a 1.5
device. And it tells you it is unsupported

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:20.850
because of the manifest settings. I can also,
for example, manually -- let's say, if I wanted

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:26.570
to for some reason exclude the Dell Streak,
click on exclude. Now I have automatically

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:38.030
excluded devices as well as manually excluded
devices as well.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:44.330
So now you see that, yes, the numbers 346
devices. It will also tell you how many devices

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:48.500
are manually filtered as well.
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: Thank you, Kenneth.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:54.860
Another feature many have developed applications
for, in some cases, developers may have multiple

00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:00.800
versions of the application for a particular
product. They may have one version supporting

00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:07.030
Android 2.1, 2.2, and another version supporting
a tablet.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:17.600
Starting in June, we're going to be launching
a new version called Multiple APK. It allows

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.320
developers to have different versions, different
screen sizes, different text formats, all

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.890
listed under a single product listing.
[ Applause ]

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:32.330
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: You guys like this one better
than the other one?

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:38.120
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: Anyway, Android Market will automatically

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:43.990
deliver the right APK to the right device.
What you also get as a developer is that all

00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.770
the user ratings, comments, billing, will
all be aggregated in the product. And, again,

00:23:47.770 --> 00:23:55.510
this will be available in June.
The next thing that we can -- get asked a

00:23:55.510 --> 00:24:02.910
lot, Android users love gaming, as I mentioned
earlier. And as Android goes into tablet space

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:08.620
and if you look at some of the great games
that were shown in the sandbox, these are

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:12.020
extremely high-resolution games. In many cases,
they are ports coming from consoles. These

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:18.510
ports take up a lot of space.
Starting in June, we're also going to increase

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:25.340
the size of support from currently 50 megabytes
to four gigabytes. Android Market will manage

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:33.040
for you the different pieces you upload, the
application, plus the resource for the application.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.091
All of it will be hosted on Android Market.
So for some of you who have been dealing with

00:24:36.091 --> 00:24:40.370
secondary download, we're going to take care
of that for you and we'll download all the

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:46.900
pieces into the Android devices.
[ Applause ]

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:55.510
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: The next thing is, now that your
app is published, we will also want to make

00:24:55.510 --> 00:25:00.630
it extremely easy for you to start setting
up a marketing campaign for your products.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:05.590
So yesterday, we announced one-click integration
with AdMob, which makes it extremely easy

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:12.700
for you right from the Android Market portal
to launch and initiate setup of an AdMob campaign

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:16.211
for your application.
The integration doesn't touch your application.

00:25:16.211 --> 00:25:20.670
But what it does is it's smart enough to send
the right information, like your application

00:25:20.670 --> 00:25:25.400
management's information to AdMob to help
make sure that you can set up your campaign

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.790
to target the right devices to support your
application.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:33.921
And, again, this was launched yesterday.
The last thing I want to talk about is, now

00:25:33.921 --> 00:25:39.380
that your application is published, you want
to know how it is doing.

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:45.720
So six weeks ago, we launched application
stats. What it does is give you a comprehensive

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.040
view of the download performance of your application
across different countries, different languages,

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.660
different OS, different screen sizes.
What we also provide is how your application

00:25:53.660 --> 00:26:00.840
does compare to same application -- application
in the same category.

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:07.460
In addition, three weeks ago, we launched
monthly sales reporting. Our goal there is

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:12.570
to give you the ability to be able to download
monthly sales report so you can load into

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:16.360
your own system, load in your own spreadsheet,
do your own analysis, do your own tax reporting

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.360
and whatnot. So three years ago, we launched
with the month of March. I'm happy to announce,

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.610
if you go to your pub site, we now have sales
reports all the way back to January 2010.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:36.360
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: So as you see, we, have done a

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:42.030
lot of work investing in, one, making it easy
for you to manage in how you distribute an

00:26:42.030 --> 00:26:45.790
application. At the same time, we're also
invested in giving you more and more information

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:50.930
how you manage your business. You can expenditure
us to continue to invest in this area.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:54.980
The next thing I want to talk about is merchandising.
As I mentioned earlier, Android Market is

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:59.640
a marketplace. It's important for us to do
everything we can to make it easy for you

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.470
to merchandise your product.
So a few months ago, we launched Android Market

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:09.820
on the Web site. And our goal there is, number
one, we want to increase the service area,

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:13.350
make it easier for us and make it possible
for us to merchandise and showcase even more

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:18.440
products. At the same time, we want to provide
a convenient landing place where you promote

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:24.110
your applications. You can promote your application
either direct with clicks to the device, the

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:29.100
Android Market on the device, or you can direct
them to the Web site, where users can easily

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.950
check out your application, initially purchase
a download, and have the application pushed

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.600
onto your device.
We know there's a lot more we can do.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.830
Let me walk you through some of the things
we are launching today.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:48.290
Many of you are familiar with the list "just
in." That's how a new application starts.

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:56.890
You go to just in. These are more adventurous
users who are always looking for latest applications,

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:02.430
will find the applications, download it, play
with it, make some comments.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:11.270
If I were a developer, I wouldn't stop there.
I would be thinking about what should I be

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:15.420
doing to drive more eyeballs to my application.
This is extremely important, because unless

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:20.190
you generate some velocity to generate downloads,
you're not going to make it to other lists.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:29.110
You should also think about viral marketing.
Look at who you can partner with, look at

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:34.390
affiliates and whatnot, what you can do to
generate more eyeballs for your application.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:40.090
But last, but not least, it's absolutely critical
to pay attention to the comments and feedback

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:47.020
from users and update your application be
frequently. Those can help propel you to the

00:28:47.020 --> 00:28:52.830
more interesting list or potentially really
damage your ability to get eyeballs for your

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:55.500
applications.
Now, if you're a user, if you're a developer

00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:00.590
that has multiple products on the Android
Market, you also get the benefit that on the

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:05.430
apps detail page of each application, we also
showcase other applications from the same

00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:08.660
developer. But what if you are a brand-new
developer, you never launched any application

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:14.480
on the Android Market. How do you get your
-- how do you find a way, you know, to get

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.470
above all the noise, since we have thousands
and thousands of applications coming into

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:22.690
the Android Market on a weekly basis?
So I'm pleased to announce, starting today,

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:29.610
we're adding a new list on the Android Market
Web page, top page, called "trending." Trending

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:34.010
is aimed at showcasing those applications
that are getting a lot of downloads within

00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:39.490
a short period. One way to think about it
is that these are the apps that are really,

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:44.090
really hot right now.
We are also launching two additional lists,

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:50.360
Top New Paid and Top New Free.
The goal of these lists is to really showcase

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:56.000
applications that are brand-new, less than
30 days old, but they're very popular with

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.080
users.
In addition, we're refactoring the top free

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:06.770
and top paid list to really focus on showcasing
applications that are getting a lot of downloads

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:11.580
from users.
And then last, but not least, we are also

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:19.180
launching a new list called "Top Grossing."
This list is aimed to showcase those revenue

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:25.990
generators both for initial download and in-app
billing. And so any developers with more higher-priced

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.820
applications that generate a lot of revenue
but maybe not as much download, we expect

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:36.210
those type of applications to show up here.
Now, in order to make this list more relevant

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:43.150
to each user in each country, starting today
as part of this launch, these lists will be

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:49.170
regionalized for the top countries around
the world. So, for example, if you are a user

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:55.340
in the U.S., what you see in the "Top Grossing"
list will be the top grossing applications

00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:00.611
targeted for U.S. market. Not for Korea, not
for Japan, but for the U.S.

00:31:00.611 --> 00:31:04.200
So, Kenneth, can you walk through what's on
-- these lists look like.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:09.410
&gt;&gt;Kenneth Lui: Sure.
So let's start from this chart, which Eric

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:13.130
just went through, and go into a little more
detail about how you can actually get on these

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:17.270
lists. So the first one being more from a
developer, so now you have ability to actually

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:21.740
cross out and list your applications. So if
you're already installed, you can very easily

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.470
let the users see what other applications
you have.

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:32.200
Now let's get into some of the new lists.
Now, if I scroll down here, you actually see

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:37.490
"Trending Apps." And this is actually the
-- that's the actual list that we have right

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.040
now.
So if you look at some of these trending apps,

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:46.740
these are actually very, very good examples.
Google music, Web M.D., and Adidas and Groupon.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:52.000
Some of these are newly launched applications,
so their actual absolute number of installs

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.641
is not very big probably right now. But they're
growing very quickly. So we're looking at

00:31:57.641 --> 00:32:03.170
something like -- which is, let's say, in
the last day, what is the download trend of

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:06.860
these applications.
So if we show acceleration, then these applications

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:11.090
will actually get into this list.
Now if you see something like Groupon, Groupon

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:16.530
is an existing application, but they just
posted a major release. So even if it is an

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:20.920
existing application, you can actually get
onto the trending list as well if you are

00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:25.330
generating a lot of installs. So that's what
the trending is. And this application shows

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:30.980
that.
Now, if we go further into the top new and

00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:36.780
-- paid and free, you can see that now we
actually have a numbered list as well. So

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:41.650
these are actually -- it says number one,
Robot Unicorn; number two, Talking Lila, the

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:46.880
Fairy. So we actually have ranked lists in
the top new and top paid. If we click on one

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:55.940
of them, you actually see a longer list of
applications. Again, they all have a ranking

00:32:55.940 --> 00:33:03.350
next to them.
And we actually show these apps that are in

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:08.160
the top new and top -- Top New Free and paid.
What this is trending is a day. Top new looks

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:15.430
into applications that are not older than
30 days and actually showing a weekly download

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:21.650
of installations and putting them into this
rank list.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:26.522
Continuing on to the lists, now, if your application
does really well and continues to do well

00:33:26.522 --> 00:33:34.240
beyond the seven days, then we have the top
free and top paid applications. So now we

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:40.120
actually make it into this list in terms of
installations. And then, finally, top grossing,

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:45.450
which is the sale of the application.
Now, Eric also mentioned that while we are

00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:50.760
looking at the English version of this Web
site, I also started another session. Now,

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:56.770
if we look at this session, this is showing
the Korean list that users in Korea would

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.820
actually see.
So, first of all, it's localized. And then

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.840
also, if we pay attention to what the top
lists are listing, you see some of them are

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:14.869
global, English applications. But if we actually
scroll down, for example, Kakaotalk, a couple

00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:19.720
others that I don't know how to pronounce.
But these are Korean applications. What's

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:23.299
important to note is we're not filtering these
applications based on the country, but these

00:34:23.299 --> 00:34:29.759
are actual behavior of users downloading applications
in these countries and that's how we're computing

00:34:29.759 --> 00:34:34.319
that list. So it is locally relevant for the
users in those countries.

00:34:34.319 --> 00:34:39.379
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: Thank you.
So in addition to these top lists that we

00:34:39.379 --> 00:34:44.149
make available at the top pages in Android
Market Web site, we also have done some work

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:49.309
in the details by page of each application
and cross down of the applications. So there's

00:34:49.309 --> 00:34:53.450
two new lists that we're introducing. The
first one -- the first list is really aimed

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:57.619
at showcasing applications that are similar,
related to the applications that you're looking

00:34:57.619 --> 00:35:04.069
at. The second is targeted at companion applications.
Users who download this application also download

00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:06.529
these other applications.
Kenneth, can you show us a little what this

00:35:06.529 --> 00:35:12.049
looks likes.
&gt;&gt;Kenneth Lui: Sure.

00:35:12.049 --> 00:35:18.769
Now, I'm actually looking at a specific example
of an application, which is SlideIT Keyboard.

00:35:18.769 --> 00:35:22.250
Within the app detail page, if I look at the
left-hand side, number one, I have the Murph

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:28.069
developer, which we looked at before. And
then we have a list of applications here.

00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:33.710
Users who looked at the SlideIT keyboard,
also looked at Thumb key, smart keyboard,

00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:41.250
better keyboard. That's what people are comparing
and kind of what fits them the most.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:46.829
If I look at the list below that, it also
says, "Users who install this also install."

00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:52.410
So these are some of the -- you know, in addition
to the application that the users installed,

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:56.320
they also installed these applications. So
it makes sense, because now these are actually

00:35:56.320 --> 00:36:04.029
all language packs for this keyboard.
Just to give you one more example, on the

00:36:04.029 --> 00:36:13.789
Zillow page, for example, you will see that
visitors who viewed this also viewed Trulia,

00:36:13.789 --> 00:36:20.359
so people are deciding which to use. Also
users who installed this application looked

00:36:20.359 --> 00:36:24.980
at Homes.com, Zip Realty, Real Estate Answers
as well. So they're likely to have both of

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:28.940
those applications.
So now there's more ways to actually -- in

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:34.779
relation to the users, what they're installing,
also recommending some applications for them

00:36:34.779 --> 00:36:39.099
that they might consider.
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: Thank you. In addition to these

00:36:39.099 --> 00:36:45.119
new lists, our team will continue to look
for great amounts showcase in terms of editorial

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:51.520
featuring. The last thing I want to mention
-- one thing I want to mention is personal

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.509
recommendations.
In June, we're also planning to launch a new

00:36:54.509 --> 00:37:01.150
list on the top page which is aimed at really
showcasing users applications they might be

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:03.480
interested in based on applications they downloaded
before.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.640
Kenneth, can you quickly show us what we have
here?

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:12.910
&gt;&gt;Kenneth Lui: Okay. Already talked about
featuring, which talked about editorial list

00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:19.660
of applications.
If I switch into another page, you actually

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:26.539
see this is the "my library" tab. Here's a
user who's very interested in real estate.

00:37:26.539 --> 00:37:32.349
And also in golf applications.
So if I go back and see what the personal

00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:43.829
recommendations are, let's scroll down, past
the trending list.

00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:48.480
In the section that's called apps for you,
you'll see there are other applications like

00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:54.839
ScoreMobile. It thinks you have downloaded
some sports and golf applications. Real estate

00:37:54.839 --> 00:38:01.450
options: Homes.com, Century 21. Those might
be also applications that you might be interested

00:38:01.450 --> 00:38:07.470
in as well. These are things looking more
specifically to that user, based on what you

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.670
have as a portfolio of applications that you
have downloaded, here are some additional

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:14.599
sets of applications that you might be interested
in.

00:38:14.599 --> 00:38:18.089
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: Thanks.
As you can see, we went from a few lists that

00:38:18.089 --> 00:38:23.109
we had before to showcasing applications to
now 12 lists.

00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:27.109
And this, we believe, will go a long way to
really showcase many different applications

00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:30.250
based on different life cycles, what is a
brand-new -- whether it's a brand-new application

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:33.770
or an application getting downloaded right
now, or an application that's been really

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:39.570
popular for a while, we have a list that really
showcases these great applications.

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:44.900
But we think there's more we can do. We think
there's more we can do in terms of really

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:49.890
helping users quickly find what are some of
the best of the best applications on the Android

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:53.080
Market.
We also think there are things we can do to

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:58.150
really give developers recognition for those
developers who are committed to Android and

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:02.430
invested in a consistent track record of building
great applications.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:09.990
So I'm pleased to announce, starting today,
we're launching Editor's Choice for Android

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:17.460
Market. So Editor's Choice is aimed at providing
consumers information and making it easier

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:23.910
for them to find the best Android applications
on the marketplace.

00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:30.240
In addition, we're also going to be launching
the top developer badge. So Top Developer

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:37.430
is aimed at recognizing those developers who
have a strong track record on Android, and

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:42.040
they've consistently built great applications.
And we want to give them indication so that

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:47.079
when a user is looking at applications from
these developers, we want to provide a little

00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:51.279
bit more information to help users feel comfortable
that these are the developers they can trust,

00:39:51.279 --> 00:39:56.589
they can download applications from.
Kenneth, can you show us what it looks like.

00:39:56.589 --> 00:40:01.559
&gt;&gt;Kenneth Lui: Right. So looking at these
applications, if we look into the details

00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:07.180
below the icon, you can see that some of these
are actually -- has the Editor's Choice, as

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:10.540
well as the Top Developer.
So a few of these applications actually have

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:16.869
those. So, for example, if I look at -- in
this example -- Amazon Mobile, that's a top

00:40:16.869 --> 00:40:20.999
developer. And then also -- it's also an Editor's
Choice application as well.

00:40:20.999 --> 00:40:28.230
We also have a section here which lists all
the current Editor's Choice. So if we click

00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:36.289
on that, you'll see a list of applications
that have been selected editorially as the

00:40:36.289 --> 00:40:39.269
Editor's Choice applications.
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: Great. Thanks.

00:40:39.269 --> 00:40:44.829
So as part of the launch today, we started
with a set of applications that we actually

00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:48.210
spent a lot of time looking at and making
sure these are some of the best applications

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:52.789
that run on many devices. We also spent a
lot of time looking at many developers that

00:40:52.789 --> 00:40:55.869
are currently on the Android Market and trying
to pick out those developers that have a great

00:40:55.869 --> 00:40:59.079
track record.
In the coming months, we'll plan to continue

00:40:59.079 --> 00:41:04.530
to look for more and more applications to
add to this list and more and more developers

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:08.920
to add to the top developer list.
So to sum it up, if you look at, you know,

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.359
from a merchandising perspective, we've done
a lot of work to increase the real estate

00:41:13.359 --> 00:41:19.440
in terms of how we promote applications. We've
made this list -- these lists relevant based

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:25.089
on each country. And we are also providing
recognition for developers' great apps and

00:41:25.089 --> 00:41:28.619
those great apps that we think users really
look at downloading.

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:34.799
All of this is live on Android Market right
now. And within the next 30 days or so, we're

00:41:34.799 --> 00:41:38.029
also going to be bringing these capabilities
to the Android Market (inaudible) device.

00:41:38.029 --> 00:41:43.249
With that, I'm going to bring Paul Montoy-Wilson
up to show you what it will look like on the

00:41:43.249 --> 00:41:46.240
device.
&gt;&gt;Paul Montoy-Wilson: My name is Paul Montoy-Wilson,

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:51.780
and I'm a product manager on Android Market.
Yesterday, at the keynote, we announced there

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:57.890
are over 200,000 applications on Android Market.
With so many applications, we are working

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:03.720
so hard to help users find and install more
great applications. What this means is there's

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:09.430
an opportunity to get your great applications
in more places on the phone.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:24.269
I'd like to give you a demo of that.
Am I not strong enough? Oh, a little too strong.

00:42:24.269 --> 00:42:39.450
Oh, I got it. Perfect.
All righty, so with that, I'm on the home

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:44.810
page of Android Market. And we had an updated
feature section to highlight the greatest

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:55.880
applications. From the feature page, I can
easily swipe to view the categories. And also

00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:03.799
access the top lists.
In addition to the top charts that are currently

00:43:03.799 --> 00:43:08.410
available on Android Market, I'm excited to
say that the lists Eric just announced will

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:21.140
also be available, like the top new charts.
It's faster and easier to explore more applications,

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:28.829
which means users will find more and install
more applications.

00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:33.869
My dad just bought his first Android phone
and has never installed an app before. When

00:43:33.869 --> 00:43:38.430
he opens up Android Market for the first time,
it's going to be a great place for him to

00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:46.690
check out the Editor's Choice apps, an essential
set of some of the best apps on Android Market.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:51.230
For me, I am an avid app user, and so what
I like to do is, every morning when I wake

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:57.500
up, I like to swipe over to the top new charts
and check out to see which apps are new and

00:43:57.500 --> 00:44:04.529
popular.
I was excited to see and discover ESPN's new

00:44:04.529 --> 00:44:15.609
live application that streams ESPN 360.
We have redesigned the app details page and

00:44:15.609 --> 00:44:22.359
brought screen shots to the top to highlight
your most valuable assets.

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:29.279
In addition, we have added more applications
from this developer directly on the details

00:44:29.279 --> 00:44:36.130
page so users can continue to browse.
When I am ready to install this application,

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:47.009
the download is just a click away. We have
worked hard to streamline the browse purchase

00:44:47.009 --> 00:44:51.240
and download experience so users will find
an install more applications.

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:58.660
I am excited to see how this new Android Market
client for the phone will help you be successful

00:44:58.660 --> 00:44:59.990
on Android.
Thank you.

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:09.759
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: So the last section we want to

00:45:09.759 --> 00:45:14.599
cover is monetization. As I mentioned earlier,
this is an area that we have been increasing

00:45:14.599 --> 00:45:22.440
investment over the last six months.
And what we're seeing is we're already starting

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.299
to see the fruit of our labor.
If you look at our 2011 Q1 revenue compared

00:45:25.299 --> 00:45:36.779
to the same period last year for the U.S.,
we saw a 3x increase in Android market revenue.

00:45:36.779 --> 00:45:40.730
But what's even more amazing is when if you
look at the increase in revenue outside of

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:46.960
the U.S. We saw 30x increase in revenue. In
countries like UK, Germany and France, we

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:53.869
saw 7 to 8 times increase compared to the
same period last year. In Japan, with the

00:45:53.869 --> 00:46:02.829
support of carriers such as KDDI, Docomo,
we saw a 100x increase in revenue in Japan

00:46:02.829 --> 00:46:07.529
compared to the same period.
And we think one of the key things we need

00:46:07.529 --> 00:46:12.309
to continue to invest in to really drive the
increase in revenue is to increase the number

00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:17.710
of buyers in Android Market.
So over the last four quarters or so we have

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:23.630
already seen a six and a half times increase
in Android Market buyers from same time last

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:28.819
year compared to this year.
So a few things we are doing to further drive

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:34.900
that growth. Number one, at Google I/O last
year, Android Market was available for buyers

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:40.390
in 14 countries. In September, we increased
that number to 32 countries.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:48.990
I'm pleased to announce over the next week
or so we'll be introducing Android Market

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:55.119
for buyers in 99 additional countries. That
puts a total of 131 countries where people

00:46:55.119 --> 00:47:00.210
can buy your products.

00:47:00.210 --> 00:47:12.440
&gt;&gt;Eric Chu: The other area that we have been
investing in is direct carrier billing. For

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:17.410
you as a developer, you don't have to do anything.
Carrier billing is just a form of payment

00:47:17.410 --> 00:47:21.869
underneath that you don't have to worry about.
Just like a credit card, just like Visa and

00:47:21.869 --> 00:47:24.259
Mastercard. As we add additional carriers,
you get that for free.

00:47:24.259 --> 00:47:33.270
We have already integrated with AT&amp;T, T*Mobile,
Sprint. We're also integrated with a few carriers

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:39.079
in Japan and we are already seeing great results.
When we look at one of the major U.S. carriers

00:47:39.079 --> 00:47:43.869
that we integrated with, direct carrier billing
represents approximately 50% of the sales

00:47:43.869 --> 00:47:53.160
transactions. That means U.S. users are definitely
using carrier billing as a way to buy applications.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:57.519
When you look at what's happening in Asia,
the result is even more dramatic. Within a

00:47:57.519 --> 00:48:05.019
short period of time after we launched carrier
Building billing, for this particular carrier

00:48:05.019 --> 00:48:09.900
we saw sales transactions double.
The last thing I want to talk about in this

00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:15.999
area is my personal favorite. So 45 days ago
we launched in-app billing on Android Market.

00:48:15.999 --> 00:48:24.160
We're starting to see a few applications take
advantage of in-app billing, but what's really

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:33.180
interesting is that right now, these few applications
represent 14% of the average daily revenue

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:39.980
in Android market. A few applications.
In that billing application based on the data

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:47.540
we are seeing right now, monetized 25 times
more than the counterpart on the paid app

00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:52.089
side. And you just heard we launched the top
grossing list. If you go to the list on the

00:48:52.089 --> 00:48:58.480
Web site, you will find nine of the top ten
grossing applications, and these are brand-new

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:03.880
applications considering we just launched
in-app billing. Nine of the top ten applications

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:09.900
are in-app billing enabled -- sorry, nine
of the top ten games are in-app billing enabled.

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:15.970
So if you have not looked at in-app billing,
I highly, highly recommend to you take some

00:49:15.970 --> 00:49:20.850
time to check that out.
So we shared a lot of information with you.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:25.559
We shared a lot of data, we shared a lot of
information with you in terms of new things

00:49:25.559 --> 00:49:29.190
we have done. So let me kind of try and bring
it all together.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:34.430
If you are building an application for Android
Market, one of the first thing you think about

00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:40.470
is make sure it's a great application. Make
sure this application utilizes all the great

00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:48.400
features on Android platform. Make sure the
application looks great on those devices.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:54.579
Each user on their device are always looking
for the best application on their device,

00:49:54.579 --> 00:49:56.230
so they are not necessarily interested in
ports.

00:49:56.230 --> 00:50:01.950
At the same time, you should really think
about broad distribution. We have done a lot

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:07.700
of work to make it easy for to you address
90-plus percent of the installed base. Take

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:11.900
advantage of that.
Make sure you think about pricing. You need

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:17.660
to price it relative to your competition.
It's not how much you think your app is worth.

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:22.920
It's how much the user is willing to pay relative
to all the other products that are available

00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:25.839
both on Android Market and on the Android
mobile apps store.

00:50:25.839 --> 00:50:32.749
Remember I mentioned it's extremely important
when launch an application that those few

00:50:32.749 --> 00:50:37.359
initial ratings, comments could really either
make you or break you. Make it easy. Assume

00:50:37.359 --> 00:50:41.250
you have a great application. Make it easy
for them to rate and provide feedback for

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:44.849
your application and that will help propel
you into some of these new lists that we have.

00:50:44.849 --> 00:50:50.480
Immediately after you launch a product, really
think about marketing. We have done a lot

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:55.300
of good work in surfacing a lot of lists to
make it easy to promote your application,

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:59.890
but we need help from you to make sure you
rise above the noise and get into these lists.

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:05.580
It's important to monitor use of feedback.
As I mentioned earlier, respond to them and

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:09.740
timely update. And that's important in the
beginning, in the middle and throughout the

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:13.849
process. What you definitely should not do
is launch a product prematurely. We have seen

00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:19.930
cases where developers launch a product prematurely,
get bad ratings, and they have a tough time

00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:24.079
digging their way out of it.
It's also important not to require excessive

00:51:24.079 --> 00:51:29.670
permissions. Where you require permissions,
especially those that seem not as intuitive,

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:35.049
help users understand why in description.
Where you don't need the permission, don't

00:51:35.049 --> 00:51:39.319
ask for it.
And it's important to take a look in general

00:51:39.319 --> 00:51:43.130
across all applications in that category and
not overprice.

00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:47.900
So I hope you found the information we shared
with you useful.

00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:53.609
I hope you find the new features that we are
launching today and launching soon also useful

00:51:53.609 --> 00:51:58.839
for you.
From the Android team, our goal and our success

00:51:58.839 --> 00:52:02.900
really lies with you. Your success is our
success.

00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:07.059
What we think about every day is what can
we do to increase the number of downloads

00:52:07.059 --> 00:52:11.550
of your applications to users, what can we
help you do to monetize more your investment

00:52:11.550 --> 00:52:16.190
with Android.
Your feedback is also important to us. Your

00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:21.609
feedback helps us prioritize what we need
to work on first so keep those coming.

00:52:21.609 --> 00:52:23.910
So with that, thank you for being here.
