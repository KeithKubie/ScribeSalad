about the state of war I only worry

about the state of war I only worry
 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.880
about the state of war I only worry
about scientific questions for example

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890
about scientific questions for example
 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.300
about scientific questions for example
my current work shows that on the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310
my current work shows that on the
 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.790
my current work shows that on the
average level of intelligence and and in

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:26.800
average level of intelligence and and in
 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.049
average level of intelligence and and in
all wasn't populations is going down

00:00:30.049 --> 00:00:30.059
all wasn't populations is going down
 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.609
all wasn't populations is going down
that worries some of my colleagues

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619
that worries some of my colleagues
 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.400
that worries some of my colleagues
intelligence research the fact that as

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410
intelligence research the fact that as
 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.350
intelligence research the fact that as
populations the average intelligence is

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360
populations the average intelligence is
 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.360
populations the average intelligence is
going down doubt doesn't worry me I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.370
going down doubt doesn't worry me I
 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.440

don't worry about societal trends I only
 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.450
don't worry about societal trends I only
worry about scientific questions and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460
worry about scientific questions and
 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.670
worry about scientific questions and
solutions so what keeps me up a night is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680
solutions so what keeps me up a night is
 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.940
solutions so what keeps me up a night is
is solving scientific problems I don't

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:50.950
is solving scientific problems I don't
 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.680
is solving scientific problems I don't
solve society's problems I don't care

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690
solve society's problems I don't care

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.120
assoc like I said defective intelligence

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130
assoc like I said defective intelligence
 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.200

on fertility behavior all my research

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210
on fertility behavior all my research
 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.830
on fertility behavior all my research
right now involves arm what intelligent

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840
right now involves arm what intelligent
 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.040
right now involves arm what intelligent
people value and prefer and part of what

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050
people value and prefer and part of what
 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.350
people value and prefer and part of what
intelligent people value prefer is not

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360
intelligent people value prefer is not
 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.820
intelligent people value prefer is not
having children or having fewer children

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830
having children or having fewer children
 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.770
having children or having fewer children
than less intelligent people

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780
 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.190
um this work hasn't been published yet

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200
um this work hasn't been published yet
 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.990
um this work hasn't been published yet
but probably more intelligent people

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000
but probably more intelligent people
 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.730
but probably more intelligent people
more likely to be homosexual because

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740
more likely to be homosexual because
 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.800
more likely to be homosexual because
once again it is unnatural to be

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810
once again it is unnatural to be
 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.060
once again it is unnatural to be
homosexual in the sense that all

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070
homosexual in the sense that all
 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.950
homosexual in the sense that all
biological beings are designed to be

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960
biological beings are designed to be
 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.020
biological beings are designed to be
heterosexual designed for heterosexual

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030
heterosexual designed for heterosexual
 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.149
heterosexual designed for heterosexual
reproduction so in that limited sense it

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159
reproduction so in that limited sense it
 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.149
reproduction so in that limited sense it
is unnatural to be exclusively

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159
is unnatural to be exclusively
 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.340
is unnatural to be exclusively
homosexual and for that reason probably

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350
homosexual and for that reason probably
 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.960
homosexual and for that reason probably
more intelligent people are more likely

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970
more intelligent people are more likely
 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.180
more intelligent people are more likely
to be homosexual the less intelligent

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190
to be homosexual the less intelligent
 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.719
to be homosexual the less intelligent
people to pick any unnatural things that

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729
people to pick any unnatural things that
 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.340
people to pick any unnatural things that
we're not designed for one children

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350
we're not designed for one children
 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.369
we're not designed for one children
people more likely to do it
