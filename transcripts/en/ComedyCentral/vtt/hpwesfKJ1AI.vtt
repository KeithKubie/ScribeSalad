00:00:57.857 --> 00:00:58.891
Apparently they printed

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:00.860 align:start size:78% position:22%
uh, thousands,

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:02.829 align:start size:94% position:6%

00:01:15.574 --> 00:01:17.343
- 'Alright?'

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:21.481
You people have been
blisters on my taint

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.983 align:start size:84% position:16%
and not just blisters,
but in-grown hairs.

And yes, there's cabernet

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.723 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know why?

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:31.724
'Huh?'

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:34.227
I'm gonna go out
and snort coke

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.195
off a black man's behind.

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:38.965 align:start size:81% position:19%
Uh, you didn't hear
about this?

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:41.300

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.035

(Jim)
'They printed 3000 of them.'

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:47.807 align:start size:84% position:16%
But, um, there is some
coke in evidence

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.243 align:start size:81% position:19%

Nice coat.
Is it real?

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:54.947 align:start position:0%
You don't have to...
Don't...

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.284

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.635 align:start size:94% position:6%
For the record, you're
the second person to come in

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.370
and tell us to suck
your black [bleep].

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.971 align:start size:75% position:25%
(Jones)
'Who else did?'
