00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.250
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the all-new G Flex 2, from LG.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.270
Life’s Good

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.440
Get ready for the future!

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.539
Where you could see in 3D without those glasses.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:16.449
Hi guys, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.529
What’s called, autostereoscopy, or a method
of displaying a 3D image without the use of

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.210
awkward headgear is sort of old technology.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.039
If you call 30 years ago old.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.750
It was first developed by Reinhard Boerner
(RINEHARD BUR-NER) at the Heinrich Hertz Institute

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.859
(HHI) in Berlin in the mid 80s.

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.290
Since then it’s gone through a few iterations,
but this latest one is a huge step up in terms

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.290
of awesomeness.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.250
A new prototype, from a partnership between
a small tech start up, TriLite and the Vienna

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.300
University of Technology, has the potential
to create huge outdoor 3D displays by beaming

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.480
lasers directly into your eyes!

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.460
With current technology, glassless 3D images
are limited.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.250
They’re single view displays with just two
images projected and they need a “sweet

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.740
spot” to be viewed currently.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.400
Sitting outside of this zone leads to a blurred
image.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.580
You also never get the sense of moving around
an object.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:07.610
When it is possible, it’s only through eye-tracking
devices which really only work for one person

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.610
at a time.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.520
This new technology is still a small prototype
of only 3x5 pixels, or as they call them “trixels,”

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.330
but it’s promising.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.050
Each tiny part is made of up three laser diodes,
a cylindrical microlens, as well as a moveable

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.050
mirror.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.700
The mirrors move the laser in different directions.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.650
The 3D effect comes from the lasers sending
a different picture to each of your eyes.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.470
What’s really novel about this new technology
besides the lasers, is the ability to see

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.250
the image from different angles.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.420
Its creators say this new system could project
hundreds of different images and could create

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.490
potentially thousands of different "viewing
zones" and the image would change as you walked

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.490
past it.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.830
This technology still has a “sweet spot”
though, a pretty large one at that.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.980
To view a 3D image you would have to be within
about 76 yards of the screen! and if you’re

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.860
too far away, you’d just see a 2D image,
not blurred or distorted one.

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.380
The only catch is that capturing an image
in that kind of 3D would be difficult.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.920
You’d either have to use a bunch of cameras
or a new camera would have to be invented.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.690
So while the technology still has to be scaled
up and tweaked, I’m excited.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.209
Obviously 3D technology is not just a thing
of the future.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.180
Some of you might already have 3D televisions
at home.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.799
At CES this year, LG unveiled their latest
line of Smart 3D 4K OLED TVs.

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:22.510
But even though 3D is one of the coolest parlour
tricks, it’s also a pretty old one.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.959
In order to trick your brain into thinking
it’s seeing depth, each eye needs to see

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.569
a slightly different image.

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.079
Photographers first figured this out in the
mid-1800s.

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.519
Back in the day, two images taken from slightly
different angles, would be seen through the

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.060
most popular device, a Holmes stereoscope.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.700
In the mid 1900s, a more modern version arose,
the View-Master.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.239
One of these guys.

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.030
The cheesy colored glasses type of 3D was
also figured out in the 1800s.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.560
It’s called Anaglyph 3D.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.230
With this type, images are coded with colors,
usually chromatical opposite like red and

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.230
blue.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.430
If the left eye has a red lens, it reads the
blue part of the image as black and the opposite

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.849
is true for the other eye.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.189
More modern ways to trick the brain into see
3D use passive polarization glasses which

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.239
filters lines of pixels for each eye or active
flicker glasses.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.969
As the name suggests theses flicker in time
with the tv, so your right eye only gets the

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:15.989
images for that eye and the left eye only
gets images meant for it.

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.829
It’s cool to see how far the technology
has come, and where it’s going.

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.129
Are you a fan of 3D?

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.190
Did you go see Jaws 3D in theaters?

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.739
Is Avatar your FAVORITE MOVIE?

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.249
Or are you literally sick of the whole gimmick?

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.029
(there’s a video here on why you might get
sick from 3D movies)

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:30.239
