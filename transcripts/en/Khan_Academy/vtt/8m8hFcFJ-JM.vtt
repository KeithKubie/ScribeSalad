00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.736
- [Instructor] Find the
equation of a line perpendicular

00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:08.480
to this line that passes to
the point two comma eight.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.180
So this first piece of information that

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.210
it's perpendicular to that
line right over there.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.750
What does that tell us?

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.280
Well if it's perpendicular to this line,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.840
it's slope has to be the
negative inverse of two-fifths.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.250
So its slope, the negative
inverse of two-fifths,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.860
the inverse of two-fifths is five.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.990
Let me do it in a better color.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.450
A nicer green.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.110
If this lines slope is
negative two-fifths,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.260
the equation of the line
we have to figure out

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.140
that's perpendicular,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.860
the slope is going to be the inverse.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.693
So instead of two-fifths,

00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:37.970
it's gonna be five halves.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.430
And instead of being a negative,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.430
it's going to be a positive.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.390
So this is the negative inverse

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.450
of negative two-fifths, right.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.100
You take the negative
sign, it becomes positive.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.190
You swap the five and the two,

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.580
you get five halves.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.260
So that is going to have to be our slope.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.300
And we can actually use the
point slope form right here.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.750
It goes through this point right there.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.700
So let's use point slope form.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.700
Y minus this Y value which
has to be on the line.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.050
Is equal to our slope,

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.360
five halves times X minus this X value.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.990
The X value when Y is equal to eight.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.600
And this is the equation of
the line in point slope form

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.500
if you wanna put it in

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:19.590
slope intercept form.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.110
You can just do a little bit of algebra.

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.350
Algebraic manipulation.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.580
Y minus eight is equal to let's
distribute the five halves.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.580
So five halves X minus five
halves times two is just five.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.420
And then add eight to both sides.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.770
You get Y is equal to five halves X.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.170
Add eight to negative five.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.160
So plus three.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.663
And we are done.
