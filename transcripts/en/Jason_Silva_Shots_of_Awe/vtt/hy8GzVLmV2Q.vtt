00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.940
So the brilliant
thinker, Geoffrey Miller,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.360
has an amazing book
called The Mating Mind.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.720
And basically, it
stipulates that the origins

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.250
of human intelligence,
that human creativity,

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.290
the amazing functional creative
output that human beings are

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.900
capable of is rooted
merely in the fact

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.870
that our brain is
a sexual ornament.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.890
Our brain is the human version
of the peacock feather.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.290
It's a way of capturing
and controlling

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.250
the attention of
potential mates so

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.260
that we can replicate our genes.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.610
The evolutionary origins of our
immense capacity for invention

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.930
are stemmed in the
fact that we are

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.110
wired to procreate
and to mutate.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.740
Now what's really interesting
is that with the advent

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.550
of human culture,
we've graduated

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.970
from spreading our genes to
spreading our means, which

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.490
are new replicators,
units of information that

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.250
need to be seeded
out into the world.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.660
So today, we continue to
employ these ancient primordial

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.700
capacities for discourse
and oratory and ecstatic

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.000
articulation and
ecstatic vocalization.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.640
Our charm, our peacock
feather continues to be used.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.940
But it's like we're hacking
these ancient capacities

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.150
and now using them to
capture and control attention

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.240
to spread our means
instead of our genes.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.990
Celebrity, or being known
really, in any capacity,

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.480
merely means you're
mating your means well.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.370
You're the chief of that tribe.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.796
And I just think that's
astonishingly fascinating.

00:01:42.796 --> 00:01:45.270
It explains a lot.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:02:09.612
