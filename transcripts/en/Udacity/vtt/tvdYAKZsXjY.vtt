00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.864
Here, the factor pairs for 12. And I know that each factor pair must be

00:00:03.864 --> 00:00:08.758
positive, since I have a positive 13 in the bottom. The only factor pair that

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:15.188
adds to positive 13 is 1 and 12. This allows me to rewrite the middle term 13x

00:00:15.188 --> 00:00:19.925
as 1x plus 12x. Next we start factoring by grouping by taking out an x from the

00:00:19.925 --> 00:00:25.140
first two terms an a 6 from the second two terms. Finally, we factor out a 2x

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.980
plus 1, leaving us with x plus 6 times 2x plus 1, our completely factored form.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.703
You're really improving your factoring skills if you got this correct.
