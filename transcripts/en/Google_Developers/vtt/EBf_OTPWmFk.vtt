SETH STERNBERG: Well thank you
all very much for coming to

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.580
Google I/O. We really
appreciate it.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.125
My name is Seth.

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:11.010
And I'm the Product Management
Director

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.960
for the Google+ Platform.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.320
DAVID GLAZER: I'm David, the
Engineering Director for

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.150
Google+ Platform.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.580
SETH STERNBERG: So we're going
to take you guys through an

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.410
overview of the various tools
that are available from the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.560
Google+ Platform today.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.670
And first, we just
want to start.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.145
This is very new, the
Google+ Platform.

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:28.840
So we just wanted to start
with what is the platform

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:29.400
really about?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.740
What are we trying
to accomplish?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.250
And at a very high level, we're
trying to help bring the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.870
best of Google to the rest of
the internet and enable a user

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.800
to bring their internet
back to Google.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.650
So it's really creating a
connection, between a user and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.830
their Google experience and the
rest of the internet and

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.210
everything, that they experience
on the internet,

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.710
back to Google.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.110
So you wondering, what does
that actually mean, right?

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.470
Well, let's just drop
right into a story.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.730
So let's say that I'm
doing a Map search.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.860
And I'm kind of like, OK, I want
to see a movie tonight.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.760
And as I'm doing this search,
I get a notification.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.350
And you guys have probably
seen this before, the red

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.430
square with the white number,
the notifier that's across all

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.840
Google properties.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.020
So I just got a notification,
that dropped in on me, when I

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.290
was on Google Maps.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.575
And I click it.

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:19.500
And so when I click that,
I see come up a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.830
message from David.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.350
And he's saying, hey, let's
grab dinner tonight.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.370
So I want to see more.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.560
What is David actually
trying to say to me.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.680
So I go ahead and
I click that.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.650
And I get the full post
that came in.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.900
And it looks like David shared
something from Open Table.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.790
And it says, let's grab dinner
and a movie tonight.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.850
How about Zero Zero, which
is a local restaurant?

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.770
So I'm like, OK, let's see
what Zero Zero is about.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.690
There's a very clear Action
Button right there and View

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.480
Menu button.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.470
So I'm just going to go
ahead and click that.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.310
And when I do so, I just get
taken straight to Open Table,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.800
right into their.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.740
Site and I go right to the
menu page in Open Table.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.150
So Zero comes up, and I scroll
through the menu.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.960
And I think, yeah, this is
actually a pretty good place.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.710
Why don't we go ahead and
make a reservation.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.660
So I'm going to find a table.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.160
I'm going to get a
bunch of options.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.050
And I'm going to Accept,
click 5:45.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.050
And in order to make a
reservation at Open Table, of

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.090
course, you have to login.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.810
Because they need to
know who you are.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.690
So Open Table is one of the many
people who've integrated

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.160
Google+ Sign-In, which you saw
a little bit about at the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.610
keynote address.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.960
So I want to go ahead and choose
to sign in with Google.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.880
And when I do that, I get a
standard consent dialogue that

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.190
comes up and says, hey, this
is the information you're

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.590
going to send about yourself
to Open Table.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.210
And this is the information from
Open Table that's going

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.410
to come back to Google.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.320
So I'm going to go ahead
and Accept and

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.540
sign-in to Open Table.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.630
Now this is really special,
what just happened.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.620
Right here, Google just noticed
that I actually have

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.630
an Android device.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.170
And because I have an Android
device, which does not yet

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.950
have the Open Table application
on it, we're

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.820
proactively asking me if I'd
like to download the Open

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.580
Table Android app.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.180
It's the absolutely smoothest
experience for a user to get a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.490
mobile application
onto their phone.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.450
All of this happening when
a user chooses to

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.700
connect on the web.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.130
So I'm going to go ahead
and do this.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.170
I'm going to say, yes,
I'd like to install

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.360
the Open Table app.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.820
So of course, I'm on
the web, right?

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.310
I've just gone in through
the sign-in flow.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.780
I'm now signed in.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.510
And because I'm signed in, my
reservation is now confirmed.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.740
So I've just gone ahead and
made a reservation at Open

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.880
Table for dinner for David
and I tonight.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.810
DAVID GLAZER: So now
we're planning

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.860
our evening out together.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.420
And Seth took care of dinner,
so I decided, let's see if I

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.890
can find a movie for
us to go to.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.470
And I like to use Fandango
to buy my movie tickets.

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.750
So I go to Google, search
for Fandango.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.530
And what I see is not only I can
find Fandango, but I also

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.290
see some great suggestions for
movies that other people, who

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.400
use Google and Fandango, have
been interested in lately.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.760
And it reminded me, oh, I've
been meaning to see the new

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.470
Iron Man movie.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.460
Let me check it out.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.690
So I go ahead, click
on "Iron Man".

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.320
And there, right in Fandango,
is the trailer.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.250
I watch the trailer.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.460
It is going to be awesome.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.680
Enough things explode.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.550
I definitely want to go
see this tonight.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.700
So I go ahead.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.980
And I'm going to buy
some tickets.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.210
But I'm also going to tell Seth,
you should check this

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:16.529
out, because I just
bought us tickets.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:17.839
We're going to have a great
time at this movie.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.010
SETH STERNBERG: So when David
shares that, with me, from

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.090
Fandango, I get a notification,
once again, on

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.940
any Google property, including
on my Android device.

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.540
So I just pull out my Android
device, which I got a

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.210
notification on.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.990
And I see, it looks like David
has shared something with me.

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.140
So I'm going to go ahead
and click into that

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.360
and see what happens.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.860
Tap into it, as the
case may be.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.450
So I tap in, and I
see he's buying

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.572
tickets at 6:00 PM tonight.

00:04:45.572 --> 00:04:47.590
Now that's a small problem,
because, as you all remember,

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.070
I made my reservation
for 5:45 at dinner.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.250
So I'm going to fix
this conflict.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.780
So we're now on my mobile phone,
obviously, so I'm going

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.500
to go to my application
launcher.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.590
I have Open Table on my phone,
already, because I downloaded

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.180
it when I was initially
registering with Open Table.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.950
And when I go ahead and tap on
Open Table, like you guys just

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.920
on the keynote this morning,
I am already connected.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.850
I am already signed in
on the mobile device.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.980
I don't have to touch
anything.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.290
Open Table just knows
who I am.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.970
And the application is
completely relevant to me,

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.120
because I've already connected
on the web.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.930
So Open Table has my
dining points.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.720
They have my profile picture,
my name, all the standard

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.020
information about me.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.980
And of course, they also have
my reservations that I've

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.300
already made.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.270
So I'm going to go ahead and
tap on Zero Zero, the

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.210
reservation I made for
David and I tonight.

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.910
And that'll bring me into the
reservation, and I can go

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.670
ahead and change that
reservation.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.360
So that story, I think,
illustrates a completely

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.030
seamless experience, where all
the technology, all the

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.390
computing just kind of fades
into the background.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.990
And it was so easy for David and
me to coordinate, in this

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.410
case, dinner and a movie this
evening, just one, simple,

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.250
fluid flow from the user's
perspective.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.080
Open Table just appeared
on my phone.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.700
Once I connected to Open Table
on the web, I was connected to

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:15.970
Open Table on mobile.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.760
It just knew who I was.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.580
David found things in search
based on what other people

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.480
were doing inside Fandango.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.080
Fandango was telling Google,
hey, here's what's happening

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.600
inside our application.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.520
And we brought the best
of Fandango to users

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.250
as they did a search.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:36.700
So one simple fluid flow that
just makes computing fall into

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.030
the background.

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.280
Now, we launched Google+ Sign-In
just two months ago.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.750
So it's really new.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.640
And we thought we'd tell you a
little bit about what we're

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.880
hearing from the market.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.560
So one of the launch developers,
The Fancy,

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.470
proactively emailed
us and said this.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.350
And we're like, hey, guys,
that's awesome.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.660
Can we tell everybody else what
you guys just told us?

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.440
And what they're telling us is
the conversion they're seeing,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.020
from Google+ Sign-In, is besting
that of other social

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:13.450
networks, across every platform,
Android, iOS, web.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.510
And then, from another one of
our launch partners, from "The

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:21.220
Guardian," they told us that, on
Android, 41% of their users

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.010
are choosing Google+ Sign-In.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:29.140
And that is the number social
sign-in option on Android.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.390
Last night, we held a dinner for
some of our partners, who

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.040
you can see in the Sandbox
later today.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.060
And one of those partners
implemented Google+ Sign-In

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:39.500
three weeks ago.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.460
And they shared, with David
and I last night, that in

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.920
those three weeks, Google+
Sign-In has literally become

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:49.340
the number one social login
choice for users who are

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.620
connecting with their
application.

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:58.770
So some other stats, 40%,
this blew our minds.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.010
When a user is asked, do you
want to install the Android

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:06.200
app, when they are on the web,
so that flow you saw in Open

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.730
Table, where when a user
is connecting with your

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:13.240
application on the web, 40%
say, yes, I do want

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.050
to install the app.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:20.510
There is no higher conversion
mechanism that I know of to

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:24.180
enable a user to install your
Android application.

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.020
40% of users who are asked if
they'd like to install an

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:31.540
Android application, through
that flow, are saying, yes.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.179
That is incredible.

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:36.960
And then another step, those
interactive posts, where David

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.760
shared with me the menu in Open
Table and then shared

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.890
with that he'd like to go see
"Iron Man 3" from Fandango,

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:50.100
those interactive posts are
getting three times the

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.920
engagement rate of a normal
post inside Google.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.780
Three times.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.500
When we saw that, that was kind
of the sleeper hit of

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.310
Google+ Sign-In.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:03.100
We just did not expect we'd get
that level of engagement

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.140
from sharing inside an app.

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.750
And in retrospect, it's
really obvious, right?

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.990
We're giving users a really
clear call to action.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.420
David's not just saying, hey,
I'm sharing something from

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.210
Open Table.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.530
He's saying, click here
to view the menu.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.570
I want you to do something.

00:09:15.570 --> 00:09:17.380
I want you to engage with me.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.310
And that turns out to be
very, very powerful.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.520
So in sum, what you can see,
is that we've created an

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.250
experience that's
just completely

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:29.150
seamless for a user.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:32.170
It just makes it so easy to
just live your life, on a

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.720
daily basis, and use a service
that you trust, like Google+,

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.940
to connect with applications and
to bring the best of your

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:41.390
Google experience with you to
the rest of the internet and

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.130
then that rest of the internet
back to Google.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.010
And now you can see
it in action.

00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:48.200
So now David's going to walk
through some very specific

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.540
products and how to actually
make them work.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.910
DAVID GLAZER: Thanks.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.470
So Seth gave you the
overall context.

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.070
You saw the story.

00:09:57.070 --> 00:09:59.240
We're connecting what you do
on Google to what you do

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.290
everywhere else.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.740
And I'm going to walk through,
in not a deep dive but a sort

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.270
of medium deep dive, on eight
different features.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.840
I'm going to talk about four
features that are really about

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.070
how we take what happens in
your apps, what happens as

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.070
users are browsing your
site, and how we can

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.550
bring that into Google.

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.650
And then we're going to talk
about four features that go

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.200
the other direction and take
the power of Google, the

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:27.220
capabilities of Google, and help
bring them into your app.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.420
Let's get started with
first feature.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.060
This is a very straightforward
feature.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.500
Someone's looking for
you on Google.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.280
They're doing a search.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.270
They're trying to find your
brand, your product, your

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.090
presence, your company,
whatever it is.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:43.380
In addition, to the normal
results, over on the left, we

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.950
also have this panel on the
right, where you can see,

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.710
here's recent posts from
"National Geographic," here's

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:50.980
the conversation, the
information, that I'm trying

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.320
to get out to my audience now.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.650
So what does it take
to do this?

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.120
This one actually doesn't
take coding.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.900
This one just takes--

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.230
set up a Google+ page
and, once you set up

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:01.360
the page, use it.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.710
If you have something to
say to your users,

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.890
say it, share things.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.380
And when you share them and
people search for you on

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:09.070
Google, we'll show
it up in Google.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:12.130
It's probably the simplest
way to start having a

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:16.160
conversation, with your users,
inside Google, from your app.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.040
Let's go a tiny bit deeper and
say that we also want to

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:22.400
affect some of the things that
appear on the left side of

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:26.720
Search, in the ads and in the
organic search results, in the

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.620
main section there,
on the left.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:31.180
If you notice, up at the top,
you can see that this add,

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:34.910
because a lot of people have
been interacting with this

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.790
advertiser, we can
highlight that.

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:38.310
We think that's useful
information to

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.630
people viewing the add.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:40.970
So we highlight it.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:44.020
And similarly, you can see that,
in the Search results,

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:48.220
if people, me or people I care
about, have said, hey, I'm

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.410
interested in this piece of
content, I recommend this

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.960
piece of content, we
highlight that.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.040
That's useful information to
people searching, so we're

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.360
going to show that.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:59.460
So how do you send those signals
over to Google so

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:01.880
Google knows that this might
be information worth

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.880
highlighting?

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.110
Pretty simple, you put a couple
buttons on your site.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.800
You put Follow button,
if you want people

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.350
to follow your presence.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.650
You put a +1 button, if you want
people to recommend your

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.380
site, recommend your content.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.950
And what we're seeing
is really,

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.210
exactly what we expect.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.110
When we pick the signals that
we choose to highlight and

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.090
feature in Google Search, we
pick them because we think

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:21.550
they matter to people.

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:23.450
And the results we're seeing
are they do matter.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.630
People find those to be more
interesting, more compelling,

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:30.780
more reasons to click
on those results.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.110
Let's go on to another
feature.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:35.370
So you saw this in the story.

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:39.200
You saw that there was this
capability, where, right in

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.990
Seth's experience of using
Google, whether he happened to

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.470
be in Maps or he happened to be
in Search or he happened to

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:47.890
be in Gmail, a notification
came in, which took him to

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:48.950
this message I sent.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.320
I had sent a post out
there that said,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.630
Seth, this is for you.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.160
I'd like you to check
this out.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.490
And I did it in a way that was
in context, that was really in

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.370
the flow of what Seth is doing,
what we were doing

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.870
together, so he had a reason
to engage with it.

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.180
So how do you do this?

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.110
How do you help users do this?

00:13:09.730 --> 00:13:12.670
Short answer is copy and paste
that into your page next.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:16.190
A slightly longer answer-- and
I'm going to go a tad bit

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.620
deeper on this one, because
there's a pattern here, which

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:22.360
is the way that we do all
of the rich, interactive

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.360
capabilities that we let you
drop into your website.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.820
And the pattern is, you put in
one line of JavaScript, but

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.455
you put it in once.

00:13:28.455 --> 00:13:31.360
It's sort of amortized over all
of the different social

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.220
capabilities from Google that
you might want to include.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.600
You put in that one line.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.590
And then everything else is
putting in markup on the page,

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.940
just like all the other elements
on your page, with

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:43.510
enough information for us,
Google, to know how to render

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.290
it and what to do with it.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.990
So in this case, you see, at the
top of this button markup,

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:51.980
that the class is g dash
interactive post.

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.790
That tells us that you want us
to render that as a Share

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.790
button that lets Seth share a
message with me, let's me

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.500
share a message with Seth.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.250
He also told us what
should happen when

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.120
someone clicks on it.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.180
So if you go through it, you
can see that the call to

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:07.670
action is View Menu.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.230
We didn't guess that
was a View Menu.

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:12.300
You decided that, in this case,
the action that you

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.500
wanted to facilitate
was viewing a menu.

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.190
And you also told us
where should it go.

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.630
If he clicks, you told us some
other information to display.

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:21.540
You gave us all information
we need to render this.

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:24.190
I should point out that all of
the examples that we're going

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:28.010
through, today, are shown in
the HTML version, the web

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:28.670
version of it.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.210
There are exactly equivalent
capabilities for Android,

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.910
using the Android SDK
style, for iOS.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:39.090
So we didn't want to go into all
of the different syntactic

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.890
details, but, conceptually, it's
exactly the same thing.

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.630
You tell us the information
that we need to render it.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.690
And then, the benefit, of
course, Interactive Post

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:48.510
button shows up.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.000
User's share, gets those
conversations going, triggers

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.800
those 3x interaction rates.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.610
Let's go onto one more way
that we give you, as an

00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.890
application developer, a way to
get the information, about

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.220
how people are using your app,
into Google, in a way that's

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.580
useful to users and therefore
useful to you.

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:09.170
Again, you saw this
in the demo.

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:10.520
I searched for Fandango.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.550
And I saw, not only information
about Fandango in

00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.830
general, I saw information about
how people, people using

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:20.050
Google+ and Fandango,
are using Fandango.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.200
And in this case, I could see,
here's the information about

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:25.740
what's popular with
Google+ users who

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.500
are also using Fandango.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.130
You cans see what the movies
are that they have been

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.080
watching trailers of, recently,
can see a little

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.000
metadata about it.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.730
And I can see a way
to click into it.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.230
So how did this happen?

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:40.790
How is it that Google now
knows enough, about what

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.350
people are doing on Fandango,
to be able to make Search

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.070
results better?

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:49.890
And what Fandango did, in their
application, is they put

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:51.262
a little bit of code in.

00:15:51.262 --> 00:15:53.130
Again, short version
is, they told us.

00:15:53.130 --> 00:15:53.800
How did we know?

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.520
They told us.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.570
Well, how did they tell us?

00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.810
They specified the
user action.

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:01.810
We have a predefined vocabulary
of about a dozen

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:05.110
different actions, so far,
that's covered many dozens

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.760
worth of partner integrations,
so we're happy with what we're

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.200
finding with the initial.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.510
They said, in this case,
it's someone

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.640
has discovered something.

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:13.890
What did they discover?

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:16.030
There's the URL to the movie
they've discovered.

00:16:16.030 --> 00:16:18.700
And then there's just a call
at the bottom that says, go

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.460
ahead and make this API call
to write this activity-- we

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.620
call it a moment, internally--

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.350
to Google.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:27.790
And that's it.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:30.730
One more thing I'll point out,
that came before all this, is

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:32.960
you noticed, when Seth went
through the flow, there was a

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.310
permission dialog, where we said
to the user, hey, is it

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:39.250
OK if Fandango, if Open Table
writes information to Google?

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:40.450
The user said, yes.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:42.300
The user decided who
could see it.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.250
You, as a developer, don't
have to worry about that.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.720
What yo know is that the user
has already said, it's OK for

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.310
you to tell Google, here's
what happened.

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.880
And then it's between us and
the user to use that

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.120
information correctly and wisely
and in a way that's

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:01.370
value, both to the person doing
the activity and to the

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.020
other people who might
care about it.

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.660
So we just talked about four
different features for getting

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:11.010
information, from your app, from
your site, into Google.

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:14.700
Let's talk about four features
that go the other way and get

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:19.170
information and services, from
Google, to help make your app,

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:21.102
make your site better.

00:17:21.102 --> 00:17:23.780
I'm going to start with
the absolute basics.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.369
You can't do anything with the
user if you don't know who the

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:27.300
user is, right?

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:30.160
You can't provide a better
experience without knowing who

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.360
you are providing the
experience for.

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.920
So you've seen this.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.080
I think you probably couldn't
get off the escalator, you

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.645
couldn't use the Google I/O app
without seeing the Sign-In

00:17:38.645 --> 00:17:40.340
with Google button.

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.900
And you see it's really
easy as a user.

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.620
You click the button.

00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:43.580
And you're in.

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:47.030
So what did the app developer
need to do?

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:49.390
What did Open Table need
to do to put that

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:50.980
button on their site?

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.290
Well, you're going to see, it's
a very familiar pattern.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.320
They still had that one
line of JavaScript.

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.360
They still put in one piece
of markup that said,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.850
hey, I want a button.

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.570
In this case, the button,
instead of being a g dash

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:05.190
interactive post button, is
a g dash sign-in button.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:07.970
And again, you provide just
enough information for Google

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.730
to do the right thing
with that sign-in.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.240
So what information do
you need to provide?

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.430
Well, you need to tell us,
first line there, that's

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.310
called scope, is you need to
say, what permissions are you

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:19.410
asking the user for?

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:22.340
You're asking the user to trust
you to access Google.

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.420
What trust are you asking for?

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:26.770
Simplest case is you just
say, you want to login.

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:30.210
Great, a lot of good integration
is done that way.

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:34.410
But because it's all one Google
and all one user, you

00:18:34.410 --> 00:18:36.430
get to ask for more
capabilities.

00:18:36.430 --> 00:18:39.740
So if, for example, you want
to also access your user's

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.370
calendars, just add another
scope saying, hey, may I touch

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.290
your calendar?

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.730
If you want to access their
YouTube channels, maybe help

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:48.345
them subscribe, just add another
scope saying, hey, may

00:18:48.345 --> 00:18:51.600
I access YouTube, may I access
your Drive, may I get your

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.310
email address?

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.810
All of what Google offers is all
available as an option for

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:01.580
you to ask your user, would you
like to let me do this,

00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:03.510
because I'm going to give
you better experience.

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.810
That's the scope, a few other
pieces of information, what's

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:08.590
the callback flow,
the mechanics of

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.810
actually making this work.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.530
But you put that markup on your
page, and we will render

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:15.140
a Sign-In button and
take it from there.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:18.130
And you'll get called back with
the permission token, the

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.680
authorization token that
you need to go ahead

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.050
and do deeper things.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.030
So that's the basics.

00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:26.976
First step, you have to
let the user sign-in.

00:19:26.976 --> 00:19:31.000
The next thing Seth showed you
is, well, after the user

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.160
signed in, we kind of magically
said, hey, user you

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.180
might want this app.

00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:36.430
Did you know, have an app?

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.895
Check it out.

00:19:36.895 --> 00:19:37.620
It's kind of cool.

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.640
And 40% of the users say, yes,
that's very interesting.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.720
Thank you.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.300
Why is that?

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.860
It's because it's in context.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:47.860
It's like I'm offering the user
something that we know is

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.660
relevant to them, right now.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.560
And that's why, not surprisingly
in hindsight, a

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.420
lot of people are saying
yes to it.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.650
So what extra work did you, as
a developer, have to do to

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:02.000
enable this second screen
in the sign-in flow?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.790
And you're going to have to
look pretty closely to see

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.570
what's different, because
not a lot is different.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.480
This is that same g dash
sign-in button.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.770
The one thing that's different
is, at the bottom, we said,

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.860
oh, by the way, here's
my Android app.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.510
And then there's some work, in
the console, where you set it

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:19.700
up to say, hey, I have a project
that actually has a

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:20.830
couple of pieces to it.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:23.780
But once you've set it up, all
you have to do is tell us

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:26.970
about it, and now we know that
it's Open Table, whether it's

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:30.450
opentable.com, Open Table on
Android, it's all the same

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.420
application.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:35.570
So it's a good time for me to
prompt the user to say, let's

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:36.270
install this app.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.560
And that's enough for us to find
in the Play Store and do

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.220
all the other pieces of
the plumbing needed.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:43.170
You add a line, we take
care of the rest.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.430
So this is actually the news
that we announced in the

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:51.340
keynote this morning.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:55.310
This is the freshest piece of
news that you're going to see

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.290
in this talk today.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:59.650
As you saw, what Seth
demonstrated, there was a

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:01.230
missing piece of UI.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:04.620
And there's a missing
piece of code here.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:07.770
So there's no code to support
the no UI that we demoed.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.720
So what is it that we
didn't show you?

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.850
Well, what we didn't show you
is, after Seth pulled out his

00:21:13.850 --> 00:21:17.770
phone, tapped on Open Table,
he didn't have to login.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.080
He didn't have to
say who he was.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.360
He didn't have to
type a password.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.260
He didn't have to do
anything else.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.600
Because why should I he?

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.570
He has already signed
into Open Table.

00:21:25.570 --> 00:21:27.580
And he's already told
his phone who he is.

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.900
That's enough.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:33.410
So how do you, as a developer,
enable that cross client

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:34.980
single sign-on?

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:37.870
And the answer is that console I
alluded to before, just tell

00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:39.750
us, tells us it's
the same app.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.420
So you've told us
your website.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.310
You've told us your app.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.260
You tell us that they're
the same thing.

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.310
And we take it from there.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:46.190
That is it.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:50.040
We will take care of both the
download option and the

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:53.300
seamless cross platform
sign-in.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:57.200
Last feature that I'm going to
drill a little bit into is

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.480
what you see here.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:01.180
We're on "Forbes." The user is
browsing the website, reading

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:01.820
an article.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.690
They're done with the article
and up came a teaser to say,

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.110
here are some other content, on
"Forbes", that you might be

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:08.160
interested in reading.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.060
They click through.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.480
They saw some content.

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.860
I'm going to take a chance
here and go back.

00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:13.250
That was fast.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:17.060
We'll see how far back I go.

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:18.510
Here I am reading it.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.900
I'm watching the-- yeah,
I'm getting the nod.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:24.150
So here I am on this site.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:26.500
I'm reading forbes.com
on my mobile

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.200
phone, reading an article.

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.260
Watch what happens when I'm done
reading the article and

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.480
start to scroll back up.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.510
Oh, bottom of the screen,
up opens this

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:36.340
recommendations tab .

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:37.170
I look through.

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:39.250
I find other content that's
interesting to me.

00:22:39.250 --> 00:22:40.080
I pick on it.

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.530
And now I'm reading more
content on "Forbes."

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.670
So this is something
we just announced

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:45.860
and launched on Monday.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.390
This is available
to all of you.

00:22:48.390 --> 00:22:50.190
What does it take to
implement this?

00:22:50.190 --> 00:22:52.250
We're adding a significant
new capability

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:53.300
to your mobile website.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:57.470
You've now added a whole, new
user exploration and browsing

00:22:57.470 --> 00:23:00.110
capability, built on a lot of
different signals about what

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:04.920
users are reading and what
common content is, relevant to

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.380
what other content, what are
other articles written by the

00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:08.900
author, using a whole
bunch of things?

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:11.490
How do you put that
onto your site?

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.870
The answer is, remember that one
line of JavaScript I keep

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:14.700
referring to?

00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.770
Just put it on your site.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.710
And there's a console where
you check a box

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.010
saying, yes, please.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:21.000
I want mobile content
recommendations.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:21.900
And you get them.

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.410
And we do the rest.

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.350
That same partner dinner, that
Seth was talking about last

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:28.460
night, we were talking to a
couple of developers, who are

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.830
kind of jet-lagged, because
they had just

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.320
flown in from Turkey.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:33.860
And before getting on the plane,
in Turkey, for their

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.220
flight to Google I/O, so they
could be in the Sandbox here,

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.890
they read about our
announcement.

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:40.330
And they said, oh, that
sounds pretty.

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.560
So they got off the plane.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.700
And they added mobile content
recommendations to their

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.430
website and had it done before
they got to their hotel.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.070
And that was what we were
hoping were the kind of

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:51.170
stories that we would hear.

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.000
And Tamindir, in Turkey,
now has mobile content

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.340
recommendations.

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.690
You have to read Turkish, on
your phone, to be able to

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:01.030
appreciate the quality of
the recommendations.

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:05.780
But that's how mobile content
recommendations work.

00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:09.990
So you just saw a medium
deep dive.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:12.900
I'm going to let Seth put a
little bit of context around

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:13.430
all of this.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:17.000
SETH STERNBERG: So as you guys
can see, at the beginning, we

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.430
said that the Google+ Platform
was really about connecting a

00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:24.750
user's Google experience with
your applications and letting

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.370
the user take the best of what
they're finding, inside your

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:29.640
applications, inside
your websites, and

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.790
bringing it back to Google.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:34.680
And now I think you can see some
of the features that are

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.440
really making this happen.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.840
So if we know, for example,
that a user is connecting,

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.720
with your application, on your
website, guardian.co.uk, and

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.530
we know that they have an
Android device, we can say to

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:49.790
that user, hey, do you
want the Android app?

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.850
Because the user is probably
really interested in your

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.390
Android app, because they're
choosing to connect with you.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:57.700
Or giving users, in your
application, an incredibly

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:01.630
rich way for them to share what
they're doing, right now

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:04.070
inside their application, and
asking their friends, at

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.670
Google, across all Google
properties, to join you.

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:11.230
If the friend's at Search, if
they're in Maps, no matter

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.160
where they are, YouTube, they
will see that notification and

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.740
click on it and see what their
friend wants them to do inside

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.190
your property.

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:22.810
So it's a seamless experience
for users.

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.970
And it's a seamless experience
for developers to make this

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:26.720
all a reality.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:30.320
And if you think about what
we're really trying to do, for

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:32.657
all of you, the developers,
other than, hopefully, to

00:25:32.657 --> 00:25:34.770
create something that's
really, really easy to

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:38.310
integrate and create a great
user experience, it's really

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:41.470
gets down to some of the core
business metrics that you guys

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.330
care about.

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:46.430
Every one of these features
is designed, in one way or

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:50.590
another, to either bring you
more users, help your content

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:54.490
get discovered across all Google
properties, in Maps, in

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:58.670
Search, on people's Android
phones, in Google+ stream, no

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.070
matter where people are in
Google, help them find more of

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:04.200
your content.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:08.650
And then what Google does best
is send people traffic that's

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:11.240
relevant and engaged.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.890
When someone clicks on that View
Menu button or Watch a

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:17.100
Video button or a read an
article or comment, they are

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.380
going to your mobile app or
they are going to your

00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:20.930
website, because they have
something that they

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.020
specifically want to do.

00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.030
They're very, very likely to
engage, because their friend

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:29.810
asked them to take a very
specific action.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:33.480
So a bunch of these features are
designed to bring you more

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.070
traffic from Google.

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:40.620
Another core goal is to drive
you more engagement inside

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.910
your mobile apps or inside
your websites.

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:48.690
We got asked, frequently, when
we launched-- on just Monday,

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:50.100
so just two days ago--

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:52.060
the mobile content
recommendations that you saw

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.620
from "Forbes."

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.150
And we got asked, why
did you launch it on

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:57.000
the mobile web first?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.850
And the answer is, we talked
to a lot of publishers.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:02.550
And we're finding out from them
the dynamics of their

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:03.660
businesses.

00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:07.370
And they told us, hey, our
number one problem for users

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:10.130
on mobile web is that
they bounce.

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.390
There's no engagement.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:14.335
They come in from the Google+
stream or a Twitter stream or

00:27:14.335 --> 00:27:15.680
a Facebook stream.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.410
They read one article for like
15 seconds, and they leave.

00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:21.120
And I never had a chance
to keep that

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.300
user inside my property.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.690
We knew mobile web was the
problem, because user's who

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:31.050
already had the Android app or
an iOS app, they stay longer.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.130
So we chose to solve the problem
for mobile web first,

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.880
where the developers and
publishers were having the

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.990
biggest pain point.

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:42.130
So features designed to drive
more engagement, more page

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:44.220
views, more time inside
your site.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.390
Or the seamless, single sign-on
that was announced at

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:52.520
I/O this morning, if you are
able to have a user connect

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:57.620
once, on you're desktop website
or on your mobile app,

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.600
because it works both ways.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.510
It goes from desktop web to
mobile, and it goes from

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.420
mobile back to desktop web.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.110
The user connects once, and you
now know who that user is

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:10.050
across your entire service.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.530
This is not about a user
connecting with you on mobile

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.230
and then, separately, you on
desktop, but rather it is you

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:20.050
forming a relationship with your
user and your service, no

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:21.720
matter what device they're on.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.780
And you can now give them
a completely relevant

00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:28.460
experience, which, hopefully,
enables you to drive more

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.530
engagement with that user, no
matter the property, and also

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:32.830
monetize better.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:35.410
Because you now know what a user
is more interested in,

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:36.540
your own statistics.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.580
You know what a user is doing
across your different

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.580
properties, so more page use.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.870
And then, finally, more
seamless, right?

00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:46.920
We were trying to create
a completely integrated

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.670
experience, for a user,
across mobile and

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.000
web, mobile and desktop.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.840
To users, they don't really
think, oh, I'm looking at CNN

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.570
on my Android.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.330
And then I'm looking
at CNN on my iPad.

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:02.980
And then, oh, it's
CNN on desktop.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.910
They just use CNN.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:08.020
They just use Fancy
or Beautylish.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.430
so to them, it's about
a relationship with

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:11.730
you and your service.

00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.700
And we're trying to enable
all of you to create that

00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.295
completely seamless experience
for the users.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.240
So we've been doing a lot.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.670
David's engineering team,
my product team have

00:29:24.670 --> 00:29:25.880
been very, very busy.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.290
A bunch of you are in
the audience, so

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.420
thank you very much.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.640
We launched Google+ Sign-In
two months ago,

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.320
at the end of February.

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.740
And if you look at the pace with
which we've issuing new

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:41.810
product updates and bringing new
capabilities to market, by

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:45.220
early April, Gigya and Janrain
made Google+ Sign-In

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.630
available, to thousands and
thousands of developers, to

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:52.440
integrate very simply with
their platforms.

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.820
And then we took the app
activities, that you're able

00:29:54.820 --> 00:29:57.290
to write us, when a user
connects with Google, inside

00:29:57.290 --> 00:30:01.960
your app, and began making
available in Search, first in

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.750
movies and in music, with
people like Fandango and

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:08.380
Slacker and Shazam.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:11.550
And of course, more vertical
is to come.

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:15.670
But get that social activity
into Search so we can provide

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.640
users a much more relevant,
engaging experience in Search

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.400
and drive you more engaged
users back to your

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.750
applications.

00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:25.650
And then we did the content
recommendations, just a few

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:29.550
days ago, driving more
traffic, driving more

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:32.230
engagement inside your mobile
websites, letting users

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:35.900
discover content they simply
would not have discovered.

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:38.740
Developers, publishers were
losing traffic in mobile web,

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:40.420
because users didn't
have a good way to

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:42.810
find interesting content.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:44.860
And so now we've created a way
for those users to find

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.520
something that's truly
interesting, truly special

00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.700
based on what the article is
about, that they're reading,

00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.730
or what their friends
have liked

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:53.520
inside that given property.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.840
And then, just today, seamless
authentication, user connects

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.240
on a mobile app, and when they
load your service on a web

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.520
browser, they are
just connected.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.760
And trust me, there
will be much more

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.270
to come very quickly.

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:11.060
We are going to stay very busy
to keep driving this

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.520
connection between Google and
the rest of the internet and,

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:18.020
hopefully, bring a lot of value
to both users and you,

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.880
the developers.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.590
So we're here at Google I/O.
This is an overhead shot of

00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:29.270
the Google+ Sandbox
that's out there.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:32.780
I very much invite you guys to
go see all the different

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.770
publishers and all the different
developers, that

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:39.220
have come to Google I/O, with
really stellar Google+

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:41.400
integrations.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.520
So there are over 50 developers,
outside, who had

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.660
various forms of interesting
integrations with Google+

00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.900
Sign-In, with content
recommendations, with

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.860
over-the-air installs,
interactive posts.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.750
Lots of different stuff is on
display there, which could,

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.330
hopefully, give you
some ideas.

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:01.810
I think it's about 20
developers, every day, that

00:32:01.810 --> 00:32:03.860
are going to cycle through,
through day one, day

00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:05.220
two, and day three.

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.810
So you'll have lots
to look at.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:08.990
If you come back tomorrow,
there'll be a new set of folks

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:10.470
to get inspiration from.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.910
I'd really invite you
to go take a look.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:15.190
A couple that I just thought
were pretty cool.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.100
So Air New Zealand is here.

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.890
And they have this, of course,
Google+ Sign-In integrated.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.390
And when you sign-in,
they've done

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:24.290
something a little special.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:27.680
It's send me your wish, which
we thought was just cute.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.340
So you see your friends,
right?

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.250
And you can send a wish
to your friends.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:37.160
And when you do that, you just
go ahead, select a friend,

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.810
type in a wish, it gets sent
to Air New Zealand.

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.670
And then, of course, you can
let people know about it.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:45.490
DAVID GLAZER: Seth,
you left off the

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:46.570
most important feature.

00:32:46.570 --> 00:32:47.880
You can also choose the fairy's

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:49.320
wardrobe from her closet.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:49.885
SETH STERNBERG: Really?

00:32:49.885 --> 00:32:50.900
That's good to know.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.010
I did not know that one.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:56.300
Or another one that we thought
was really neat, "Glamour." so

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.470
David pointed out that
you can get any

00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:59.560
Google permission here.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.440
So it happened really fast.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.400
But you can see that now I've
signed in to "Glamour," using

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:09.670
Google+ Sign-In, I'm actually,
already, subscribed to the

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.160
YouTube channel.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.790
Because one of the capabilities
that YouTube has

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.370
is to subscribe to their
channels through an API.

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:18.400
And that's one of many APIs
that you could ask for.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.350
Like David said, you could
have asked for access to

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.150
someone's calendar, to put
events on their calendar, or

00:33:23.150 --> 00:33:24.630
asked for access
to their Drive.

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:27.250
So this is a really great
example of someone going

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.740
beyond just the straight social
functionality and

00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.050
saying, hey, when someone
connects with us, since we

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.260
have an active YouTube channel,
we'd like to have

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:37.140
them subscribe to our YouTube
channel, too.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.060
And we thought that
was pretty neat.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.970
So we've got a lot of sessions,
that are going to be

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:46.710
happening over the next couple
of days, that are about the

00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:48.630
Google+ Platform.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.380
So this is day one.

00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.150
I encourage you guys
to take a look.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:56.290
It's in the I/O application as
well, where you can scan

00:33:56.290 --> 00:34:00.450
through, or on
developers.google.com/IO.

00:34:00.450 --> 00:34:01.810
So these are the day
one activities.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:05.050
And then there's a bunch of
activities on day two as well,

00:34:05.050 --> 00:34:07.340
all about how to really take
advantage of these features

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.389
that, hopefully, should be
there to both create an

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:14.159
awesome user experience inside
your properties and drive you

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:18.610
more unique users, more traffic,
more engagement, more

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:22.159
page views, and create a
seamless experience between

00:34:22.159 --> 00:34:23.429
mobile and web.

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:26.489
So with that, I think we have
a few minutes left.

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:29.150
And we'd love to take any
questions that you folks might

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:30.340
have from the audience.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.659
DAVID GLAZER: There are a
couple of microphones.

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:34.370
Please use them, because this
is also being live streamed.

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:38.460
There's also, for people who
are watching at some of the

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:41.090
remote events, there's a link
that, I'm told, you can see

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:43.590
Nexus stream, where can submit
questions online.

00:34:43.590 --> 00:34:46.513
And I've got that open if anyone
finds that channel and

00:34:46.513 --> 00:34:46.980
wants to use it.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.525
SETH STERNBERG: So go ahead.

00:34:48.525 --> 00:34:49.389
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:51.719
Tantek Celik from Mozilla.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.330
As part of the Google+ Platform,
do you guys have any

00:34:54.330 --> 00:34:58.210
plans to support any of the
social web standards, such as

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:03.180
PubSubHubbub, co-developed by
various Google folks, both for

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:07.160
subscribing to Google+ feeds
in realtime and being on

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:11.070
Google+ and being able to
subscribe to feeds, across the

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:13.440
web, in realtime?

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.740
DAVID GLAZER: We have
no immediate plans.

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.690
We've obviously looked very
closely at those standards.

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.850
We have people who helped
build those standards.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.090
You've been part of the
community that's helped define

00:35:23.090 --> 00:35:24.890
some of those standards.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:28.800
What we've looked at, with a lot
of aspects of Google+, is

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.830
really not just, on auto-pilot,
following the

00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:35.590
model that made sense before and
looking at each aspect of

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:38.390
sharing, each aspect of
relationships and saying,

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:41.500
which ones do we know we want to
replicate, which ones do we

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:44.180
know we want to do something
new and different on--

00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.060
I'll get concrete in a second--
and which ones do we

00:35:46.060 --> 00:35:48.220
not know yet, so we're
going to go slow?

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:51.280
So, for example, on the basic
relationship model, we knew

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.530
that we wanted to not follow
the standard model and

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.120
introduced the concept
of circles.

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.470
And we think that that has led
to a whole richer set of

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:01.850
engagement opportunities in the
product and therefore it

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:04.260
ripples into how the
platform works.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:10.400
Around the stream itself, we
have been watching how the

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.070
conversational environment
evolves inside Google+.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:16.130
And we really like the kinds
of conversations that are

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:17.410
fostered in there.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:22.000
And we are leery that, if we too
easily allow people to do

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.840
what could be perceived as
junk mail entering the

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:28.260
conversation or perceived as
fragmenting the conversation,

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:32.820
it would hurt the nature
of and the quality of.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:35.960
So that's why we've been going
very slowly around anything

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.150
that provides that kind of
stream access in either

00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:40.330
direction that you're
talking about.

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:41.510
There are some basic
things out there.

00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:43.040
I'm sure you know about them.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.650
We have a lot of partners who
are using those basic things.

00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:47.960
There's a car out there, where
you can watch your Google+

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.170
posts in the Mercedes.

00:36:50.170 --> 00:36:51.690
I think they're on
the third floor.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.360
They've put something
together.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.630
But nothing to say about the
specific standards that you

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.510
asked about.

00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:59.530
SETH STERNBERG: How about
the person in the back.

00:36:59.530 --> 00:37:01.940
AUDIENCE: Sure, I love the
automated app install on my

00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:02.590
Android phone.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:04.010
Is there anything you
can do to make it

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:05.270
automated on an iPad?

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.670
Or is that Apple's decision?

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.460
And then the unrelated follow-up
is, my main problem

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.100
with sharing things on Google+
is none of my friends know to

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.460
click that red box in the upper
right-hand corner of

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.350
their toolbar.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:18.850
Is there any kind of more
obvious way you could make

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:22.120
that, if you just sent this
right into their email?

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:26.420
SETH STERNBERG: So to your
second question, the

00:37:26.420 --> 00:37:31.280
notifications that
go into Google.

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:36.160
So a point I made is, the
Google+ Platform is very much

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:39.860
about connecting a user with
their entire Google

00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:42.840
experience, across all the
properties, with your

00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:43.650
applications.

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:46.490
And you've seen lots of features
from Android, to

00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:49.800
Search, to Maps.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:52.900
Those notifications are one of
the things that we actually

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.030
find users click on quite
a fair amount.

00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:59.550
Now one thing to note, as a
developer, is we're very

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.170
careful with the
notifications.

00:38:01.170 --> 00:38:04.430
We've heard from users, when we
were creating the sharing

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:08.370
features with the Google+
Platform, that users did not--

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.410
they were almost scared--

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.990
of spamming friends.

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:13.400
They really don't want
to spam friends.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.940
But when they do want to share
to friends, they want to make

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.300
absolutely certain that
their friends are

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.730
going to see something.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.940
And so the way we've designed
the notifications is that, if

00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:26.150
someone's specific name
is called out in

00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:27.390
that sharing box--

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:30.010
which actually, as a developer,
if you've pulled

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:35.290
down the user's friends list,
you now have my list of people

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:39.780
in my circles, you can, even in
your own UI, let me select

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.550
friends, and then choose
to prepopulate--

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.120
I think it's up to 10 names--

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.450
inside that box, individually.

00:38:45.450 --> 00:38:49.490
And then those notifications
will trigger.

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.730
Just on the basis of a circle,
the notifications won't

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:54.850
trigger, because we think
that that is too loud.

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:58.230
If I shared something with a
circle of 100 people, not all

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:01.260
100 people, probably, should
get that notification.

00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:04.890
But if I actually chose to call
someone specifically out,

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:06.070
that person should get
the notification.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.710
And not only will they get that
notification across every

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:11.620
Google property, they'll also
get an email, as long as they

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.530
haven't changed their
default settings.

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:19.510
So it's as close as we could
get to guaranteed delivery.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:23.140
DAVID GLAZER: It might be
they're just ignoring you.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:25.820
I did a test, with my family, a
little while ago, where I'd

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.950
been posting a fair number of
things and hearing a little

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.140
bit but some crickets back.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:33.280
So I did a sort of loud, caps
post saying, hey, could you

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.220
just let me know if
you get this?

00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:37.110
And they all said, oh
yeah, we get it.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:38.990
We just didn't have anything
to say to you before.

00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.673
So I was like, OK.

00:39:39.673 --> 00:39:43.120
SETH STERNBERG: To your second
question about iOS, so, as you

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.000
probably noticed, in the
story, throughout the

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.220
presentation, every feature that
we are launching Google+

00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:53.950
Platform is cross platform,
for Android, iOS, and web,

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:57.630
with the exception of the
really, super seamless

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:00.470
one-click install from
web to mobile.

00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:04.220
The only reason is because
we cannot do that on iOS.

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.420
We don't have quite the level
of access, in iOS, that we

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.870
would need to make that as
seamless as possible for

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:11.520
users, to create a good
user experience.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.470
If we could do it, we would.

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:14.700
But right now, we just can't.

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.180
So it's the one feature that,
unfortunately, we can't make

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.920
cross platform.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:20.750
Fire away.

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.890
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:23.190
This is Chris from Austria.

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:25.770
You mentioned a possibility to
connect the Android app with

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:28.820
the Google+ Sign-In button
on the website.

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.000
Is there any mechanism
or possibility

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.610
to specify two apps?

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:36.130
So I'm thinking multiple app
developers have a free version

00:40:36.130 --> 00:40:40.060
and a paid version or even
multiple apps, so is there any

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.510
mechanism for this?

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.212
DAVID GLAZER: Yeah.

00:40:44.212 --> 00:40:46.070
So we've looked at that.

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:47.290
We want to do that.

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:51.060
We want to do it once we're sure
that we have shut off the

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:55.210
abuse potential of an
ill-intentioned developer

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:57.710
using that in a bad way.

00:40:57.710 --> 00:41:02.080
And we think we know how to do
that, but until we're positive

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.340
that we can get that right and
handle all of that, we're

00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:05.680
going to go slowly there.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:09.120
So yeah, the use case you
described is a great use case.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:12.420
There's another use case, where
some developers have a

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.590
family of apps, where they've
chosen to provide three kinds

00:41:15.590 --> 00:41:18.310
of functionality as separate,
top-level apps.

00:41:18.310 --> 00:41:20.690
It's a fine pattern.

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:24.050
But we wanted to start, with the
one-to-one, which is what

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:26.400
you saw, which covers
the majority.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.860
SETH STERNBERG: How about
the person behind you?

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.530
I think he's been
waiting longer.

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:33.180
Yeah, on the front.

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:33.980
Yeah, mic.

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.090
AUDIENCE: John Blossom, Shore

00:41:35.090 --> 00:41:37.950
Communications and Content Nation.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:40.240
I enjoy using the service.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:42.840
One thing that you just did,
you activated comments in

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:46.070
Blogger, which is has been one
that's actually made me want

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:48.570
to blog for the first
time in a long time.

00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:50.640
Because I know that my community
will come with me

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.340
and stay engaged
in the content.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:56.470
What's the roadmap for exposing
that to mainstream

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:58.360
publishers, who may be
interested in that sort of

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.330
engagement?

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:01.770
Are you getting feedback that
they are, in fact, interested

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.840
in it, on services such
as Huff Post?

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:09.090
Question two, as long as I
waited, it's a pain in the

00:42:09.090 --> 00:42:14.310
butt, if you want to expose your
content to the public,

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:17.730
and you have specific circles
you don't want to receive it.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.450
Like my dad really doesn't want
to hear about everything

00:42:20.450 --> 00:42:22.440
that I do in my professional
life.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.400
Public goes to him anyway,
regardless.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.730
Is that ever going to change?

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:28.185
So two things, thank you.

00:42:28.185 --> 00:42:29.690
SETH STERNBERG: Great
question.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:33.870
In terms of the second
question,

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:35.390
it's not on the roadmap.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:38.030
So, right now, if you
do choose public,

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.050
that does go to everybody.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:43.330
Obviously, circles were designed
to let you decide

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:47.000
what to share with very
specific people.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.760
I've actually not heard that
request before but duly noted.

00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:55.240
For the second, so like you
said, we just put out comments

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.190
in Blogger.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:43:00.580
It was our first shot at making
comments really great

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:04.030
and crossing them between the
conversation that's happening

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:07.990
on Google+, on a given topic,
and putting that into Blogger

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.120
and making it available there.

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:14.640
We've seen interesting demand
and even a few hacks out in

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:17.680
market, trying to take those
comments, that commenting

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.010
system, from Blogger, and bring
it into other sites.

00:43:21.010 --> 00:43:23.965
But we don't have anything that
we could announce on that

00:43:23.965 --> 00:43:24.430
at present.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.120
DAVID GLAZER: Is it something
that you'd be interested in

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.710
using on sites you manage
or sites you visit?

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.170
AUDIENCE: I think that
a lot of folks would.

00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:35.700
I'm using it on my sites now,
because I'm using a blogging

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.260
mechanism within our site.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:40.370
Just look at what happened, say,
on the "Huffington Post".

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:42.150
People have options there.

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.970
They can Facebook.

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:43.550
They can Twitter.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:46.450
At minimum, there should
be an x to be able to

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:47.740
say that it's Google+.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:50.750
But it seems like what you're
saying is, you're creating the

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:53.500
ability for them to create
engagement much more

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.710
efficiently, with all these
other things surrounding the

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:57.210
commenting mechanism.

00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:00.200
So this could be icing on
the cake, it seems.

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:00.590
DAVID GLAZER: Thank you.

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:01.946
SETH STERNBERG: Thanks.

00:44:01.946 --> 00:44:02.880
Go ahead.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:04.670
AUDIENCE: You talked earlier
about plus naming for

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:05.700
notifications.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.210
I'm wondering what's
the upper limit?

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:07.500
SETH STERNBERG: Sorry.

00:44:07.500 --> 00:44:07.840
Could you start again?

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.230
I couldn't hear you at first.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.740
AUDIENCE: You talked earlier
about plus naming for

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:11.800
notifications.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.830
I'm wondering, what's the upper
limit for the number of

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:17.320
people you can plus name
in a post, to get those

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.400
notifications, that prevents my
users from getting 10,000

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.850
emails with 10,000 other
people's names in them?

00:44:23.850 --> 00:44:25.820
SETH STERNBERG: Right now,
I believe it's set at 10.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:30.070
So you can do up to 10 names,
specifically called out inside

00:44:30.070 --> 00:44:34.430
a share box, which you
can pass into it.

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:37.520
So if you built your own UI to
let a user select names, you

00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:38.630
can pass that in.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:41.070
The user will then see
the share box.

00:44:41.070 --> 00:44:43.430
And they'll see those
names listed out.

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:46.150
So we made sure that users
would know exactly what's

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:48.950
happening at each step.

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:49.820
But right now it's 10.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.220
DAVID GLAZER: And the intent
behind that is we're trying

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.260
to, again, match real world
conversations, where there is

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:58.470
a mode of, I want to talk, very
directly, to three or

00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.140
four people.

00:44:59.140 --> 00:45:00.880
And it's probably very
important to me

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:01.520
that they hear it.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.930
And they probably
want to hear it.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:06.240
It's unlikely I want to start an
intimate conversation with

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.970
97 people at once.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:11.060
It's possible, but that's not
the case we optimized for.

00:45:11.060 --> 00:45:12.980
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.690
AUDIENCE: Jonathan Frankel,
School of Rock.

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.250
This might be a little bit
outside of the scope of what

00:45:17.250 --> 00:45:17.920
you're talking about.

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:21.790
But we're really interested in,
if you have any plans, and

00:45:21.790 --> 00:45:25.360
if you do have any plans are you
willing to share plans, to

00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:29.020
allow for some enterprise
control of Google+ accounts?

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:30.270
SETH STERNBERG: Sorry,
enterprise control?

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:31.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:34.940
So right now, we can
provision accounts.

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.390
In the cPanel obviously,
we can enable

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:40.660
Google+ for the accounts.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.520
But we don't have any
direct control

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.870
over the Google+ accounts.

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:49.230
They're kind of connected to
but, I guess, separate from

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:53.245
the Google account
that we control.

00:45:53.245 --> 00:45:55.690
And I think it would be
really useful for us.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.330
It seems like we could create
a community, which would be

00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:00.050
very useful for us, if we
just had a little bit

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:02.810
more top-down control.

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:04.470
DAVID GLAZER: There's work
happening there.

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:06.890
I don't know their
exact roadmap.

00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:09.560
But if you come find me
afterwards, I can get your

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.490
contact info and put you in
touch with the product

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:14.610
manager, who's working
to do that.

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:17.370
What we find is that, if we look
at the world of all the

00:46:17.370 --> 00:46:20.590
people using Google apps, in
their domain, there's a set of

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:23.810
requirements that we have
done that satisfy a

00:46:23.810 --> 00:46:24.970
chunk of the pie.

00:46:24.970 --> 00:46:27.820
And then there's a richer set of
requirements, before we can

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:30.360
get at the next set, to
say, yes, this works

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:31.580
for me and so on.

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.320
And we're just working our
way through that list.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:35.230
I don't know where your
requirements would fit.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.590
But I can connect you.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:41.531
SETH STERNBERG: I guess we'll
take the last question.

00:46:41.531 --> 00:46:44.226
AUDIENCE: Allen Firstenberg.

00:46:44.226 --> 00:46:48.730
Can you elaborate a little bit
on, if and how, the Google+

00:46:48.730 --> 00:46:50.710
Moments are going to be
integrating, in any way, with

00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:53.370
the Game Center?

00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:56.860
SETH STERNBERG: So when we
first announced Google+

00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:59.340
Sign-In, we talked about app
activities, or you're

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:00.730
referring to them as Moments.

00:47:00.730 --> 00:47:03.290
So just to make sure that
everybody is on the same page,

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:07.280
that's how you, as a developer
or publisher, can let us know

00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.990
what users are doing
inside your apps.

00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:14.160
Now we want to take that data
and put it in the most

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.510
interesting, most contextually
relevant place for our users.

00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:22.640
What we're not particularly
interested in is only throwing

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.550
them at people on that kind
of timeline basis.

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:29.700
Because if you read an article
about Costa Rica, right now, I

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.280
don't really care.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.610
But if I start doing a search
for Costa Rica, what my friend

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:38.170
has written on, on Costa Rica,
commented on, on Costa Rica,

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:41.390
read about Costa Rica,
I probably care.

00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:44.480
Or if I'm doing a Map search
for Costa Rica or San Jose,

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.250
Costa Rica, I probably
care then.

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:50.900
So we want to take this
information and use it in

00:47:50.900 --> 00:47:54.310
context, which should be a
better user experience and

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:57.630
send you all, as developers and
publishers, more qualified

00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:59.010
traffic back.

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:02.220
The first place we launched it
was on people's profiles.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.720
So if I went specifically to
your profile and you said,

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.730
yes, I get access to that,
because I'm in a circle that

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.610
you've named, then
I can see it.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.040
And we're not spamming
it at people.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.340
But if I'm interested in what
you're doing, I can go see

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.380
what you've done
in a given app.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:19.120
The second place that
we publicly talked

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.920
about was in Search.

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:25.350
And you saw us launch movies
and music verticals, into

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:27.980
Search, using that same data.

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.340
What I can certainly promise you
is that you will continue

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:33.950
to see the same kind of data
roll throughout other Google

00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:35.340
properties, where
it makes sense.

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:38.370
The way we think about it is
that users have very specific

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:43.330
intents as they use Maps versus
Search versus Play, as

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:45.280
you mentioned, versus
the Google+ stream.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.305
And we want to make sure that
we're doing a great job giving

00:48:48.305 --> 00:48:50.620
the users exactly what they
would want, based on the

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.830
reason they're using a given
product, as we think about

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:56.600
rolling that data
across Google.

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:57.810
So thank you all very much.

00:48:57.810 --> 00:48:58.680
I really appreciate it.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:02.135
Please do stop by all the
developers booths outside in

00:49:02.135 --> 00:49:03.190
the Sandbox.

00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:04.720
DAVID GLAZER: Try out the
new feedback mechanism.

00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:06.720
Love to hear what you think,
so we can tune

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:07.630
this up for next time.

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.120
And check the Sandbox, check the
other talks if you want to

00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.350
go deeper on any of the things
we talked about.

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:14.600
That's where you'll find
the deep dives.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.280
Thank you.

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.830
SETH STERNBERG: Thank you all
