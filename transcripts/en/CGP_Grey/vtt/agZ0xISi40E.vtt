00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.300
Hello, I stumbled upon the EU's secret negotiation plan in the form of this slide

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.260
presented by the chief EU negotiator at the European Council.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.080
This slide is amazing and I want to talk to you about it.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:18.240
So, since the Brexit breakup the EU and the UK have been trying unsuccessfully to broker a deal,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.340
and this slide makes it painfully clear why that has made such little progress over such a long time.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.240
It started with brexit where the UK voted to leave the European Union;

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.640
now, what that means isn't exactly clear because the EU has a core center

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.660
but it also has many orbits of relationships.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.660
So, the EU and the UK needed to figure out where they were as a couple

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.480
and the UK has a list of deal-breakers that, at least at time of recording, are non-negotiable-

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.360
and that's fine! Everyone has relationship deal-breakers. It would be unhealthy not to.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.740
Anyway, core no more

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.300
the EU's next closest relationships are with Norway Iceland and Liechtenstein

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.360
as part of the European Economic Area.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.420
This is a kind of "EU Light"

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.340
They're part of the unified EU economy with the EU's four freedoms:

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.240
Free movement of goods, free movement of services, free movement of capital, and free movement of people

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.240
So, as an Irish citizen, since Ireland is "Core EU",

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.360
I could go live in a cabin in Norway, even though they're not Core EU

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.520
because of the free movement of people and vice versa

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.940
Now for the UK free movement to people is a huge deal

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.220
Shut it down – deal-breaker

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.200
This makes an EEA style relationship. Just impossible

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.360
So the next relationship orbital out is Switzerland who has a unique relationship with the EU

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.140
She's not EU core,

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.900
she's also not in the EEA,

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.420
and she is completely landlocked by EU core members

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.440
(I mean except for Liechtenstein)

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.980
So perhaps inevitably despite not being part of the EU in any way

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.920
she has over a hundred bilateral treaties with the EU

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.620
integrating their economies

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.980
which means that Switzerland has given up complete regulatory autonomy on goods and services to facilitate trade

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.240
This is also a deal breaker.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.240
Switzerland's treaties grant freedom of movement– deal-breaker

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.280
–and Switzerland makes significant financial contributions to the EU– deal breaker.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.220
These two things are also part of the EEA

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.560
So while Switzerland isn't an EU member, in fact, she is

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.980
basically in practice, but also, like the EEA members,

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.300
lacks representation in the Parliament of EU Core

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.960
So, Switzerland's relationship with the EU is also not one that the UK wants to emulate

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.600
this now moves us to the outermost orbitals

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.459
and we get into the really deep asterisks of European Union foreign relationships

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.640
This is stuff like the European Eastern Partnership and the deep and comprehensive trade agreements

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.620
Which sounds like political dirty talk

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.600
or the European neighbourhood policy.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.640
a lot of the aims of these things is to bring neighbours more in line with Europe

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.660
either with what the EU politely calls "The Promotion of Human Rights" or trade integration

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.880
but both of these bring up the final deal breakers for the UK

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.180
taking Ukraine as an example, while not remotely in EU member or even close,

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.220
she has agreed to let the European Court of Justice have some jurisdictional power in her borders

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.160
This is required by the EU for Ukrainian participation in Interpol

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.100
A kind of FBI for the EU that works on cross-border crime. Nonetheless European Court of Justice

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.280
jurisdiction does mean giving up some sovereignty on some issues

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.780
and that's a deal breaker or take Turkey who can participate in trade negotiations under the aegis of the EU

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:35.520
Presumably to benefit from the trading power a large bloc has but this means Turkey doesn't have complete independence in matters of trade policy

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.410
Deal-breaker and so now we've passed the outermost orbital. Where a

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.999
relationship even means anything and so end up in an inevitable no deal with the EU and UK's relationship being just

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.549
regular countries to each other in the World Trade Organization

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.279
Membership of which is basically every country on Earth

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.250
So the progress from EU core out to No

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.849
Deal is what this slide is showing: why the EU

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:07.590
thinks that path is the only path but the UK has been saying very loudly she wants to deal while also saying brexit means brexit

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:15.119
She wants independence but also wants a relationship that's deeper and more comprehensive with the EU than just the cold

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.920
WTO rules, but for the EU it's

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.180
impossible to see how to satisfy those desires contradictory without triggering the UK safeword

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.800
Which is probably why this EU negotiation strategy slide wasn't a secret

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.640
but was published back in December of 2017

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.680
by the lead negotiator in front of the heads of state because this isn't a secret strategy

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.870
It's a clear illustration of the mechanistic results of all of the UK's deal-breakers

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:48.749
I really do think this is a pretty amazing infographic in terms of clarity for a horrifically

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.549
complicated topic which is why I just had to make this footnote to share it with you because

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.349
I could not bear to let it fade away into my notes as just part of the background reading

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.010
anyway

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:05.010
that is why the brexit timeline has been so long with so little happening the UK has mutually

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.510
exclusive wants as also discussed in the main video in a different area and

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.670
It's really all down to the UK

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.580
She could stick with the deal-breakers and go it alone

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.430
Or she can drop some and settle in an orbital relationship with the EU, but she can't have both I guess

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.920
We'll see what happens soon

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.620
maybe
