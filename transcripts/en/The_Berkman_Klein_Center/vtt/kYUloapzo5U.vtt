00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.700
 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.690
Hello, I'm Terry Fisher.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.320
This is the last in a series of 12
lectures on the subject of copyright.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.000
I'll be discussing today the
remedies that the law makes

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.430
available for copyright infringement.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.900
As usual, I will concentrate on
copyright law in the United States,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.150
but will also identify some ways
in which the law in other countries

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.030
differs from that in the United States,
and some ways in which all countries

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.870
are now constrained by
multilateral copyright treaties.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.220
Also as usual, the lecture
will be accompanied

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.080
by various audiovisual materials, which
include maps of copyright doctrine

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.100
and copyright theory.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.980
The current versions of which may
be downloaded from my home page.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.630
The address of which is tfisher.org.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.640
 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.300
There are three types of remedy
for copyright infringement--

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.230
equitable, legal, and criminal.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.930
The first two types are available to the
prevailing plaintiffs in civil suits.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.530
In other words, a copyright
owner who, in a civil lawsuit,

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.210
successfully demonstrates that a
defendant has engaged in copyright

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.950
infringement may attain either or
both equitable or legal remedies.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.310
In addition, a person who engages in
some types of copyright infringement

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.110
may be prosecuted by the
government and, if convicted,

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.420
subjected to criminal sanctions.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.080
The three segments of this lecture will
examine these three types of remedy

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.580
in sequence.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.250
 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.350
The primary form of equitable
relief consists of injunctions.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.960
Injunctions are orders by courts
directing someone to do something

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.100
or, more commonly, to
stop doing something.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.880
In copyright suits, by far the
most common type of injunction

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.660
is an instruction to the defendant
to cease engaging in the behavior

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.870
that a court has deemed
to be infringing.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.170
Statutory authority for the
issuance of such injunctions

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.260
is contained in section
502 of the copyright

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.990
statute, which is set
forth on your screen.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.050
As you can see, section 502 provides
that "any court having jurisdiction

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.810
of a civil action
arising under this title

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.900
may grant temporary and final
injunctions on such terms

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.030
as it may deem reasonable to prevent or
restrain infringement of a copyright."

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.360
Note the reference to "temporary
and final injunctions."

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.870
Those adjectives allude
to the fact that there

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.900
are, in the American
legal system, two species

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.480
of injections-- permanent injunctions
and so-called preliminary injunctions.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.670
Permanent injunctions,
as their name suggests,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.910
are typically issued at the conclusion
of a copyright infringement suit.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.960
Preliminary injunctions,
as their name suggests,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.000
are issued by a court before
the conclusion of the suit--

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.860
often long before the
conclusion of the suit--

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.960
when it becomes apparent that the
defendant will likely in the end lose,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.670
and that allowing the defendant's
behavior to continue in the meantime

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.880
would cause the
plaintiff serious injury.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.920
The principals governing when
it's appropriate for courts

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.140
to issue either of these
two types of injunction

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.344
are set forth on your screen.

00:03:34.344 --> 00:03:37.510
These principles were not developed in
the context of copyright infringement

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.610
lawsuits.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.010
Rather, they were
developed by the courts--

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.950
specifically by the federal courts--
to govern equitable relief in general.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.110
As you can see, the traditional
rule was that a plaintiff, in order

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.150
to obtain a permanent
injunction, must show--

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.470
first, that she has suffered
an irreparable injury;

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.480
second, that the monetary damages
would be inadequate to compensate her

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.960
for that injury; third, that she
would suffer more serious hardship

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.230
if an injunction were denied than would
the defendant if an injunction were

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.840
granted; and finally, that
the public interest would not

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.538
be disserved by the
issuance of an injunction.

00:04:18.538 --> 00:04:20.829
The traditional rules governing
preliminary injunctions

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.630
were slightly different.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.140
To obtain one of these,
a plaintiff was obliged

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.750
to show-- first, that
she is likely to suffer

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.580
an irreparable injury if the
defendant's conduct continues;

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.310
second, that monetary damages would
be inadequate to compensate her

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.170
for that injury; third, that
the balance of hardships,

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.980
again, tilts in her favor; fourth,
that the public interest would not

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.310
be disturbed; and last but
not least, that she is likely,

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.650
at the conclusion of the lawsuit,
to succeed in demonstrating

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.230
the illegality of the
defendant's behavior.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.830
This last factor has the effect of
making judicial decisions concerning

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.810
the availability of
preliminary injunctive relief

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.310
into provisional assessments of the
merits of the plaintiff's claims.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.770
Although technically only provisional,
in practice such judgments

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.570
often terminate controversies.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.020
As I say, these principles
have long governed

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.230
the availability of
injunctive relief in general.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.190
By contrast, in copyright
lawsuits, until quite recently,

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.520
different standards obtained.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.910
Specifically, courts
in copyright suits were

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.130
more likely to grant either
preliminary or permanent injunctions

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.910
than in most other
kinds of controversies.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.410
Courts typically took the
position that a demonstration

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.910
by the plaintiff that she is likely to
succeed on the merits of a copyright

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.510
infringement suit gives rise to
a presumption of irreparable harm

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.170
sufficient to warrant issuance of a
preliminary or permanent injunction.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:06:01.420
As a result, granting injunctions to
prevailing plaintiffs was routine.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.540
To be sure, it was not automatic.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.130
On occasions, courts would deny
injunctions in special circumstances.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.870
The three most famous
instances in which courts

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.600
suggested that injunctions
should not invariably be granted

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.750
are listed on your screen.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.630
You may recall that in the
case of Stewart versus Abend,

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.840
the author of a short story granted a
license to make a motion picture based

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.140
on that story-- a license
that eventually ended up

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:33.080
in the hands of James Stewart
and Alfred Hitchcock--

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:38.980
and resulted, in their hands, in the
creation of the movie Rear Window.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.950
Unfortunately, both for the
author and for the movie makers,

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.670
the author of the short story died
before the end of his first 28 year

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.390
copyright term.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.690
And thus, he was unable
to renew the copyright.

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.690
Instead, his executor
renewed the copyright,

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:01.420
and then assigned it to a third
party who promptly brought suit

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.650
against Hitchcock and
his company, seeking

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.700
to enjoin future
performances of Rear Window

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.740
unless and until the defendants
obtained a new license.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.100
You'll recall, I hope, that the
Supreme Court eventually sided

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.910
with the plaintiff-- the
assignee of the renewal term.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.727
However, the Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

00:07:22.727 --> 00:07:24.560
took the position that
the plaintiff was not

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.610
necessarily entitled to an injunction.

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.980
Instead, in view of
the good faith reliance

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:34.410
by the filmmakers on
the original license,

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:38.610
a reasonable monetary award would be
more appropriate than an injunction.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:41.150
 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.680
Another special circumstance was
identified by the United States Supreme

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.120
Court in the Campbell case, which
I discussed in lecture number nine.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.380
You'll recall, I hope, that
the Supreme Court in that case

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.060
took the position that the defendant
who, without permission, prepares

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:03.500
a parody of a copyrighted work is likely
to prevail under the fair use doctrine.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.390
However, Justice Souter,
writing for the court,

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.470
suggested that parodist
would not always succeed.

00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:14.090
After taking into account all
four of the fair use factors,

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:20.090
a court might conclude that a particular
parody should not be deemed a fair use.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.359
In such circumstances, however,
Souter suggested, in dictum,

00:08:24.359 --> 00:08:26.400
that the defendant might
be permitted to continue

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.920
to distribute his or
her parody, provided

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:35.380
he or she paid the plaintiff
an appropriate damage award.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.929
Finally, in the Tasini case, the Supreme
Court suggested, again in dictum,

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:44.320
that injunctive relief could be
denied when it's issuance would

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.750
frustrate "the goals of copyright law."

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.630
The upshot, in short, is
that courts occasionally

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:57.020
rejected plaintiffs'
requests for injunctions.

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.710
In the overwhelming majority of
cases, however, prevailing plaintiffs

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:06.040
were deemed to be entitled
to injunctive relief.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.680
In 2006, the Supreme
Court decided a case

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.340
that changed this
landscape fundamentally.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.790
Until that date, most federal courts
had dealt with patent infringement suits

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.950
in much the same way they dealt
with copyright infringement suits--

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:26.440
granting injunctive relief nearly
automatically to prevailing plaintiffs.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.560
The Supreme Court, in eBay, declared
that that practice could not

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.480
be justified on the basis of the
language of the patent statute.

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.880
Henceforth, the court ruled
that traditional rules, which

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.340
I summarized a minute
ago, should be employed

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:45.750
to determine whether injunctive relief
was appropriate in patent cases.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.530
In particular, a plaintiff would have
to establish, among other things,

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:53.230
that the balance of
hardships tilted in her favor

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.600
and that the issuance of
an injunction would not

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.949
undermine the public interest.

00:09:58.949 --> 00:10:00.990
The opinion of the Supreme
Court in the eBay case

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.040
did not provide much guidance
concerning what adherence to those rules

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.790
would produce.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:11.680
However, two concurring
opinions in the case did so.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.700
Chief Justice Roberts, in an opinion
joined by justices Scalia and Ginsburg,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.430
suggested that in the
future federal courts,

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:22.410
when applying the traditional
rules governing equitable

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:25.980
relief to patent
disputes, should continue

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.600
to be somewhat more favorably disposed
to the issuance of injunctions

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.080
than in non-patent cases in light of
the traditional practice of granting

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.140
such injunctions nearly automatically.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:43.290
By contrast, Justice Kennedy, in an
opinion joined by justices Stevens,

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:46.630
Souter and Breyer, identified
three circumstances

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:51.660
in which, in their judgment, court
should be especially reluctant to issue

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:57.140
injunctions-- when the plaintiff is
a so-called non-practicing entity,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:01.210
sometimes referred to as a patent
troll; when the patent at issue

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:04.680
covers one component
of a complex product,

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.410
and thus issuance of an
injunction would give

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:09.430
the patentee disproportionate
bargaining power

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:13.820
when negotiating for a subsequent
license; and when the patent at issue

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.980
pertains to a method of doing
business, a context in which patent

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:23.260
protection, they believed,
is especially problematic.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.450
Although, as you can see,
Justice Kennedy was only

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.870
speaking for four
justices, his opinion has

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:30.300
proven to be influential in patent law.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.830
 

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:36.250
In the eBay decision, the
Supreme Court intimated

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:39.560
that the issuance of
injunctions in copyright cases

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.950
should be governed by
the same principles

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.820
that henceforth would govern the
issuance injunctions in patent cases.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.930
As one might expect,
given that clear signal,

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:57.690
most district courts in copyright cases
subsequently adopted the eBay approach.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:02.200
But a few continued to adhere to
the traditional practice, which,

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.750
as we've seen, strongly
favored plaintiffs.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:11.210
In 2010 and 2011, the influential Courts
of Appeals in the Second and Ninth

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.600
Circuits, removed any
remaining doubt concerning

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.950
the applicability of eBay to copyright.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.820
In the Salinger and Perfect
10 cases, those courts

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:26.190
ruled decisively that permanent
and preliminary injunctions

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:30.240
could be granted in copyright
cases only upon satisfaction

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.225
of the traditional multi-factor tests.

00:12:32.225 --> 00:12:35.030
 

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:37.800
So that's where things stand today.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.710
The net result is that it is
significantly harder nowadays

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:46.740
to obtain an injunction
than it was seven years ago.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:51.550
This shift likely seems to you
quite technical, and it is.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.210
But its impact is fundamental.

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:57.900
In the growing percentage of cases in
which prevailing copyright plaintiffs

00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.380
are denied injunctive relief
and are granted only damages,

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.710
the courts are, in effect, creating
compulsory licensing regimes

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.730
forcing, in other words,
copyright owners to accept

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:16.160
a governmentally determined license
fee in return for allowing defendants

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.680
to continue to engage in conduct
forbidden by copyright law.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.960
Plaintiffs who would prefer to charge
more, or to deny permission altogether,

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.460
have no choice but to accept the
amount of money selected by the court

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:35.110
and to tolerate the continuation
of the defendant's behavior.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.040
Twice, earlier in this
lecture series, we

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:41.320
have discussed the merits and demerits
of compulsory licensing systems.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.940
First, from the perspective
of welfare theory,

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:48.220
and then in the context of
public performance rights.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.550
At the time, we were primarily
concerned with compulsory licensing

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.090
systems that had been
created by statute.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:59.420
As we saw, such statutory
regimes now govern several uses

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:04.870
of copyrighted works-- for example,
covers of copyrighted songs,

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.060
retransmissions of signals
by cable television

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.890
or satellite systems, juke
boxes, derivative works based

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:18.740
upon the restored foreign
copyrights, and so forth.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.820
But judicially created
compulsory licenses

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.550
implicate many of the
same concerns that arise

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:28.460
in connection with statutory
compulsory licenses.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.810
I hope that you can see
how the eBay decision has

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:38.110
had the effect of sharply increasing
the set of such judicial compulsory

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:39.275
licenses.

00:14:39.275 --> 00:14:41.400
Whether that impact will
be socially and culturally

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:46.270
beneficial remains to be seen

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:49.570
This concludes our discussion
of equitable relief.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.930
After the break, I will examine
the even more complex set

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:58.470
of rules that determine the magnitude of
the monetary awards to which prevailing

00:14:58.470 --> 00:15:01.860
plaintiffs in civil suits are entitled.

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:02.934
