00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:08.080
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.110
I'm delighted to
welcome you here

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.730
to the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:12.320
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.580
I'm Dean of the
Institute, and I'm

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.460
glad to see such a
great crowd here today.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.070
I'd like to extend a special
welcome to a Harvard Advanced

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.600
Fiction Writing class who
is here with their teacher,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.450
Claire Messud, who
is also a novelist,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.520
well-known and
respected novelist,

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.810
and a former Radcliffe fellow.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.460
So where is that class?

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.750
There they are, great.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.580
Happy to have you here.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.530
This afternoon for
our annual Dean's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.820
Lecture in the Humanities, I
am delighted to have Viet Thanh

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.320
Nguyen, also a former Radcliffe
fellow, back at the Institute

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.610
to delve into the topic of
history, identity, politics,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.350
and the art of writing.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.240
Viet has set out quite an agenda
for us to contemplate together.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.600
After his talk, Viet will
engage in a conversation

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.020
with yet another distinguished
writer and former Radcliffe

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.940
fellow, Gish Jen.

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.950
I am grateful to both Viet and
Gish for joining us here today.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.440
As Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.770
Radcliffe fosters
interdisciplinary inquiry,

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.850
innovative research, and the
creation of art in many forms.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.540
We are also dedicated to sharing
that work with the public

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.670
through lectures, through
conferences, panel

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.400
discussions, and exhibitions.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.300
Today, we are fortunate to have
with us two writers whose work

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.360
demonstrates remarkable
breadth and depth,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.660
and who exemplify
the kind of boundary

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.780
crossing that we take
pride in at Radcliffe.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.480
Both Viet Thanh
Nguyen and Gish Jen

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.090
write fiction and nonfiction.

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.390
They are scholars and
artists, and they are just

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.910
as adept at scouring
the archives

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.910
as they are at mining their own
experiences and imaginations.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.000
Viet is a professor, a cultural
critic, and a fiction writer.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.460
He earned his PhD in
English from the University

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.140
of California at Berkeley.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.480
And he has spent
the last two decades

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.150
at the University of
Southern California

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.240
where he holds the
Arnold Chair of English

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.420
as well as professorships in the
Department of American Studies

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.380
and Ethnicity and the Department
of Comparative Literature.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.720
Viet also serves as a
member of the steering

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.390
committee of USC's Center
for Transpacific Studies.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.950
Viet is a critic-at-large
for the Los Angeles Times

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.610
and a contributing opinion
writer for The New York Times.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.960
His essays have appeared
in publications,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.040
including Time Magazine, The
Guardian, and The Atlantic.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.310
Viet is the author of Race
and Resistance, Literature

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.990
and Politics in Asian America.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.730
He is co-editor of the
anthology Transpacific Studies,

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.830
Framing an Emerging Field.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.110
And he is editor of a
forthcoming collection

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.250
of essays, The Displaced,
Refugee Writers on Refugee

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.690
Lives.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.350
Viet's debut novel
entitled The Sympathizer

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.340
won the Pulitzer Prize
for Fiction in 2016,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.700
and too many other
awards to list here.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.600
That same year, he published
the nonfiction book Nothing Ever

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.570
Dies, Vietnam and
the Memory of War,

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.570
which was a finalist for
the National Book Award.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.400
Then in 2017, Viet released
a critically acclaimed

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.900
short story collection
entitled The Refugees,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.880
and it received both a
Guggenheim Fellowship

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.760
and a MacArthur Genius Grant.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.490
I'd say that makes for a pretty
impressive couple years, Viet.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.230
And I wonder, do you ever sleep?

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.180
Joyce Carol Oates has
described Viet as,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.470
and I quote her, "one
of our great chroniclers

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.510
of displacement," end quote.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.760
It's a fitting characterization.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.390
Viet, who himself came
to the United States

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.930
as a refugee from Vietnam
at the age of four,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.510
has dedicated much
of his life's work

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.870
to probing how the Vietnam War
is remembered and represented

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.640
and to investigating the
experiences of those displaced

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.646
from that war.

00:04:21.646 --> 00:04:24.380
In Nothing Ever
Dies, Viet observes,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.040
and I quote, "all
wars are fought twice.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.460
The first time on the
battlefield and the second time

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.570
in memory," end quote.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:37.340
Much of his writing
interrogates that latter fight.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.830
He sheds light on aspects
of the Vietnam War's

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.830
social and political
history that might otherwise

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.320
have escaped critical analysis.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.810
That includes
collective remembrance

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.760
of the war in both the United
States and Southeast Asia

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.690
through forms of
popular culture,

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:57.080
such as literature,
film, and memorials.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.370
In doing so, Viet shows
us that memory is dynamic,

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.880
and that the way we
come to understand war

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.150
is shaped by ideology, by
individual and national

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.310
identity, by power structures,
and by the industries of war

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.990
and memory.

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.960
Viet grapples with these issues
using the distinctive lenses

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.980
of different kinds of writing,
the short story, the novel,

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.280
the essay, the op-ed, and more.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.980
With so much
nimbleness as a writer,

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.600
he strategically selects the
form best suited to his message

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.640
and to his audience.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.430
Viet's work, both
fiction and nonfiction,

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.520
captures the experiences
and the perspectives

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.370
of Vietnamese soldiers,
Vietnamese refugees,

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.260
and Vietnamese Americans.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.920
He develops the full
complexity of his characters

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.390
and his plotlines to
avoid exaggerated heroism

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.910
and simplistic motivation.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.780
In Viet's hands, people
are rendered with subtlety,

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.830
and the Vietnam War becomes
the multi-faceted, political,

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.970
cultural, and historical
confrontation between the US

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.790
and Vietnam that it truly was.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.690
Take as an example his debut
novel, The Sympathizer.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.840
The protagonist and
narrator in The Sympathizer

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.190
illustrates Viet's ability
to explore complex dualities

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.560
within a single individual.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.650
This nameless double
agent, undercover

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.140
as a South Vietnamese
Army captain,

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:35.160
flees Saigon and resettles
in Southern California.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:39.510
He is torn not only between his
covert mission and his cover

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.160
identity, but also between his
homeland and the United States,

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.280
between his French and
Vietnamese ancestries,

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.180
and between his position as
the betrayer and the betrayed.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.330
For Viet, these personal
dualities powerfully

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.930
illuminate larger complexities
of ethnic identity,

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.100
of war displacement, and
of the refugee experience.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.030
Gish Jen has explored closely
related aspects of identity,

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.100
culture, and history.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.500
In her novels and
short stories, she

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.620
has written about immigration
and the hyphenated American

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.200
experience, while
also challenging

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.920
what typically has been
characterized as ethnic writing

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.600
and what has not.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.380
Gish grew up as the child
of Chinese immigrant parents

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:27.930
and went on to graduate
from Radcliffe College

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.890
and to earn an MFA in fiction
writing at the Iowa Writers'

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.000
Workshop.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.820
She is a member of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences,

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:39.270
and she was the recipient of the
Academy's prestigious Mildred

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:44.070
and Harold Strauss Living Award
and many other top honors.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:47.010
Most recently, she
received a Legacy Award

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:50.990
from the Museum of Chinese
in America in New York.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:53.600
Gish was in residence
as a bunting fellow

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.780
here at Radcliffe when
she wrote her first novel,

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.370
Typical American.

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.470
She returned again.

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:03.605
This time, it was the Radcliffe
Institute in 2001- 2002

00:08:03.605 --> 00:08:07.340
to work on her third novel
entitled The Love Wife.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.790
And I was lucky enough to
be one of her fellow fellows

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.930
that year.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.230
Gish has authored two other
novels, Mona in the Promised

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.190
Land and World and Town, as well
as a short fiction collection

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.290
entitled Who's Irish?

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.450
Her short stories
have been anthologized

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.740
in many textbooks
and collections,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.860
including multiple
anthologies of the best

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.100
American short stories,
including, most notably,

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.760
The Best American Short
Stories of the Century.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.539
Recently, Gish has turned
her talents to nonfiction,

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:41.780
including Tiger Writing, Art,
Culture, and the Interdependent

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:46.550
Self, and just last year, The
Girl at the Baggage Claim,

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.360
Explaining the
East-West Culture Gap.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.750
In these books, Gish
brilliantly probes differences

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:56.930
in Western and Eastern
conceptions of self

00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.080
and their implications for
identity, family, and community

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:05.060
relationships, for
art, and for much more.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:09.030
I am thrilled to have both Viet
and Gish with us here today

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:12.990
in dialogue with one another
as two exceptional writers who

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:17.040
focus our attention in a very
nuanced way to both fiction

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.910
and nonfiction on compelling
issues of history, identity,

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.530
politics, and the
art of writing.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:27.380
So now, please join me in
warmly welcoming Viet Thanh

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:28.800
Nguyen to the podium.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:39.382
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:39.382 --> 00:09:42.420
- Thank you for that
incredible introduction, Liz.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:45.510
It's such an honor to be
here and a real pleasure

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.270
to be back here after
having been a fellow here

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.600
several years ago.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.300
And now, the most
important thing

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.415
I got to do, though,
before everything starts--

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.150
can't help it.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.870
I'm Asian.

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.299
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:03.090
I'm not going to actually
exhaustively talk

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.197
about history, identity,
politics, and so on.

00:10:05.197 --> 00:10:07.530
I'm really going to talk
about-- for just about 15 or 20

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:08.246
minutes--

00:10:08.246 --> 00:10:09.870
about how those things
have intersected

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.000
with writing and
with my life, and how

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.190
I've become a writer
and a scholar who

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:15.810
has tried to take
all those things

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.510
and work with them,
simultaneously.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.990
And the reason why history,
identity, and politics

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:23.880
have been so important
to me as a writer

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.330
is not simply because I'm Asian,
but because I'm a refugee.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:30.150
And the history of being
a refugee and the impact

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:32.850
of that experience on
my family and my life

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.090
has been something that
has marked me indelibly

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:37.560
from the moment that
my memory has begun.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.310
And my memories began as a
four-year-old coming here

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.160
to Fort Indiantown
Gap, Pennsylvania

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.500
as a refugee with my parents.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.860
And being separated from my
parents at four years of age

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.440
and being sent to live with
a white sponsor family,

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.170
that was the way to get
out of the refugee camp.

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.850
And so that's when
memory begins.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.880
And that's also when forgetting
begins as well for me,

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.500
because I spent much
of my life trying

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.460
to forget that experience
of separation and of trauma

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.320
and trying to forget what
it meant to lose a country.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.970
And then as a writer
and as a scholar,

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.540
I've been trying to remember
what those things mean for me.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.960
So I'll just start off with
the couple of first paragraphs

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.450
from this book,
Nothing Ever Dies.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.158
And I will tell you
a little bit about me

00:11:22.158 --> 00:11:26.130
and what I think of my work.

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:30.210
"I was born in Vietnam
but made in America.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:32.400
I count myself among
those Vietnamese

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.370
dismayed by America's
deeds but tempted

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.720
to believe in its words.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.430
I also count myself among those
Americans who often do not

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.800
know what to make
of Vietnam and want

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.710
to know what to make of it.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.740
Americans, as well as many
people the world over,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.010
tend to mistake Vietnam with
the war named in his honor,

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:55.980
or dishonor as the case may be.

00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:59.130
This confusion has no doubt led
to some of my own uncertainty

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:02.190
about what it means to be
a man with two countries

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.880
as well as the inheritor
of two revolutions.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.760
Today, the Vietnamese
and American revolutions

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.820
manufacture memories only
to absolve the hardening

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.500
of their arteries.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.240
For those of us who
consider ourselves

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.210
to be inheritors of one or
both of these revolutions,

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:23.550
we have to know how
we make memories

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.760
and how we forget them, so that
we can beat their hearts back

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.290
to life."

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:32.400
So for me, my journey
into being someone

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.350
who could write these
past three books

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.984
has been an intensely
personal journey.

00:12:35.984 --> 00:12:38.400
It's not only been a journey
as a writer and as a scholar,

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.740
but it's been as
someone who has never

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.180
been able to forget the
questions of history, identity,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.200
and of politics and
how to try to bring

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.710
all those things together in
the act of writing itself.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:51.600
And the reason why
it's personal is

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.180
because I was never
at a time in my life

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:58.620
when I wasn't being reminded
of history and of difference

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:00.550
in one way or another.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.290
So after we had settled in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.180
for about three
years, my parents

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.780
made the wonderful decision
to move to California.

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.789
And we settled in San
Jose, California in 1978,

00:13:12.789 --> 00:13:15.330
and my parents opened, perhaps,
the second Vietnamese grocery

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:17.640
store in San Jose, California.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.710
And we lived in
downtown San Jose.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.350
And downtown San Jose is
not like downtown San Jose

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.400
of today.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:26.930
Back then, it was a very rough
and violent neighborhood.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.730
And I remember walking down the
street from my parents' store

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.950
and seeing a sign in
another window that

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.380
said, another
American driven out

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.770
of business by the Vietnamese.

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.420
And I was, perhaps,
10 or 11 years old,

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.040
and that was one of
the things that I

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.170
both remembered and forgot.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:45.550
I put that away in my
memory for many years,

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.524
because I didn't know what
to make out of that sign.

00:13:48.524 --> 00:13:50.190
And I've spent many
years trying to make

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:52.530
sense of what that sign meant.

00:13:52.530 --> 00:13:54.990
And that sign, as
short as it was,

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.850
contained an entire epic
story about what America was,

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:01.980
who belonged to this
country, and the fact

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.667
that Vietnamese people
did not belong here.

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:06.750
And not just Vietnamese
people, but, obviously, it

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.306
was a matter of
fill in the blank.

00:14:08.306 --> 00:14:09.930
Another American
driven out of business

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:15.510
by fill in the blank, Chinese,
Japanese, Koreans, and so on.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:19.110
Well, what happened was that
the reason why my parents opened

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:21.640
this grocery store
in downtown San Jose

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:23.640
was because no one else
wanted to open a grocery

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.740
store in downtown San Jose.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.950
In the 1970s and the 1980s,
many of the businesses

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:33.150
that were opened were opened
by Vietnamese refugees.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:36.060
And the city didn't care
about downtown San Jose.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.880
Then something called
Silicon Valley happened,

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.980
and all of a sudden,
tax money started

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.710
to come in to San
Jose, California.

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:47.560
And in the early 2000s,
San Jose City Hall

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.460
thought, well, maybe we should
transform San Jose downtown

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.300
into something more worthy
of the Silicon Valley.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.240
So they decided to
build a new City Hall.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.630
Where do you think they decided
to put the new City Hall?

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:05.630
They built it right across the
street from my parents' store.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:07.430
Now, in order to
make that happen,

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:13.280
City Hall had to dispossess
many of these Vietnamese refugee

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.550
shopkeepers,
including my parents.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:20.240
And I thought for
many, many years

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.410
afterwards that what they did
was to raise my parents' store

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:27.060
and build a parking garage.

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:29.480
And this was a store in which
my parents had been working

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.510
12 to 14 hour days,
every day of the year,

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:36.080
except for Christmas,
Easter, and New Years.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.850
This was a store
in which my parents

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.660
were shot on Christmas Eve.

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:45.470
And to think that the city had
erased this business where they

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:53.960
had sacrificed themselves
and had erased their legacy

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:55.742
was very painful for me.

00:15:55.742 --> 00:15:57.200
So for many years,
whenever I would

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.750
return to downtown San
Jose, I would never actually

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.935
go to this location.

00:16:00.935 --> 00:16:02.810
I would always drive around it.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.310
Well, then something
else happened--

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.277
was that I won the
Pulitzer Prize.

00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:08.360
So then City Hall thought
it would be a great idea

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:12.290
to invite me back and
give me a commendation.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.195
And I thought,
great, I'll take it.

00:16:14.195 --> 00:16:16.070
I always take every
award that's given to me.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.510
But I'm going to
tell this story.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.750
And so I finally went
back to downtown San Jose,

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.570
to this location
where my parents had

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:27.090
shed their blood
and their tears,

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.690
and I realized there was
no parking garage there.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.267
There was a parking lot.

00:16:34.267 --> 00:16:36.350
And there's a line in The
Sympathizer where I say,

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:39.650
America's most original
contribution to architecture

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:42.620
is the parking lot.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:50.840
And I thought, this was
why I became a writer.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.600
It wasn't simply that
we had been erased

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.020
in some abstract way
from American history,

00:16:57.020 --> 00:16:59.450
or that we'd been erased
in an abstract way

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:01.840
from Vietnamese
history in Vietnam.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.210
We had been erased
in very concrete ways

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:10.700
in our own history here in
this country, my parents.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:15.619
And as I was growing up
in San Jose in the 1980s,

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:19.520
I knew that these stories
and these erasures

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.339
were enormously meaningful,
but I didn't have a way

00:17:22.339 --> 00:17:25.200
to give articulation to them.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.530
So for example, I
remember in the 1980s,

00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:29.660
there was something
called the VCR.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.580
And my parents bought a VCR.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.830
And because they were
working 12 to 14 hour days,

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.180
they used a VCR as a
way of babysitting me.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.390
So after I watched Star Wars
a dozen times, I went out,

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:43.520
and I got a movie
called Apocalypse Now.

00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.340
I was about 11 or 12 years old.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.500
I watched many
inappropriate things

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.060
when I was 11 or 12
years old on this VCR.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.710
And I was an American.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.330
I grew up feeling
that in my parents'

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:59.930
very Vietnamese household,
I was an American spying

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:02.015
on these Vietnamese people.

00:18:02.015 --> 00:18:03.890
And when I was outside
in the American world,

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:06.500
I was a Vietnamese spying
on these Americans.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:08.750
So when I was watching
Apocalypse Now,

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.570
I came to it as an American,
as an American boy who

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:14.600
loved American war
movies, and I identified

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.680
with American soldiers.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.800
And in this case, I identified
with the American soldiers up

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.460
until a point they started
killing Vietnamese civilians.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.370
And then I was split in two.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.860
Later, I would go to a
very elite high school

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.330
in San Jose that
was mostly white,

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.270
except for a handful of us
who were of Asian descent.

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.850
And we would gather
in a corner at lunch

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.718
and call ourselves
the Asian invasion.

00:18:37.718 --> 00:18:39.261
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:39.261 --> 00:18:40.760
At least it wasn't
the yellow peril.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:44.030
It wasn't until
I got to Berkeley

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.160
and became instantly
radicalized-- literally,

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.547
the moment I set foot on campus.

00:18:47.547 --> 00:18:49.130
But I learned that
there was something

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.800
called Asian Americans.

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.789
It's only a name, but
it's an entire story.

00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:54.830
It's an entire narrative.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.720
And it totally
transformed my sense

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.240
of who I was and my
place in American society

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:02.660
and the possibilities of me
being able to tell stories.

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.180
And one of the first
books that I encountered

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.610
when I stepped foot in
the city of Berkeley

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.710
was Amy Tan's Joy Luck Club.

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.200
And then just a
couple of years later,

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.960
I found Typical
American by Gish Jen.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.570
And these were momentous
events in the life of someone

00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:19.970
who had called himself
part of the Asian invasion.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:20.690
No.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.749
We were Asian Americans.

00:19:22.749 --> 00:19:25.040
And this is what I mean by
history, identity, politics,

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.150
and the art of writing.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.340
To become a writer, I
had to try to figure out

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.260
not just how to write
stories, but how

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:33.832
to talk about history, identity,
politics, simultaneously.

00:19:33.832 --> 00:19:35.540
And the challenge was
that these were not

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:40.280
things that were being taught
to us as budding writers.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.070
What was being taught to
us was the art of writing

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:44.315
and the beauty of literature.

00:19:44.315 --> 00:19:46.690
And there's no doubt that all
those things are important.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:50.252
That's why I became an English
major when I was at Berkeley.

00:19:50.252 --> 00:19:51.710
But there was no
way that I thought

00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:53.240
that I could become a writer.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.140
There was no way that
I thought I could

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.306
become an English professor.

00:19:55.306 --> 00:19:59.570
I would have to go home and tell
my parents who were working 12

00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:02.850
to 14 hour days,
hey, mom and dad,

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:06.120
I want to spend my life studying
Jane Austen and the Romantics.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.740
It wasn't going to work.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.430
It wasn't going to work.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:11.490
So encountering Asian
American literature

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:13.410
and becoming an ethnic
studies major as well

00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:15.720
were enormously
crucial to my sense

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:19.470
that writing stories
could also include

00:20:19.470 --> 00:20:22.460
the history, the identity,
the politics that

00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:26.840
were so fundamentally important
to me and that had shaped me.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.450
And I had set out
on a quest then

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:33.320
to try to figure out how to
put all these things together,

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.620
because it seemed
to me at that time

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.170
that the state of contemporary
American literature,

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.360
dominant contemporary
American literature,

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:47.040
wasn't that interested in
history, identity, or politics.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.890
And I was a writer
who wanted to try

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:52.050
to figure out how to do
these things simultaneously.

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.750
And I became a professor.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:56.600
And as a professor, you could
talk about history, identity,

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:58.160
and politics.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.270
But if you've read any recent
works of literary criticism

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.000
or cultural criticism, you'll
know that they're also not

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.160
about the art of writing.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.230
So part of my
challenge to become

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.410
a writer, my kind
of a writer, was

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:17.120
to be a writer who could be
both a novelist who could write

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.720
critical fiction, and a critic
who could write creatively

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.220
as well.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.510
And so that's how I came to
the book Nothing Ever Dies.

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.320
So I'm just going to
read you an excerpt

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.030
from this book that
talks about all

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:32.720
of these issues in a very,
hopefully, personal way

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.610
and about the memory,
the act of remembering

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:41.070
that is so crucial to that
book and to my life in general.

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:44.400
"As a Gook, in the
eyes of some, I

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.820
can testify that being
remembered as the other

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.790
is a dismembering
experience, what

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.790
we can call a disremembering.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:58.350
Disremembering is not simply
the failure to remember.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:02.820
Disremembering is the
unethical and paradoxical mode

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:07.260
of forgetting at the
same time as remembering,

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:11.400
or from the perspective of the
other who is disremembered,

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.110
of being simultaneously
seen and not seen.

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:21.430
Disremembering allows someone
to see right through the other,

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.040
an experience
rendered so memorably

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:27.320
by Ralph Ellison in the
opening pages of Invisible Man.

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.790
His narrator, the
titular hero, runs

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:32.850
into a white man who
refuses to see him,

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:38.060
and enraged, strikes back to
force the white man to see him.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.220
Even beaten, however,
the white man

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:44.630
refuses to see him the
way he wishes to be seen.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:47.420
That is because the other's
use of physical force

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:52.880
may make the other visible, but
only to turn him into a target.

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.340
The other must deploy
the psychic forces

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.630
of remembering,
imagining, and narrating

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.820
if the other wishes to
transform the ways of seeing.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.940
Not satisfied with
being disremembered,

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.600
we, who are others,
find that it is up to us

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.610
to remember ourselves.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:15.910
Having carried ourselves over
or been brought over from

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:21.710
the other side, we Gooks, we
goo-goos, we slopes, we dinks,

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:26.020
we zipperheads, we slant-eyes,
we yellow ones, we brown ones,

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:32.260
we Japs, we Chinks, we ragheads,
we sand niggers, we Orientals,

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:35.740
we who cannot be distinguished
between ourselves because we

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:38.280
all look alike--

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.430
we know that the
condition of our being

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:44.420
and our self-representation
is that we are both ourselves

00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.290
and others.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:50.150
We are never without identity
and never without ideology,

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.390
whether we like it or not,
whether we acknowledge it

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:54.560
or not.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.810
Those people who
believe themselves

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:59.750
to be beyond
identity and ideology

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:05.940
will, sooner or later, charge
us with identity and ideology

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:10.400
if we dare commit that most
unnatural act of speaking

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.360
up and speaking out."

00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:19.230
So my work as a scholar
and as a fiction writer

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:23.790
has been about trying to think
through identity and ideology,

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:25.650
simultaneously.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:28.810
This belief that we are
never without an identity,

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.620
even if we refuse to
acknowledge our identity,

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:35.790
and this belief that to be a
writer who believes in history,

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:37.680
identity, and
politics is to believe

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.070
in the act of writing as
an ideological act as well.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.350
That identity is important
but insufficient.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.600
That ideology is
critical but also

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.264
insufficient without
identity as well.

00:24:48.264 --> 00:24:50.430
And so I'll end with an
excerpt from The Sympathizer

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.560
where I try to bring
these things together

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.570
through the act of
fiction, because I

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.850
imagined the novel The
Sympathizer as a novel that

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:00.630
is about history and identity
and politics and writing,

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:05.230
and is a novel that is also
an act of criticism as well.

00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.142
Hopefully, you'll also have
some fun along the way.

00:25:08.142 --> 00:25:09.600
So for those of
you who don't know,

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.690
The Sympathizer is about a
communist spy in the South

00:25:12.690 --> 00:25:15.325
Vietnamese Army in April 1975.

00:25:15.325 --> 00:25:17.700
And his mission is to flee
with the remnants of that Army

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.360
to the United States where his
task is to spy on their efforts

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.070
to take their country back.

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:25.710
So in order to do that, he
has to become a refugee.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.570
And then one of the
things that he has to do

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:29.510
is survive in the United States.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.140
And one of the jobs
that he gets is

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:33.750
to become the
authenticity consultant

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:36.750
on the making of a movie
that looks suspiciously

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:38.190
like Apocalypse Now.

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:39.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:42.720
But if Francis Ford Coppola
or his lawyers are to ask,

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.720
it's not Apocalypse Now.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:44.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:46.090
And it really isn't.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.400
Apocalypse Now is an
easy target for me.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.090
But that really is an example of
what I mean by disremembering,

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:55.270
because it wasn't as if in
looking at that movie or any

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:57.270
of the American movies
about the Vietnam War--

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:59.290
of which there were dozens
in the '80s and '90s,

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.280
and I saw most of them,
which is an exercise I

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.070
recommend to nobody.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.880
In seeing them, it was clear
that the Vietnamese were not

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:07.900
invisible.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:09.670
We were totally there.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:10.870
We were seen.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.120
But we were seen
through, and that's

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.410
the act of disremembering.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.792
But it wasn't just
Apocalypse Now that did that.

00:26:16.792 --> 00:26:18.250
It was also all
these other movies.

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:21.250
And in this excerpt, the
movie is called The Hamlet,

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.110
and it really is a
compendium of all

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:27.130
of these-- this entire genre of
the American Vietnam War movie.

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.010
And the reason why I felt
it necessary to write

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:31.660
four chapters of
the novel about this

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.740
was that no matter where
I went in this world

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.970
and I told people I was
working on the Vietnam War,

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:37.450
sooner or later
someone would say,

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:40.270
have you seen Apocalypse Now?

00:26:40.270 --> 00:26:43.544
And they had never seen
a Vietnamese movie.

00:26:43.544 --> 00:26:45.210
And we're still dealing
with that today.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:46.959
Let me tell you, don't
ask me the question

00:26:46.959 --> 00:26:48.010
I'm about to give you.

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:51.750
In the last few months,
no matter where I went,

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.786
somebody would
inevitably ask me,

00:26:53.786 --> 00:26:58.870
have you seen that 18 hour
documentary on the Vietnam War?

00:26:58.870 --> 00:27:01.600
And guaranteed, they
had not read my book,

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.970
had not read any book by a
Vietnamese person, any book

00:27:03.970 --> 00:27:05.595
by a Vietnamese
American person and not

00:27:05.595 --> 00:27:07.180
see any movie from Vietnam.

00:27:07.180 --> 00:27:10.270
That's what we're up
against, seen and not seen

00:27:10.270 --> 00:27:11.850
all at the same time.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:15.280
And so here, I take my
revenge on that perspective.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.590
My narrator meets with the
famous director known only

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:20.660
as the Auteur.

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.360
"My meeting with the Auteur
had gone on for a while longer,

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.230
mostly in a more subdued
fashion with me pointing out

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:32.760
that the lack of speaking
parts for Vietnamese people

00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:36.830
in a movie set in Vietnam
might be interpreted

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.410
as cultural insensitivity.

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:44.480
Do you not think it would be a
little more believable, I said,

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:48.790
a little more realistic,
a little more authentic

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:51.710
for a movie set in a certain
country for the people

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:54.860
in that country to
have something to say,

00:27:54.860 --> 00:27:57.110
instead of having your
screenplay direct,

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:02.247
as it does now, cut to villagers
speaking in their own language?

00:28:02.247 --> 00:28:04.580
Do you think it might not be
decent to let them actually

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.910
say something instead
of simply acknowledging

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:12.290
that there is some kind of
sound coming from their mouths?

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:15.860
Could you not even just have
them speak a heavily accented

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:20.960
English, you know what I mean,
ching-chong English, just

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.200
to pretend that they are
speaking in an Asian language

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.320
that somehow American audiences
can strangely understand?

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:37.820
The Auteur grimaced and
said, very interesting.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.910
Great stuff.

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:41.566
Loved it.

00:28:41.566 --> 00:28:44.600
But I had a question.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.660
What was it?

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:48.380
Oh, yes.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.810
How many movies have you made?

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:54.330
None.

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:55.770
Isn't that right?

00:28:55.770 --> 00:29:03.590
None, zero, zilch, nada,
nothing, and however you

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:06.200
say it in your language.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.096
So thank you for telling
me how to do my job.

00:29:08.096 --> 00:29:09.470
Now, get the hell
out of my house

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.766
and come back after you've
made a movie or two.

00:29:12.766 --> 00:29:15.182
Maybe then I'll listen to one
or two of your cheap ideas."

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:19.950
Funny thing is that
since this book came out,

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.780
I've spoken to quite
a few Hollywood people

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.000
and none of them dispute
this characterization.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:31.800
"I confess to being
angry with the Auteur,

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:34.655
but was I wrong in being angry?

00:29:34.655 --> 00:29:36.030
This was especially
the case when

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:39.030
he acknowledged he did not even
know that Montagnard was simply

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.316
a French catch all term for the
dozens of Highland minorities."

00:29:42.316 --> 00:29:44.440
The movie The Hamlet is
about American Green Berets

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.080
who go to the central
Highlands and train

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.996
the so-called Montagnards
to defend themselves

00:29:47.996 --> 00:29:49.360
against communism.

00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.590
"What if, I said to him, I wrote
a screenplay about the American

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:56.010
West and simply called
all the natives Indians?

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:59.550
You'd want to know whether the
cavalry was fighting the Navajo

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:02.460
or Apache or Comanche, right?

00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:04.890
Likewise, I would
want to know, when

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:06.840
you say these people
are Montagnards,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:11.860
whether we speak of the
Bru or the Nung or the Tay.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:16.430
Let me tell you a
secret, the Auteur said.

00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.360
You ready?

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.060
Here it is.

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.990
No one gives a shit.

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.720
He was amused by
my wordlessness.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.300
To see me without
words is like seeing

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.690
one of those Egyptian felines
without hair, a rare, not

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:36.960
necessarily desirable occasion.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.920
Have could I be so dense?

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:40.540
How could I be so deluded?

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:43.300
I naively believed that I could
divert the Hollywood organism

00:30:43.300 --> 00:30:46.810
from its goal, the
simultaneous lobotomization

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:50.092
and pickpocketing of
the world's audiences.

00:30:50.092 --> 00:30:52.750
Hollywood did not just
make war movie monsters.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.850
It was its own
horror movie monster,

00:30:54.850 --> 00:30:56.690
smashing me under its foot.

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.830
I had failed, and the
Auteur would make The Hamlet

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.770
as he intended, with my
countrymen serving merely

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:05.710
as raw material for an
epic about white men

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:10.160
saving good yellow people
from bad yellow people.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.670
I pity the French
for their naivete

00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:17.130
in believing they had to visit a
country in order to exploit it.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:18.980
Hollywood was much
more efficient

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:22.070
imagining the countries
it wanted to exploit.

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:23.570
I was maddened by
my helplessness

00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:27.860
before the Auteur's
imagination and machinations.

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.190
His arrogance marked
something new in the world,

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:35.720
for this was the first war where
the losers would write history

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.390
instead of the victors,
courtesy of the most

00:31:38.390 --> 00:31:41.630
efficient propaganda
machine ever created,

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:45.140
with all due respect to
Joseph Goebbels and the Nazis

00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:48.242
who never achieved
global domination.

00:31:48.242 --> 00:31:49.700
Hollywood's high
priests understood

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:52.430
innately the observation
of Milton's Satan,

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.120
that it was better to rule
in Hell than serve in Heaven.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.690
Better to be villain,
loser, or antihero

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:03.470
than virtuous extra, so long as
one commanded the bright lights

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.210
of center stage.

00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:07.350
In this forthcoming
Hollywood trompe l'oeil,

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.520
all the Vietnamese of any
side would come out poorly,

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:15.200
herded into the roles of the
poor, the innocent, the evil,

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.910
or the corrupt.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:20.550
Our fate was not
to be merely mute,

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:23.920
we were to be struck dumb."

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.420
Thank you.

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:40.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.700
- Viet, let me just
say, first of all,

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:45.460
that was just wonderful.

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.260
And welcome to Cambridge.

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:50.140
It's great to have you here.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.410
I think we're all interested
in how you got to this point

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:58.950
where you were able to
make us all give a shit.

00:32:58.950 --> 00:33:00.910
And in your journey--

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:03.910
so I'd like to talk
about that journey today,

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.430
starting with, if I may--
start with your days

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.920
at Berkeley and your grades.

00:33:12.610 --> 00:33:16.870
You did take a class with
Maxine Hong Kingston there and--

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:18.400
creative writing class.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.010
And you did get a B.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:21.810
- A B-plus.

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:22.660
- A B-plus.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:25.120
- Now it comes out.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.230
I was really worried.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.570
I don't know if you have
great inflation there the way

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:29.830
we do here.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:34.610
But a B here is not
an F, but it is a C.

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:36.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:40.770
- So I'm relieved to hear
that you got a B-plus.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:44.050
And a very interesting
part, I think, of the story

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:49.389
is also that you slept in
her class every time it met.

00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:51.430
- Well, I think the
important part to acknowledge

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.940
is that it was a class of 14
students, in which I sat here,

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.840
and she sat there.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.985
And I fell asleep every
single day in that class.

00:33:57.985 --> 00:34:01.390
- And you sat next to
her, and you fell asleep.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.940
She also did say that you
never contributed, because that

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.762
goes along with being asleep.

00:34:05.762 --> 00:34:06.262
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:06.262 --> 00:34:09.850
- Well, she wrote me a very long
note at the end of the class.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:14.350
- And she had a little advice
to you in that note, right?

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.962
- Well, she said, you seem to
be very alienated, which I was.

00:34:17.962 --> 00:34:19.420
And she said, maybe
you should make

00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.659
use of Cal's excellent
counseling services.

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:25.210
And thankfully, I did
not take her advice.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:34.060
Part of how I get anybody
to give a shit if they do

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.550
is that I stopped giving a fuck.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:39.610
And I was alienated when
I was an undergraduate,

00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:42.250
because I was confused
for all the reasons

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.340
that I talked about.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:45.920
I was trying to make sense
of myself as a person,

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.440
as an Asian American, as a
student, as a writer, as a son.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.900
And all of that was wrapped up
in so many kinds of anxieties.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.570
And that was about caring about
what other people thought.

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:00.160
I got a B-plus.

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.790
That's unacceptable, right?

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:03.290
- You don't have
to be so defensive,

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.550
because I'm just ripping you.

00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:08.944
It's funny today.

00:35:08.944 --> 00:35:10.360
But it actually
gets to something.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:14.200
I think there are a lot of
students here in this crowd,

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.860
and it's always very interesting
what works in the classroom

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.317
and what doesn't.

00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:21.400
And what I'm wondering
today-- because, of course,

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.200
we could say, he was a bum.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.890
He slept every day.

00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:26.440
And what's the matter with him?

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:32.920
But I have to say that today,
I wonder whether really sitting

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.590
there at your young
age-- were you 19, 20--

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:39.370
where you were already feeling
some anxiety of influence.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.990
You weren't just a bum.

00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:42.310
So there you were.

00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:46.330
I don't need to explain to this
crowd how anxiety influences--

00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:50.100
Harold Bloom's idea that we
need to kill our predecessors.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.140
I, myself clear across the
country felt this with Maxine,

00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:56.440
and I think I said so in an
interview with the result

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.397
that the first time
I met her, she said,

00:35:58.397 --> 00:35:59.980
I had read that you
wanted to kill me.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.250
I said, oh God, no.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.190
I'm so sorry, Maxine.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:07.480
But in fact, of course, many
writers have had this feeling.

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:11.850
It's just the Southern writers
feel this way about Faulkner.

00:36:11.850 --> 00:36:13.960
Flannery O'Connor
famously said, we

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.930
have to differentiate
ourselves from Faulkner.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.680
You don't want
your mule and cart

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.860
on the same tracks the
Dixie Limited came down.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:28.150
And I wonder if for you it
was a supremely bad choice

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.890
for your first
creative writing class

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:31.420
to be in class where
you're not only

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:35.230
with the preeminent Asian
American writer, but a woman

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:38.380
who, because of her
peace work, whose name

00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:41.110
was synonymous with Vietnam.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.580
And there she is.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:46.540
And she owns Vietnam, and
she's not even Vietnamese.

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:51.280
And I'm wondering if that
was a contributor to why

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.620
you shut down.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:56.040
- Well, I think that may
definitely be the case,

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.450
but it wasn't articulate
for myself at the time.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:00.910
We read Chinaman, for
example, in her class.

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:03.906
And Chinaman, part of it is
very much about the Vietnam War.

00:37:03.906 --> 00:37:05.530
There's a great
chapter in there called

00:37:05.530 --> 00:37:08.530
"The Brother from Vietnam."

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:11.140
But the funny thing was
I didn't remember that.

00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.840
It took me many, many years
to come back to that book

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.790
and to realize that the
brother from Vietnam

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.227
is absolutely crucial
to my own thinking.

00:37:18.227 --> 00:37:19.810
Maybe you should put
a seed in my head

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:20.994
by having me read that work.

00:37:20.994 --> 00:37:23.410
And I think that the thing is
I have influences definitely

00:37:23.410 --> 00:37:25.810
there, because she represented
Asian American literature.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:27.351
She represented a
particular approach

00:37:27.351 --> 00:37:29.140
to peace and reconciliation.

00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.050
And at the time, I was trying
to be an Asian American writer

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:36.460
as you were saying, but also
rebelling against this notion

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.060
of peace and reconciliation.

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.760
I was an angry Asian
American activist.

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.790
I was storming the
president's office.

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:43.870
Now, I'm sitting
with the president.

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:45.500
So it's a really
weird transformation.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.320
But at the time, I was like,
let's have a revolution.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.810
I'm not interested in
nuances and ambiguities.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.370
I want some clarity
at 19 years old.

00:37:53.370 --> 00:37:56.135
And so it took a couple of
decades of revisiting her work

00:37:56.135 --> 00:37:59.360
to understand that it was
enormously influential,

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:00.830
enormously important.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:05.690
And that part of why it took so
long to become a writer for me

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:08.120
was about learning the
art, but of also learning

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:12.140
emotional maturity to be able
to confront some of the things

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:13.540
that she was talking about.

00:38:13.540 --> 00:38:16.040
- But it's such a
great example, I think,

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.350
when people think, who
should I study with?

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:21.260
On the surface of it, it would
have been what a perfect match.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.640
Maxine Hong Kingston is there.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:23.575
She's so gentle.

00:38:23.575 --> 00:38:25.980
She's so loving.

00:38:25.980 --> 00:38:28.270
She's interested in Vietnam.

00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:29.870
On the surface of
it, it would seem

00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.910
that there could be
no better teacher,

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.500
and yet, actually a disaster.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:38.510
And then exactly as you said,
I get this committed pacifist.

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:42.620
And there you are, and you've
talked about your journey

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.750
as a writer is really
being an emotional journey.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:48.000
And so you are trying to
get in touch with yourself.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.070
You have a lot of
violence in you.

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:53.250
And she is so adamantly
anti-violence to this day,

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:55.650
that when she read your
book in order to blurb it,

00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:58.080
she did give you the
blurb but without reading

00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.340
the violent parts.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.420
The first time this has
ever happened, of course,

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.586
that a writer has blurbed
a book without reading it.

00:39:03.586 --> 00:39:06.912
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:06.912 --> 00:39:07.620
So there you are.

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:11.140
So in a funny kind of way,
it is a perfect mismatch.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.450
So then you go on,
and you do, of course,

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:17.730
what I will say many
failed writers do

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:20.600
is you become an academic.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.430
It's always very funny how
many-- every year at Radcliffe

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:25.497
there is a number of
fellows who applied

00:39:25.497 --> 00:39:27.330
to do such and such a
project, but then they

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:30.720
spend the year writing novels.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:31.470
But there you are.

00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:35.550
You become an academic
like these many academics.

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:39.670
On the side, even though you're
doing very well as an academic,

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:45.990
you persist at this writing
thing for 15, 17 years,

00:39:45.990 --> 00:39:48.150
writing the same short stories.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:50.310
The stories that we now
see in The Refugees.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:54.130
You wrote them for 15, 17 years.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.710
You go about it in
a very rational way.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:40:00.060
You have an Excel
spreadsheet for the writers

00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.610
and the audience.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:04.300
This is not the recommended way.

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:06.550
But you've got this spreadsheet.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.170
You're having no fun.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:11.424
Of course, I think you've said
yourself that you don't do fun.

00:40:11.424 --> 00:40:13.840
- Well, I grew up in a very
Vietnamese Catholic household.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.640
We don't know
anything about fun.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.670
We only know about
sacrifice and torture,

00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:22.330
so that was perfect
for being a writer.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.970
- So you're having
no fun, but you're

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:30.900
sticking at it 15, 17
years, rewriting, rewriting

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.030
with your spreadsheet.

00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:39.850
And this goes on while your
academic career is going on.

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:43.270
And it seems like these two
tracks are completely separate.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.010
But I guess what
I'm wondering today

00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:50.770
is actually if the academic
track was key to your finally

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.620
getting unstuck.

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:55.810
You've talked about
the whole idea

00:40:55.810 --> 00:41:00.030
that your journey was
really an emotional journey.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:01.579
If, in fact--
especially the kind

00:41:01.579 --> 00:41:03.370
of academics that you
were doing over there

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.640
in California where it is
so radical, whether it gave

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.740
you scaffolding
for all that anger.

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:10.620
- Absolutely.

00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.100
And the real
challenge was to try

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.769
to figure out how to work
emotionally in both areas.

00:41:14.769 --> 00:41:16.810
As a writer, you're supposed
to work emotionally.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.757
That's the substance
from which you draw.

00:41:18.757 --> 00:41:21.340
And I remember another writing
teacher that I had at Berkeley,

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:23.924
Bharati Mukherjee, reading one
of my short stories and saying,

00:41:23.924 --> 00:41:26.173
you know what, you don't cut
close enough to the bone.

00:41:26.173 --> 00:41:27.560
I was like 19 or 20 years old.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.332
I was like, how do you do that?

00:41:29.332 --> 00:41:30.920
If I could just take a knife
to myself, I would do it.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.919
- Is that going to hurt?

00:41:31.919 --> 00:41:33.520
- But I think what
she was getting

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:36.190
at is that what a writer
needs to draw from

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:40.170
is the internal emotions that
go deep into your own feelings.

00:41:40.170 --> 00:41:43.540
And fiction doesn't have
to be autobiographical,

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:45.999
but the emotions that you put
into it come from within you.

00:41:45.999 --> 00:41:48.165
And that's what I was talking
about at the beginning

00:41:48.165 --> 00:41:49.840
of the talk is that
I spent a lifetime

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.360
suppressing those feelings,
suppressing those emotions,

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:56.470
trying to approach my past
rationally as a scholar.

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:58.442
So that approach did
have some benefits,

00:41:58.442 --> 00:42:00.900
because I couldn't have written
The Sympathizer without all

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:05.020
the rational work of going
to Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos,

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:07.556
thinking about the politics
and ethics of memory.

00:42:07.556 --> 00:42:09.430
But I also couldn't have
written Nothing Ever

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:11.770
Dies without writing
The Sympathizer,

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:15.100
because I was able
in Nothing Ever Dies

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:16.899
to also tap into my emotions.

00:42:16.899 --> 00:42:18.940
And as a scholar, you're
not supposed to do that.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.280
You're supposed to be objective.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.050
- It's a very emotional book.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:28.840
The whole tone of it is a very
take no prisoners type tone.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.930
This is not the dispassionate
scholar writing.

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:32.950
It's very interesting.

00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:34.700
But I was just interested
in your journey,

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.110
because it's so opposite the
way that most writers have--

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:41.170
and I think that probably
what Maxine, I think,

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:44.410
has spoken about her, she
starts with the emotion.

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:47.430
And I would say that many, many,
many writers would say, well,

00:42:47.430 --> 00:42:49.240
they start with some
kind of feeling.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.020
And it's just so
interesting that you went

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.420
a completely different way.

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:53.980
And you needed the
Excel spreadsheet,

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.354
and then you needed
the academia.

00:42:55.354 --> 00:42:56.680
You need the scholarship.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.890
And then what happens after
15 years of scholarship

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:02.155
and 15 years of banging
your head against the wall--

00:43:02.155 --> 00:43:04.030
and you've described
this period of your life

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:05.680
as completely miserable.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.070
- Yes, it was.

00:43:07.070 --> 00:43:11.020
1997 to 2011 when I was writing
the bulk of The Refugees,

00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:12.520
it really was a
horrible experience,

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:13.720
because I was
learning how to write.

00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.770
I didn't do an MFA.

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:16.079
I didn't have writing teachers.

00:43:16.079 --> 00:43:17.620
So I was learning
how to write, and I

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.080
was also trying to learn
how to be a human being,

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.510
trying to learn what it meant
to be emotionally mature,

00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:24.610
to try and investigate
how I felt about things

00:43:24.610 --> 00:43:27.670
and why I was not feeling
certain kinds of things.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:31.430
And that's a very
difficult thing to do.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:38.190
But I think that it prepared
me for writing The Sympathizer.

00:43:38.190 --> 00:43:40.930
It was like that moment from
Karate Kid, wax on, wax off.

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:42.460
You do this endlessly
over and over,

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:44.830
and then, all of a sudden,
you become the karate master.

00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:46.120
So writing The
Refugees was nothing

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:47.328
like writing The Sympathizer.

00:43:47.328 --> 00:43:49.390
But somehow, through that
act of banging my head

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.982
against the wall, of
frustration and so on,

00:43:51.982 --> 00:43:53.440
when it came time
to write a novel,

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.461
it felt completely
natural to do it.

00:43:55.461 --> 00:43:56.835
And I could do
that in two years.

00:43:56.835 --> 00:43:57.580
- Well, right.

00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:01.930
It was that on
one hand, but also

00:44:01.930 --> 00:44:05.170
your life as an academic,
which I will say--

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:07.116
so you started off as someone--

00:44:07.116 --> 00:44:09.115
you're sleeping in Maxine
Hong Kingston's class.

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:14.200
You don't say one word,
which suggests a certain kind

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.180
of shyness too, I will say.

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.280
And then from there,
I will say, it

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:20.680
seems that it's your
academic life that gave you

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.160
the confidence to
come to the novel,

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.490
knowing what you wanted to say.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:26.990
- Well, let me just
put it this way.

00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:29.080
I think that one of the
reasons why I did not go

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.410
do an MFA was that I
just didn't believe

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:35.230
in how writing is
taught in this country,

00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:36.670
and maybe it's a stereotype.

00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:39.504
But my understanding of
contemporary American fiction,

00:44:39.504 --> 00:44:41.170
like I said at the
beginning, is that it

00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.900
wasn't the kind of fiction
that I wanted to write.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:47.470
It was a fiction that
prioritizes the intimate,

00:44:47.470 --> 00:44:49.554
the emotional, the realistic.

00:44:49.554 --> 00:44:51.220
And all those things
are important kinds

00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:53.170
of aesthetic features, but
they weren't necessarily

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:54.070
what I wanted to do.

00:44:54.070 --> 00:44:56.770
I couldn't see how I could
take those kinds of aesthetics

00:44:56.770 --> 00:44:58.730
and write a novel
like The Sympathizer

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:02.380
that wanted to be an
angry, in-your-face novel

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:06.370
about politics, and
a novel that would

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.500
leave some room for ambiguity.

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:10.540
But it would also
make perfectly clear

00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.930
what my critique of ideology
and revolution in America

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:15.790
and Vietnam were all about.

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:17.551
So yes, I had to become
a scholar in order

00:45:17.551 --> 00:45:19.300
to write that kind of
a book, because it's

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.320
a very different kind
of book than what

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.960
might have been produced out
of a conventional MFA program.

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:26.680
- But I think what you're
also saying is that--

00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:28.120
I told you-- I think we agreed.

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.840
I said, well, let's talk
about your nonfiction.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.760
You said, no, we're not going
to talk about my nonfiction.

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.780
There isn't time.

00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:36.100
But I think what you are also
saying is that in your heart,

00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:41.500
you knew that the American
MFA program and approach is

00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.200
too individualistic for you.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.140
That it started from the self
in a way which you understood

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.390
was not going to work for you.

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:49.600
- Let me go back to
the idea of the fact

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.599
that I was both an English
and an ethnic studies

00:45:51.599 --> 00:45:53.350
major as an undergraduate.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.420
English is great
for reading books

00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:57.520
and is great for
cultivating this idea

00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.400
of the individual literary
talent and the romantic genius,

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.990
and all that is important.

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:04.120
But being an ethnic
studies major

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.300
was about being a
part of a collective,

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:08.410
recognizing myself as
a part of something

00:46:08.410 --> 00:46:12.730
of a group in solidarity that's
having a lineage of resistance

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:15.310
and revolution third
world solidarity, all

00:46:15.310 --> 00:46:17.500
these kinds of things that
do not get talked about,

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.820
generally speaking, in English
department writing programs.

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:27.010
- So you went around the MFA,
very Western-oriented MFA

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:28.030
program.

00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:31.390
And you went the other way,
and then you came back.

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:32.770
And then you came back.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:36.580
And you came back,
and you came back

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.190
with the kind of confidence
that came from being academic.

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:43.884
You revisited one of your
great heroes, Ralph Ellison.

00:46:43.884 --> 00:46:45.550
I wonder if you could
just tell everyone

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:49.640
a little bit about when you
came to Invisible Man again.

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:53.380
So you had written a lot about
Invisible Man as an undergrad,

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:54.656
and then, now what?

00:46:54.656 --> 00:46:56.530
- Well, it was a very
important novel for me.

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:59.602
And there's a lot of African
American literature, Chicano

00:46:59.602 --> 00:47:01.810
literature, Asian American
literature, and so on that

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:03.435
was important to me
as an undergraduate

00:47:03.435 --> 00:47:05.020
and giving me a sense
that these types

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:06.978
of narratives about
history, identity, politics

00:47:06.978 --> 00:47:07.865
had already been--

00:47:07.865 --> 00:47:10.240
people had already started
writing these kinds of things.

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.114
And Invisible Man was
particularly important,

00:47:12.114 --> 00:47:13.960
because number one,
it's a masterful novel.

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:15.910
But number two,
because Ellison's

00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:19.120
arguments about the invisibility
of African Americans

00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:21.490
and their
hypervisibility were very

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:24.680
applicable to other
minority populations,

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.990
including Asian Americans
in this country.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:30.447
So when I set out to
write The Sympathizer,

00:47:30.447 --> 00:47:32.530
Invisible Man was a model,
because he set out also

00:47:32.530 --> 00:47:34.810
to write an allegory for
African American experience.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:36.430
And I wanted to
write an allegory

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:38.080
for Vietnamese
experience as well.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.510
But speaking about the
anxiety of influence,

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:42.866
I also wanted to draw a
distinction between me

00:47:42.866 --> 00:47:44.740
and Ralph Ellison in
the book without picking

00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:46.681
a fight with him.

00:47:46.681 --> 00:47:49.180
I think one of the reasons why
Invisible Man was successful,

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:52.810
besides being a great
book, is that in the end,

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:55.400
the narrator of Invisible
Man becomes a revolutionary

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:59.530
and then renounces it and
then emerges out of his hole

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:03.280
and declares the possibility
of hope as an individual.

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:06.079
And for me, I thought, well,
that's one narrative that's

00:48:06.079 --> 00:48:07.870
very powerful in this
country, but it's not

00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:09.310
the narrative I want.

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:13.090
My narrative is about
how, yes, revolutions

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:15.340
do lead to disillusionment,
but that doesn't

00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.657
mean we give up on revolutions.

00:48:16.657 --> 00:48:18.490
It doesn't mean we give
up on collectivities

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.720
and solidarities.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:23.440
So my narrator, actually, after
his failure with revolution,

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.650
says, let's recommit
to another revolution.

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:28.630
And he embraces not
the individual I

00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:32.680
at the end of the book,
but uses we instead.

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.589
Now, that's either a sign of
collectivity and solidarity,

00:48:35.589 --> 00:48:36.880
or it's a sign of its insanity.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:37.714
It works either way.

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:39.796
And then that's another
other way in which it also

00:48:39.796 --> 00:48:42.580
aligns with Invisible Man and
our doubts about his sanity

00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.020
as well.

00:48:45.020 --> 00:48:48.850
- Thanks to your work as a
scholar, when you come back

00:48:48.850 --> 00:48:51.250
and you're looking at your
models for your novel,

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:53.310
you have a kind of
confidence there.

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:55.720
There is a way in which you
know what you're going to do.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.700
It's very interesting what
you pick for your models.

00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:04.185
Do you want to talk about that
a little bit, the big novels

00:49:04.185 --> 00:49:06.310
that you were looking at
when you were sitting down

00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:07.340
to read The Sympathizer.

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:08.790
You've got Celine.

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:10.000
You've got the [? Grass. ?]

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.420
- Well, I was certainly
looking for big novels that

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:15.220
tackled the big
questions in society

00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.310
and that were dealing
with war and its fallout

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:20.641
and the possibilities
of reconciliation.

00:49:20.641 --> 00:49:23.140
And so for example, Celine's
Journey to the End of the Night

00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:25.180
was really crucial,
because that was

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.910
a landmark novel of French
literature in the 1920s.

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:29.570
And when I read it
for the first time

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:31.570
in getting ready
for The Sympathizer,

00:49:31.570 --> 00:49:33.250
I saw that in the
first 50 pages,

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:36.340
it opens up in a Paris
cafe during World War I,

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.380
then moves the trench
warfare, then goes

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:42.060
to a French African colony, then
crosses the Atlantic to Detroit

00:49:42.060 --> 00:49:44.380
and goes back to
France, all in 50 pages.

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:46.540
And I thought, if
he can do that, I

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.704
can try to do that as well.

00:49:47.704 --> 00:49:49.120
So it was important
to try to find

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:50.740
these aspirational models--

00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:54.160
or Dostoyevsky of Crime and
Punishment, The Brothers

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.880
Karamazov and the
interrogation scene

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.167
in that, Antonio Lobo
Antunes, The Land

00:49:58.167 --> 00:50:00.250
at the End of the World,
which no one, apparently,

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:03.940
has ever read besides me.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.500
And part of what it
is to be a writer

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.880
is not just to
renounce influence,

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:11.589
but also to acknowledge and
to seek out influence as well.

00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:13.630
And so it's crucial to
see that other people have

00:50:13.630 --> 00:50:15.235
been trying to do
this and successfully

00:50:15.235 --> 00:50:16.360
have done this work before.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.620
- But what's so interesting
is that none of those models

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:18.592
are American.

00:50:18.592 --> 00:50:20.050
- I didn't think
that I was writing

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:22.710
the great American novel.

00:50:22.710 --> 00:50:24.550
I thought I was writing
the European version

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.500
of the American
novel, because to me,

00:50:26.500 --> 00:50:27.791
that was much more interesting.

00:50:27.791 --> 00:50:30.940
For me, the great American
novel, whatever that means,

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:34.240
does typically mean something
that's more realistic,

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:36.435
something that affirms
the American dream.

00:50:36.435 --> 00:50:37.810
And when I say
that, I don't mean

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:39.768
that it affirms the
American dream in some kind

00:50:39.768 --> 00:50:41.620
of propagandistic fashion.

00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:46.670
These novels often talk about
disillusionment and alienation.

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:50.140
But they still affirm an
American way of being,

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:54.130
and I wanted to do something
that was much more modernist,

00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:56.680
hopefully, and also
something that was much more

00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:00.730
skeptical of this American way
of being, this American idea.

00:51:03.580 --> 00:51:06.790
That's why I think that the
novel when we sent it out

00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:10.330
to publishers was rejected
by 13 out of 14 publishers.

00:51:10.330 --> 00:51:12.270
- Tell people about
that because you have--

00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:14.740
so you did succeed
in writing your book.

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:16.840
Let's not skip over that
wonderful period, though,

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.570
in your writing.

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:24.400
So your academic career has
given you the scaffolding.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.390
The emotion is coming up.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:28.540
It is coming up big.

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:32.350
And there you are writing,
and it's ecstatic.

00:51:32.350 --> 00:51:35.050
First, you find your
first opening line.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:37.060
Maybe you could share
with us what that was like

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.300
and how long it took.

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:40.810
- Well, it's important to note
that I wrote The Sympathizer

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:42.768
in two years, and it was
an ecstatic experience

00:51:42.768 --> 00:51:45.250
for the most part, except for
when I talked to my agent.

00:51:45.250 --> 00:51:46.460
And then I started
worrying about,

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.209
am I ever going to
sell this novel or not?

00:51:48.209 --> 00:51:51.592
- But it's never the
highlight of anyone's life.

00:51:51.592 --> 00:51:53.800
- No, most writers think,
I just got to get an agent.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.710
But then when you get
the agent, there's

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:56.050
a whole other set of anxieties.

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:58.008
But I spent a summer
trying to find the opening

00:51:58.008 --> 00:52:00.640
line in the opening
sequence of the novel,

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:02.560
because I knew that
that would then set

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.065
the tenor for the entire book.

00:52:04.065 --> 00:52:06.190
And that was when reading
Antonio Lobo Antunes' The

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:08.500
Land at the End of the World
was really crucial for me,

00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.590
because it's a novel about the
Portuguese war in Angola, which

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:13.870
is similar to the Vietnam
War for the Portuguese.

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:15.820
But it's also a novel
that is intensely

00:52:15.820 --> 00:52:18.892
about the voice and the style.

00:52:18.892 --> 00:52:21.100
And I knew in writing The
Sympathizer that it was not

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:23.140
just going to be a novel
about the Vietnam War,

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:25.510
it would be a novel
about voice and style,

00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:28.819
because my feeling was that
I had to prove something.

00:52:28.819 --> 00:52:31.360
And I had to prove something,
not just about the Vietnam War.

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.550
I didn't have just an argument
to make about the Vietnam War.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:35.500
I had an argument to
make about what it meant

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:37.150
to be an Asian American writer.

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:39.430
And that argument
was, I can do it

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:42.910
just as well as any
other American writer,

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:45.760
and I can demonstrate
this through the language

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.360
of the book.

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.980
And we were talking about
the anxiety of influence.

00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:49.330
If there's any
anxiety of influence

00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:50.746
that's really
evident in the book,

00:52:50.746 --> 00:52:53.207
it's in the very language
of the book itself.

00:52:53.207 --> 00:52:54.790
It's possible the
book is overwritten,

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:56.500
because I'm too
anxious about trying

00:52:56.500 --> 00:53:00.310
to prove that I can master
English and write just as good

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:02.680
as any other American author.

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.900
That to me was the very
self-conscious moment

00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:08.367
of me working through
what my anxieties were

00:53:08.367 --> 00:53:10.325
and what I was trying to
both prove and reject.

00:53:10.325 --> 00:53:13.120
- And this goes back to what you
were saying earlier about never

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:16.330
being able to forget that
you are in this context.

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:18.940
It's a great luxury to be
able to forget that context.

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:21.280
And I will say that,
just as an aside,

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:24.730
very similarly when I sat down
to write Typical American--

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:27.070
which was right
here at Radcliffe--

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:28.925
but also, at a time
when people did not

00:53:28.925 --> 00:53:30.925
believe that Asian Americans
could write novels.

00:53:35.050 --> 00:53:38.320
That novel just says, I
am a novel in every line,

00:53:38.320 --> 00:53:42.180
because every single
moment, I was asked,

00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:43.711
isn't that immigrant
autobiography?

00:53:43.711 --> 00:53:44.710
Do you know what I mean?

00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:46.000
I was like, no, it's a novel.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.130
And the same way you
have anxiety today,

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:51.370
well, maybe I overwrote the
voice as I'm struggling to say,

00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:52.660
I can do this.

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:55.420
Today, I think, well,
I wonder if I overdid

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:59.170
the novelness of
the novel, because I

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:00.730
was in reaction to something.

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:03.146
- But even the title, Typical
American, when I encountered

00:54:03.146 --> 00:54:05.890
it, it was clearly a statement,
typical American, native

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:07.510
speaker, things like this.

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:10.240
We as Asian American
writers are oftentimes

00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:12.190
worried about that
anxiety of, do we belong,

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:13.390
or do we not belong?

00:54:13.390 --> 00:54:15.310
How do we assert
our Americanness?

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:17.560
And in The Sympathizer,
because things

00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:21.790
like Native Speaker and Typical
American had come along,

00:54:21.790 --> 00:54:23.780
I didn't feel I needed
to do that work.

00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:25.240
So I could do something else.

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.365
I could write about from
the perspective of someone

00:54:27.365 --> 00:54:29.320
who was not clearly
an American, someone

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.000
who was ambiguously
Americanized,

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.610
but who was also very
clearly Vietnamese.

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:35.110
And to assert that
this was not just

00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:37.720
an American novel, but
again, a European version

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:40.270
of an American novel that
took into consideration

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:44.039
international politics and
the international arena, which

00:54:44.039 --> 00:54:46.330
is something that many Asian
American writers before me

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:48.220
and the generations
before me might have been

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.720
reluctant to do,
because they didn't

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:52.775
want to be tainted with that
association with the foreign.

00:54:52.775 --> 00:54:55.170
- And you so often call
yourself a Vietnamese writer,

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:56.970
which I find very interesting.

00:54:56.970 --> 00:54:58.640
In my generation,
if you will, we

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.390
were always very careful to
say we're Asian American.

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:02.610
We're Chinese American.

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.670
But you often will refer
to yourself as Vietnamese.

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:08.970
- Well, I think the
whole dilemma in this--

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.190
through your generation and
whenever I would go see--

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:13.106
- I'm not that much
older than you.

00:55:13.106 --> 00:55:14.525
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:14.525 --> 00:55:17.260
- Let me just say, though,
when Typical American came out,

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.650
it was a landmark, because--
every time an Asian American

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:20.850
novel came out,
it was a landmark,

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:22.530
because they only came out like
once a year or once every two

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:23.579
or three years.

00:55:23.579 --> 00:55:25.620
I'm living in a moment
where Asian American books

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:26.880
are coming out every week.

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.450
So I think there is a
generational shift in that.

00:55:30.450 --> 00:55:33.381
But I forget what we
were talking about.

00:55:33.381 --> 00:55:36.027
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:36.027 --> 00:55:38.606
- Well, you were talking about--

00:55:38.606 --> 00:55:40.480
I don't remember what
you were talking about.

00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:42.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:44.170
- The Vietnamese
American [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:47.510
- Why you call
yourself Vietnamese.

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:50.160
I'm in great pains to sort of
say, we're typical American.

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.960
And you call
yourself Vietnamese,

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.820
even though you go
to Vietnam, and you

00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:56.720
don't get the Vietnamese price.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.695
There it is.

00:55:57.695 --> 00:55:59.080
- Writers of your generation--

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.130
I remember this going to
many writers' readings--

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:04.980
would often get the question,
are you an Asian American

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:07.090
writer, or are
you just a writer?

00:56:07.090 --> 00:56:08.740
And I think that's
a loaded question.

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.270
That's a no-win situation
whichever one you choose,

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:13.770
because it implies that if you
are an Asian American writer,

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.140
you're not a universal writer.

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:18.030
But I think that
for me, I'd already

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:21.840
seen enough evidence of
people disputing that,

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:22.780
so I didn't have to--

00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:24.150
I don't have that anxiety.

00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:25.710
I can say I'm a
Vietnamese writer.

00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:27.880
And I don't care
whether people think,

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.270
oh, he's not just a writer.

00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:32.520
He's not a universal writer,
because in my mind, I am.

00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:35.100
- But you want to say
Vietnamese American.

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.230
- I say that sometimes.

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:37.080
- You see, they're
interchangeable.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.413
- I say Vietnamese, Vietnamese
American, Asian American,

00:56:39.413 --> 00:56:40.650
American, or just a writer.

00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:43.770
So I think part of
what's different for me

00:56:43.770 --> 00:56:46.050
as a writer in this
moment is that it's

00:56:46.050 --> 00:56:49.770
possible to claim a
multiplicity of possibilities

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:53.160
of identification as a writer
and to think of a novel

00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:55.320
that I write as being
able to function

00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:56.970
in different kinds
of traditions.

00:56:56.970 --> 00:56:59.040
So yes, it works in
an American tradition,

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.590
but, hopefully, it works
in Vietnamese literature.

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:05.240
Hopefully, it works on an
international context as well.

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.110
And so we have to be
defiant about that.

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:14.520
- So you have this novel, and
it's written, as you have said,

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.190
addressed-- it was written
by a Vietnamese writer,

00:57:18.190 --> 00:57:19.890
addressed in Vietnamese.

00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:22.470
Other people are
allowed to eavesdrop.

00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:25.470
But fundamentally, to the degree
that the white audience is

00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:28.100
included, the purpose
of-- they can eavesdrop,

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:32.070
but the purpose is to
show them their privileges

00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:34.470
and assumptions,
which they don't see.

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:36.650
So it's very much in-your-face.

00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:41.010
So this novel is in-your-face,
Apocalypse Now loving,

00:57:41.010 --> 00:57:43.290
white America.

00:57:43.290 --> 00:57:44.730
Take that.

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:48.090
And so lo and behold, you put
up for auction and what happens?

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:50.680
Because it is in-your-face,
white America and [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:55.200
- Well, it was rejected by
13 out of 14 publishers.

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:57.720
And so I'll tell
an anecdote, which

00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.470
is that I had higher
hopes for the novel.

00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:04.670
I knew in writing the novel that
I was deliberately not doing

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:07.170
what I was supposed to do as
an Asian American writer, which

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:09.295
is, it's OK to talk about
communist disillusionment

00:58:09.295 --> 00:58:10.560
and all that kind of stuff.

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:14.190
But you have to end on a
note of Americanization.

00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:17.160
You have to end on an embrace
of the American dream,

00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:18.630
explicitly or implicitly.

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:20.050
And the novel does not do that.

00:58:20.050 --> 00:58:22.260
He does not go back
to the United States.

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.870
- But he said, we will live.

00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:25.945
- But where?

00:58:25.945 --> 00:58:27.352
Where is he going to go?

00:58:27.352 --> 00:58:28.560
- As he heads off to America.

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.211
- But he doesn't
head off to America.

00:58:30.211 --> 00:58:32.210
And we just see-- he was
just getting on a boat.

00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:33.070
- He's getting on a boat.

00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:34.736
But yes, American
audiences will assume,

00:58:34.736 --> 00:58:37.140
of course, he's going to
the promised land, America.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.529
But it's never actually
said in the novel.

00:58:40.529 --> 00:58:42.070
There's a lot of
very critical things

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:44.280
that are being said about
Americans in that book.

00:58:44.280 --> 00:58:46.230
But about anxiety of
influence, while I

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:47.730
was writing The
Sympathizer, a novel

00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:49.560
called Orphan
Master's Son came out

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:53.700
by Adam Johnson in 2011 or 2012,
and it won the Pulitzer Prize.

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:54.910
And so I read it.

00:58:54.910 --> 00:58:57.430
I thought it was
a very good book.

00:58:57.430 --> 00:59:00.460
It's a book about North
Korea and a communist spy,

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:03.180
so you can see why I was very
concerned about this book.

00:59:03.180 --> 00:59:05.263
But I read it, and I
thought, this book is written

00:59:05.263 --> 00:59:09.600
for Americans, because all
the references are oriented

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.360
towards an American audience.

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.760
And the ending of the novel--
sorry to give it away--

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.450
is that the people who
survive are going to America.

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:20.940
And I thought, I don't want
to write that kind of a novel,

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.860
because I can
totally see how it's

00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:26.190
placating an American audience,
saying North Korea is crazy.

00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:27.940
We're great.

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.450
So I had a conversation with
the editor of that book.

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:33.435
I thought, I really would
love you to buy my novel.

00:59:33.435 --> 00:59:35.310
And he said, you should
do a couple of things

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:38.100
with this novel, including
putting in a romantic interest.

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:43.290
In Orphan Master's Son,
there's a romantic interest

00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:45.390
like Casablanca.

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:47.550
I said, I can't do that.

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:49.410
And lo and behold, he
didn't buy the book.

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:59.190
That's what it means to
challenge majority privilege.

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:01.110
If you don't challenge
majority privilege,

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:03.602
if you don't force the majority
to question themselves,

01:00:03.602 --> 01:00:06.060
they're much more likely to
give you a very nice book deal.

01:00:09.756 --> 01:00:11.880
I ended up being very lucky
in getting a book deal.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.469
It wasn't that great
of a book deal.

01:00:13.469 --> 01:00:15.510
And lo and behold, the
editor who bought the book

01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:16.910
was not an American.

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:18.572
He was English.

01:00:18.572 --> 01:00:20.280
And it turned out he
was also mixed race.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:21.630
I didn't know that.

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:24.480
So there was something, I think,
about just the inherent power

01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.670
of majority privilege
and identification

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:29.040
that often makes it very
difficult for the majority

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:32.890
to see past their own
assumptions and prejudices.

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:34.540
- I will say that
I've had a very,

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:38.370
very lucky career on
the publishing front,

01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:41.710
but I am convinced that's
because I am a [INAUDIBLE] is

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:45.230
headed by [INAUDIBLE] who
is an Indian American,

01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:47.460
Indian British, really.

01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:51.420
But he's not American either.

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.310
But lo and behold,
so you've had this--

01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.287
you wrote this angry book.

01:00:55.287 --> 01:00:56.120
It was in-your-face.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.411
It's not written for Americans.

01:00:57.411 --> 01:01:00.660
You refused to conform to
the American standards,

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:04.170
and you win the Pulitzer Prize.

01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:06.270
So now, what?

01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:07.885
It's kind of a disaster.

01:01:07.885 --> 01:01:11.009
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:11.009 --> 01:01:13.675
- Well, it makes up for the fact
that I didn't get into Harvard,

01:01:13.675 --> 01:01:14.610
and my brother did.

01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:18.839
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:18.839 --> 01:01:20.880
You would imagine one
person getting into Harvard

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.850
for a family is enough, but
it's not for an Asian family.

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:24.480
You both have to
get into Harvard.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:28.290
But it was funny, because after
I got the Pulitzer Prize--

01:01:28.290 --> 01:01:32.030
and I learned about it,
actually, here in Cambridge--

01:01:32.030 --> 01:01:33.789
I didn't tell my parents.

01:01:33.789 --> 01:01:35.580
Actually, it literally
never occurred to me

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.320
to tell my parents,
because I thought,

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.790
that would just me bragging.

01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:41.220
But a couple of days later,
my dad calls me on the road,

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:43.535
and he said, hey, the
relatives in Vietnam called.

01:01:43.535 --> 01:01:44.660
You won the Pulitzer Prize.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.630
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:49.690
But I don't know.

01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:51.320
How do you read the
politics of prizes?

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.040
It's very, very difficult.
But one way to read it

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.294
would be that, yes, the novel
is very angry and in-your-face,

01:01:58.294 --> 01:02:00.460
and there's a lot of critiques
of the United States.

01:02:03.070 --> 01:02:09.100
But giving it the Pulitzer Prize
legitimates American culture

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.050
as well.

01:02:11.050 --> 01:02:13.184
We're in America
that allows writers

01:02:13.184 --> 01:02:14.475
to write these kinds of things.

01:02:14.475 --> 01:02:15.490
- We love it.

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:16.150
- We love it.

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.650
We love it.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:18.370
- We love the angry young man.

01:02:18.370 --> 01:02:23.531
We love the in-your-face,
self-righteous anger.

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:25.780
We actually love that-- we
don't love it commercially,

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:27.960
but we love it in
the literary world.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.460
- But if you look at some of
the writers of color who've won

01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.020
the Pulitzer over the
last few decades--

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.936
we're talking about Toni
Morrison, Junot Diaz,

01:02:33.936 --> 01:02:36.090
Jhumpa Lahiri, me--

01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:40.540
three out of four are
fairly political writers

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.640
who are very critical
of different aspects

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.260
of American culture.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:47.925
So there is a certain kind of
genre of the writer of color.

01:02:47.925 --> 01:02:49.740
- There is a kind of genre.

01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.580
And it's interesting
to hear you acknowledge

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.222
that there is a kind of genre.

01:02:53.222 --> 01:02:55.180
I don't mean to take it
away from you because--

01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:58.310
- I'm taking it away from me.

01:02:58.310 --> 01:03:02.830
- There is a kind of genre, and
it does serve America, finally.

01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:05.830
But at the same time,
it's a great story.

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:09.350
And here you are.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:12.100
You resist the idea that
this is an American dream,

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.720
rags to riches thing.

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:16.740
And so then you have to
hear from Terry Gross.

01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:18.100
You're like, I'm a refugee.

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:19.930
This is not a rags
to riches story.

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:20.500
It is not.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:20.920
It is not.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.430
It is not.

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:22.930
And she says, yeah,
but your brother

01:03:22.930 --> 01:03:25.570
did go to Harvard and
Stanford Medical School.

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:28.130
And you did win the Pulitzer.

01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:32.000
And here you are now
having a great life.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.180
You've got this wonderful son.

01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.280
You have a wonderful new
project that involves

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.640
a lot of research in Paris.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.572
Many would say
that's pretty nice.

01:03:42.572 --> 01:03:44.530
Let's talk a little bit
about your new project.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:45.994
- Well, yeah, it's the--

01:03:45.994 --> 01:03:47.410
- Sorry, we just
have to wind up--

01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:49.720
- The sequel to The
Sympathizer, and it's

01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.890
set in Paris in the 1980s.

01:03:51.890 --> 01:03:54.790
And it confronts the
fact that my narrator is

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:56.170
half Vietnamese, half French.

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:59.290
And I wanted to talk about
the French side of colonialism

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:01.960
and the fact that
for the French, what

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.640
they did in Indochina
is something

01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:07.360
they've basically, completely
forgotten and romanticized.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.830
And so it's interesting being
a Vietnamese American writer,

01:04:11.830 --> 01:04:14.200
because at least here
in the United States,

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:20.180
Americans have confronted
their past in the Vietnam War.

01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:22.640
Now, we can debate how
well they've done that,

01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:24.140
but they have confronted it.

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.212
But that's both an
opportunity and a trap.

01:04:26.212 --> 01:04:27.920
So I knew as a Vietnamese
American writer

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.836
that if I wrote a novel
about the Vietnam War,

01:04:29.836 --> 01:04:32.300
there would be interest in that.

01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:35.570
But that's a trap
too, because that's

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:39.020
our only way of entering
the American conversation

01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:44.640
as Vietnamese Americans is
to play on American guilt.

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.120
So could I write a novel
about the Vietnam War

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:50.180
that was not simply
about being Vietnamese

01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.400
but was also a critique of
American culture as well?

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.858
And that was one
of the challenges.

01:04:53.858 --> 01:04:56.180
So now, the problem is with
writing another novel--

01:04:56.180 --> 01:05:00.050
the issue is, do I stop writing
about Vietnam and the Vietnam

01:05:00.050 --> 01:05:01.610
War simply because
it will simply

01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:04.310
reinforce my status as a
Vietnamese and Vietnamese

01:05:04.310 --> 01:05:05.270
American writer?

01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:07.730
Or do I attempt, again,
as with The Sympathizer,

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:09.950
to write a novel on
my own terms, that is,

01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:13.460
yes, about Vietnam
but is also about

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:17.870
reimagining what that means for
the Americans, the Vietnamese,

01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:18.530
and the French.

01:05:18.530 --> 01:05:19.988
That's what's going
to, hopefully--

01:05:19.988 --> 01:05:21.692
going to happen in the novel.

01:05:21.692 --> 01:05:23.270
- I think the
truth of the matter

01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:26.810
is that every writer has
some kind of [? doney ?]

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:28.580
with which they must grapple.

01:05:28.580 --> 01:05:33.080
And the question is,
what did you do with it?

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.550
What did you do with it?

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:36.470
But I don't think
there's getting away

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:38.895
from the [? doney. ?]
But in any case,

01:05:38.895 --> 01:05:40.145
I just have one more question.

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:45.110
I know everyone's very
amped up about the time.

01:05:45.110 --> 01:05:48.764
But just one more
question, and that

01:05:48.764 --> 01:05:50.180
is, since we're
here at Radcliffe,

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:53.720
I wonder if you could say just
a word about your Radcliffe year

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:56.344
and how it contributed
or didn't to--

01:05:56.344 --> 01:05:57.260
- It was a great year.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.301
I got very lucky to get
the Radcliffe fellowship.

01:05:59.301 --> 01:06:02.479
And the fellowship was for me
to work on Nothing Ever Dies.

01:06:02.479 --> 01:06:03.770
And so of course, what do I do?

01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:05.570
I don't work on
Nothing Ever Dies.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:07.880
I'm sorry.

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.580
What I did was I spent most of
my time writing The Refugees.

01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:12.320
But I also spent a
lot of time thinking

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.600
about the book that would
become Nothing Ever Dies

01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.370
and doing a lot of
reading for that.

01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:20.089
And eventually, I did write
that book six years later.

01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:22.130
So the Radcliffe fellowship
and other fellowships

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:23.838
that I've gotten were
absolutely crucial,

01:06:23.838 --> 01:06:27.650
because what they do is they
provide time and space where

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:31.127
the crucial work of thinking
is allowed to happen.

01:06:31.127 --> 01:06:32.960
And unfortunately, you
can't legislate that.

01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.220
You can plan for it.

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.360
I'm going to finish
this book within a year.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:39.382
We say that in our applications,
even though, realistically, we

01:06:39.382 --> 01:06:41.090
know that's probably
not going to happen.

01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:42.290
But we need that year--

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:42.790
- Excuse me.

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:44.039
- of freedom-- oh, you did it.

01:06:44.039 --> 01:06:44.600
You did it.

01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:45.975
Well, that's great.

01:06:45.975 --> 01:06:48.100
You probably got an A in
every class you ever took.

01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:53.281
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:53.281 --> 01:06:55.130
- No, I'm the one
who dropped out

01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:58.012
of Stanford Business School.

01:06:58.012 --> 01:06:59.990
- But you got into
Stanford Business School.

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.490
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:00.490 --> 01:07:01.810
- Of course.

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.594
I got into Harvard
Business School as well.

01:07:04.594 --> 01:07:06.260
I'm just that kind
of irritating person.

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.790
- I was rejected
by every college

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:08.950
I applied to, except one.

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:12.870
- It doesn't matter.

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:13.730
You only need one.

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.160
You only need one.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.510
So you had a good
year at Radcliffe

01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:18.560
and here you are back.

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:23.448
And I think on that note,
it's time to take questions.

01:07:23.448 --> 01:07:25.791
- Jim Haber was one of the
Radcliffe fellows of my year

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:26.290
too.

01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:28.820
- You know him as well.

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:31.050
- As a Vietnamese
writer, I guess

01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:33.970
it would be interesting if you
talked about your reception

01:07:33.970 --> 01:07:36.630
by Vietnamese--

01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:40.586
by the Vietnamese government
and by Vietnam in general.

01:07:40.586 --> 01:07:44.790
- Well, The Refugees was
translated into Vietnamese.

01:07:44.790 --> 01:07:48.600
And the interesting thing was
that the censorship mechanism

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:51.480
removed an entire short
story from the book War

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.180
Years, which was the only
autobiographical story I'd ever

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:55.510
written.

01:07:55.510 --> 01:08:00.410
The overseas Vietnamese edition
will have War Years in it.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:04.154
I'm aware that censorship
politics and suppression

01:08:04.154 --> 01:08:05.820
of dissidents and all
that kind of stuff

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:08.239
is a very real issue
in Vietnam, which

01:08:08.239 --> 01:08:09.780
is why I can never
go back to Vietnam

01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:12.630
and be a writer in Vietnam.

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.820
The Sympathizer, when
we sold the rights

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.260
to another Vietnamese
publisher, I

01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:19.229
thought, why would they
buy this book, because how

01:08:19.229 --> 01:08:21.120
do you translate this
book into Vietnam?

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:24.479
The last quarter of the novel
is a very serious critique

01:08:24.479 --> 01:08:25.581
of Vietnamese communism.

01:08:25.581 --> 01:08:27.330
They'd have to cut out
the entire quarter.

01:08:27.330 --> 01:08:29.060
You can cut out a short story
from a short story collection,

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:29.976
and it can still work.

01:08:29.976 --> 01:08:32.890
But you can't cut out a quarter
of a novel and make it happen.

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:33.670
So I don't know.

01:08:33.670 --> 01:08:35.950
I really don't know whether
the translation would ever

01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:38.879
be allowed and whether
the government will

01:08:38.879 --> 01:08:40.920
allow it to be published
in an uncensored manner.

01:08:43.779 --> 01:08:44.529
- Hi.

01:08:44.529 --> 01:08:46.990
I'm a high school teacher,
and I taught The Sympathizer

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:49.210
last year to 11
and 12th graders.

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:52.229
And it was a
wonderful experience.

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:54.130
And one of the things
that we talked about

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.890
as we were discussing the
book was the role of gender.

01:08:56.890 --> 01:08:58.810
And I just so appreciated
the interviews

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:03.640
that you did where you
talked about how you realized

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.220
your writing of
gender and the way

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:10.149
you wanted to potentially
revisit some of those gender

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:11.800
dynamics in the sequel.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:14.020
So I wonder if you
could speak to how

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:17.410
you came to discover that
about your own writing,

01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:20.170
because it was just such a
beautiful public acknowledgment

01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:23.099
of that and where
you are now with it.

01:09:23.099 --> 01:09:25.390
- Well, going back to the
anxiety of influence question

01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:27.550
and being Maxine's student.

01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:30.250
Looking back upon myself
as a 19- or 20-year-old,

01:09:30.250 --> 01:09:32.290
I think there's no
doubt that part of what

01:09:32.290 --> 01:09:35.109
I was struggling with was
masculinity, Asian American

01:09:35.109 --> 01:09:36.943
masculinity but just
masculinity in general,

01:09:36.943 --> 01:09:39.275
and trying to become this
angry writer and revolutionary

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:40.609
and all that kind of stuff.

01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:44.859
And so I wasn't interested
in ambiguity or nuance

01:09:44.859 --> 01:09:47.370
or feminist politics
or anything like that.

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:49.210
And that's a real problem.

01:09:49.210 --> 01:09:52.930
And I took great
enjoyment in reading books

01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:54.580
that were very masculine.

01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:58.151
That's why I like the spy
genre and the detective genre.

01:09:58.151 --> 01:10:00.400
And in writing The Sympathizer,
I chose the spy genre,

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.840
because I like that genre.

01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.430
But once I chose
the genre, I was

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:05.007
locked into many
of its conventions,

01:10:05.007 --> 01:10:07.090
especially after I constructed
my narrator the way

01:10:07.090 --> 01:10:09.300
that he was.

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.959
But I didn't feel
that I was locked

01:10:10.959 --> 01:10:12.250
in when I was writing the book.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:15.290
I just felt pleasure.

01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:17.860
And at a certain point
after having constructed

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:21.520
a character who is an
alcoholic and a womanizer

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.105
and a very masculine
person, about 2/3

01:10:23.105 --> 01:10:24.980
of the way through the
book, I also realized,

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.710
he's a misogynist.

01:10:26.710 --> 01:10:29.860
He enjoys his pleasure
of women too much,

01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:32.770
and perhaps he does because
I enjoy it too much.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:35.830
And at that point, it was
not possible to reconstruct

01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:38.380
the novel in a feminist fashion.

01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:41.980
But I had to think about how
to work out the gender dynamics

01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:44.590
in the frame of the novel.

01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:47.650
And that's why the
last third of the novel

01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:49.240
turns out the way
it does, which is

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:52.930
not only about an
interrogation of himself,

01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:57.550
literally, but also about
how that interrogation pivots

01:10:57.550 --> 01:11:00.190
the treatment and the
spectacle of women.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.470
Even so, that's still
problematic, of course,

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:07.810
because how do you--

01:11:07.810 --> 01:11:10.690
you're caught in this
issue of acknowledging

01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:14.260
that sexual exploitation
and rape and sexual violence

01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:15.885
have always been a part of war.

01:11:15.885 --> 01:11:18.010
But how do you talk about
it without exploiting it?

01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:20.135
But if you don't show it,
how do you talk about it?

01:11:20.135 --> 01:11:22.730
And so the end of the novel
can be read in different ways,

01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:24.640
whether it successfully
tries to depict that,

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.240
or whether it simply continues
to reinforce that exploitation.

01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.260
I don't know.

01:11:29.260 --> 01:11:31.260
But again, that was
one of the reasons why

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:33.262
I felt like I needed
to write a sequel,

01:11:33.262 --> 01:11:34.720
not only to talk
about what happens

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.400
to a revolutionary
who's been destroyed

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.380
and how he rebuilds
himself, but what

01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:41.800
happens to a man who's forced to
confront his own masculinity as

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:42.577
well.

01:11:42.577 --> 01:11:44.485
- Thank you very much.

01:11:47.347 --> 01:11:50.950
- You mentioned your parents
several times in the podium

01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:53.440
and in the chair, and
you said a cliffhanger

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.810
that I wanted to resolve for us.

01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:57.430
You said, imagine
telling your parents

01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:58.596
you want to become a writer.

01:11:58.596 --> 01:12:00.010
Well, I can't imagine.

01:12:00.010 --> 01:12:03.040
So how did you tell
them or ask them?

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:05.770
What did they expect
you to become?

01:12:05.770 --> 01:12:06.761
And how did they react?

01:12:06.761 --> 01:12:09.010
- Well, I never told them I
wanted to become a writer.

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:12.220
I told them instead,
I'll become a professor,

01:12:12.220 --> 01:12:14.340
and I'm going to get a
doctorate in English.

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.960
And fortunately, I
had Vietnamese parents

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.065
who were liberal in
just one respect,

01:12:19.065 --> 01:12:20.315
and that was around education.

01:12:20.315 --> 01:12:23.170
And they said, OK, it's not
as good as a medical doctorate

01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:25.830
like your brother, but
it's still a doctorate.

01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:27.780
Now, all you have
to do is get a job.

01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:30.040
And so literally, I
thought of my academic work

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:33.620
as my day job, my fantasy life.

01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:36.910
What I really wanted to
do was to become a writer.

01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:39.485
So that was how I held off
my parents for a long time.

01:12:39.485 --> 01:12:41.860
It's like the fact that my
parents are devoutly Catholic,

01:12:41.860 --> 01:12:43.151
they don't know I'm an atheist.

01:12:43.151 --> 01:12:46.060
I don't go home and tell them,
I'm an atheist mom and dad.

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:49.750
That was my way of negotiating
these dynamics with my parents.

01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:51.868
- Thank you.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.690
- If you could please
identify yourself.

01:12:53.690 --> 01:12:54.980
- Sure.

01:12:54.980 --> 01:12:56.090
My name is Dan.

01:12:56.090 --> 01:12:58.260
As a second generation
Vietnamese American,

01:12:58.260 --> 01:13:00.920
I have to ask, do you
think the role of memory

01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:03.800
will change or be different
between the first generation

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:06.530
and second generation in how
subsequent generations will

01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:09.948
relate to the fading
memory of the war?

01:13:09.948 --> 01:13:13.762
- Well, I think it's
inevitable that as--

01:13:13.762 --> 01:13:16.220
right now, for example, we're
dealing with third generation

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:17.210
Vietnamese Americans.

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:19.751
And in Vietnam, we're dealing
with a majority population that

01:13:19.751 --> 01:13:21.560
was born after the Vietnam War.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:25.280
They have the right to imagine a
different kind of future that's

01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:28.850
not tied to the past.

01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:31.260
For me, I don't
have that choice.

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:33.440
I feel like I'm psychically
connected to Vietnam

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.300
in some way, because
I was born there.

01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:36.841
And that was one
reason, for example,

01:13:36.841 --> 01:13:39.800
why I never changed my name
to become Troy, for example.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.910
I'm still Viet.

01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:44.990
So I am indelibly
marked by that past.

01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:47.150
And I think any movement
towards the future

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:50.030
has to be that negotiation
between turning away

01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:52.580
from the past but also
confronting the past,

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:54.330
simultaneously.

01:13:54.330 --> 01:13:57.140
And the reality of it, I
think, for Vietnamese people

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.990
in Vietnam or the country
of Vietnam, for example,

01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:01.710
is that that's not
actually happening.

01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:03.470
The country is completely
future-oriented,

01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:07.970
for the most part, in terms of
building a capitalist society

01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:12.725
but at the expense of actually
dealing with its past.

01:14:12.725 --> 01:14:14.900
The past that it
has is completely

01:14:14.900 --> 01:14:17.370
ossified into a
celebration of communism,

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:20.450
which totally erases people like
you and me and our families.

01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:21.950
So we haven't yet
reached that point

01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:25.070
of being able to both
go towards the future

01:14:25.070 --> 01:14:27.170
by having acknowledged the past.

01:14:27.170 --> 01:14:29.680
- Thank you.

01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.790
- Hi.

01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:34.150
My name is [? Yun ?] Nguyen
and I'm a Vietnamese American.

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:36.799
I was born in Vietnam and
moved here when I was 10.

01:14:36.799 --> 01:14:39.340
And actually, it's interesting
he asked that right before me,

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:42.550
because our questions
share similar themes.

01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:46.150
So my question revolves
around the trauma

01:14:46.150 --> 01:14:50.380
that's so tied to
immigrant identities

01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:53.830
and how with your family
was tied to the war.

01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:57.514
But with the word Vietnam
shifting every day

01:14:57.514 --> 01:14:59.680
because the country in and
of itself and its culture

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:03.190
and its people shifts every
day, how do you personally

01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:06.900
reconcile the Vietnamese
part of you that's

01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:08.500
obligated so much to the past?

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:11.290
How do you look forward to
the other aspect of it that's

01:15:11.290 --> 01:15:13.920
still continually shifting?

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.760
- Well I think that that's why
I look to the next generation,

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:21.010
because I don't think I can.

01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:24.070
I think that for me, the past
is going to remain continually

01:15:24.070 --> 01:15:24.725
important.

01:15:24.725 --> 01:15:26.350
But what's critical
for someone like me

01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:29.890
is to not obligate the
next generation to continue

01:15:29.890 --> 01:15:32.710
to genuflect before my
past, because that's

01:15:32.710 --> 01:15:34.750
what I encountered in
the Vietnamese community.

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:36.000
You would go to
Vietnamese events,

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.270
and they would be
completely dominated

01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:39.353
by the perspectives of the
previous generation who

01:15:39.353 --> 01:15:41.350
would talk on and on
and on about culture

01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:43.840
and tradition and remembering
what was done to us.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.390
And I was like, when do
I get a chance to speak?

01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:47.920
So I got my chance
to speak, which

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:51.575
means that I have to then
allow that there will

01:15:51.575 --> 01:15:53.950
be a new generation that's
going to be saying things that

01:15:53.950 --> 01:15:57.310
will completely catch
made by surprise.

01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:59.560
And that's necessary.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.630
That's absolutely crucial.

01:16:01.630 --> 01:16:04.600
But also in my own
work, I think that's why

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:08.549
I think that it's
important to write fiction

01:16:08.549 --> 01:16:10.590
that both addresses the
Vietnam War, for example,

01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:13.060
but tries to shift our
understanding of that as well,

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.338
so we're not stuck in the
same definitions of the past.

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:17.314
- Thank you.

01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.970
- Hi.

01:16:21.970 --> 01:16:23.900
My name is Delores Johnson.

01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.960
I write essays on mixed race.

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:27.770
My father's black.

01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:28.580
My mother's white.

01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:35.300
And I have a manuscript, which
is a multigenerational memoir

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:39.680
on the evolution of mixed
race placement in America

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.506
that was turned
down by your editor.

01:16:41.506 --> 01:16:43.480
- I'm sorry.

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:45.170
- He told me that
it was too soft.

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:49.640
And so my question is, how did
you get in touch with the anger

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:52.130
and get it on the page so
that you could let it rip?

01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:54.461
How did you get in
touch with that?

01:16:54.461 --> 01:16:57.360
- Well, the anger was
actually always there.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.910
The essay that I gave to get
into Maxine Hong Kingston's

01:16:59.910 --> 01:17:02.280
class, for example, was
about being Asian in America,

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:05.160
and it was really angry.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.370
And then what happened was I
became a professional academic,

01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:10.292
and you can't be
angry as an academic.

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:11.250
It's not going to work.

01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:15.430
You need to tamp things down,
keep things under control.

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:19.271
And what I also recognized in
reading a lot of, for example,

01:17:19.271 --> 01:17:21.270
Asian American literature
was that there was not

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:23.560
a lot of anger there.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:25.680
And I think people
had tamped it down.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.690
They recognized that
it would be easier

01:17:27.690 --> 01:17:30.840
to function as Asian
Americans in American society

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.590
if they directed their anger
inwards towards their family,

01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:38.610
for example, or towards whatever
their community happens to be.

01:17:38.610 --> 01:17:40.690
And so it was liberating
for me to think that.

01:17:40.690 --> 01:17:44.539
It was crucial to not only do
that work, which is necessary.

01:17:44.539 --> 01:17:46.830
You have to be angry at
wherever the trauma comes from,

01:17:46.830 --> 01:17:49.413
even if it comes within your own
family or your own community.

01:17:49.413 --> 01:17:53.160
But you have to be angry at
the external forces that have

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:55.680
led to that situation as well.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.050
You have to be angry at
structures and societies

01:17:58.050 --> 01:17:59.460
and dominant culture.

01:17:59.460 --> 01:18:01.780
That's a little
bit harder to do.

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:04.200
Because if you do that,
you're opening yourself up

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:08.290
to greater punishment
and censorship

01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:11.262
by the people who have
that kind of power.

01:18:11.262 --> 01:18:12.720
So not having read
your manuscript,

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.830
I don't know where the softness
is that the editor detects.

01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:19.930
But another way of
putting it is that idea,

01:18:19.930 --> 01:18:22.800
to use a whole bunch of
cliches, cut closer to the bone,

01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:26.070
don't pull the
punches, say the things

01:18:26.070 --> 01:18:28.290
that you're afraid
of saying, find out

01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:31.890
what it is you're afraid
of saying and decide why--

01:18:31.890 --> 01:18:35.760
figure out why you're afraid of
saying those kinds of things.

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:38.310
Oftentimes, we're afraid
of saying these things,

01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:41.580
because we've been told not
to say them by our families,

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:45.780
by our community, and by
dominant society as well.

01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:46.280
- Thank you.

01:18:51.071 --> 01:18:51.570
- Hello.

01:18:51.570 --> 01:18:52.500
My name is Layla.

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:55.080
I'm a student in Professor
Claire Messud's Advanced

01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.515
Fiction Writing Workshop.

01:18:56.515 --> 01:18:58.140
Before I ask my
question, I just wanted

01:18:58.140 --> 01:19:01.500
to say thank you for all
the work that you've done.

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:04.560
I used to be a refugee
as well from Afghanistan.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.800
I grew up in a refugee
camp until the age of six.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.730
At age 10, we returned
to Afghanistan,

01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:13.350
and that's where I've been
living until the age of 18.

01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:15.240
And being at Harvard
has been very strange,

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:17.880
but it's been books like
yours that have really

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:21.572
helped me make sense, especially
your book Nothing Ever Dies.

01:19:21.572 --> 01:19:24.030
It has informed the way that
I think, the way that I write.

01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:27.000
So I just wanted to
say thank you for that.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.500
So as for my
question, you talked

01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:32.180
about how you lacked
the emotional maturity

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.640
in the beginning to
confront the things that you

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:36.040
were writing about.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:38.490
So I wanted to ask, how
did you come to reach

01:19:38.490 --> 01:19:39.540
that emotional maturity?

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:41.510
And what did that
process look like?

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:46.280
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.590
- There's many, many
ways that happened.

01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:52.100
But for example,
when I was your age

01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:54.230
and trying to be a writer
and everything like that,

01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:56.420
yes, I believed I wanted to be
a writer because of the beauty

01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:57.740
of the art and everything.

01:19:57.740 --> 01:19:59.895
But I also wanted to be a writer
because I wanted to be famous.

01:19:59.895 --> 01:20:01.353
Wouldn't it be cool
to be a writer,

01:20:01.353 --> 01:20:05.180
and I don't know
exactly what that meant.

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:07.560
But after 20 years of
struggling to become a writer

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.890
and confronting failure and
everything like that, which

01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:12.110
was a very discouraging
experience,

01:20:12.110 --> 01:20:15.620
the positive outcome of
that is that it boiled away

01:20:15.620 --> 01:20:18.020
all the unimportant things--

01:20:18.020 --> 01:20:21.200
prizes, vanities, success,
all that kind of stuff--

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.490
publications--

01:20:22.490 --> 01:20:25.130
and left me with the
importance of simply the act

01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:26.400
of writing itself.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.150
So after writing The Refugees
for 17 years, for example,

01:20:29.150 --> 01:20:32.270
I thought, I can let that go.

01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:34.220
If that book never
sees the light of day,

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.053
I should be OK with it,
because it taught me

01:20:36.053 --> 01:20:37.610
how to write The Sympathizer.

01:20:37.610 --> 01:20:41.210
And that was emotional
maturity, because it was about--

01:20:41.210 --> 01:20:43.730
part of the emotional
maturity is hopefully

01:20:43.730 --> 01:20:46.220
being able to divorce
oneself for a while

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:47.930
from the contaminations
of the world,

01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:50.540
even if one has to return
to them, eventually.

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:53.120
The other emotional
maturity was getting married

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.610
and having a child and becoming
a father, all that kind

01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:56.870
of really personal stuff.

01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:59.120
That brought me
outside of myself.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.870
That made me think about others.

01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:04.100
And I think that is one
kind of emotional maturity,

01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:06.135
and it's completely
related to the task

01:21:06.135 --> 01:21:07.760
of writing that I
set for myself, which

01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:10.792
is about writing about others.

01:21:10.792 --> 01:21:11.700
- Thank you.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.050
- Thank you.

01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:15.870
- Well, that was a
fabulous conversation.

01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:16.470
Thank you.

01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:18.320
[APPLAUSE]
