00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.990
The client interacts with the rest of this pattern

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.860
through an abstract interface.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.180
For example, if your application provides the end-user a way of

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.940
drawing diagrams, then the abstract interface might have the name Graphic.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.440
If you were modeling an organization and

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.660
its employees, you might use the term Unit.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.220
To indicate the general nature of the pattern, GoF uses the term component.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.290
In the diagram you can see that the client class talks to the component class,

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.580
and that the component class is abstract because its name is in italics.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.440
The component class has a variety of operations as well as the ability to add

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.060
and remove children and access any of the children of the component that exists.
