WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.960
And I think on some level,
American policy is a red herring.

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:09.270
The U S is 15% of global emissions.
Um,
and we're falling.

3
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.880
The future of climate of the world will be determined by China,
by India,

4
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.370
by sub Saharan Africa.
Those are carbon footprints that are growing.

5
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:20.760
China's now almost twice as big a carbon footprint as the u s and they're

6
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:24.920
building all this infrastructure outside of China that doesn't even count,
um,

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.870
in Asia,
in Africa,
you know,
the Belton road.
Do you know this project?

8
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.620
So basically taking the model that the US had with like the Suez Canal in the

9
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:35.820
Panama Canal and they're building the infrastructure of the developing world.

10
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.200
So recently they,
they loaned um,

11
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.970
Kenya a huge amount of money to build a new rail line,

12
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.680
which was again being built with Chinese workers.
They built a rail line,

13
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.980
um,
then they can,
you can pay back the debt.

14
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.430
So China is threatening to take over the entire port of Mombasa as debt

15
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:03.630
repayment.
And this is like going on all around the world.
Highways across Africa,

16
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:08.220
across Asia are being built by Chinese workers as an in an effort to build a

17
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:11.430
new,
an imperial infrastructure for themselves.

18
00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.750
And is the thought that they're doing this in terms of setting up the debt in a

19
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:19.650
way that's unpayable so that they could take over.
I,
that's one motive.

20
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.890
I think that the Kenya exam,
but they'd be happy if the deck get repaid.

21
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.030
I think it's,
they're,

22
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:29.031
they're stitching together an alternative to the western infrastructure of trade

23
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:30.750
and transit.

24
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.430
They're basically stitching together an entire second system of how the world

25
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:36.840
will work,
how the economy will work,

26
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:41.010
and it will be conducted through their own infrastructure and through their own

27
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:42.420
ports and through their own airports.

28
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.970
And that's being done by their own standards.

29
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:48.300
So China is now pouring more concrete,
um,

30
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.100
every three years than the entire,

31
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.640
than the u s poured in the entire 20th century.
She's crying.

32
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:56.520
If concrete were a country,
it would be the world's third biggest carbon emitter.

33
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.850
So the,
the,
the path of development of these other countries,
China,
India,

34
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:07.800
and sub Saharan Africa are really what's going to be writing the story of the

35
00:02:07.801 --> 00:02:09.720
future.
America has a kind of,

36
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.960
I think like a mar moral obligation to lead because historically we had the

37
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:16.110
biggest carbon footprint.

38
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.880
But at the moment we're a relatively small part of the problem and within the u

39
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:24.660
s market forces are doing a lot of,
are making a lot of progress for us.
Um,

40
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.500
so the real issue is how do we figure out a new geopolitics that forces

41
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:33.540
countries like China to act better?

42
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.670
And one answer may be as weird as it is to say that,
um,
you know,

43
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:40.380
Xi Jinping is basically a dictator.

44
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.130
If he wants to impose new standards,

45
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:46.200
if he wants to invest aggressively in green energy,

46
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.130
he doesn't have any of the AHP political obstacles that we have in the u s and

47
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:54.360
so there's this sort of weird sympathy among American climate people for that,

48
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.800
um,
authoritarianism.
And he has,

49
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.430
especially since Trump has been elected,

50
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.420
been a lot more aggressive about talking about climate because he sees if

51
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:05.620
America's not going to be leading,

52
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:09.640
this is an opportunity for China to be like the real face of climate.

53
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.610
And that means they've paid,
you know,

54
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.990
they've invested a ton in solar and wind.
They've done a lot with air pollution.

55
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:21.550
So Beijing used to be really awful in 2013 they more than a million Chinese

56
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:25.840
people died of air pollution and now that's much better.
Um,
what have they done?

57
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.480
Just imposing stricter standards on,
um,
on pollution,
emissions,

58
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.340
coal plants,
things like that kind of stuff.
Yeah.
And um,
but you know,

59
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.700
we think about,
we think about carbon and the whole problem,

60
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.760
I think a little too much in terms of energy.

61
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.120
Energy is just 30% of the global carbon footprint.

62
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.910
And it's the easiest one to solve because wind and solar is actually really

63
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.610
cheap.
Now.
Most parts of the world is cheaper than dirty energy.

64
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.720
What's the majority of the footprint?
Well,
it's all,
nothing's a majority,

65
00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.280
but so there's energy,
there's infrastructure,
there's transportation.

66
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.310
Um,
and agriculture is like a huge underappreciated part of it.

67
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:07.030
It's something like,
I don't know,
30% of the global footprint.
Um,

68
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.080
is it because of tractors or what does it recover?
Everything.
Everything.

69
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.180
Everything that you need to do to run a farm.
I mean,

70
00:04:13.181 --> 00:04:16.780
really everything you need to do to live in the world has some kind of carbon

71
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:21.010
footprint.
But you know,
if we were able to like feed all our cattle seaweed,

72
00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.160
that would have like a big,
that would have a big impact.
Um,

73
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.670
but all kinds of crops have,
um,
have carbon footprints and they,

74
00:04:27.671 --> 00:04:32.110
but they would still have to do something to get the seaweed and have the

75
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:35.950
seaweed travel the seaweed.
Yeah.
Deliver it to these farms.
Well,

76
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:36.781
you could also do,
you know,

77
00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:40.410
you could imagine lab grown meat having a much smaller carbon footprint.
Um,

78
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.710
I mean,
it should,
if it proceeds as we expect it will.
Um,

79
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.800
and like I said before,
like when you look at each particular threat,

80
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:50.470
there's like,
you can see reasons for optimism.
You can see like,
oh,

81
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:52.240
we'll figure it out in this way.
We'll figure it out in that way.

82
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.750
But the UN says we need to have all of our global emissions by 2030 to have a

83
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:03.940
chance of averting two degrees of warming,
which they call catastrophic warming.

84
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.900
And the projects that we need to put into place in those 11 years are just much

85
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:16.090
bigger than I think we're capable of pulling off.
They say the UN says,

86
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.510
what is necessary is a global mobilization at the level of World War II against

87
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:25.840
climate starting this year,

88
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.200
2019 and there's just no chance to work in to do that anytime soon.

89
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:36.370
I mean,
maybe 10 years from now we'll get there.
That may even be optimistic.
Um,

90
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.820
but the total decarbonization that's required is we need to totally zero out on

91
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:46.180
carbon by 2050 they say.
Um,
and I just think,
you know,

92
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.480
a lot of these sectors are much trickier.

93
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.760
We could maybe zero out on energy,

94
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.140
zero on carbon when it comes to energy in 15 years if we wanted to.
But again,

95
00:05:56.141 --> 00:05:59.420
that's just 30%.
The total problem.
Um,

96
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.820
which is why I think there's the negative emissions stuff.

97
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:06.530
The carbon capture is so important because it will allow us to move more slowly

98
00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.220
than the UN says we need to.
And still if it works out,

99
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.380
you know,
keep the planet relatively stable,
relatively livable.
Um,

100
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.130
but that's,
you know,
those technologies have been called magical,

101
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.640
magical thinking by the Journal of Nature,

102
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:26.150
which is like the biggest scientific journal,
um,
writing about this stuff.

103
00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:29.720
So it's sort of a leap of faith to think that they could solve that problem.

104
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.970
<v 1>Do you think that we're dealing with like shifts in degrees of perception that</v>

105
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:39.770
it,
it is things like your book,
things like Al Gore's movie,

106
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:40.790
things like,
you know,

107
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:44.040
anytime there's a new story that's written in the New York Times or in any,

108
00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:47.180
any periodical,
we need more of this.

109
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:51.200
He needs to be hammered home to people that it's needs to be something that's a,

110
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:53.690
a global discussion that accelerates.

111
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.780
<v 0>Totally.
And I think that that's happening.
You know,
I think,
um,</v>

112
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.160
there was this big report that the UN did in October that spurred a lot of

113
00:07:02.161 --> 00:07:06.150
conversation about it.
And I think that in a grotesque way,

114
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.540
the best teacher is just extreme weather.
You know,

115
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.370
when you see every year these California wildfires,
every year they're burning.

116
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.500
And that is really dramatic.

117
00:07:16.501 --> 00:07:19.830
People I talked to in Europe are focused on the California fires,

118
00:07:19.831 --> 00:07:20.910
even though they have wild fires over there.

119
00:07:20.911 --> 00:07:22.980
There's something about the California fires that they're really worried about

120
00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.780
when you see these global heat waves,

121
00:07:24.781 --> 00:07:27.600
when you see unprecedented hurricane seasons,

122
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.760
we just had the typhoon in the Pacific in February,

123
00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:32.940
first time in recorded history.
Um,
you know,

124
00:07:32.941 --> 00:07:37.460
when every day on the news there's some,
um,
there's some,
you know,

125
00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:41.340
dramatic extreme weather and when they come one after the other,

126
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:45.350
I think that's a really powerful teaching tool.
So,
you know,
there's,

127
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:49.590
this term is now outdated,
but 500 year storm,

128
00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:53.610
you hear a lot about 500 year storm means,
you know,

129
00:07:53.611 --> 00:07:58.611
hurricane that would hit a particular area once every five centuries,

130
00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:03.090
right?
That means five centuries ago there were no white people in America.

131
00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:08.550
So that means we're talking about a storm that would hump come once as colonists

132
00:08:08.551 --> 00:08:11.400
came to America as they,
you know,

133
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.640
committed genocide against the native Americans as they built their own empire.

134
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:18.930
So they built an empire of slaves and cotton as they fought a civil war.

135
00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.910
They fought world war one's,
they fought World War II.

136
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.310
Everything that we've done would expect one,

137
00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.000
one storm of that kind.
In that time,

138
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.960
hurricane Harvey was the third 500 year storm to hit Houston in three years.

139
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.280
We are living in such unprecedented climate that it's impossible to look at the

140
00:08:40.261 --> 00:08:45.261
news and not learn that despite all of our inclinations,

141
00:08:45.571 --> 00:08:48.690
all of our reflexes to look away,
I think it is seeping in.

142
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:52.170
I think people are beginning to be more alarmed about it and I think alarm is

143
00:08:52.171 --> 00:08:55.360
really useful.
There are people in the climate community who think,
you know,
it's,

144
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.050
it's dangerous to scare people,
it turns them off.

145
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:01.320
But I'm somebody who is awakened to this out of fear.

146
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.320
And when I look at the history of environmental activism,

147
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:07.230
when I look at activism generally like we don't try to get people to stop

148
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:09.960
smoking cigarettes by like messaging through optimism.

149
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:12.780
We try to get them to stop because we tell them how bad it's going to be for

150
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:15.840
them.
Drunk driving,
nuclear proliferation.
Same thing.

151
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:19.530
Rachel Carson wrote silent spring about pesticides.

152
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.210
It was called hyperbolic alarmist.

153
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.500
It led to the creation of the EPA and you know when you think about that UN

154
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:29.190
directive that we should be mobilizing at the scale of World War II to come back

155
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:32.220
climate.
We didn't fight World War II out of hope.

156
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:37.280
We fought world war two out of panic and I think that that should be part of how

157
00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:41.550
we think about this story.
Obviously I think,
you know,

158
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:44.850
when I look around the world,
when I talk to anyone,
when I talked to my family,

159
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:47.400
when I watch TV,
when I watch to move,
whatever,
read stuff,

160
00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.510
it just seems obvious to me that there are many more people who are still too

161
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:54.630
complacent about this issue.
Even if they're concerned about it a little bit.

162
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:56.910
Even if they're aware of it.
Um,

163
00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.930
they don't think of it as like the overarching all encompassing story of our

164
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:05.160
time that requires an existential response.

165
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.750
And even saying those words make me uncomfortable because I like,
it's hard.

166
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.350
It's hard for me to believe that this is,
the threat is that big,

167
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.190
but that is what the science says.
Um,
and like I said before,

168
00:10:17.191 --> 00:10:18.660
some of that science is not going to get born out,

169
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:23.190
but when you look at the full scope of it and just how,
just how large,

170
00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.480
just how bleak the impacts will be,
you realize like,

171
00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:31.290
we really need to wake up to just how dangerous a world we're heading into and

172
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:33.300
do everything we can to avoid it.
Um,

173
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.720
in addition to probably planning to adapt.
