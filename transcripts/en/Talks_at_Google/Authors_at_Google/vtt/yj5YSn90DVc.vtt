JOHN HOLL: That I have this
really-- like, the coolest job

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.260
on the planet.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.400
And invariably there's
somebody in the crowd who's

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.170
saying, "Can I have your job?"

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.790
I imagine working for
a company like Google,

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.260
you guys are probably edging
me out on the coolness factor.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.040
So thank you for all
that you guys do.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.040
Technology has played a big part
in the evolving world of beer

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.630
these days.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.780
Everything from
apps that allow you

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:30.920
to check into beer, to
websites that review beer,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.060
to really just keeping breweries
in touch with consumers

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.640
these days.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.420
And technology, I
think, has really

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.759
spread the good
word of good beer,

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:41.300
not only throughout the US, but
throughout the world as well.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.630
I just came in from New
Zealand this afternoon.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.830
I was on an overnight flight.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.740
And their beer scene down
there is growing quite a bit.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.650
And it was amazing
to me how many people

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.150
kept saying, "Well I was
reading on the internet

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.499
about this particular brewery.

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:58.540
Have you been there yet?"

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:59.706
There's a lot of enthusiasm.

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:03.400
So technology and beer
are both very social.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.125
So cheers to what you guys do,
and thanks for having me here.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.660
We have beer on the table.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.180
So we're going to
do a beer tasting.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.180
I'm going to talk about
the history of the beer.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.430
I don't know why the
beers aren't open

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.971
and you guys aren't
already drinking,

00:01:18.971 --> 00:01:22.590
but let's do that
first, if we can.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.810
And I'm going to
steal from somebody.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:27.840
As we do it.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.550
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.720
We're going to
start with the can.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.720
We're going to start with
Maui Brewing Company--

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.645
the beer in the can
that's in front of you.

00:01:33.645 --> 00:01:36.020
That's probably helpful to
know, as opposed to all of you

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.735
guys going around and-- Hey.

00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:40.360
Thank you guys.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.970
So it's very important
to know that we

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.260
do have a limited amount
of beer for everybody.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.320
So share and share alike.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.270
Be Googly in your sharingness.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.770
Right?

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.110
Is that a thing?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.710
That's perfect.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.230
About that much or
a little bit less

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.750
for each of the
beers in your glass.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.320
And this is important for a
couple of different reasons.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.550
One, we want the aroma to build
in these particular glasses.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.930
Who's been to a
wine tasting before?

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.110
Who's been to a
beer tasting before?

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.610
OK.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.490
Who has not been to a
beer tasting before?

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.190
OK.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.310
So those of you who
have not been to a beer

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.660
tasting before, you're
in for a lot of fun.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.150
Those of you who've done it
before, you already know.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.900
You'll notice right
off the bat that there

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.280
are no dump buckets
on the table.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.855
That is because you are
supposed to drink the beer.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.880
And you're supposed
to enjoy the beer.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.489
If you don't like it,
give it your neighbor

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.030
and they'll finish
it off so that you

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.670
can fill up the next one.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.590
Tasting beer is really one
of the most important things

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.220
about experiencing
the beer overall.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.780
So let's just do
a quick tutorial

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.220
on how that works overall.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.890
So the first thing you want
to look at is the appearance.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.800
And if you have a little bit of
haze on the outside, that's OK.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.630
So you want to see what the
color of the beer looks like.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.100
And what does it
make you think of?

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.910
What does the straw golden
yellow liquid in front of you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:59.830
make you think of?

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.650
And if you give it a
little bit of a swirl,

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.210
you can see the carbonation.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.800
You can see that nice fluffy
white head appear on top.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.610
Beer is wonderful to look
at a lot of the time.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.310
But it's more fun to taste.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.940
But before we get
to that, we're now

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.190
going to do the aroma of beer.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.550
So there's two ways
of smelling a beer.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:26.370
You can do the bloodhound,
where you get your nose in.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.240
And you do a couple
quick sniffs.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.264
And then you can do the
drive-by-- which I know in LA

00:03:31.264 --> 00:03:32.680
means something
totally different.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.220
And while you're
doing that, so much

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.610
of what we taste--
90% about-- is aroma.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:41.670
It's aroma-driven.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.890
So what we perceive as taste
is really aroma-driven.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.220
So while you're smelling your
beer, think about food terms.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.530
We're going to talk about
that in a little bit.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.180
But think about what it
is that you're smelling.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.420
Is it sweet grain?

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.700
Is it corn?

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.730
Is it floral?

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.570
Think about the
beer in food terms

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.969
as you go along with this.

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.135
And then obviously the next
thing to do is to taste.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.350
Take whatever kind of sip
you're comfortable with.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.710
And then you can
take a smaller one.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.440
Really kind of see if the
aromas that you experience

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.160
with the beer-- and we're
going to have a range of beers

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.480
as we go through this today--
see if what you're smelling

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.200
matches what's on
your taste bud.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.640
See how different tastes,
acidity, astringency,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.300
sweetness, how all that
appears on your palate

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.330
once you've actually
tasted the beer.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.450
And really think
about those flavors.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.090
Then the next thing
is mouth feel.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.590
And wine people
know that mouth feel

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.480
is very important with wine.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.460
It's certainly very
important with beer.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.170
So take a sip, just
a small enough sip

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.210
to float your
tongue, essentially.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.640
And fell the carbonation
on your tongue.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.500
Is it robust carbonation?

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.080
Is it super fizzy?

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.650
Is it light?

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.410
Is it a little bit more mellow?

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.620
And then think about how
it coats your tongue.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.870
Is it watery?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.560
Is it thick?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.650
Is it falling somewhere
in the middle?

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:08.450
As we go on with some of
these-- and this particular beer

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.300
has a little bit of body to it.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.890
It's got a little bit more oompf
than some of those other lagers

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.240
that you might see out there.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.260
And for the color, it's got
a little bit more body to it.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:22.230
This is the Maui Bikini Blonde.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.030
This comes from Maui in Hawaii.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.560
It's a Helles Lager.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.340
And I have to go to
my cheat sheet here.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.870
It's 5.1% alcohol.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.920
And this to me is
what an American lager

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.280
should be these days, in the
promise that it can have.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.730
It's got these really nice
bready characteristics to it.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.688
It's got a little bit of
that floralness to it.

00:05:40.688 --> 00:05:44.070
It's even got a little bit of a
lemony characteristic in there

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.990
as well.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.220
I wish I could get this beer
in Jersey, where I live.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.660
But my wife and I spent
a week in Maui last year,

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.550
and I drank this by the case.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.940
And it was just-- it's a really,
really nice refreshing beer.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.660
And we're going to
talk a little bit

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.850
about the history
of beer in America.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.730
And it's interesting
to see that this

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.910
is where we're at with
beer these days-- that we

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.890
do once again have these rich,
full, flavorful lagers that

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:14.210
dominate-- or that are
beginning to come back

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.200
into the landscape.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.630
We were a country
founded by beer.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.380
The Mayflower landed
at Plymouth Rock

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.800
because, according to
the captain's diaries,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.364
their provisions were running
low-- especially their beer.

00:06:28.364 --> 00:06:30.030
They were drinking
beer on the way over.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.050
It was running low.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.550
And so they stopped
at Plymouth Rock

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.410
when they actually meant
to go down to Virginia.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.820
And so from the
very start, what we

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.605
think of like the
birth of this country,

00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:41.460
beer has played
an important role.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.320
The founding fathers-- all
of their various farms,

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.616
and plantations, and
estates, all brewed beer.

00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:49.990
A lot of people say that the
founding fathers brewed beer

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.290
themselves.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.100
Maybe.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.160
But chances are, they had the
women of the house doing it.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.840
Or they had somebody
else doing it.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.270
They were off doing other stuff.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:00.800
And typically the men
in the house in that era

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.881
were not necessarily
the brewers themselves.

00:07:03.881 --> 00:07:05.880
Over time, as we became
a country of immigrants,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.840
more people came
over in 1700s, 1800s.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:12.520
We were getting a lot of
people from UK, and Germany,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.571
and other parts of
the world that already

00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:17.070
had these established brewing
countries that had been around

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:19.349
for hundreds of years.

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:21.640
And as they set up in the
new cities on the East Coast,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.620
and then slowly moved
west, these people

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.470
who had been brewers back
in their own home countries

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.270
started opening
up breweries here.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.450
And so we were seeing
flavorful lagers.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.200
We were seeing many
thousands of breweries

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.960
operating around the country.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.420
And they were bringing their
home brewing traditions

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:42.030
to the US shores, using
what they could here.

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.240
This is where corn and
rice as added sweeteners

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.790
and fermentable sugars
came into play in brewing,

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.270
because that's just
simply what was available.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.090
We saw more local
breweries back then.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.880
We didn't have
refrigeration necessarily.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.000
And the brewers didn't have
the means to make a lot of beer

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.380
to ship it across the country.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.522
So if you lived
in New York City,

00:08:03.522 --> 00:08:06.160
you went to your brewery
that was down in the Bowery.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.540
Or you went to your brewery that
was on the upper parts of town,

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.040
or Brooklyn, or--
you drank local.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:16.960
And that's something that
our country lost for a while,

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:22.310
because Prohibition came
into being, as it were.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.990
And Prohibition was called
the noble experiment.

00:08:24.990 --> 00:08:26.600
It failed.

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.310
From 1920 to 1933, the
country was relatively dry.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.669
And during that time
a lot of the breweries

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:35.270
that were operating closed.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:39.340
Which was really devastating
to these smaller breweries.

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.960
When we came out on the other
side, we emerged into a world

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.480
where larger breweries
thrived, got bigger, started

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.750
to expand their
distribution network,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.642
and eventually became
the dominant players

00:08:54.642 --> 00:08:55.600
throughout the country.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.150
Smaller ones died off.

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.630
And so by the 1970s we were left
with not a great beer culture.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.010
Only less than 100
breweries where we once

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.370
had many thousands of
breweries in this country.

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.750
So we've sort of had
this very strange history

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.730
with beer in the US.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:15.940
And as people are
emptying their glasses,

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.580
we can start to open up the
Kellerweis from Sierra Nevada.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.330
Don't be shy about doing that.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:27.590
I'm going to-- this is going
to do wonders for my jet lag.

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.730
Oh yeah.

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.650
It's OK.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.280
If we had a little bit of
water, we can suss it out,

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:42.880
but I'm going to steal a
little bit from you as well.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.530
Thanks.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.350
And that's just a really
quick, brief history

00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:47.449
of beer in the US.

00:09:47.449 --> 00:09:49.740
I mean there's obviously been
books and books and books

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.406
written about this,
but since we're here

00:09:51.406 --> 00:09:53.120
to taste and talk
about food, that's

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.330
just sort of your quick one two.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:10:00.900
In the late 1970s when the
brewing culture had really

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.600
been decimated, we
got to this point

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.370
where it could have
gone one of two ways.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.260
And fortunately, it
went the good way.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.940
And it started with a
guy named Jack McAuliffe.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:17.050
In Sonoma in the late 1970s,
a former Naval engineer

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:19.510
who started home brewing
back when he was in the Navy

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:23.090
and stationed overseas, decided
to fabricate some equipment out

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.640
of some old stainless
dairy tanks, and opened up

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.640
and got a license for
a brewery in Sonoma.

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.370
And he called it New Albion,
and it made only a few barrels

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:37.620
of beer at a time, compared with
tens of millions being produced

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:41.140
by the larger
players on the scene.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.760
By most accounts the
beer needed some work.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.590
But the important thing
was that it was different.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.800
And it was small.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.770
And it gave people
an opportunity

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:53.620
to realize that beer
didn't have to just come

00:10:53.620 --> 00:11:00.380
from many different
factories with the same label

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:02.120
throughout the country.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.699
And so Jack up in Sonoma started
getting a lot of attention.

00:11:06.699 --> 00:11:08.240
He got a spread the
"New York Times."

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.700
He got a spread in the
"Washington Post.""

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.575
People started coming
from around the country

00:11:11.575 --> 00:11:12.674
to see what he was doing.

00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:14.340
University of California
up in Berkeley,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.380
which already had a professional
brewing school-- where

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.740
most of the students
who went through that

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.280
were destined for careers
at Anheuser-Busch,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.580
or Miller Brewing Company,
or Coors Brewing Company,

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.610
started taking field
trips to Jack's place

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.530
and see that you could
fabricate small equipment

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.930
and make flavorful ales and
lagers on your own terms,

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:38.450
and not just follow what had
become mass-produced beer.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.020
One of the people
who came and visited

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.180
owned a home brew supply shop
and a bicycle repair shop

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:47.090
in Chico, California.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:50.010
And he came down and he
saw what Jack was doing.

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:53.200
And this guy had a
particular engineering mind,

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.670
and looked around and
said, "I could do this."

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.450
And so the guy's
name is Ken Grossman.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.130
And he went back up to Chico.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.370
And then he co-founded the
Sierra Nevada Brewing Company,

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.210
which is what we're
drinking right now.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.840
We're drinking their Kellerweis,
which is a German-style wheat

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:19.720
beer that is-- going to my cheat
sheet again-- 4.8% alcohol.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.444
It is brewed with wheat
along with malted barley,

00:12:22.444 --> 00:12:24.860
so you're going to get a little
bit of that lemony flavor,

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.110
a little bit of
that tart flavor.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:29.420
And then as you
swirl it around, he

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:32.370
uses this really
distinctive yeast

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:36.110
that gives off a particular
flavor and a particular aroma.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:41.870
Is anybody picking up on
what the dominant aroma is?

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.250
Getting some citrus.

00:12:44.250 --> 00:12:47.310
[INAUDIBLE] yup.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:48.060
Banana.

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:48.672
That's it.

00:12:48.672 --> 00:12:50.630
And now that we've said
that, is everybody else

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.540
picking up the banana now?

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.380
Yeah.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:54.380
Beer is very suggestive.

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:55.546
I could have said, "Oh yeah.

00:12:55.546 --> 00:12:56.810
Chocolate-covered cherries."

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.268
And people would
say, "Oh yeah, No.

00:12:58.268 --> 00:12:59.435
I can get that as well."

00:12:59.435 --> 00:13:01.320
I love screwing around
with people like that.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.250
I like you guys too much,
so I'm not going to do that.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:05.720
Yet.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.060
But yeah, banana.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.970
A little bit of clove
in there as well.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:14.230
It's a really nice,
refreshing beer.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.760
And Sierra Nevada is now the
second largest craft brewery

00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:19.120
in America.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.870
They just celebrated 34 years.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:23.380
They're almost 35 now.

00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:26.860
And they're producing just
about a million barrels

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:27.510
of beer a year.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.859
They're going to grow
in the years to come.

00:13:29.859 --> 00:13:32.150
Jack McAuliffe started with
about seven barrels of beer

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:33.150
a year.

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.680
If memory serves,
in the five years

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.140
that he lasted, the
best year that he had,

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.970
he produced somewhere
around 400 barrels.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.900
There's 31 1/2 gallons in the
barrel, just for scale of size.

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:49.550
So Jack did 400
and change barrels.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.640
Sierra Nevada, which was
inspired by Jack McAuliffe,

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.480
is now doing well
over a million.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:57.201
And they're going to continue
to grow with the new facility

00:13:57.201 --> 00:13:57.700
as well.

00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.550
So Jack only lasted five years.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.430
And the historian Maureen
Ogle, who wrote a great book

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.350
about the history of beer,
called "Jack's Brewery:

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.910
The Most Successful Failed
Brewery in America."

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.334
Because he really did inspire so
much of what's going on today.

00:14:11.334 --> 00:14:13.000
So if you still have
beer in your glass,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.920
I always like to just
do a quick toast to Jack

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.800
to thank him for where
we are these days.

00:14:21.551 --> 00:14:23.550
Does anybody have any
questions while we're just

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:26.420
getting started?

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:27.530
It's the yeast.

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:32.791
So we should talk about
that a little bit.

00:14:32.791 --> 00:14:35.800
There's four main
ingredients in beer.

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.030
And it's water, it's malt,
it's hops, and it's yeast.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.170
And each of those
particular beers

00:14:41.170 --> 00:14:44.950
have their own food
flavors to them.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.350
And that's really where the
beer industry is right now,

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.290
is thinking about beer as food.

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:52.480
Beer is food.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:56.630
But it's so difficult
sometimes to get that message

00:14:56.630 --> 00:15:00.170
across for some of the brewers
because they're talking about,

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.220
"Well this is malty,
or this is hoppy.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:05.222
Or, you know, boy it's got these
great yeast esters to them.

00:15:05.222 --> 00:15:07.180
And we're not necessarily
thinking about-- hey,

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.763
there's some seats
in the front, guys.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.490
They're not necessarily thinking
about beer as food terms.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.490
So that's one of the
things that is probably

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:21.830
important to talk about.

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:24.160
And then if you guys want
to start pouring the stout,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.730
you're more than welcome to if
you've gotten to that point.

00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.560
If you haven't,
don't feel rushed.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.530
This is not a marathon.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.560
This is a fun beer tasting.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.530
This is social.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.000
It happens every time.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.180
But I'm terribly sorry, sir.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:42.990
You're cut off.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.440
Alright so.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.750
Beer as food.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.450
Four main ingredients of beer--
water, malt, hops, and yeast.

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.800
Each of those four
main ingredients

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.070
have their own food flavors
and components on their own.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:03.150
And so it's kind of fun to
break it out a little bit.

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:06.310
So you have water, which
can have a mineral or sulfur

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.130
content to it.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.080
There's malt.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.270
And depending on how
the malt is kilned,

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.090
which means roasted,
essentially.

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.490
It starts off as very pale.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:20.090
And it can have a biscuity, or
grape-nutty, or cereal grain

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:21.160
kind of taste to it.

00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.120
And the more you kiln it
and the more you roast it,

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.330
the darker it gets, and the
more flavors it takes on.

00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:30.490
So you toast it a little bit.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:32.784
And then it takes
on notes of caramel.

00:16:32.784 --> 00:16:34.450
And then you roast
it some more, and you

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:39.570
start to get chocolate
and coffee and toffee.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.000
And then you can go
really deep with it,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.980
and it can turn even like
acrid black, and ash, even.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.930
You could smoke the malt so that
you get a smoky flavor from it

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:51.430
as well.

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.910
And you just actually just
put the kiln malt over a flame

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.079
with a smoke, and it
infuses those flavors.

00:16:57.079 --> 00:16:59.620
And then when you brew it, it
takes on those flavors as well.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.650
So sometimes you get
some heat-smoked malt,

00:17:01.650 --> 00:17:03.317
and some other cherry
wood-smoked malts,

00:17:03.317 --> 00:17:04.941
and all different
kind of smoked malts,

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:06.349
and it takes it
on there as well.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:11.859
But these are all flavors
to think about with the malt

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:12.359
itself.

00:17:12.359 --> 00:17:13.900
And I'm getting
distracted, because I

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:17.460
want to go grab
another beer if I can.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:20.391
Thank you, sir.

00:17:20.391 --> 00:17:21.599
You're a wonderful assistant.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:22.265
I appreciate it.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:25.940
Well it shows.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.540
Your skills are impeccable.

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:31.820
So we'll talk about the
other two in a second.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.260
But this is a very malt-forward
beer now that we're pouring.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.520
This is the Oatis from Ninkasi.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.530
And I looked this up
just a few minutes ago.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.620
And this is about 7.2%.

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:45.620
They make this out
of Eugene, Oregon.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.200
I love pairing this
in a beer float

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.130
with a scoop of
vanilla ice cream.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:56.290
Or it goes well with a really
hardy lamb stew as well.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.550
When you smell this and
you do that whole aroma

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:03.600
thing with the beer-- and I'll
try not to do that again--

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.580
what are some of the
flavors or aromas

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.790
that you're getting off of this?

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:08.720
Coffee, chocolate.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.940
Those are the two big ones.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:12.440
And then when you taste it, are
those flavors coming through

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:12.939
as well?

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.710
Yeah.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.280
What's really interesting is
that there is neither coffee

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.690
nor chocolate in this beer.

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:28.072
It all comes from
the roasted malt.

00:18:28.072 --> 00:18:30.030
They use a variety of
different malts in there,

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.100
including a malt that is
called chocolate malt.

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:34.510
And when you get some of
that, and you eat it raw,

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.790
it does taste like a
piece of bitter chocolate,

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.120
or it can, or various
types of chocolate.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.829
So that's always kind of fun,
because people swear, "No!

00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:43.870
There's definitely coffee
or chocolate in there."

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:44.770
There's not.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:48.580
And that just shows just how
diverse malts can be depending

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:53.200
on how it's kilned
and how it's roasted.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.810
This is a big kind of--
on the mouth feel of this,

00:18:55.810 --> 00:18:57.040
it's very creamy.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.850
It's very-- there's
oatmeal in this as well.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.610
Flaked oats in
this beer as well.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.235
So you're going to get a little
bit of that chewy, a little bit

00:19:04.235 --> 00:19:07.120
of that creamy mouth
feel off of this.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:12.670
People think about Guinness
as a big, dark, heavy beer.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:16.990
Try the mouth feel trick next
time you're out with Guinness.

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.600
And you're going to notice that
it's actually fairly watery.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.290
It doesn't have a
lot of body to it.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.780
Its that nitrogen
pour off of the bar

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.980
that gives it a creamy
sort of texture.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.570
But the beer itself
is very watery.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:31.920
This is robust.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.860
Sticks to your ribs.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.040
Like I say, lamb stew or
one of those cold winter

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:40.080
nights that LA is famous for.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.150
If I chilled this down, and
proper beer serving temperature

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:46.470
is usually in the cellar
temperature range, so

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.840
about 50 or so degrees.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.340
But I admit that
sometimes in the summer

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.470
I will chill down one
of these to that ice

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.880
bucket-cold mountain stern
blue, kind of pull it out

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.740
of the cooler and drink
it ice cold on a hot day.

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.080
And it's super refreshing.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.810
It's almost like
drinking an iced coffee.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.992
Except it's got the
other kind of benefits

00:20:04.992 --> 00:20:05.825
aside from caffeine.

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:13.990
So the next ingredient is hops.

00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:19.160
And when people say to me,
"Oh, I don't like beer."

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:19.920
I ask them why.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.419
And some people will say, "Oh,
I don't like the taste of it.

00:20:22.419 --> 00:20:25.480
It's too bitter." "Or
it's just not for me."

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.890
And the bitterness
stands out because that's

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.740
what hops give beer.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.430
Not only aroma, but they
also give bitterness.

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:36.740
And bitter is a terrible word.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:38.910
Bitter is sort of like
when you have a kid brother

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:41.949
and you're eating something as
children that you don't like,

00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.240
and you go, "Oh, this is awful.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.854
Here, try this."

00:20:44.854 --> 00:20:46.770
You immediately have
this connotation of like,

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.770
"I'm not going to enjoy
this," When you say bitter.

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:54.140
And so one of the things I like
to say with people-- and again

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.620
if people are ready to move
onto the next one, that's fine.

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:02.010
We can talk about it again.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:06.310
Hops can have flavors
and aromas of everything

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:10.830
from citrus, like
tangerine and orange,

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:14.500
and lemon and lime
leaf, to tropical fruits

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.470
like pineapple, or
guava, or mango.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:21.820
There's other hops that have
resin or pine aromas to them.

00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:25.170
They're still new ones that
have peach or blueberry

00:21:25.170 --> 00:21:26.990
aromas coming off of them.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:30.000
And where I was in New Zealand
recently, they have their hops.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.820
And they're breeding them
and they're growing them.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.126
And they have these
aromas of gasoline.

00:21:37.126 --> 00:21:39.887
You know when you pump gas, and
then you get back in the car,

00:21:39.887 --> 00:21:42.220
and about 20 minutes later,
you kind of smell your hand.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:44.009
It's that faint smell of petrol?

00:21:44.009 --> 00:21:46.050
That's what's appearing
in these hops these days.

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:48.460
And they love it
for some reason.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:52.180
And there's also like a smell of
what I was calling sweat socks,

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.620
and they were calling laundry.

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:57.640
And they're putting
this in their beer.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.110
But again, when you know what
it is that you're smelling,

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:03.100
and you know that the brewers
want it in their intentionally,

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:08.330
it's not quite as unappealing
as it might sound.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.460
So when we move on to
the next beer, which

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:15.800
is going to be the AleSmith
IPA, think about some

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.200
of those aromas that
I just talked about.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:22.680
See if any of those present in
your mind as you're tasting it.

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:24.400
And then recognize
that at the end,

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.920
when you get a little
bit of that bite,

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:30.190
that pucker, that bitterness
on the end, that'll

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.100
be an "in the back of your
tongue" kind of thing,

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.760
think about the flavors
that you smell first.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.870
And then suddenly
bitterness becomes a lot

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:45.950
more approachable in beer,
especially with IPAs,

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:49.480
which is a really
decisive thing for people.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.070
It's the most entered
category-- the India pale ales--

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:54.710
in the Great American
Beer Festival every year.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:57.080
It is the beer style that
is leading this craft beer

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.180
charge that we're in these days.

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.550
And unfortunately,
like I say, there

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.080
hasn't been great education
to the general public

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.120
on experiencing the overall
flavor notes of an IPA.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.110
But if you think about it from
the pine notes, or the fruit

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:13.690
notes, or even the
gasoline notes,

00:23:13.690 --> 00:23:16.080
you're going to come
around a little bit more

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.606
and hopefully enjoy
those overall flavors.

00:23:18.606 --> 00:23:19.105
Yes.

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.300
Why do I think IPAs are
more popular in the craft--

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:28.240
because they're big, and
bold, and unapologetic,

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.570
and in your face,
and that is America.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:36.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.652
It's interesting.

00:23:37.652 --> 00:23:39.610
There's a couple of
different theories on this.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.930
And I'm sort of of the mindset
of, for a long time in the US,

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:45.570
when we had these
generic lagers that

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:47.880
were out there-- that are
technically perfectly made--

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:49.380
they just don't
have a lot of flavor

00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:53.970
that appeals to a lot of new
beer drinkers these days.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.410
The IPAs is a run in
a different direction.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:58.520
One, it's an ale, not a lager.

00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:04.310
But two, it's just so jam-packed
with flavor, with extra booze,

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.832
it's just the polar opposite.

00:24:05.832 --> 00:24:07.290
And that's what
the brewers wanted.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:10.360
They wanted to say, "Yeah, you
all knew these guys over here.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.300
This is us over here.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.250
This is flavor country."

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.930
As it were.

00:24:13.930 --> 00:24:15.471
And I think that's
one of the reasons

00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:17.360
that it's led the charge.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.360
Interestingly enough,
we are seeing a change

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.020
in the overall beer
market these days.

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.770
People are tending towards
sessionable beers, or more

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:28.550
well-balanced beers these
days, where you can actually

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:31.770
taste all four ingredients
in the beer, and not just

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.640
a dominant hop, which
is really quite great,

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.830
and it shows the overall
maturity of the market

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:37.330
right now.

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.080
But I think it was
really just running

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.210
in the opposite direction
of where we had been.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:47.090
And where beer really took
off up in northern California,

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.150
and in Oregon and Washington.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.460
They were already growing
hops up there to begin with,

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.974
and so hops became a fairly
dominant flavor in there.

00:24:55.974 --> 00:24:57.390
People started
opening up the IPA.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:03.530
What are some of the aromas
that you're getting off of that?

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.910
Orange.

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:08.160
Mango pine.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.010
Grapefruit.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:09.510
Freedom.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:18.870
Smells like bald eagles
and monster truck rallies.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.850
I'd love to get this at
a monster truck rally.

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:29.761
But when you taste it thought,
the malt characteristic really

00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:31.010
comes through on this as well.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.630
You get a little bit of
that biscuity, cereal grain,

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.580
little bit of caramelization
in there as well.

00:25:40.379 --> 00:25:42.670
You'll also notice that when
you hold it on your tongue

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.840
and do mouth feel, it's
going to be a bit more chewy.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.080
It's going to be
a bit more thick.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.560
Again, people say, "Oh,
I don't like dark beers.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.440
They're too heavy."

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.390
And they might tend
towards this because it's

00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:56.510
this nice sort of like
burnt orange amber.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.114
This is actually
heavier than a lot

00:25:58.114 --> 00:26:00.030
of those commercial
stouts that are out there.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.180
You can kind of feel that.

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.400
And you can also see that
as well with the lacing

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.060
on the glass.

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:08.750
And just how robust
this particular beer is.

00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:09.876
So we talked about water.

00:26:09.876 --> 00:26:10.750
We talked about malt.

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:13.210
We've talked about hops.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:15.530
There's an old
saying that brewers

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:20.430
make wort-- which is a sweet
liquid, sugary liquid--

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.390
but yeast makes the beer.

00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:26.420
And so when you add yeast to
sweet wort it eats the sugars

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.270
and creates alcohol
and CO2 carbonization.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:33.850
And without yeast, we
would not have beer.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:38.020
So be thankful for
that little micro.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.270
The flavors of yeast,
which are so diverse,

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:43.030
can be everything
from-- and we've already

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:45.900
seen this-- from
banana and bubble gum.

00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.980
There's pepper.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:50.290
There is flowers.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:51.690
There's honey.

00:26:51.690 --> 00:26:56.590
There's bubblegum is a
great yeast flavor as well.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.910
It's really quite
diverse, the various yeast

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:00.660
flavors out there.

00:27:00.660 --> 00:27:04.110
And different styles of beer
use different styles of yeast.

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:08.810
So Belgian beers will have a
lot of very fruity ester yeast

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.650
that could have stone
fruits and plums

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:15.190
and really great depths
of a honey kind of thing.

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:17.056
And then you'll
have some others,

00:27:17.056 --> 00:27:18.930
like we said, some of
these German beers that

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.420
could have banana or clove.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.820
Or just can be very
crisp and clean as well,

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.690
where it does let the
other flavors come through.

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.050
The Kellerweis is
really the best example

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:32.320
of a yeast-forward beer that
we have up here right now.

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.320
And again, if you go onto
YouTube at some point,

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.970
Sierra Nevada does another beer.

00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:40.440
And this is an open
fermented beer,

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:44.080
which essentially means that
they pour the sweet wort

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.260
into these large tanks which
look like bathtubs, that

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:50.090
are essentially the
size of this stage here.

00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:51.900
And much, much taller.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.520
And they fill it
with the sweet wort.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.890
And they add the yeast to it.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.850
And it open ferments, and then
it bubbles and blows over.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.820
And it's a really
fun thing to watch.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.240
Sierra Nevada has a video
where they do their Bigfoot

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.120
Barleywine every year in
the same open fermenters.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.855
And if you YouTube
it or you Google it,

00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:12.640
you can see this very
cool minute-long video

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.140
of just this yeast
kind of exploding off

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.510
of these open
bathtub fermenters.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:21.920
Most of the beer is
done-- most normal beer.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.600
Not normal-- that's
a terrible word.

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.250
These other beers are probably
done in closed fermentation

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:30.880
tanks where the yeast can
blow off if it needs to.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:32.580
But if you're looking
for a fun visual,

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.122
that's a cool video to look up.

00:28:36.122 --> 00:28:39.930
I probably should have
shown it, but that's

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:43.304
poor planning on my part.

00:28:43.304 --> 00:28:44.470
Overall thoughts on the IPA?

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.790
I should say that
this is the AleSmith

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.450
IPA, down in San Diego.

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:57.280
7.25%.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:01.130
With food, I would go with
spicy Thai would go really

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:02.260
well with this.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:06.110
Blue cheese would go
really well with this.

00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:10.230
And also carrot cake would go
exceptionally well with this.

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:14.380
And that kind of brings us
to how beer pairs with food.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.580
So after Jack McAuliffe
came and left,

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:22.180
and the new breweries like
Sierra Nevada opened up,

00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:25.500
we had a fun couple years of
what was called micro brew.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.340
And it got a lot of attention.

00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:33.650
It was these small brewers
that were doing various beers.

00:29:33.650 --> 00:29:36.370
Unfortunately, not all of
them were doing a good job.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:41.770
And what we found was that
they closed over time.

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:45.810
They had these beers that
were taking an animal name,

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:49.070
and they were taking a bodily
fluid, and mixing it together.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:53.300
So you were getting like
beaver spit, or monkey piss,

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.219
or something terrible.

00:29:54.219 --> 00:29:56.010
And people would go
and buy these six packs

00:29:56.010 --> 00:29:57.550
and bring it to
parties as a joke.

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:58.640
They would be like, "Hey!

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.848
Look what I saw on the shelf.

00:29:59.848 --> 00:30:00.720
Isn't this crazy?"

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.810
And your friends
would look at you

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:04.670
kind of like, you're a jackass.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:09.540
And when you tasted the beer,
it tasted like, you know,

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.300
beaver sweat.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:15.440
And so a lot of these
businesses went out of business.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.179
And the ones that
survived grew and became

00:30:19.179 --> 00:30:20.470
better at what they were doing.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:21.690
They really focused on quality.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:22.970
They really focused on flavor.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.830
It wasn't just a fad for them.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.770
This was a long term
business and an industry

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.500
that they wanted to grow
of these microbreweries.

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.040
The name was
essentially rebranded

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.170
to craft beer to
kind of get away

00:30:33.170 --> 00:30:35.910
from the bad connotations
of micro brewing.

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:39.330
And once that
really took off, you

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:42.640
start to see it everywhere now,
which is a really great thing.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:45.180
From Jack McAuliffe
being the first craft

00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:50.590
brewer in the late 1970s, we
now have 3,000 plus breweries

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.640
operating in the country.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.620
With another 1,000
planning to come online

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.370
within the next couple of years.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:57.720
It's grown tremendously.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.162
And all these-- or most
of them, I should say--

00:31:00.162 --> 00:31:01.870
are really focused on
quality and they're

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:05.130
focused on their local area.

00:31:05.130 --> 00:31:08.400
With so many people now
knowing about craft beer,

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.090
there's now an
attention being paid

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:12.390
to pairing good
beer with good food.

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:16.280
And that's where the
cookbook comes into play.

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.790
I spent 2 and 1/2 years working
on the "American Craft Beer

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:19.960
Cookbook."

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:22.272
Pulling recipes from
around the country,

00:31:22.272 --> 00:31:24.480
from breweries that I know,
breweries that I respect,

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.120
beer bars that I
know and respect,

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.840
and even a few from
my own kitchen.

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.760
And what I really
wanted to do was

00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:33.050
highlight the diversity of beer.

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:38.010
And so you hear a lot of
people say, "Oh, you know,

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:42.470
when it comes to alcoholic
beverages and food pairings,

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.430
red meat goes with red
wine, and white wine

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:45.780
goes with chicken and fish."

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.060
It's not that black and
white, as any real wine

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.790
lover will tell you.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:53.710
It's certainly not easy to paint
a picture like that with beer.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:56.790
So we've already talked
about the great diversity

00:31:56.790 --> 00:31:59.454
with these flavors of these
beers that we've had so far.

00:31:59.454 --> 00:32:01.370
And I'm going to just
ask you guys to hold off

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:05.530
on opening up that last one
before we go any further.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.970
You can finish off some of
these others that we have.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:12.070
Leave no man behind.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:14.220
Leave no beer in the
bottles, as it were.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.980
When it comes to
pairing beer with food,

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:22.280
we can't just think
about our protein.

00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:23.930
Like that wine saying goes.

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:26.952
We really need to think about
how the food is prepared,

00:32:26.952 --> 00:32:28.410
what it's being
served with, what's

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:29.720
being served on top of it.

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.300
So an example that I
like to use quite a bit

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.930
when it comes to thinking
about beer and food is a steak.

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:36.490
And so you go to a
nice steak house,

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:39.330
and invariably somebody's gonna
offer you a glass of red wine.

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.730
But why does red wine work?

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:43.650
And for a number of reasons.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:46.680
It's a bold flavor that can
stand up to bold flavor.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.150
For other reasons, it just
looks good on the plate,

00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:53.840
in the glass, and on
the plate as well.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.140
With beer, it's fun to
think about the steak

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.630
and how it's prepared.

00:32:58.630 --> 00:33:00.410
And so you throw a
steak on the grill,

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.201
and you're going to
get that caramelization

00:33:02.201 --> 00:33:05.510
of the fat, a little
bit of that black char

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.150
on the outside of it.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:09.150
And then when you
cut into the steak,

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:11.530
you're going to get these
savory juices in there as well,

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.615
and that meatiness of the
overall piece of steak.

00:33:14.615 --> 00:33:16.740
And if there's vegetarians
in the crowd, I'm sorry.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:20.450
I'm going to stick
with this meat motif.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:24.330
And so I think about a
brown ale, or a Porter,

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.480
or even a stout when
I start thinking

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.710
of a steak on the grill.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.420
And that's because
of the malts that we

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.460
talked about before,
which have some

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.160
of those caramel notes to them.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.530
Maybe a little
bit of that black,

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:40.320
acridness to it that will
complement those existing

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.700
flavors on the outside char
and outside crust of the steak.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:45.640
And then when you
cut it open and you

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.950
get those savory juices,
the sweetness of the beer

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.680
is going to contrast
with the meat itself,

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.950
and bring out a whole new
dimensions of flavors as well.

00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:58.490
But then you say, "Alright.

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.360
So a brown ale
goes with a steak."

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:03.000
But not always.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.670
Because what happens
if you put a Gorgonzola

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:08.639
sauce, or a blue cheese
sauce on top of that steak?

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:11.243
Now that's really going to
become the dominant flavor.

00:34:11.243 --> 00:34:12.659
And you're going
to need something

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.350
that could stand up to that.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.699
And that's where
something like an IPA

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.949
comes in, because it can
stand up to those blue cheese

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:23.090
flavors, kind of cut
through some of that fat,

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.654
and really bring
out some roundedness

00:34:24.654 --> 00:34:26.320
and some of those
other flavors as well.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.120
So you can't just think
about your protein.

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.090
You have to think about
what it's served with,

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:33.710
what it's being served
alongside with as well.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:37.750
And as you drink more beer, and
you think about beer as food,

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:42.909
with going through those flavors
that we talked about earlier,

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:45.070
it's going to become
easier and easier

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:49.010
to pair good beer
with good food.

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:51.230
The other thing that's
important to mention

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.580
is that it's not just the
four main ingredients in beer

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:56.530
these days, but brewers,
especially in the US,

00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:59.890
are fearless-- and
sometimes foolhardy--

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.690
that they will brew with
just about anything.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.680
So these days you'll actually
get chocolate in your beer,

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.600
and you'll get
coffee in your beer,

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:09.640
and you'll get tea in your beer.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.840
And then you'll have
all sorts of manners

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.307
of exotic fruits in your beer.

00:35:14.307 --> 00:35:16.140
Not just ones you find
at the grocery store,

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:19.840
but ones that they are traveling
to Africa to source, things

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.434
that a lot of us have never
heard of here in the States.

00:35:22.434 --> 00:35:24.100
They're finding
vegetables to brew with.

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:26.680
There's one particular
brewer a couple of years

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:31.570
ago that brewed a beer
with grilled beef hearts.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.530
It was not good.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:37.830
You know when you walk
into a butcher shop

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:41.670
and you get that tinny, blood,
metallic scent in the air?

00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:42.210
Yeah.

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:44.170
You would open up a
bottle over there,

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:47.750
and it would just kind
of waft around the room.

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.540
And it had a very short
shelf life, thankfully.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:55.370
And I don't think they make it
anymore, which is quite good.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.390
But it shows that
brewers are really

00:35:57.390 --> 00:36:01.600
trying to bring different
things into beer.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.760
I try to find beers that
are brewed with honey,

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.497
and I pair it with
ham a lot of the time.

00:36:06.497 --> 00:36:08.080
Just the thought
being honey baked ham

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.970
is such a great combination,
that why can't it work?

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.740
To that point, on
the ham thing, there

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.310
are beers being
brewed with bacon

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:16.810
that are actually
really quite nice.

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:19.370
It's like a breakfast
beer in a lot of ways,

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:23.590
especially if they've added
some coffee in there as well.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:28.330
So there's a lot going
on and the only thing

00:36:28.330 --> 00:36:30.070
that limits brewers
these days is

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.510
their own imagination
and their own creativity.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:35.850
So it's an awesome time to be
a beer drinker in the US right

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:38.207
now.

00:36:38.207 --> 00:36:40.790
So I just challenge you to think
about that with beer and food

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.550
next time you're out.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.270
Don't necessarily reach for a
glass of wine instinctively,

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:47.728
but really think about what it
is that you're going to eat.

00:36:47.728 --> 00:36:50.240
And think about why you're
having a glass of wine

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.520
or a glass of beer
along with it,

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:56.260
and try to find something that
is as good in the glass that

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:58.160
is as good on your
plate, and see

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.896
if you can't meld them together.

00:36:59.896 --> 00:37:01.770
And that's something
that's really important.

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:02.850
And I'm not anti-wine.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.099
I just want to point that out.

00:37:04.099 --> 00:37:06.470
A lot of people are like,
oh, you're against the grape.

00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:07.660
I'm really not.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:08.850
I drink a lot of wine.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:10.070
I drink a lot of spirits.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.105
I drink a lot.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:15.520
You guys laugh.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:20.500
Every time I do that joke,
my wife is rolling her eyes.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.990
It's not true.

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:24.295
It's a little bit true.

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:29.854
The last thing that I'll mention
is cooking with beer as well.

00:37:29.854 --> 00:37:31.520
As you're flipping
through the cookbook,

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.010
you'll see that a lot
of the recipes in there

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.560
use beer as an ingredient.

00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.100
Not only is beer fun to pair
with, beer is fun to cook with.

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:43.280
And adding a beer to a dish is
like adding a spice cabinet.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:45.929
Because once you degas the
beer, once you heat it up,

00:37:45.929 --> 00:37:47.470
once you've added
garlic to anything,

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:50.297
it's not going to taste the
way that it does in our glass.

00:37:50.297 --> 00:37:51.880
It's going to taste
totally different.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:56.020
And so you're going to get
deeper flavors from it.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.660
It could be like using a stock.

00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.260
Beer is great in
salad dressings.

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.470
Its great as a marinade.

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:05.790
Not only does it add some
tenderness to the meat,

00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:08.330
or to your protein, by having
the carbonation nibble away

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:10.090
at it a little bit,
but it also can

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:12.480
add some additional
sweetness that can bring out

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:15.950
some of the more
savory flavors as well.

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.760
Don't just cook with beer for
the sake of cooking with beer.

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:20.450
As I was researching
this book, there's

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:23.230
been a lot of your
cookbooks in the past,

00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:25.600
and one thing that
I wanted to avoid

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.700
was people say, well,
add a tablespoon of lager

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:30.530
and then move on.

00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:33.970
That does nothing
to the overall--

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:36.620
if you're going to cook
with beer, cook with beer.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.570
One of the recipes in there
uses an entire six pack

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:40.970
of a scotch ale in there.

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:42.630
Which I know, people
are like, well,

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.252
why would you use
an entire six pack?

00:38:44.252 --> 00:38:46.460
Because it's good when it
comes out on the other end.

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:47.610
And that's why.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:50.260
Because anything less than
six or anything more than six

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:52.730
just wouldn't have done.

00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:55.110
So cooking with beer
can be a lot of fun,

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:59.180
but not if you're just going to
do it for the sake of doing it.

00:39:01.940 --> 00:39:04.350
The cookbook itself--
as you can see--

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:07.640
has 155, it's
actually 157, but that

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:09.690
didn't have the same
ring for the cover.

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:11.070
Breakfast to dessert.

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:12.430
People say, why breakfast?

00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:14.540
I say, Frank Sinatra
used to say you

00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:18.730
can't drink all day unless
you start in the morning.

00:39:18.730 --> 00:39:20.490
There are a lot of
vegetarian options.

00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:23.560
I know I spent a lot of time
talking about meat today.

00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:27.370
But there are vegetarian and
gluten-free options in there.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:28.880
I think that's important.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.970
We've moved beyond the
days of burger and bud,

00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:37.299
and pork nachos and beer,
and all sorts of things.

00:39:37.299 --> 00:39:38.840
There's a lot of
great diversity that

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.171
comes with food these days.

00:39:40.171 --> 00:39:41.670
And there's a lot
of great diversity

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.910
that comes with beer these days.

00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:46.520
And really quickly,
I'll just say

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.070
that it's been fun
to watch the way

00:39:49.070 --> 00:39:50.630
that the two worlds--
the food world

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:55.341
and the beer world have evolved
together in the last few years.

00:39:55.341 --> 00:39:57.840
So we talked about prohibition,
and after prohibition how we

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.200
all kind of became these
generic-- oh, yeah,

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.830
I'll-- these generic beers that
were out there, these lagers.

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:06.480
Our food culture kind of
went the same way as well.

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.800
Our grandparents, our
great grandparents,

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.260
they all knew where dinner
came from every night.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:15.340
And so you'd have fresh
baked bread on the table.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.010
Your meat came from
the local butcher.

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:19.790
Your vegetables came
from the green grocer

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:21.220
or from the backyard.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.075
And you knew what
it was that you

00:40:23.075 --> 00:40:24.310
were putting into your body.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:26.980
But slowly over
time, that changed

00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.640
and we became this culture of
convenience and mass-produced.

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.620
And so real cheese
became Velveeta.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.070
And fresh-baked bread
became Wonder Bread.

00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:37.982
And rather than
working on a dinner,

00:40:37.982 --> 00:40:40.440
even if it would only take an
hour at the end of the night,

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.620
we convinced ourselves
that we were so busy

00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:44.824
that we pop a plastic
tray into the microwave,

00:40:44.824 --> 00:40:46.490
and whatever came out
two minutes later,

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.040
we'd call that dinner.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.040
We've moved on.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:52.130
I mean we still have a lot
of that in the country,

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:55.020
but we're starting to see
more and more that people care

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.640
about where their
food is coming from.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.500
They want to know
who's making their food

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.570
The localvore movement
is coming back into play.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:03.199
Farmers' markets haven't
been this popular in ages.

00:41:03.199 --> 00:41:04.740
People really care
about what they're

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:05.740
putting in their bodies.

00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.790
And the same thing is true
for the brewing industry.

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:11.430
You can walk into your
local brewers around here--

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.022
and you guys have quite a
few here in the LA area,

00:41:14.022 --> 00:41:15.730
and more and more it
seems all the time--

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:18.180
and you can meet the
people who make your beer.

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:22.350
You can shake the hand
of the guy or woman who

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:24.240
made what is now in your glass.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.047
And that's a personal
connection, as well.

00:41:26.047 --> 00:41:28.130
It's like knowing where
your vegetables came from.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.370
And so to see the
craft beer movement

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:32.860
and the localvore movement
kind of come together

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:36.440
has really been great for
the beer and food movement,

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:37.740
and books like this.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.590
So that's just another
thing to think about.

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:41.610
When you're buying
craft beer, you're

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:44.500
supporting smaller businesses,
you're supporting local,

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.240
and you're doing your part
to do right by yourself

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.330
by getting some good, flavorful
beer into your system.

00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:53.771
There's a question over here.

00:41:53.771 --> 00:41:55.270
AUDIENCE: In regards
to cooking, how

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:57.375
do the four different
ingredients-- probably

00:41:57.375 --> 00:42:00.490
mostly the hops and the
yeast, those flavors--

00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:03.350
how do they stand up to
cooking, and what do you lose?

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:05.350
JOHN HOLL: So the question
is, how does the four

00:42:05.350 --> 00:42:09.060
main ingredients stand up
when you're cooking with beer?

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.170
It really depends on the beer.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:14.230
I tend to find that more
malt-forward beers work

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:16.760
a little bit better than
more hop-forward beers

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.500
when it comes to cooking.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:22.630
The hops can take on some
astringency and some not nice

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:25.820
flavors, if you're going to
be boiling it for a long time.

00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:28.490
Whereas more
malt-forward beers, I

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:32.570
think go a lot further, just
because of the sweetness

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:34.510
that it brings to the game.

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.590
But it really depends
on the overall beer

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.400
that you're cooking with.

00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.790
I try to be as specific
as possible in the book,

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:43.130
and saying like, if you're
going to cook with this beer,

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:44.840
here's why you
should, and here's

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.260
some of the flavors
that come out with it.

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.380
And it was a lot of
fun trial and error

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.870
to try to come up with that
while I was doing that.

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:57.250
So we can get into the general
question portion of things now.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:59.690
And with that, opening
up the last beer.

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:05.440
So IPAs have been leading the
charge in the US for a while.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.340
And I keep hearing from
people, oh, a sours

00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:10.550
going to be the next IPA.

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:12.440
I don't know if
they are, but this

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.730
is going to be a Sour Blonde
from the Almanac Brewery

00:43:15.730 --> 00:43:18.240
Company up in the
San Francisco area.

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.340
It's tart.

00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:22.930
It is brewed with two types
of cherry-- a Rainier cherry

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:25.712
and I'm so hesitant
to use this, the name

00:43:25.712 --> 00:43:27.545
of the variety of cherry
that they use here.

00:43:27.545 --> 00:43:28.410
It's called Bing.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.181
I was reading the description
before, and I was like, oh,

00:43:36.181 --> 00:43:36.680
man.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.070
I'm bringing like
a Bing to Google.

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.890
That's so weird.

00:43:41.890 --> 00:43:44.850
And this has been aged
in wine barrels as well.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:47.350
There's a lot going
on with this beer.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.860
It's 7%.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.140
Uses three types
of yeast in here,

00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:55.000
including famous San
Francisco sourdough yeast

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:55.950
culture in there.

00:43:55.950 --> 00:44:00.250
So as you're doing your
aromas and your flavors

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:02.190
and everything in
between, you're

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:05.360
going to get a lot of things.

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:11.930
I'm going to come down
and join you if I may.

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:12.680
Thank you so much.

00:44:17.858 --> 00:44:20.547
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:20.547 --> 00:44:21.505
JOHN HOLL: What's that?

00:44:21.505 --> 00:44:22.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:25.140
JOHN HOLL: Right.

00:44:25.140 --> 00:44:27.890
Are there Google cherries?

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:29.260
If not.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:29.780
Get on it.

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.709
So that's kind of where we're
at it very quickly with beer

00:44:35.709 --> 00:44:37.500
and food these days,
in the history of beer

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:40.590
and how we got to sitting
in a room drinking

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:44.660
a wide range of diverse beers
from a wide range of mostly

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:47.050
West Coast breweries.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:49.783
And any thoughts?

00:44:49.783 --> 00:44:50.366
Any questions?

00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.012
I'll go back there, and yes.

00:44:56.012 --> 00:44:58.690
AUDIENCE: If possible, can
you use the microphone?

00:44:58.690 --> 00:45:00.090
Just for the sake
of the YouTube?

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:01.600
JOHN HOLL: Yes.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.560
This is going on the YouTube.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:05.200
So if you could
use the microphone.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.700
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
these wonderful food pairings.

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.040
I mean, some of us
were getting actively

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.120
hungry in the back there.

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.250
I'm wondering, in addition
to these speaking tours,

00:45:12.250 --> 00:45:14.666
if you considered doing sort
of an event where we come in,

00:45:14.666 --> 00:45:18.490
and we try some of the beer,
some of the food together.

00:45:18.490 --> 00:45:20.040
Do you spiel on the steak.

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.690
Now with the
Gorgonzola, now without.

00:45:21.690 --> 00:45:22.440
JOHN HOLL: Yes.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.643
How soon do you want me
to come back and do that?

00:45:24.643 --> 00:45:26.210
AUDIENCE: Um, Saturday?

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.930
JOHN HOLL: Sure.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:27.580
AUDIENCE: That'd be good for me.

00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:28.611
JOHN HOLL: Absolutely.

00:45:28.611 --> 00:45:29.360
I will absolutely.

00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:30.915
Yeah, I do that quite a bit.

00:45:30.915 --> 00:45:32.640
We do beer dinners
and beer tastings.

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:34.350
And that's a fun thing.

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:37.970
Scan-- and I love
doing it, but they're

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:40.300
happening all over the
country these days.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:43.050
Sign up when you go and
visit your local brewery,

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:45.670
and sign up for
their newsletters.

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:48.770
And they will send you different
things that they're doing.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:51.440
And you'll really find beer
dinners that they're doing

00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:53.557
and beer and cheese
pairings that they're doing.

00:45:53.557 --> 00:45:55.140
Boy, you're really
having a tough time

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.250
with this microphone, man.

00:45:56.250 --> 00:45:56.940
AUDIENCE: I am.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:57.952
Yes.

00:45:57.952 --> 00:45:59.660
JOHN HOLL: You are
cut off at this point.

00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:03.400
You're now the second
person to get cut off.

00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:05.740
The cool thing, and
one of the things

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:11.220
I didn't really touch about with
this book, is beer is local,

00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.340
but so is food.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:14.600
And so when you look
through this book,

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:16.910
you're going to find
seafood dishes that

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:19.390
come from New England and
the Pacific Northwest.

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:21.140
And you're going to
find spicy dishes that

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:21.825
come from the southwest.

00:46:21.825 --> 00:46:23.520
And you're going to
find meat and dairy

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.020
dishes that come
from the heartland.

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:29.420
Or you're going to find very
city-specific food traditions

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:29.920
as well.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.780
And the book kind of
overall tells the story

00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:34.950
of where we are with beer and
food, and how both can be local

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:37.360
and how both can play
with local strength.

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:39.330
So I love doing beer dinners.

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:40.900
And especially when
I travel around,

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.800
because I get to talk with chefs
and brewers and be like, OK.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:48.950
Here in LA, there's a great
food truck culture that exists.

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:51.350
And there's a really
great Mexican that exists.

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:53.790
Let's find these
local food traditions

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:57.220
and find local beers that bring
out the best flavors in both.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.677
And that's really
the cool thing.

00:46:58.677 --> 00:47:00.260
So the point that I
was trying to make

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:04.140
is find your local brewers,
find good local beer bars around

00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:06.250
here, and see if they're
doing beer dinners.

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.520
And go and just sit and taste.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.310
It's a lot of fun to do.

00:47:10.310 --> 00:47:12.760
And it's fun to get out
with friends as well.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:14.930
And it's something
different to do as well.

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:16.270
Awesome date nights.

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:19.402
It's all sorts of very cool--
there's very cool stuff

00:47:19.402 --> 00:47:20.110
that's happening.

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:21.070
But, yeah.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:23.990
Any time you guys want me to
come back and do a beer dinner,

00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.580
yeah.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.250
I'm on the next
plane from Jersey.

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:28.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.770
JOHN HOLL: Yes.

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:31.804
Yes sir.

00:47:31.804 --> 00:47:32.720
First times the charm.

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.906
I like that.

00:47:34.906 --> 00:47:36.030
AUDIENCE: I am mic enabled.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:37.940
Yes.

00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:40.000
So you were mentioning
the pairing with a steak.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.666
You mentioned you
have some blue cheese,

00:47:41.666 --> 00:47:43.910
you add either a Porter
or perhaps a stout.

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:46.882
What is the modern
difference between those?

00:47:46.882 --> 00:47:48.960
JOHN HOLL: God, I
hate that question.

00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.490
AUDIENCE: I know.

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:51.540
JOHN HOLL: Very little.

00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:52.360
AUDIENCE: That's what I thought.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:52.810
JOHN HOLL: Very little.

00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:54.726
AUDIENCE: I was always
just kind of assuming--

00:47:54.726 --> 00:47:55.720
JOHN HOLL: Yeah.

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.060
It's evolved over time.

00:47:57.060 --> 00:48:02.161
When you look at the overall
definitions when judging

00:48:02.161 --> 00:48:02.660
is done.

00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.777
It can be tough to tell the
difference between the two.

00:48:05.777 --> 00:48:07.610
AUDIENCE: There's even
different categories.

00:48:07.610 --> 00:48:08.401
JOHN HOLL: Exactly.

00:48:08.401 --> 00:48:09.520
It's different categories.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:14.490
I Some people make the argument
that it's Irish versus United

00:48:14.490 --> 00:48:16.240
Kingdom kind of difference.

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.700
Guinness versus London
Porter kind of thing.

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:21.200
Yeah.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.290
There's not-- there's not a
heck of a lot of difference,

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:27.080
on its face, of them.

00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:29.820
When you start getting into
some of the larger, or the more

00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:33.390
boozy, complex,
stouts and porters,

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:34.890
the differences
become more vast.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:38.390
The difference between a foreign
Extra Stout and a Baltic Porter

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:40.960
are a little bit different.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:44.510
Yeah I hate that question,
because I get it all the time.

00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:47.240
And I've never come up
with a really good answer

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:50.700
that people walk away
feeling, you're a genius!

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:51.890
So, Yeah.

00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:55.480
AUDIENCE: So, much easier
personal preference question.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.510
Obviously you get asked every
day, what's your favorite beer?

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:01.000
But within your
favorite style-- if you

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.520
have one-- what is your favorite
beer that you've ever tasted?

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:09.980
JOHN HOLL: Favorite beer
that I've ever tasted.

00:49:09.980 --> 00:49:10.480
Shit.

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.480
That's a tough question.

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.855
AUDIENCE: Assuming
you don't have

00:49:12.855 --> 00:49:14.360
a favorite that
you've never tasted.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:15.862
JOHN HOLL: Right.

00:49:15.862 --> 00:49:16.820
There are known knowns.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.945
And there are known unknowns,
and unknown unknowns.

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:27.690
I tend toward stouts
and porters myself.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:31.930
It's really sort of my
go to style if I'm out.

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:33.900
But it really depends
on where I'm at,

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:39.370
who I'm with, what's
local, what tastes good.

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:42.320
For the purposes of when I
do beer tastings at home,

00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:45.880
and judging, I keep Sam
Adams Foster and a Lager,

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.230
and Sierra Nevada
Pale Ale in my fridge.

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:51.420
And that's because I know
exactly how those beers

00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:53.330
taste like.

00:49:53.330 --> 00:49:55.951
They're not my go to's, but
I'm very familiar with them,

00:49:55.951 --> 00:49:57.700
and that helps when
I'm tasting new beers.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:49:59.825
Because if I feel like I'm
tasting something that's

00:49:59.825 --> 00:50:01.740
an off flavor, or I'm
feeling like I'm just

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:04.260
having a bad tasting day,
I can open up one of those.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:06.980
And if it tastes how I know
it's supposed to taste,

00:50:06.980 --> 00:50:08.465
then I know that there's
something wrong with this beer

00:50:08.465 --> 00:50:09.240
that I'm tasting.

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.460
If those beers don't
taste right to me,

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:12.400
it means that I had
something weird for lunch.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.180
And it's throwing
me off a little bit.

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:17.520
There's a couple of beers
throughout the country,

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:20.510
and I hate playing favorites,
because I run this beer

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:24.059
magazine where we're
impartial, but there's

00:50:24.059 --> 00:50:25.850
a couple of beers that
I do try to seek out

00:50:25.850 --> 00:50:27.190
whenever I'm traveling.

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.780
New Glarus out in
Wisconsin makes

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.695
a beer called Raspberry Tart
which is just phenomenal.

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:35.810
It's about 4% alcohol, made
with fresh raspberries.

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:37.780
It's like a brown
ale with raspberries.

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:40.160
It's just delightful.

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:42.720
The Cambridge Brewing
Company out in Massachusetts

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:44.900
does a Summer
Barleywine that they

00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:49.330
call arquebus that's
about 14% alcohol, that's

00:50:49.330 --> 00:50:51.679
got these really wonderful
boozy vanilla flavors.

00:50:51.679 --> 00:50:53.220
And they only put
it out once a year.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:56.600
And it seems like I'm on a
train from New York up to Boston

00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:00.190
every summer just to taste
this particular beer.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.850
But for me these
days, there are so

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.890
many cool beers to
be tasted out there,

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:06.296
that I haven't found
my next favorite yet.

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:07.920
And I haven't found
the next one that's

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:11.400
going to stop me dead in my
tracks and make me say, wow.

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.600
And that's kind
of a cool thing is

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:16.240
it just shows how much
the brewers are pushing

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.860
the envelope these days, and
really continually trying

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.639
to make themselves better.

00:51:21.639 --> 00:51:23.180
It's always a lot
of fun when I smell

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:25.500
a beer for the first time,
like I did with this one.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.291
And I get this big
smile on my face,

00:51:28.291 --> 00:51:29.790
because I know as
soon as I smell it

00:51:29.790 --> 00:51:31.960
that I'm really going
to enjoy this beer.

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.640
And that's a cool thing because
that still happens quite a bit.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:36.867
And you'd think with 3,000
breweries in the country

00:51:36.867 --> 00:51:38.450
that it wouldn't
happen quite so much.

00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:39.708
But it is.

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:47.530
I'm really digging the cherries
off of this by the way.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:49.470
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned beef hearts.

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:50.095
JOHN HOLL: Yes.

00:51:50.095 --> 00:51:52.450
AUDIENCE: So ignoring that.

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:55.770
What's your favorite gimmick
ingredient and your least

00:51:55.770 --> 00:51:58.580
favorite gimmick ingredient
that you've tried thus far.

00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:01.150
JOHN HOLL: Beef hearts
is my least favorite.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:02.490
AUDIENCE: Besides beef hearts.

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:03.781
JOHN HOLL: Besides beef hearts.

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:10.380
Probably my favorite is coffee.

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:13.130
I think coffee just
brings so much to stouts.

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.520
And there's brewers that
are trying different things

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.620
these days with coffee.

00:52:16.620 --> 00:52:18.620
We have a brewery
in New Jersey called

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:22.057
Carton which did a
coffee light and sweet.

00:52:22.057 --> 00:52:23.640
So that's sort of
an East Coast thing.

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.681
I don't know if it's out
here, but it's basically

00:52:25.681 --> 00:52:28.110
like three sugars and
milk in your coffee.

00:52:28.110 --> 00:52:30.890
And so it's like coffee
for kids, essentially.

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:33.030
And they did a
beer that was maybe

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:35.010
about this color, thereabouts.

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:36.770
But it had a good
ton of coffee in it.

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:38.270
And when you think
of a coffee beer,

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:40.850
you're not necessarily thinking
of a light colored beer

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:42.050
as well.

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:44.630
And so I really dig
that, because they

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:46.890
use some lactose sugar,
which is milk sugar,

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:50.040
and the coffee in
it, so it actually

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:55.240
tasted like a coffee light and
sweet, which was kind of fun.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.330
Coffee's also great with IPAs.

00:52:57.330 --> 00:52:59.020
Stone Brewing Company
a couple years ago

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:02.130
did a collaboration--
Dayman Coffee,

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:04.850
where it was these
bright floral hoppy

00:53:04.850 --> 00:53:07.240
notes with this really
nice kick of coffee.

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:09.540
And again, lighter color.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:12.130
My magazine did a collaboration
with Sierra Nevada Brewing

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:13.690
a couple months
ago, where we also

00:53:13.690 --> 00:53:16.700
did a coffee IPA with
Counterculture Coffee, which

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:19.020
is a growing chain
and growing business.

00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:22.240
And we tried different
coffee varieties

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:25.870
where we wanted ones that had
berry and lemon notes to it.

00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:28.330
Then we found hops to match,
so that it brought out

00:53:28.330 --> 00:53:29.530
those additional flavors.

00:53:29.530 --> 00:53:31.113
So I'm really digging
what's happening

00:53:31.113 --> 00:53:32.812
with coffee these days.

00:53:32.812 --> 00:53:34.270
As I've been rambling
on that, I've

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:36.360
been really trying to think
about some of the bad stuff

00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:36.943
that I've had.

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:41.150
There's a lot of
brewers that are

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:46.070
using rare and exotic
fruits these days.

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:48.680
And sometimes it works,
and sometimes it doesn't.

00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.640
The thing that I'm hesitant to
say about things that I overly

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:55.620
don't like is that I might
not like it, but you might.

00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:59.639
And then who am I to say
that this is not a good beer?

00:53:59.639 --> 00:54:01.930
And who are any of us to say
that it's not a good beer?

00:54:01.930 --> 00:54:04.010
If somebody likes
the taste of it,

00:54:04.010 --> 00:54:05.580
that's a personal preference.

00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:08.365
I'm sure as we did this
tasting today that you noticed

00:54:08.365 --> 00:54:09.740
that some of you
really liked it.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.580
Maybe your neighbor sitting
next to you is like, oh

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:12.420
that's not for me.

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:14.750
I saw people passing
off their glasses.

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:17.350
And there's no shame in that.

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:21.570
Beer is a very
personal experience.

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:25.010
Brewers are trying
weird stuff these days.

00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:27.010
But it's from the weird
stuff that you sometimes

00:54:27.010 --> 00:54:28.100
get the best stuff.

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:30.650
And it's that continually
pushing of the innovation.

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:36.890
It's that continually pushing
of brewers going and finding

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:38.670
weird ingredients.

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:41.830
Oyster stouts have been
around for a really long time.

00:54:41.830 --> 00:54:44.650
And oysters and stouts are
a wonderful beer and food

00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:45.150
pairing.

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:47.970
And so putting oysters
into your stout

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:49.890
really brings out the
sort of like savoriness

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:51.830
in the beer along with
some of that sweetness,

00:54:51.830 --> 00:54:54.120
and adds a little bit
of body and depth to it.

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:55.230
I love oyster stouts.

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:56.930
But if there's
people here who are

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:59.750
squeamish at the
idea of oysters,

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:04.800
or eating raw shellfish,
you're not going to like that.

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.460
And so it's tough
to say ingredients

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:07.670
that I don't personally like.

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:09.670
There's some people who
are tea drinkers and not

00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:11.294
coffee drinkers who
are just turned off

00:55:11.294 --> 00:55:13.240
by my whole little
spiel on coffee.

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:16.160
So it's a tough thing to
really say these days.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:19.470
It's judge each beer yourself.

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:22.537
And if you like it,
drink more of it.

00:55:22.537 --> 00:55:24.370
If you don't, you're
going to find something

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:25.813
that you will like.

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.904
Questions?

00:55:31.904 --> 00:55:34.260
You guys can duke it out there.

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:39.490
Is there any of
more this Almanac?

00:55:39.490 --> 00:55:40.640
Somewhere?

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.110
Sorry, I just need to reload.

00:55:46.415 --> 00:55:47.040
I'm not joking.

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:51.130
I got off of a plane like three
hours ago from New Zealand.

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:52.982
I've been up for like 24 hours.

00:55:52.982 --> 00:55:54.940
And I still have to fly
back to Jersey tonight.

00:55:54.940 --> 00:56:00.170
So this is-- my seat mate is
going to hate me on the plane.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:01.546
Yes.

00:56:01.546 --> 00:56:02.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah
I'd love to hear--

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.086
kind of a two-part question.

00:56:04.086 --> 00:56:07.620
First question is how your
opinion of California breweries

00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.100
versus breweries
from other states.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.750
And then part two
are what are three

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:13.600
beers we have to
try before we die?

00:56:16.420 --> 00:56:18.696
JOHN HOLL: Good questions.

00:56:18.696 --> 00:56:20.070
California has
the most breweries

00:56:20.070 --> 00:56:22.280
out of any state in
the Union right now.

00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:25.630
So by nature of that, you have
a really big, diverse beer

00:56:25.630 --> 00:56:27.860
culture.

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:32.370
San Diego is a hop
capital right now.

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:34.750
They're doing these
really big, dank,

00:56:34.750 --> 00:56:37.542
super hoppy, super
aggressive beers.

00:56:37.542 --> 00:56:40.000
And you're seeing some of those
in other parts of the state

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.300
as well.

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:44.250
Hops come into big
play in California.

00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:46.920
Whereas other states use them,
but maybe not in the same way

00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.280
that California does.

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:51.740
If you say to somebody a San
Diego, or a West Coast style

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:54.110
IPA, chances are
that they're thinking

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:56.780
of California,
specifically San Diego.

00:56:56.780 --> 00:57:00.330
But then you go up to
Berkeley and San Francisco

00:57:00.330 --> 00:57:02.460
and that general area,
where this beer comes from,

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.793
and they're doing a lot of
barrel aging, because they're

00:57:04.793 --> 00:57:06.610
in wine country, or
close to wine country.

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:07.720
And there's access to barrels.

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:09.678
And they're really
interested in those flavors.

00:57:09.678 --> 00:57:11.080
And they're
interested in using--

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.530
like with this beer--
that wild sourdough

00:57:14.530 --> 00:57:16.860
to help culture the beer.

00:57:16.860 --> 00:57:20.950
So it's a really
diverse beer state.

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:24.720
I mean, it's a great
beer state, no doubt.

00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:28.670
Three beers that
you have to try.

00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:32.170
That's a really tough one.

00:57:32.170 --> 00:57:35.900
Because when you talk about--
is it the global beer scene.

00:57:35.900 --> 00:57:37.150
Is it the US beer scene?

00:57:37.150 --> 00:57:39.887
Is it your local beer scene?

00:57:39.887 --> 00:57:41.470
I think that there's
a couple of beers

00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:45.620
that have shaped
the US right now.

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:48.770
Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, I
think everybody should taste.

00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:50.270
I think that's a great beer.

00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:54.820
That it has a great hop
characteristic to it.

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.960
But it also has a great
malt characteristic to it.

00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.069
It's a very, very
well-balanced beer.

00:58:00.069 --> 00:58:01.360
It's a very easy drinking beer.

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.901
And it's found
everywhere these days.

00:58:02.901 --> 00:58:06.450
And it can be easy to forget
that when it first came out,

00:58:06.450 --> 00:58:08.870
that it was revolutionary
in a lot of ways.

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:13.240
So many-- if Ken Grossman was
inspired by Jack McAuliffe,

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:15.450
whole new generations of
brewers were originally

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:18.240
inspired by Sierra Nevada
and that particular beer.

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:21.150
So that's a fun beer
to pay attention to.

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:25.710
Man, I'm really
trying to think of--

00:58:25.710 --> 00:58:27.420
I already mentioned
Raspberry Tart

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:30.107
from New Glarus, which is
for me, one of those ones

00:58:30.107 --> 00:58:31.190
that everybody should try.

00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:32.981
And they have an
interesting business model

00:58:32.981 --> 00:58:36.060
that they're doing more than
100,000 barrels of bee a year,

00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:38.480
and they're just staying
in the state of Wisconsin.

00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:42.497
They're choosing to stay
local, which is incredible

00:58:42.497 --> 00:58:44.330
when you think about
how people are shipping

00:58:44.330 --> 00:58:46.620
their beer around the
country and around the world.

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.900
Will Myers makes that awesome
arquebus from Cambridge,

00:58:52.900 --> 00:58:54.730
but you can only
get it if you're

00:58:54.730 --> 00:58:58.390
at his pub in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

00:58:58.390 --> 00:59:00.272
So that's a tough thing to say.

00:59:00.272 --> 00:59:01.980
AUDIENCE: We have an
office in Cambridge.

00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:03.896
JOHN HOLL: You do have
an office in Cambridge?

00:59:03.896 --> 00:59:04.870
Road trip.

00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:06.402
Let's go!

00:59:06.402 --> 00:59:08.610
Next summer we're all gonna
meet at Cambridge Brewing

00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:11.390
and we're all gonna
drink the arquebus.

00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:14.330
Yeah, I mean those kind
of jump out in my mind.

00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:17.320
But again, I've had
so many good beers.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.410
I've had these wonderful
bourbon barrel aged beers.

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:23.910
Full Sail Brewing Company
does a bourbon barrel aged

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:27.530
imperial stout every year that
has these really wonderful

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:31.659
boozy, vanilla, woody notes to
them as well with the stout.

00:59:31.659 --> 00:59:34.200
And a lot of people are doing
bourbon barrel aged these days.

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.710
If you love bourbon
and you love beer,

00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:38.880
it's just a perfect
marriage between the two,

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.530
if it's done right.

00:59:40.530 --> 00:59:43.210
There's some really
wonderful Belgian Quads

00:59:43.210 --> 00:59:46.350
if you're really into
deep stone-fruity,

00:59:46.350 --> 00:59:50.150
boozy, foreign styles of beer.

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:52.770
There's something beautiful
about just a normal Kolsch.

00:59:52.770 --> 00:59:57.900
A very simple German Kolsch
that is refreshing and light.

00:59:57.900 --> 01:00:03.180
And so, try them all.

01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.430
Follow your palate.

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:05.970
I mean that's really it.

01:00:05.970 --> 01:00:08.230
Who am I to sit
up here-- I mean,

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:13.530
except that I was invited
to-- to say, try these beers.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:14.357
Follow your palate.

01:00:14.357 --> 01:00:15.190
Follow your passion.

01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:17.720
Follow where your
taste buds move you.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.790
Because again, it's subjective.

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:23.680
Whatever I say-- I could
say, oh this is a must

01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:24.560
try before you die.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.520
And you could drink it
and go, this is awful!

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:28.561
He doesn't know what the
hell he's talking about!

01:00:28.561 --> 01:00:30.110
Personal palates are different.

01:00:30.110 --> 01:00:31.200
Do you have a question?

01:00:35.509 --> 01:00:37.800
AUDIENCE: So you were talking
about some of the reasons

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:40.305
why people say they
don't like beer.

01:00:40.305 --> 01:00:40.930
JOHN HOLL: Yes.

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:44.880
AUDIENCE: And one that
I hear in LA a lot

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:48.540
is it's too many carbs.

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.450
It's too heavy.

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:51.150
Blah, blah, blah.

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:57.470
Do you see anything in
the craft beer industry

01:00:57.470 --> 01:01:03.650
trying to tackle that, or
approach that, or market that?

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:06.100
JOHN HOLL: So I'm
not in the best

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:08.280
of physical conditions
as a beer drinker.

01:01:10.956 --> 01:01:13.270
So it's tough for me to talk
about the caloric intake.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:15.790
But here's the thing.

01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:19.300
A lot of people will cite
that beer is bad for you,

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.920
or worse for you than wine or
spirits and that kind of thing.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:23.110
It's really not.

01:01:23.110 --> 01:01:26.150
It's comparable to some
of those, sometimes.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:29.480
But it's everything
in moderation.

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:29.980
Really.

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:34.449
If you're going to drink three
six packs a night, or three six

01:01:34.449 --> 01:01:34.990
packs a week.

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:36.480
And then not work
out, and all that.

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:36.979
Well yeah.

01:01:36.979 --> 01:01:38.320
It's going to be bad for you.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.900
But I've been out
traveling where

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.680
I've seen people just kill
a bottle of wine themselves.

01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:46.100
And that's not better for you.

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.950
It's not much [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:49.620
What we've seen
though is there's

01:01:49.620 --> 01:01:51.400
a lot of the larger
beer companies that

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.860
market to a lower
calorie intake.

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:58.646
So ones that say, we
only have 65 calories.

01:01:58.646 --> 01:02:00.770
Or we only have 100 calories,
and things like that.

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:01.269
65.

01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:03.120
No, I wasn't trying
to like-- I'm

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.390
getting corrected in the back.

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:06.330
It's Miller 64!

01:02:06.330 --> 01:02:08.570
I was trying to give
them a pass on this one.

01:02:08.570 --> 01:02:11.630
I was trying to give them
a pass of just throwing out

01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:16.780
an arbitrary number then
a watered-down beer.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:20.180
But a Guinness, for example.

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:23.200
They had a big advertising
campaign a couple of years ago,

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:26.550
it has about 125 calories in it.

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:27.050
Right?

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:29.240
People would think
that it has a lot more.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:32.290
Your normal beers are
somewhere in the 100 to 200

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.160
calorie range.

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.360
It's not that bad for you,
considering everything else

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:39.280
that we might eat
during the day.

01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.572
It's just that perception
that beer makes you bloated,

01:02:41.572 --> 01:02:43.530
or beer makes you fat,
or you get a beer belly.

01:02:43.530 --> 01:02:46.160
Or all those manners
of things that wine

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:47.730
has done a very good
job, and spirits

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:50.190
have done a very good
job of sort of playing up

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:52.030
the sophistication
and the health aspect,

01:02:52.030 --> 01:02:56.460
or the higher
aspect range of it.

01:02:56.460 --> 01:03:00.652
So it's not necessarily
bad for you.

01:03:00.652 --> 01:03:02.110
It's just everything
in moderation.

01:03:02.110 --> 01:03:02.776
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:03:02.776 --> 01:03:06.022
So my question was more
do you see something--

01:03:06.022 --> 01:03:08.467
because I agree with
you, I love beer.

01:03:08.467 --> 01:03:10.423
And I don't think
it's bad for you.

01:03:10.423 --> 01:03:12.868
But there's that
perception out there,

01:03:12.868 --> 01:03:16.780
whether you see something
in the marketing.

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:20.203
Is that something that's
trying to be attacked head-on.

01:03:20.203 --> 01:03:23.002
Or if it's just conversations
like these where you say--

01:03:23.002 --> 01:03:25.210
JOHN HOLL: It's not being
attacked head-on in the way

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:27.880
that I would like the
industry to attack it head-on.

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.330
I think that if brewers
started putting caloric intakes

01:03:31.330 --> 01:03:33.740
on there, I think it
could help or hurt.

01:03:33.740 --> 01:03:36.950
Because you're going
to get some beers that

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:39.090
are going to have
600 calories in them,

01:03:39.090 --> 01:03:40.880
just given by the
nature of the sugar.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.220
And they're not going to
want to put that on there.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:46.370
And if one brewery makes a
beer that has 100 calories,

01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:49.480
and the same brewery
makes one that has 600,

01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:50.960
do you do a blanket or not?

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:53.930
And then you're going to get
accused of false advertising.

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:56.790
So I think it's a slippery
slope for a lot of them.

01:03:56.790 --> 01:04:00.420
Every couple years that
"Eat This, Not That,"

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.990
"Drink This, Not That."
book comes back into vogue.

01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:06.270
And invariably they show
up on the Today Show.

01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:08.710
And it's have this
beer that's like water.

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:12.110
And not this barleywine
that has 600 calories.

01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:14.450
You can't even
compare the two beers.

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:17.080
And it's like if I'm going
to drink this barleywine,

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:18.900
that means I'm only
going to have one.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:21.530
And it means that
rather than drinking

01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:24.430
six of those, which would
actually equal one of these.

01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:27.020
And that's something
that we need to change.

01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.890
But that's a question for
the individual brewers.

01:04:29.890 --> 01:04:31.640
There's not an easy
answer, unfortunately,

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:33.580
for that at this point.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.650
The other thing,
just perception-wise,

01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:38.390
we were talking about
calories, one of the things

01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:40.140
I wanted to point out
just really quickly.

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:43.260
As you look at the bottles
up there that we had today,

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:46.820
you'll see a lot of the famous
brown glass 12-ounce bottles.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:51.874
But you also see the larger
22-ounce bottle of the IPA.

01:04:51.874 --> 01:04:53.540
And then that really
cool-looking bottle

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:57.010
that we have with this blonde
that we're drinking right now.

01:04:57.010 --> 01:04:59.010
And then there's also the can.

01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:00.660
Which I always
love pouring cans,

01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:03.140
because people think that
can is a lesser vessel.

01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:04.400
It's really not.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:05.570
It keeps out light.

01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:06.997
It's easier to ship.

01:05:06.997 --> 01:05:09.330
Keeping out light helps the
beer from getting that skunk

01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:12.630
flavor, that oxidation
flavor as well.

01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:14.460
It's lighter, so
it ships easier.

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.500
It's stackable.

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.590
You can take it camping.

01:05:17.590 --> 01:05:19.030
You can take it to the poolside.

01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:21.270
You can take it to the
shore without worrying

01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:22.520
about broken glass.

01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:25.510
So don't dismiss beers in cans.

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:27.290
I hope you all like
that flavorful beer.

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:30.830
You can crush it on your head
after you're done drinking it,

01:05:30.830 --> 01:05:31.880
if you're really into it.

01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:34.250
And if you've had a couple.

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:35.890
So yeah, don't dismiss
a beer in a can,

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:38.370
because I'm sure as
you were drinking it,

01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:39.870
you didn't notice
any off flavors.

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:42.450
And you hopefully
enjoyed that beer.

01:05:42.450 --> 01:05:43.610
And that came from a can.

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:48.180
So don't dismiss
it when you see it.

01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.900
So thanks so much, guys.

01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:52.600
This was really cool
for me to be here.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:56.840
It's a company that I've
long admired from afar.

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:59.610
So to sit here with you guys and
be able to talk about the thing

01:05:59.610 --> 01:06:02.490
that I love and the place
where you guys work and love

01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:04.720
has been a really cool
experience for me.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.690
And I hope that you enjoy
the book and your beer

01:06:07.690 --> 01:06:08.770
and food-tasting journey.

01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:10.170
I hope to come back and
do a beer dinner with you

01:06:10.170 --> 01:06:11.000
guys at some point.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:11.500
Cheers.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.000
Thanks so much.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.550
[APPLAUSE]
