what maybe a new human retrovirus called

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469
what maybe a new human retrovirus called
 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.880
what maybe a new human retrovirus called
XMRV so this starts this whole story

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
XMRV so this starts this whole story
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.690
XMRV so this starts this whole story
starts with prostate cancer prostate

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700
starts with prostate cancer prostate

cancer is a disease that in that occurs

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
cancer is a disease that in that occurs
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.119
cancer is a disease that in that occurs
in two forms there is a sporadic form of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129
in two forms there is a sporadic form of
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.610
in two forms there is a sporadic form of
the disease where the prevalence

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620
the disease where the prevalence
 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.090
the disease where the prevalence
increases with age so a risk factor is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
increases with age so a risk factor is
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.109
increases with age so a risk factor is
age and then there is a familial form

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119
age and then there is a familial form
 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.830
age and then there is a familial form
where genetics is involved and you're

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
where genetics is involved and you're
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.710
where genetics is involved and you're
predisposed to developing the cancer

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
predisposed to developing the cancer
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.480
predisposed to developing the cancer
depending on what's been present in your

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
depending on what's been present in your
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.450
depending on what's been present in your
family and this is typically early onset

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460
family and this is typically early onset
 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.140
family and this is typically early onset
less than 55 years old a number of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
less than 55 years old a number of
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.260
less than 55 years old a number of
studies have shown that perhaps another

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
studies have shown that perhaps another
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.510
studies have shown that perhaps another
risk factor for prostate cancer is a

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520
risk factor for prostate cancer is a
 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.170
risk factor for prostate cancer is a
mutation in RNA cell so RNA Sal remember

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180
mutation in RNA cell so RNA Sal remember
 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.929
mutation in RNA cell so RNA Sal remember
it's a interferon stimulated gene

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
it's a interferon stimulated gene
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.359
it's a interferon stimulated gene
product that's involved in cutting up

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
product that's involved in cutting up
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.039
product that's involved in cutting up
the genomes of incoming viruses and in

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
the genomes of incoming viruses and in
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.300
the genomes of incoming viruses and in
particular this are 462 qvariant is

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310
particular this are 462 qvariant is
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340
particular this are 462 qvariant is
thought to have be associated with an

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
thought to have be associated with an
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.649
thought to have be associated with an
increased risk for having prostate

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659
increased risk for having prostate
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.630
increased risk for having prostate
cancer all right now this mutation

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640
cancer all right now this mutation
 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.100
cancer all right now this mutation
actually decreases the catalytic

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
actually decreases the catalytic
 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.859
actually decreases the catalytic
activity of the RNAs so it makes it less

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
activity of the RNAs so it makes it less
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.399
activity of the RNAs so it makes it less
efficient at chopping up RNA so some of

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409
efficient at chopping up RNA so some of
 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.670
efficient at chopping up RNA so some of
the ideas for how this mutation might

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680
the ideas for how this mutation might
 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.460
the ideas for how this mutation might
predispose you to prostate cancer maybe

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
predispose you to prostate cancer maybe
 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.580
predispose you to prostate cancer maybe
it makes maybe it has an

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590
it makes maybe it has an
 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.610
it makes maybe it has an
anti a pop Tata cafetto and so you don't

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620
anti a pop Tata cafetto and so you don't
 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.400
anti a pop Tata cafetto and so you don't
normally clear precancerous cells and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410
normally clear precancerous cells and
 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.309
normally clear precancerous cells and
therefore they progress the cancer or

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319
therefore they progress the cancer or
 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.589
therefore they progress the cancer or
another idea was that maybe this

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599
another idea was that maybe this
 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.530
another idea was that maybe this
mutation allowed you to be infected with

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540
mutation allowed you to be infected with
 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.009
mutation allowed you to be infected with
a virus which then led to prostate

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019
a virus which then led to prostate
 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.380
a virus which then led to prostate
cancer alright so the original idea for

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390
cancer alright so the original idea for
 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.710
cancer alright so the original idea for
looking for a virus etiology of prostate

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720
looking for a virus etiology of prostate
 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.539
looking for a virus etiology of prostate
cancer was this mutation in RNA cell

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549
cancer was this mutation in RNA cell
 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.390
cancer was this mutation in RNA cell
right so a group actually a multi-center

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400
right so a group actually a multi-center
 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.640
right so a group actually a multi-center
group decided to do this and what they

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650
group decided to do this and what they
 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.970
group decided to do this and what they
used was a microarray technology this is

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980
used was a microarray technology this is
 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.370
used was a microarray technology this is
a figure from the textbook showing you

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380
a figure from the textbook showing you
 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.860
a figure from the textbook showing you
how DNA microarrays work in this

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870
how DNA microarrays work in this
 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.229
how DNA microarrays work in this
experiment we are looking to see if a

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239
experiment we are looking to see if a
 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.589
experiment we are looking to see if a
virus infected cell makes different

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599
virus infected cell makes different
 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.920
virus infected cell makes different
mRNAs compared to an uninfected cell of

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930
mRNAs compared to an uninfected cell of
 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.990
mRNAs compared to an uninfected cell of
course the viral mrnas would be

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000
course the viral mrnas would be
 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.250
course the viral mrnas would be
different but you want to know if in

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260
different but you want to know if in
 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.710
different but you want to know if in
particular cellular mrnas or turned on

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720
particular cellular mrnas or turned on
 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.470
particular cellular mrnas or turned on
so what you do is you make these arrays

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480
so what you do is you make these arrays
 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.479
so what you do is you make these arrays
on glass slides we're a robot prints

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489
on glass slides we're a robot prints
 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.949
on glass slides we're a robot prints
individual DNA sequences hundreds and

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959
individual DNA sequences hundreds and
 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.460
individual DNA sequences hundreds and
hundreds of them per slide then you can

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470
hundreds of them per slide then you can
 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.150
hundreds of them per slide then you can
make RNA from your test subjects it can

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160
make RNA from your test subjects it can
 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.740
make RNA from your test subjects it can
be a virus infected cell or an

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750
be a virus infected cell or an
 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.930
be a virus infected cell or an
uninfected cell in the case today it's a

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940
uninfected cell in the case today it's a
 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.970
uninfected cell in the case today it's a
prostate tumor we're going to make RNA

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980
prostate tumor we're going to make RNA
 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.640
prostate tumor we're going to make RNA
from prostate tumors cut out of patience

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650
from prostate tumors cut out of patience
 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.970
from prostate tumors cut out of patience
you take the RNA you make cdna using

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980
you take the RNA you make cdna using
 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.870
you take the RNA you make cdna using
reverse transcriptase and you use a dye

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880
reverse transcriptase and you use a dye
 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.909
reverse transcriptase and you use a dye
coupled triphosphate so that the DNA you

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:42.919
coupled triphosphate so that the DNA you
 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:45.250
coupled triphosphate so that the DNA you
make is labeled with a fluorescent dye

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260
make is labeled with a fluorescent dye
 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.409
make is labeled with a fluorescent dye
in this case one is red and one is green

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419
in this case one is red and one is green
 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.979
in this case one is red and one is green
so you can distinguish viral DNA from

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989
so you can distinguish viral DNA from
 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.069
so you can distinguish viral DNA from
cellular DNA you then hybridize these

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079
cellular DNA you then hybridize these
 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.059
cellular DNA you then hybridize these
DNA's to the slide you can do this very

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069
DNA's to the slide you can do this very
 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.720
DNA's to the slide you can do this very
readily and then you excite the floors

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730
readily and then you excite the floors
 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.120
readily and then you excite the floors
on the that have stuck to the glass

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130
on the that have stuck to the glass
 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.610

slide with lasers that excite at

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620
slide with lasers that excite at
 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.740
slide with lasers that excite at
different wavelengths and then you can

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750
different wavelengths and then you can
 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.039
different wavelengths and then you can
take photographs or digitize these and

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049
take photographs or digitize these and
 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.050
take photographs or digitize these and
analyze them so in this experiment if

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060
analyze them so in this experiment if
 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.170
analyze them so in this experiment if
you have a red dot it means that mRNA is

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180
you have a red dot it means that mRNA is
 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.330
you have a red dot it means that mRNA is
and do so each dot on the slide is a

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340
and do so each dot on the slide is a
 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.030
and do so each dot on the slide is a
different sequence come

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040
different sequence come
 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.280
different sequence come
referring to a cellular gene say so if

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290
referring to a cellular gene say so if
 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.620
referring to a cellular gene say so if
you have a red dot it means the mRNA is

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630
you have a red dot it means the mRNA is
 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.470
you have a red dot it means the mRNA is
up if you have a green dot it means it's

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480
up if you have a green dot it means it's
 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.350
up if you have a green dot it means it's
down because you have mostly cellular

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360
down because you have mostly cellular
 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.230
down because you have mostly cellular
green here and if it's yellow that means

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240
green here and if it's yellow that means
 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.820
green here and if it's yellow that means
the two are equal there's no change

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830
the two are equal there's no change
 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.490
the two are equal there's no change
alright so in this experiment they did

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500
alright so in this experiment they did
 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.000
alright so in this experiment they did
this was just DNA or RNA from prostate

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010
this was just DNA or RNA from prostate
 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.300
this was just DNA or RNA from prostate
tumors I do a microarray and on the

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310
tumors I do a microarray and on the
 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.070
tumors I do a microarray and on the
slide was not cellular mrna but viral

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080
slide was not cellular mrna but viral
 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.810
slide was not cellular mrna but viral
sequences and so this is called the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820
sequences and so this is called the
 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.050
sequences and so this is called the
viral chip was developed by jo durie see

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060
viral chip was developed by jo durie see
 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.660
viral chip was developed by jo durie see
at UCSF and this viral chip contains the

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670
at UCSF and this viral chip contains the
 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.510
at UCSF and this viral chip contains the
most conserved sequences of about nine

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520
most conserved sequences of about nine
 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.850
most conserved sequences of about nine
hundred and fifty different viruses so

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860
hundred and fifty different viruses so
 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.790
hundred and fifty different viruses so
it's a scan to say what virus is in this

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800
it's a scan to say what virus is in this
 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.700
it's a scan to say what virus is in this
sample so they took RNA from tumor

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710
sample so they took RNA from tumor
 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.640
sample so they took RNA from tumor
tissues they took 19 different tumor

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650
tissues they took 19 different tumor
 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.070
tissues they took 19 different tumor
tissues which were collected at the

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080
tissues which were collected at the
 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.400
tissues which were collected at the
Cleveland Clinic and they extracted RNA

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410
Cleveland Clinic and they extracted RNA
 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.080
Cleveland Clinic and they extracted RNA
label them fluorescently and hybridized

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090
label them fluorescently and hybridized
 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.830
label them fluorescently and hybridized
them to this viral microarray okay not a

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840
them to this viral microarray okay not a
 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.660
them to this viral microarray okay not a
cellular microarray it's all viral

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670
cellular microarray it's all viral
 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.160
cellular microarray it's all viral
sequences because they want to know what

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170
sequences because they want to know what
 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.310
sequences because they want to know what
kind of viruses might be in the prostate

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320
kind of viruses might be in the prostate
 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.170
kind of viruses might be in the prostate
tumor and so here's an example of the

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180
tumor and so here's an example of the
 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.640
tumor and so here's an example of the
readout of a microarray so here on the

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650
readout of a microarray so here on the
 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.740
readout of a microarray so here on the
left is just part of it and this is

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750
left is just part of it and this is
 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.790
left is just part of it and this is
showing 502 retroviral sequences that

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800
showing 502 retroviral sequences that
 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.190
showing 502 retroviral sequences that
were on the chip they're all viruses

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200
were on the chip they're all viruses
 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.320
were on the chip they're all viruses
represented but we're just looking at

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330
represented but we're just looking at
 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.090
represented but we're just looking at
the retroviral sequences because that's

00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100
the retroviral sequences because that's
 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.700
the retroviral sequences because that's
in fact what they picked up and these

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710
in fact what they picked up and these
 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.040
in fact what they picked up and these
are the positive hybridization signals

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050
are the positive hybridization signals
 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.380
are the positive hybridization signals
here each line it's a different sequence

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390
here each line it's a different sequence
 

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.260
here each line it's a different sequence
and going vertically each vp is a

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270
and going vertically each vp is a
 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.420
and going vertically each vp is a
different patient samples with their 19

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430
different patient samples with their 19
 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.450
different patient samples with their 19
patient samples and you can see one two

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460
patient samples and you can see one two
 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.730
patient samples and you can see one two
three four five six seven eight of them

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740
three four five six seven eight of them
 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.790
three four five six seven eight of them
or or maybe seven I think it was a

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800
or or maybe seven I think it was a
 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.330
or or maybe seven I think it was a
reacting with retroviral sequences on

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340
reacting with retroviral sequences on
 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.740
reacting with retroviral sequences on
the chip so they're giving you a

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750
the chip so they're giving you a
 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.920
the chip so they're giving you a
positive signal and then they took these

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930
positive signal and then they took these
 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.950
positive signal and then they took these
positive samples and did a pcr for a

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960
positive samples and did a pcr for a
 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.830
positive samples and did a pcr for a
retro viral gene and this is the gag

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840
retro viral gene and this is the gag
 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.120
retro viral gene and this is the gag
gene and you can see these are all

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130
gene and you can see these are all
 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.850
gene and you can see these are all
confirmed positive as well

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860
confirmed positive as well
 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.860
confirmed positive as well
so this is a typical readout of a

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870
so this is a typical readout of a
 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:42.950
so this is a typical readout of a
microarray now here are the numbers so

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960
microarray now here are the numbers so
 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.809
microarray now here are the numbers so
they got a positive signal in 7 of 11

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:44.819
they got a positive signal in 7 of 11
 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:47.839
they got a positive signal in 7 of 11
tumors homozygous for this variant so

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:47.849
tumors homozygous for this variant so
 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.659
tumors homozygous for this variant so
our Q so its QQ and those are the red

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:50.669
our Q so its QQ and those are the red
 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.839
our Q so its QQ and those are the red
ones here and then they also got a

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:53.849
ones here and then they also got a
 

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.659
ones here and then they also got a
positive signal in a heterozygous

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669
positive signal in a heterozygous
 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.070
positive signal in a heterozygous
variance so in other words the

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080
variance so in other words the
 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.050
variance so in other words the
homozygous have both mutations in RNA

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060
homozygous have both mutations in RNA
 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.149
homozygous have both mutations in RNA
cell and the heterozygous only has one

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:02.159
cell and the heterozygous only has one
 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:06.559
cell and the heterozygous only has one
allele mutated so 7 of 11 for the RNA

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:06.569
allele mutated so 7 of 11 for the RNA
 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:09.709
allele mutated so 7 of 11 for the RNA
art cube RNA selves area of QQ no

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:09.719
art cube RNA selves area of QQ no
 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:11.480
art cube RNA selves area of QQ no
positive signals and three tumors from

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:11.490
positive signals and three tumors from
 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.709
positive signals and three tumors from
RQ heterozygotes and one positive in in

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:15.719
RQ heterozygotes and one positive in in
 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:19.939
RQ heterozygotes and one positive in in
the wild-type homozygote alright so that

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:19.949
the wild-type homozygote alright so that
 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:21.980
the wild-type homozygote alright so that
was a gamma retrovirus that they pulled

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:21.990
was a gamma retrovirus that they pulled
 

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.559
was a gamma retrovirus that they pulled
out and so what they did is they went

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:24.569
out and so what they did is they went
 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:27.439
out and so what they did is they went
back to some of the positive prostate

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:27.449
back to some of the positive prostate
 

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:29.990
back to some of the positive prostate
tumors and they use PCR to amplify the

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000
tumors and they use PCR to amplify the
 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.080
tumors and they use PCR to amplify the
entire viral genome from those samples

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:33.090
entire viral genome from those samples
 

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:35.480
entire viral genome from those samples
and this is what they got on top is a

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.490
and this is what they got on top is a
 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:38.869
and this is what they got on top is a
diagram of the viral genome that was

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:38.879
diagram of the viral genome that was
 

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:41.629
diagram of the viral genome that was
cloned from one of these on this slide

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639
cloned from one of these on this slide
 

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.230
cloned from one of these on this slide
are shown genomes cloned from two

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:45.240
are shown genomes cloned from two
 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.529
are shown genomes cloned from two
different patients VP 35 and VP 62 so

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539
different patients VP 35 and VP 62 so
 

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:50.360
different patients VP 35 and VP 62 so
this was cloned into pieces and this was

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.370
this was cloned into pieces and this was
 

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.339
this was cloned into pieces and this was
cloned in a number of different pieces

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:52.349
cloned in a number of different pieces
 

00:07:52.349 --> 00:07:54.290
cloned in a number of different pieces
here and they sequenced them and they

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300
here and they sequenced them and they
 

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.480
here and they sequenced them and they
find a typical retro viral genome with

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:56.490
find a typical retro viral genome with
 

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.079
find a typical retro viral genome with
the ltrs on either side it encodes a gag

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:00.089
the ltrs on either side it encodes a gag
 

00:08:00.089 --> 00:08:03.050
the ltrs on either side it encodes a gag
and a gag pro Paul protein and an

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.060
and a gag pro Paul protein and an
 

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:05.050
and a gag pro Paul protein and an
envelope protein from a spliced

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:05.060
envelope protein from a spliced
 

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:08.450
envelope protein from a spliced
messenger RNA so they took this sequence

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:08.460
messenger RNA so they took this sequence
 

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.519
messenger RNA so they took this sequence
and they just compared it to the entire

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:10.529
and they just compared it to the entire
 

00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:13.159
and they just compared it to the entire
database of viral sequences which you

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:13.169
database of viral sequences which you
 

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:15.170
database of viral sequences which you
can do very readily and they find that

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:15.180
can do very readily and they find that
 

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.619
can do very readily and they find that
it has very high identity with a number

00:08:18.619 --> 00:08:18.629
it has very high identity with a number
 

00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:22.519
it has very high identity with a number
of other retroviruses of mice all right

00:08:22.519 --> 00:08:22.529
of other retroviruses of mice all right
 

00:08:22.529 --> 00:08:25.179
of other retroviruses of mice all right
so these are all a variety of murine

00:08:25.179 --> 00:08:25.189
so these are all a variety of murine
 

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:28.010
so these are all a variety of murine
retroviruses there are some exogenous

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:28.020
retroviruses there are some exogenous
 

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:31.189
retroviruses there are some exogenous
and endogenous viruses so these ARVs are

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199
and endogenous viruses so these ARVs are
 

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:34.040
and endogenous viruses so these ARVs are
endogenous retroviruses those are pro

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.050
endogenous retroviruses those are pro
 

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:35.959
endogenous retroviruses those are pro
viral sequences that are present in the

00:08:35.959 --> 00:08:35.969
viral sequences that are present in the
 

00:08:35.969 --> 00:08:39.019
viral sequences that are present in the
mouse genome so they're called murine

00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:39.029
mouse genome so they're called murine
 

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:40.759
mouse genome so they're called murine
endogenous retrovirus and then this

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:40.769
endogenous retrovirus and then this
 

00:08:40.769 --> 00:08:42.500
endogenous retrovirus and then this
tells you what chromosome of the mouse

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:42.510
tells you what chromosome of the mouse
 

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:45.920
tells you what chromosome of the mouse
they are integrated into chromosome 147

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:45.930
they are integrated into chromosome 147
 

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:49.639
they are integrated into chromosome 147
cetera so this new virus that they found

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:49.649
cetera so this new virus that they found
 

00:08:49.649 --> 00:08:51.230
cetera so this new virus that they found
in a prostate instead

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240
in a prostate instead
 

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.210
in a prostate instead
prostate tumors had high homology to

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:53.220
prostate tumors had high homology to
 

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.690
prostate tumors had high homology to
murine retroviruses and here's a

detected in tumor tissues so they
conclude it's probably not a contaminant

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:06.960
conclude it's probably not a contaminant
 

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.540
conclude it's probably not a contaminant
and it's the first example of human

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:08.550
and it's the first example of human
 

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.900
and it's the first example of human

so this was the paper in plos pathogens

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.100
so this was the paper in plos pathogens
 

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:18.530
so this was the paper in plos pathogens
in March 2006 I was a collaboration

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:18.540
in March 2006 I was a collaboration
 

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.950
in March 2006 I was a collaboration
between the DC lab at UCSF and the

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:21.960
between the DC lab at UCSF and the
 

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.410

provided the prostate tumor samples some

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:28.890
provided the prostate tumor samples some
 

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.980
provided the prostate tumor samples some
of the questions raised by this study

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:30.990
of the questions raised by this study
 

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.220
of the questions raised by this study
first of all this virus has no oncogene

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:34.230
first of all this virus has no oncogene
 

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.430
first of all this virus has no oncogene
you remember that many RNA tumor viruses

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440
you remember that many RNA tumor viruses
 

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.990
you remember that many RNA tumor viruses
are oncogenic because they have an

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000
are oncogenic because they have an
 

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.910
are oncogenic because they have an
oncogene in them but the sequence of

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920
oncogene in them but the sequence of
 

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:43.370
oncogene in them but the sequence of
this one showed there's no oncogene so

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380
this one showed there's no oncogene so
 

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.310
this one showed there's no oncogene so
how does it cause prostate cancer

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320
how does it cause prostate cancer
 

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.750
how does it cause prostate cancer
another interesting thing which we

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760
another interesting thing which we
 

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.490
another interesting thing which we
didn't point out in the sections but the

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:49.500
didn't point out in the sections but the
 

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.150
didn't point out in the sections but the
genome is found in stromal cells not the

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160
genome is found in stromal cells not the
 

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:55.190
genome is found in stromal cells not the
actual carcinoma cells in the prostate

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200
actual carcinoma cells in the prostate
 

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.230
actual carcinoma cells in the prostate
samples well it just is funny because

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240
samples well it just is funny because
 

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.550
samples well it just is funny because
you would assume that the viral genome

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560
you would assume that the viral genome
 

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.100
you would assume that the viral genome
is present in the tumor cells and that's

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:01.110
is present in the tumor cells and that's
 

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.530
is present in the tumor cells and that's
not the case these data don't prove it a

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:03.540
not the case these data don't prove it a
 

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:05.810
not the case these data don't prove it a
link of the virus with cancer they just

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820
link of the virus with cancer they just
 

00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.490
link of the virus with cancer they just
show that there's an association so you

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:07.500
show that there's an association so you
 

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.130
show that there's an association so you
have to do much more than then show an

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:10.140
have to do much more than then show an
 

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.440
have to do much more than then show an
association of a virus with a certain

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:12.450
association of a virus with a certain
 

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.540
association of a virus with a certain
disease and finally where did this virus

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:14.550
disease and finally where did this virus
 

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.300
disease and finally where did this virus
come one from it's a murine virus which

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:17.310
come one from it's a murine virus which
 

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.850
come one from it's a murine virus which
we say is infecting people so let's take

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:19.860
we say is infecting people so let's take
 

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:22.160
we say is infecting people so let's take
a look at the virus before we go on this

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:22.170
a look at the virus before we go on this
 

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:24.380

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:57.110
here is again a sequence line up between
 

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.590
here is again a sequence line up between
these patient samples you see prostate

00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600
these patient samples you see prostate
 

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.720
these patient samples you see prostate
cancer here very closely related to

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:01.730
cancer here very closely related to
 

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:04.060
cancer here very closely related to
murine leukemia viruses and so what

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:04.070
murine leukemia viruses and so what
 

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:05.890
murine leukemia viruses and so what
happens in mice this is just a

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:05.900
happens in mice this is just a
 

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.170
happens in mice this is just a
theoretical idea for how it got into

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:08.180
theoretical idea for how it got into
 

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:12.880
theoretical idea for how it got into
people so mice make exogenous murine

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:12.890
people so mice make exogenous murine
 

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.890
people so mice make exogenous murine
retroviruses the eco tropic viruses for

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:14.900
retroviruses the eco tropic viruses for
 

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:18.150
retroviruses the eco tropic viruses for
example they can infect mice these

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:18.160
example they can infect mice these
 

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.920
example they can infect mice these
eventually become endogenous so they

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:20.930
eventually become endogenous so they
 

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:23.500
eventually become endogenous so they
integrate into the genome and these mice

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:23.510
integrate into the genome and these mice
 

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.940
integrate into the genome and these mice
live with these infections for many

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:24.950
live with these infections for many
 

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.430
live with these infections for many
years eventually the my sins are

00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440
years eventually the my sins are
 

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.290
years eventually the my sins are
selected for a receptor mutation which

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:29.300
selected for a receptor mutation which
 

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:30.760
selected for a receptor mutation which
makes them resistant so they don't get

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:30.770
makes them resistant so they don't get
 

00:21:30.770 --> 00:21:33.670
makes them resistant so they don't get
disease and now we have Xena tropic MLV

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:33.680
disease and now we have Xena tropic MLV
 

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:36.130
disease and now we have Xena tropic MLV
these mice make virus but they can't be

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:36.140
these mice make virus but they can't be
 

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:38.410
these mice make virus but they can't be
infected by it although the virus can

00:21:38.410 --> 00:21:38.420
infected by it although the virus can
 

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.240
infected by it although the virus can
spread to other species so the idea is

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:40.250
spread to other species so the idea is
 

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:41.770
spread to other species so the idea is
that one of these kinds of viruses

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:41.780
that one of these kinds of viruses
 

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:44.980
that one of these kinds of viruses
somehow infected people the question is

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:44.990
somehow infected people the question is
 

00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:47.230
somehow infected people the question is
was there one case of the virus going

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240
was there one case of the virus going
 

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.780
was there one case of the virus going
from a mouse to people or were there

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:49.790
from a mouse to people or were there
 

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.330
from a mouse to people or were there
multiple incidents was there any human

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:52.340
multiple incidents was there any human
 

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.860
multiple incidents was there any human
to human transmission we don't have any

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:53.870
to human transmission we don't have any
 

00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:55.540
to human transmission we don't have any
answers to these questions from what

00:21:55.540 --> 00:21:55.550
answers to these questions from what
 

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.000
answers to these questions from what
I've told you so far so I just want to

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.010
I've told you so far so I just want to
 

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:59.500
I've told you so far so I just want to
tell you about some studies where they

00:21:59.500 --> 00:21:59.510
tell you about some studies where they
 

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.810
tell you about some studies where they
have looked in the mouse genome to see

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:01.820
have looked in the mouse genome to see
 

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.910
have looked in the mouse genome to see
if there's a related virus so again we

00:22:03.910 --> 00:22:03.920
if there's a related virus so again we
 

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.440
if there's a related virus so again we
start with XMRV the virus isolated from

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:07.450
start with XMRV the virus isolated from
 

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.240
start with XMRV the virus isolated from
prostate tumors

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:09.250
prostate tumors
 

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:11.460
prostate tumors
you make primers that will detect it in

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:11.470
you make primers that will detect it in
 

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:14.010
you make primers that will detect it in
the mouse genome and this is an example

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:14.020
the mouse genome and this is an example
 

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.220
the mouse genome and this is an example
of how you can use pcr to specifically

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:17.230
of how you can use pcr to specifically
 

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:21.690
of how you can use pcr to specifically
look for XMRV it turns out that XMRV has

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:21.700
look for XMRV it turns out that XMRV has
 

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:24.090
look for XMRV it turns out that XMRV has
a 24 nucleotide deletion right here

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:24.100
a 24 nucleotide deletion right here
 

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:27.000
a 24 nucleotide deletion right here
which is unique and so you can design

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.010
which is unique and so you can design
 

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:30.120
which is unique and so you can design
pcr primers that span it and are

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.130
pcr primers that span it and are
 

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.130
pcr primers that span it and are
therefore going to amplify specifically

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:32.140
therefore going to amplify specifically
 

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.150
therefore going to amplify specifically
XMRV in Mouse DNA all right you want to

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:36.160
XMRV in Mouse DNA all right you want to
 

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.380
XMRV in Mouse DNA all right you want to
do this because there are lots of

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:37.390
do this because there are lots of
 

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.970
do this because there are lots of
related sequences in the mouse genome

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:38.980
related sequences in the mouse genome
 

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.560
related sequences in the mouse genome
and you don't want to see those you just

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:40.570
and you don't want to see those you just
 

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:45.300
and you don't want to see those you just
want to see XMRV so this was done in in

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:45.310
want to see XMRV so this was done in in
 

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.400
want to see XMRV so this was done in in
a number of laboratories and these are

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:47.410
a number of laboratories and these are
 

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.610
a number of laboratories and these are
some of the mouse DNA's that were tested

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:50.620
some of the mouse DNA's that were tested
 

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:55.980
some of the mouse DNA's that were tested
for XMRV of course mus musculus is a cut

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:55.990
for XMRV of course mus musculus is a cut
 

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.710
for XMRV of course mus musculus is a cut
is the origin of many lab strains which

00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720
is the origin of many lab strains which
 

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.150
is the origin of many lab strains which
are shown here some of these may look

familiar to you Bob see c57 black then

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:04.390
familiar to you Bob see c57 black then
 

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.160
familiar to you Bob see c57 black then
there are many substrains as well of

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:07.170
there are many substrains as well of
 

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.810
there are many substrains as well of
most musculus all these were looked out

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:09.820
most musculus all these were looked out
 

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.870
most musculus all these were looked out
than their different sprains Predis cook

I etc dunny and then it was also looked

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:17.770
I etc dunny and then it was also looked
 

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:20.250
I etc dunny and then it was also looked
for in rat cells and a variety of other

00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:20.260
for in rat cells and a variety of other
 

00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:24.030
for in rat cells and a variety of other
cells as well and so what was found was

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:24.040
cells as well and so what was found was
 

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.940
cells as well and so what was found was
that inbred mice of all those strains

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:26.950
that inbred mice of all those strains
 

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.460
that inbred mice of all those strains
contain about 10 to 20 Xena Tropic

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:29.470
contain about 10 to 20 Xena Tropic
 

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:33.840
contain about 10 to 20 Xena Tropic
viruses related to XM RV but none of

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:33.850
viruses related to XM RV but none of
 

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:35.730
viruses related to XM RV but none of
them the ones that were looked at

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:35.740
them the ones that were looked at
 

00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:37.740
them the ones that were looked at
contain a single pro virus with the

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:37.750
contain a single pro virus with the
 

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.350
contain a single pro virus with the
exact sequences of XMRV that is the

00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.360
exact sequences of XMRV that is the
 

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.800
exact sequences of XMRV that is the
virus that we got from prostate tumors

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:42.810
virus that we got from prostate tumors
 

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:48.030
virus that we got from prostate tumors
so none of these mouse strains have xmrv

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:48.040
so none of these mouse strains have xmrv
 

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:50.100
so none of these mouse strains have xmrv
that have related Xena Tropic viruses

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:50.110
that have related Xena Tropic viruses
 

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:54.120
that have related Xena Tropic viruses
but not xmrv so it's not likely that any

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:54.130
but not xmrv so it's not likely that any
 

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.250
but not xmrv so it's not likely that any
of those viruses in the mice were the

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:56.260
of those viruses in the mice were the
 

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:01.110
of those viruses in the mice were the
immediate source of xmrv so well it's

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120
immediate source of xmrv so well it's
 

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.210
immediate source of xmrv so well it's
thought is that these results mean that

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:03.220
thought is that these results mean that
 

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.460
thought is that these results mean that
there was a single cross-species

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:04.470
there was a single cross-species
 

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:06.870
there was a single cross-species
transitions transmission sometimes

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880
transitions transmission sometimes
 

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.390
transitions transmission sometimes
recently and then the virus adapted to

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:09.400
recently and then the virus adapted to
 

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.850
recently and then the virus adapted to
humans so it became different now it's

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:11.860
humans so it became different now it's
 

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.240
humans so it became different now it's
different from the endogenous XMRV xml

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:15.250
different from the endogenous XMRV xml
 

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:18.810
different from the endogenous XMRV xml
vs so that's one idea or maybe there is

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:18.820
vs so that's one idea or maybe there is
 

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.940
vs so that's one idea or maybe there is
an endogenous pro virus in mice which

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:20.950
an endogenous pro virus in mice which
 

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:22.470
an endogenous pro virus in mice which
hasn't been detected yet and that

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480
hasn't been detected yet and that
 

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.159
hasn't been detected yet and that
could have led to XMRV infection okay so

00:24:26.159 --> 00:24:26.169
could have led to XMRV infection okay so
 

00:24:26.169 --> 00:24:27.990
could have led to XMRV infection okay so
remember this is a retrovirus that

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000
remember this is a retrovirus that
 

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.900
remember this is a retrovirus that
infect cells the RNA is converted to DNA

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:30.910
infect cells the RNA is converted to DNA
 

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:33.900
infect cells the RNA is converted to DNA
the DNA goes in the nucleus and it

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:33.910
the DNA goes in the nucleus and it
 

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:37.710
the DNA goes in the nucleus and it
integrates and forms a proviral DNA you

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720
integrates and forms a proviral DNA you
 

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:39.960
integrates and forms a proviral DNA you
remember that this integration step is

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:39.970
remember that this integration step is
 

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:43.289
remember that this integration step is
an obligatory step in retro virus

00:24:43.289 --> 00:24:43.299
an obligatory step in retro virus
 

00:24:43.299 --> 00:24:45.870
an obligatory step in retro virus
replication the virus cannot replicate

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880
replication the virus cannot replicate
 

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.230
replication the virus cannot replicate
without integrating so a very good test

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:49.240
without integrating so a very good test
 

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.539
without integrating so a very good test
of whether in fact a cell is infected

00:24:51.539 --> 00:24:51.549
of whether in fact a cell is infected
 

00:24:51.549 --> 00:24:54.299
of whether in fact a cell is infected
with a retrovirus is to find the

00:24:54.299 --> 00:24:54.309
with a retrovirus is to find the
 

00:24:54.309 --> 00:24:56.510
with a retrovirus is to find the
integration site in the chromosomal DNA

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520
integration site in the chromosomal DNA
 

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:59.340
integration site in the chromosomal DNA
right so you could take DNA from these

00:24:59.340 --> 00:24:59.350
right so you could take DNA from these
 

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:01.409
right so you could take DNA from these
prostate tumors and ask is there

00:25:01.409 --> 00:25:01.419
prostate tumors and ask is there
 

00:25:01.419 --> 00:25:04.049
prostate tumors and ask is there
integrated retro viral DNA because what

00:25:04.049 --> 00:25:04.059
integrated retro viral DNA because what
 

00:25:04.059 --> 00:25:06.480
integrated retro viral DNA because what
was done before was to take RNA from

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:06.490
was done before was to take RNA from
 

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.299
was done before was to take RNA from
these tumors and make DNA from it all

00:25:09.299 --> 00:25:09.309
these tumors and make DNA from it all
 

00:25:09.309 --> 00:25:10.470
these tumors and make DNA from it all
right that doesn't tell you that it's

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480
right that doesn't tell you that it's
 

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.470
right that doesn't tell you that it's
integrated remember when you when you

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480
integrated remember when you when you
 

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.080
integrated remember when you when you
integrate a retro viral genome there's a

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:16.090
integrate a retro viral genome there's a
 

00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:18.900
integrate a retro viral genome there's a
host target the host target sequences

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:18.910
host target the host target sequences
 

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:20.970
host target the host target sequences
are duplicated and you lose some

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:20.980
are duplicated and you lose some
 

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.940
are duplicated and you lose some
retrovirus sequence so you can tell a

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:23.950
retrovirus sequence so you can tell a
 

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:26.100
retrovirus sequence so you can tell a
retrovirus integration site if you

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:26.110
retrovirus integration site if you
 

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.140
retrovirus integration site if you
sequence across the integration site

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:28.150
sequence across the integration site
 

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.780
sequence across the integration site
across the retrovirus into the cell DNA

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:30.790
across the retrovirus into the cell DNA
 

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.299
across the retrovirus into the cell DNA
you can tell that it's retro viral

00:25:33.299 --> 00:25:33.309
you can tell that it's retro viral
 

00:25:33.309 --> 00:25:45.140
you can tell that it's retro viral
because of these features so this is yes

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:45.150
 

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.880
could you check for protein expression

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:47.890
could you check for protein expression
 

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:50.880
could you check for protein expression
so in the prostate sections that's what

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:50.890
so in the prostate sections that's what
 

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.980
so in the prostate sections that's what
they did but it doesn't prove that

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:52.990
they did but it doesn't prove that
 

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:55.830
they did but it doesn't prove that
there's an integrated pro virus which is

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840
there's an integrated pro virus which is
 

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.590
there's an integrated pro virus which is
really a more gold standard proof of

00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.600
really a more gold standard proof of
 

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:09.110
really a more gold standard proof of
infection than finding protein yeah yes

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120
 

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.980
you lose to news nucleotides from either

00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:12.990
you lose to news nucleotides from either
 

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:16.220
you lose to news nucleotides from either
end of the retroviral sequence and then

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:16.230
end of the retroviral sequence and then
 

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:19.130
end of the retroviral sequence and then
you duplicate the target site in the

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.140
you duplicate the target site in the
 

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.890
you duplicate the target site in the
hosts DNA that that it's integrated into

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:21.900
hosts DNA that that it's integrated into
 

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:24.500
hosts DNA that that it's integrated into
so this is the host target this pink

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:24.510
so this is the host target this pink
 

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.790
so this is the host target this pink
sequence here and you can see it's

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:25.800
sequence here and you can see it's
 

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:30.170
sequence here and you can see it's
duplicated on either side and then these

00:26:30.170 --> 00:26:30.180
duplicated on either side and then these
 

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.270
duplicated on either side and then these
two properties to terminal bases are

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:32.280
two properties to terminal bases are
 

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:35.299
two properties to terminal bases are
lost in the virus the TT in the AE vaa

00:26:35.299 --> 00:26:35.309
lost in the virus the TT in the AE vaa
 

00:26:35.309 --> 00:26:38.150
lost in the virus the TT in the AE vaa
are gone right so you see that and you

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:38.160
are gone right so you see that and you
 

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.490
are gone right so you see that and you
can tell it's an integration sign all

00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.500
can tell it's an integration sign all
 

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.049
can tell it's an integration sign all
right so then this was looked at in this

00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059
right so then this was looked at in this
 

00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:44.530
right so then this was looked at in this
paper in october two thousand eight

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:44.540
paper in october two thousand eight
 

00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:48.190

new retro virus associated with prostate

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:51.210
new retro virus associated with prostate
 

00:26:51.210 --> 00:26:53.960
new retro virus associated with prostate
cancer so what they did is they took DNA

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:53.970
cancer so what they did is they took DNA
 

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.150
cancer so what they did is they took DNA
from prostate tumors they cloned out

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:56.160
from prostate tumors they cloned out
 

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.090
from prostate tumors they cloned out
nine xmrv integration sites from nine

00:26:59.090 --> 00:26:59.100
nine xmrv integration sites from nine
 

00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.490
nine xmrv integration sites from nine
patient actually i think they're more

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500
patient actually i think they're more
 

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:02.870
patient actually i think they're more
than nine there nine patients I think

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880
than nine there nine patients I think
 

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.430
than nine there nine patients I think
there are fourteen integration sites

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440
there are fourteen integration sites
 

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.190
there are fourteen integration sites
from nine patients and they sequence

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200
from nine patients and they sequence
 

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.169
from nine patients and they sequence
them and they found there's no

00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179
them and they found there's no
 

00:27:09.179 --> 00:27:10.850
them and they found there's no
integration near oncogenes which they

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860
integration near oncogenes which they
 

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:12.260
integration near oncogenes which they
wanted to see because that's that would

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:12.270
wanted to see because that's that would
 

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.910
wanted to see because that's that would
be how it would cause prostate cancer

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:13.920
be how it would cause prostate cancer
 

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.650
be how it would cause prostate cancer
and there's no integration near tumor

00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:15.660
and there's no integration near tumor
 

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.040
and there's no integration near tumor
suppressor gene which might disrupt it

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:18.050
suppressor gene which might disrupt it
 

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.630
suppressor gene which might disrupt it
so here are just three examples of this

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640
so here are just three examples of this
 

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.490
so here are just three examples of this
to give you an idea what the data look

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:22.500
to give you an idea what the data look
 

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.790
to give you an idea what the data look
like so on the top here is one

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:24.800
like so on the top here is one
 

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.510
like so on the top here is one
integration of XMRV and so they sequence

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520
integration of XMRV and so they sequence
 

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.910
integration of XMRV and so they sequence
across one of these integration sites

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:31.920
across one of these integration sites
 

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.940
across one of these integration sites
and you can see where the virus begins

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:34.950
and you can see where the virus begins
 

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.980
and you can see where the virus begins
and it goes into cellular sequence and

00:27:36.980 --> 00:27:36.990
and it goes into cellular sequence and
 

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.230
and it goes into cellular sequence and
you can just take the sequence you get

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240
you can just take the sequence you get
 

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:41.270
you can just take the sequence you get
and blasted against the genome sequence

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:41.280
and blasted against the genome sequence
 

00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:43.100
and blasted against the genome sequence
so you know exactly what chromosome this

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:43.110
so you know exactly what chromosome this
 

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:45.320
so you know exactly what chromosome this
integration occurs and what genes are

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:45.330
integration occurs and what genes are
 

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.510
integration occurs and what genes are
nearby so for example there's a creme 5

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520
nearby so for example there's a creme 5
 

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.210
nearby so for example there's a creme 5
gene here which encodes a transcription

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:50.220
gene here which encodes a transcription
 

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.460
gene here which encodes a transcription
factor that's one integration site

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:52.470
factor that's one integration site
 

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:53.990
factor that's one integration site
there's another one here within a gene

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000
there's another one here within a gene
 

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.750
there's another one here within a gene
and fat and then another one here within

00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760
and fat and then another one here within
 

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.240
and fat and then another one here within
a different gene so in all cases you can

00:27:59.240 --> 00:27:59.250
a different gene so in all cases you can
 

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.520
a different gene so in all cases you can
tell exactly where the integration has

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:01.530
tell exactly where the integration has
 

00:28:01.530 --> 00:28:03.110
tell exactly where the integration has
occurred so this was thought to be good

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120
occurred so this was thought to be good
 

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.600
occurred so this was thought to be good
evidence that there is actual bona fide

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:05.610
evidence that there is actual bona fide
 

00:28:05.610 --> 00:28:07.669
evidence that there is actual bona fide
infection of prostate cells because an

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679
infection of prostate cells because an
 

00:28:07.679 --> 00:28:10.100
infection of prostate cells because an
integration site dura is derived by

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:10.110
integration site dura is derived by
 

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:14.180
integration site dura is derived by
viral replication okay so now after

00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:14.190
viral replication okay so now after
 

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:15.890
viral replication okay so now after
these studies came out a number of

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900
these studies came out a number of
 

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.710
these studies came out a number of
people began to look in other areas of

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720
people began to look in other areas of
 

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.110
people began to look in other areas of
the world in people with prostate tumors

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120
the world in people with prostate tumors
 

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:22.860
the world in people with prostate tumors
to see if this virus is present because

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:22.870
to see if this virus is present because
 

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.450
to see if this virus is present because
that's one of the first things you do if

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:24.460
that's one of the first things you do if
 

00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.090
that's one of the first things you do if
you suspect the virus is causing a

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:27.100
you suspect the virus is causing a
 

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:28.950
you suspect the virus is causing a
disease you start looking in more cases

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960
disease you start looking in more cases
 

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.980
disease you start looking in more cases
and do some epidemiology so here is the

00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:31.990
and do some epidemiology so here is the
 

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:34.890
and do some epidemiology so here is the
study from Germany prevalence of XMRV

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:34.900
study from Germany prevalence of XMRV
 

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.220
study from Germany prevalence of XMRV
and sporadic prostate cancer so now

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:38.230
and sporadic prostate cancer so now
 

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.080
and sporadic prostate cancer so now
we're not worried about the RNA cell

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:40.090
we're not worried about the RNA cell
 

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:43.560
we're not worried about the RNA cell
mutation anymore so they found they

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:43.570
mutation anymore so they found they
 

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.260
mutation anymore so they found they
looked at 105 tissue samples from people

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:46.270
looked at 105 tissue samples from people
 

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.410
looked at 105 tissue samples from people
with non-familial prostate cancer they

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:49.420
with non-familial prostate cancer they
 

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.799
with non-familial prostate cancer they
found one positive for XMRV out of 105

00:28:52.799 --> 00:28:52.809
found one positive for XMRV out of 105
 

00:28:52.809 --> 00:28:57.450
found one positive for XMRV out of 105
using PCR they also found one in 70 in

00:28:57.450 --> 00:28:57.460
using PCR they also found one in 70 in
 

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.419
using PCR they also found one in 70 in
tissue samples of men without prostate

00:29:00.419 --> 00:29:00.429
tissue samples of men without prostate
 

00:29:00.429 --> 00:29:02.940
tissue samples of men without prostate
cancer so they concluded that at least

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:02.950
cancer so they concluded that at least
 

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.660
cancer so they concluded that at least
in Germany XMRV is not associated with

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:06.670
in Germany XMRV is not associated with
 

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.330
in Germany XMRV is not associated with
prostate cancer so that's november two

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:09.340
prostate cancer so that's november two
 

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.830
prostate cancer so that's november two

they I have no I'm not aware of any
 

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:36.170
they I have no I'm not aware of any
study that has attempted to make a

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:36.180
study that has attempted to make a
 

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:38.660
study that has attempted to make a
correlation between the two diseases no

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:38.670
correlation between the two diseases no
 

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:40.400
correlation between the two diseases no
we are we're going to talk about the

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:40.410
we are we're going to talk about the
 

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:42.950
we are we're going to talk about the
chronic fatigue syndrome results in a

chronic fatigue syndrome results in a
 

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.540
chronic fatigue syndrome results in a

moment but I've not I don't know of any
 

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:46.910
moment but I've not I don't know of any
that the attempt to do both it's same

00:29:46.910 --> 00:29:46.920
that the attempt to do both it's same
 

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:50.560
that the attempt to do both it's same
virus that's implicated in both though

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:50.570
virus that's implicated in both though
 

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:54.080
virus that's implicated in both though
this was a study in September 2009 from

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:54.090
this was a study in September 2009 from
 

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:56.840
this was a study in September 2009 from
a group at University of Utah and one of

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:56.850
a group at University of Utah and one of
 

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.060
a group at University of Utah and one of
the individuals they re Lessing used to

00:29:59.060 --> 00:29:59.070
the individuals they re Lessing used to
 

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.970
the individuals they re Lessing used to
be up at Columbia and she is a

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:01.980
be up at Columbia and she is a
 

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.710
be up at Columbia and she is a
pathologist and she looked at 233

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:05.720
pathologist and she looked at 233
 

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.390
pathologist and she looked at 233
prostate tumor sections she's a

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:08.400
prostate tumor sections she's a
 

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:12.530
prostate tumor sections she's a
pathologist and a virologist 109 benign

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:12.540
pathologist and a virologist 109 benign
 

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:16.160
pathologist and a virologist 109 benign
101 benign controls she found the DNA by

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:16.170
101 benign controls she found the DNA by
 

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:18.800
101 benign controls she found the DNA by
pcr in six percent of the tumors and in

00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:18.810
pcr in six percent of the tumors and in
 

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:21.110
pcr in six percent of the tumors and in
two percent of the controls she also

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120
two percent of the controls she also
 

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.700
two percent of the controls she also
looked for protein she found it in

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:22.710
looked for protein she found it in
 

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.740
looked for protein she found it in
twenty-three percent of the tumors and a

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:24.750
twenty-three percent of the tumors and a
 

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.300
twenty-three percent of the tumors and a
four percent of the controls in this

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:26.310
four percent of the controls in this
 

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:28.400
four percent of the controls in this
study contrast to the first one she

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:28.410
study contrast to the first one she
 

00:30:28.410 --> 00:30:31.760
study contrast to the first one she
found that the protein the viral protein

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:31.770
found that the protein the viral protein
 

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.790
found that the protein the viral protein
is predominantly found in malignant

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:34.800
is predominantly found in malignant
 

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.070
is predominantly found in malignant
cells not the stromal cells which are

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080
cells not the stromal cells which are
 

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.530
cells not the stromal cells which are
the non-malignant part of the sections

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:39.540
the non-malignant part of the sections
 

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.660
the non-malignant part of the sections
okay so this is a bit different but she

00:30:41.660 --> 00:30:41.670
okay so this is a bit different but she
 

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:44.480
okay so this is a bit different but she
also is finding XMRV consistently in

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:44.490
also is finding XMRV consistently in
 

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:46.520
also is finding XMRV consistently in
prostate tumor so this is an example of

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:46.530
prostate tumor so this is an example of
 

00:30:46.530 --> 00:30:49.910
prostate tumor so this is an example of
a section of a prostate tumor this has

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:49.920
a section of a prostate tumor this has
 

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.040
a section of a prostate tumor this has
been stained with an antibody to one of

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:52.050
been stained with an antibody to one of
 

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:55.700
been stained with an antibody to one of
the viral proteins now this antibody is

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:55.710
the viral proteins now this antibody is
 

00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:59.930
the viral proteins now this antibody is
made against XMRV virus so ela singh

00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940
made against XMRV virus so ela singh
 

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:01.970
made against XMRV virus so ela singh
propagated the virus and injected it

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:01.980
propagated the virus and injected it
 

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.130
propagated the virus and injected it
into rabbits and made into bodies so now

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:04.140
into rabbits and made into bodies so now
 

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.920
into rabbits and made into bodies so now
this is the brown staining is where the

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:06.930
this is the brown staining is where the
 

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:08.960
this is the brown staining is where the
antibody is reacting with proteins and

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:08.970
antibody is reacting with proteins and
 

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:12.350
antibody is reacting with proteins and
these are all malignant epithelial cells

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360
these are all malignant epithelial cells
 

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.870
these are all malignant epithelial cells
in the prostate section and the stroma

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880
in the prostate section and the stroma
 

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:17.210
in the prostate section and the stroma
which is marked with an S here is not

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220
which is marked with an S here is not
 

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.520
which is marked with an S here is not
staining so this makes more sense in

00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:19.530
staining so this makes more sense in
 

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:22.760
staining so this makes more sense in
terms of the tumor the actual malignant

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:22.770
terms of the tumor the actual malignant
 

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:24.260
terms of the tumor the actual malignant
cells are now expressing the viral

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:24.270
cells are now expressing the viral
 

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:28.670
cells are now expressing the viral
protein okay so another study in October

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:28.680
protein okay so another study in October
 

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:34.490
protein okay so another study in October
of 2009 this from another German cohort

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500
of 2009 this from another German cohort
 

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:37.640
of 2009 this from another German cohort
of patients lack of evidence for xmrv in

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:37.650
of patients lack of evidence for xmrv in
 

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.290
of patients lack of evidence for xmrv in
German prostate cancer patients they

00:31:39.290 --> 00:31:39.300
German prostate cancer patients they
 

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:44.330
German prostate cancer patients they
looked at 589 prostate samples and 146

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:44.340
looked at 589 prostate samples and 146
 

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:44.730
looked at 589 prostate samples and 146
see

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:44.740
see
 

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.890
see
samples from people with prostate cancer

00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:46.900
samples from people with prostate cancer
 

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.720
samples from people with prostate cancer
and they found no XMRV by pcr and no

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:51.730
and they found no XMRV by pcr and no
 

00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:55.520
and they found no XMRV by pcr and no
antibodies by eliza in any of the sarah

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:55.530
antibodies by eliza in any of the sarah
 

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:59.040
antibodies by eliza in any of the sarah
so again this is a German study so they

00:31:59.040 --> 00:31:59.050
so again this is a German study so they
 

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.990
so again this is a German study so they
said maybe there are some geographical

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000
said maybe there are some geographical
 

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.240
said maybe there are some geographical
restrictions on where this virus so

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:03.250
restrictions on where this virus so
 

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.950
restrictions on where this virus so
subsequently many studies have been done

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960
subsequently many studies have been done
 

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.049
subsequently many studies have been done
in many different areas looking for the

00:32:07.049 --> 00:32:07.059
in many different areas looking for the
 

00:32:07.059 --> 00:32:09.720
in many different areas looking for the
presence of this virus or viral sequence

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:09.730
presence of this virus or viral sequence
 

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:13.080
presence of this virus or viral sequence
or antibodies to it in a variety of

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:13.090
or antibodies to it in a variety of
 

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.690
or antibodies to it in a variety of
prostate cancer patients and these are

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:15.700
prostate cancer patients and these are
 

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.930
prostate cancer patients and these are
the studies that find the virus in pc at

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:18.940
the studies that find the virus in pc at
 

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:23.490
the studies that find the virus in pc at
the original one from ucsf 9 of 86 this

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:23.500
the original one from ucsf 9 of 86 this
 

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.890
the original one from ucsf 9 of 86 this
is the one from ela singh at University

00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:25.900
is the one from ela singh at University
 

00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:28.340
is the one from ela singh at University
of Utah and then there were two others

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:28.350
of Utah and then there were two others

integrated copies of XMRV in a cell line
 

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.230
integrated copies of XMRV in a cell line
called 22 rv1 so remember that not that

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240
called 22 rv1 so remember that not that

I'm going to ask you on an exam but

00:33:20.730 --> 00:33:20.740
I'm going to ask you on an exam but
 

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:23.310
I'm going to ask you on an exam but
it'll come up later 22r v1 is the cell

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320
it'll come up later 22r v1 is the cell

line derived from a human prostate tumor

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:26.350
line derived from a human prostate tumor
 

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:29.130
line derived from a human prostate tumor
and so they found that the virus that is

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:29.140
and so they found that the virus that is
 

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.169
and so they found that the virus that is
produced by this human cell line is

00:33:31.169 --> 00:33:31.179
produced by this human cell line is
 

00:33:31.179 --> 00:33:35.250
produced by this human cell line is
basically xmrv it's the same virus that

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:35.260
basically xmrv it's the same virus that
 

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.980
basically xmrv it's the same virus that
has already been found in prostate

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:37.990
has already been found in prostate
 

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:40.520
has already been found in prostate
tumors this was what we're talking about

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:40.530
tumors this was what we're talking about
 

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:44.580
tumors this was what we're talking about
this cell line was produced by taking a

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:44.590
this cell line was produced by taking a
 

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:47.610
this cell line was produced by taking a
piece of a human tumor and injecting it

00:33:47.610 --> 00:33:47.620
piece of a human tumor and injecting it
 

00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:50.250
piece of a human tumor and injecting it
into a nude mouse a mouse without an

00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:50.260
into a nude mouse a mouse without an
 

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:51.630
into a nude mouse a mouse without an
immune system it's called

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:51.640
immune system it's called
 

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.880
immune system it's called
xenotransplantation the purpose is to

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:53.890
xenotransplantation the purpose is to
 

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.919
xenotransplantation the purpose is to
grow up the tumor they pass it from

00:33:55.919 --> 00:33:55.929
grow up the tumor they pass it from
 

00:33:55.929 --> 00:33:57.330
grow up the tumor they pass it from
mouse the mouse and eventually make a

00:33:57.330 --> 00:33:57.340
mouse the mouse and eventually make a
 

00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:58.380
mouse the mouse and eventually make a
cell line out of it and

00:33:58.380 --> 00:33:58.390
cell line out of it and
 

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:01.440
cell line out of it and
that's the cell law in 22 rv1 so the

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:01.450
that's the cell law in 22 rv1 so the
 

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.150
that's the cell law in 22 rv1 so the
sequence of that virus is a nearly

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:03.160
sequence of that virus is a nearly
 

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.190
sequence of that virus is a nearly
identical to the XMRV that's been

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200
identical to the XMRV that's been
 

00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.580
identical to the XMRV that's been
isolated from prostate tumors and the

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:08.590
isolated from prostate tumors and the
 

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:11.460
isolated from prostate tumors and the
authors conclude quote we conclude that

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:11.470
authors conclude quote we conclude that
 

00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:15.030
authors conclude quote we conclude that
the 22 RV one virus is XMRV and is not a

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040
the 22 RV one virus is XMRV and is not a
 

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.130
the 22 RV one virus is XMRV and is not a
mouse Nina tropic virus acquired during

00:34:17.130 --> 00:34:17.140
mouse Nina tropic virus acquired during
 

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.860
mouse Nina tropic virus acquired during
passage of the cells in culture or in

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:19.870
passage of the cells in culture or in
 

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:22.409
passage of the cells in culture or in
mice so they said yeah this is XMRV it's

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:22.419
mice so they said yeah this is XMRV it's
 

00:34:22.419 --> 00:34:24.990
mice so they said yeah this is XMRV it's
not it's not a mouse seen atrophic virus

00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.000
not it's not a mouse seen atrophic virus
 

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.010
not it's not a mouse seen atrophic virus
so this is an interesting observation

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.020
so this is an interesting observation
 

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.630
so this is an interesting observation

glycoproteins on their surface so then

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:13.180
glycoproteins on their surface so then
 

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.540
glycoproteins on their surface so then
you add serum from the patients and you

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:15.550
you add serum from the patients and you
 

00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.540
you add serum from the patients and you
ask does that serum react with these

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:17.550
ask does that serum react with these
 

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:21.120
ask does that serum react with these
envelope expressing cells all right so

00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:21.130
envelope expressing cells all right so
 

00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:24.090
envelope expressing cells all right so
here we have normal Sierra normal plasma

00:41:24.090 --> 00:41:24.100
here we have normal Sierra normal plasma
 

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:28.290

from a patient without the disease and
 

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:32.250
from a patient without the disease and
then you have here a plasma so this is a

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:32.260
then you have here a plasma so this is a
 

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.370
then you have here a plasma so this is a
another control sorry this is another

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:35.380
another control sorry this is another
 

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:39.360
another control sorry this is another

cross-react with spleen focus forming
 

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.810
cross-react with spleen focus forming
proteins again it's not XMRV it's a

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:54.820
proteins again it's not XMRV it's a
 

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:56.790
proteins again it's not XMRV it's a
related virus so the patients appear to

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800
related virus so the patients appear to
 

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.100
related virus so the patients appear to
have virus in their peripheral blood

00:41:59.100 --> 00:41:59.110
have virus in their peripheral blood
 

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.320
have virus in their peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and they also appear

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:01.330
mononuclear cells and they also appear
 

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:04.620
mononuclear cells and they also appear
to have antibodies in their blood okay

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:04.630
to have antibodies in their blood okay
 

00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:07.440
to have antibodies in their blood okay
so to summarize that up we have another

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:07.450
so to summarize that up we have another
 

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:09.750
so to summarize that up we have another
association between xrm RV and a

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760
association between xrm RV and a
 

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.980
association between xrm RV and a
different disease chronic fatigue

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:10.990
different disease chronic fatigue
 

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.950
different disease chronic fatigue
syndrome again is it a causal factor or

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:13.960
syndrome again is it a causal factor or
 

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:15.390
syndrome again is it a causal factor or
a passenger we don't know from this

00:42:15.390 --> 00:42:15.400
a passenger we don't know from this
 

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.920
a passenger we don't know from this
study we have to do much more

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:16.930
study we have to do much more
 

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.350
study we have to do much more
epidemiology and basic research to

00:42:19.350 --> 00:42:19.360
epidemiology and basic research to
 

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.230
epidemiology and basic research to
answer that in this study there was no

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240
answer that in this study there was no
 

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.240
answer that in this study there was no
correlation with the RNA cell genotype

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:24.250
correlation with the RNA cell genotype
 

00:42:24.250 --> 00:42:27.720
correlation with the RNA cell genotype
so that was what led them into doing

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:27.730
so that was what led them into doing
 

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:29.400
so that was what led them into doing
this but there isn't a correlation

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:29.410
this but there isn't a correlation
 

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:33.640
this but there isn't a correlation
between whether or not you find X

00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:33.650
 

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.589
the other point that is interesting is

00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599
the other point that is interesting is
 

00:42:36.599 --> 00:42:38.870
the other point that is interesting is
that they found the virus sequence

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880
that they found the virus sequence
 

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.019
that they found the virus sequence
present in three point seven percent of

00:42:41.019 --> 00:42:41.029
present in three point seven percent of
 

00:42:41.029 --> 00:42:43.069
present in three point seven percent of
healthy blood donors so if you

00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079
healthy blood donors so if you
 

00:42:43.079 --> 00:42:45.230
healthy blood donors so if you
extrapolate that across the u.s. that

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240
extrapolate that across the u.s. that
 

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.240
extrapolate that across the u.s. that
means there are several million people

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:47.250
means there are several million people
 

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:49.130
means there are several million people
theoretically that have this virus in

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140
theoretically that have this virus in
 

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.930
theoretically that have this virus in
them so immediately this became a

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940
them so immediately this became a
 

00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:53.180
them so immediately this became a
concern for the blood supply whether the

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:53.190
concern for the blood supply whether the
 

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:55.069
concern for the blood supply whether the
virus is present and whether we should

00:42:55.069 --> 00:42:55.079
virus is present and whether we should
 

00:42:55.079 --> 00:42:56.930
virus is present and whether we should
worry about that so you can imagine that

00:42:56.930 --> 00:42:56.940
worry about that so you can imagine that
 

00:42:56.940 --> 00:43:01.519
worry about that so you can imagine that
that would be an issue so a number of

00:43:01.519 --> 00:43:01.529
that would be an issue so a number of
 

00:43:01.529 --> 00:43:04.400
that would be an issue so a number of
other studies rapidly followed this one

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:04.410
other studies rapidly followed this one
 

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:07.750
other studies rapidly followed this one
September 2010 this is from the NIH and

00:43:07.750 --> 00:43:07.760
September 2010 this is from the NIH and
 

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.760
September 2010 this is from the NIH and
here they again took blood from patients

00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:10.770
here they again took blood from patients
 

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:12.529
here they again took blood from patients
with chronic fatigue syndrome and

00:43:12.529 --> 00:43:12.539
with chronic fatigue syndrome and
 

00:43:12.539 --> 00:43:15.799
with chronic fatigue syndrome and
healthy donors and they did pcr and they

00:43:15.799 --> 00:43:15.809
healthy donors and they did pcr and they
 

00:43:15.809 --> 00:43:18.170
healthy donors and they did pcr and they
found viral sequences in this study but

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180
found viral sequences in this study but
 

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:24.160
found viral sequences in this study but
they weren't XMRV these were polytropic

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:24.170
they weren't XMRV these were polytropic
 

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:27.950
they weren't XMRV these were polytropic
MLV these are a different tropism group

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960
MLV these are a different tropism group
 

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.920
MLV these are a different tropism group
than the xeno tropic ones so they found

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:30.930
than the xeno tropic ones so they found
 

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:32.960
than the xeno tropic ones so they found
these sequences and we'll call them MLV

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:32.970
these sequences and we'll call them MLV
 

00:43:32.970 --> 00:43:36.829
these sequences and we'll call them MLV
like sequences in 32 of 37 CFS patients

00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839
like sequences in 32 of 37 CFS patients
 

00:43:36.839 --> 00:43:39.410
like sequences in 32 of 37 CFS patients
in 3 of 44 healthy controls they had

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:39.420
in 3 of 44 healthy controls they had
 

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:42.049
in 3 of 44 healthy controls they had
some paired samples from patients 15

00:43:42.049 --> 00:43:42.059
some paired samples from patients 15
 

00:43:42.059 --> 00:43:44.089
some paired samples from patients 15
years apart so they were able to test

00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:44.099
years apart so they were able to test
 

00:43:44.099 --> 00:43:45.740
years apart so they were able to test
those and seven of eight of those were

00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:45.750
those and seven of eight of those were
 

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:49.130
those and seven of eight of those were
still positive and as I said these are

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140
still positive and as I said these are
 

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.589
still positive and as I said these are
more related to poly tropic MLV subs not

00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599
more related to poly tropic MLV subs not
 

00:43:51.599 --> 00:43:54.680
more related to poly tropic MLV subs not
it's not XMRV it's different and there's

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:54.690
it's not XMRV it's different and there's
 

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:56.299
it's not XMRV it's different and there's
more sequence diversity so if you do a

00:43:56.299 --> 00:43:56.309
more sequence diversity so if you do a
 

00:43:56.309 --> 00:43:59.120
more sequence diversity so if you do a
phylogenetic tree of the envelope and

00:43:59.120 --> 00:43:59.130
phylogenetic tree of the envelope and
 

00:43:59.130 --> 00:44:03.500
phylogenetic tree of the envelope and
gag sequences you see XMRV that we've

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:03.510
gag sequences you see XMRV that we've
 

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:05.750
gag sequences you see XMRV that we've
been talking about is right here here's

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760
been talking about is right here here's
 

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.859
been talking about is right here here's
the CFS sequences WPI and VP 622 the

00:44:09.859 --> 00:44:09.869
the CFS sequences WPI and VP 622 the
 

00:44:09.869 --> 00:44:12.440
the CFS sequences WPI and VP 622 the
prostate sequences here are some murine

00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:12.450
prostate sequences here are some murine
 

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.260
prostate sequences here are some murine
endogenous retroviruses and here the

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:15.270
endogenous retroviruses and here the
 

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:18.410
endogenous retroviruses and here the
sequences found in this study so there

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:18.420
sequences found in this study so there
 

00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:22.420
sequences found in this study so there
they're tracking with poly tropic or

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:22.430
they're tracking with poly tropic or
 

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:25.460
they're tracking with poly tropic or
modified polytropic retroviruses of mice

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:25.470
modified polytropic retroviruses of mice
 

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:30.170
modified polytropic retroviruses of mice
here and also here compared with xmrv so

00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180
here and also here compared with xmrv so
 

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.880
here and also here compared with xmrv so
this was puzzling because it was a very

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:31.890
this was puzzling because it was a very
 

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:34.970
this was puzzling because it was a very
different virus it's a Marine retrovirus

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:34.980
different virus it's a Marine retrovirus
 

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.970
different virus it's a Marine retrovirus
but it's not xmrv so it's it was strange

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:37.980
but it's not xmrv so it's it was strange
 

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:40.370
but it's not xmrv so it's it was strange
that a different virus would be found in

00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380
that a different virus would be found in
 

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:43.279
that a different virus would be found in
the same types of patients and here's a

00:44:43.279 --> 00:44:43.289
the same types of patients and here's a
 

00:44:43.289 --> 00:44:44.750
the same types of patients and here's a
summary then of all the studies that

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760
summary then of all the studies that
 

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.680
summary then of all the studies that
followed

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:45.690
followed
 

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:49.340
followed
looking at xmrv in patients with chronic

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:49.350
looking at xmrv in patients with chronic
 

00:44:49.350 --> 00:44:51.680
looking at xmrv in patients with chronic
fatigue syndrome so we have the original

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:51.690
fatigue syndrome so we have the original
 

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:55.040
fatigue syndrome so we have the original
study which I first described in the US

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:55.050
study which I first described in the US
 

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:58.450
study which I first described in the US
these are patients in the Nevada area

00:44:58.450 --> 00:44:58.460
these are patients in the Nevada area
 

00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:00.290
these are patients in the Nevada area
actually there are patients from

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.300
actually there are patients from
 

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.450
actually there are patients from
different parts of the US and then the

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:02.460
different parts of the US and then the
 

00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:04.460
different parts of the US and then the
second study which we just described

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:04.470
second study which we just described
 

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:07.700
second study which we just described
also us patients 3237 positive but there

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:07.710
also us patients 3237 positive but there
 

00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:09.320
also us patients 3237 positive but there
have been many that fine little or no

00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:09.330
have been many that fine little or no
 

00:45:09.330 --> 00:45:12.740
have been many that fine little or no
virus in patient samples and these go

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:12.750
virus in patient samples and these go
 

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:15.110
virus in patient samples and these go
from the UK the US China Germany and

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:15.120
from the UK the US China Germany and
 

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:18.200
from the UK the US China Germany and
Japan and you can see the numbers most

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:18.210
Japan and you can see the numbers most
 

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:20.420
Japan and you can see the numbers most
of them are pcr-based there's a little

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:20.430
of them are pcr-based there's a little
 

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:22.430
of them are pcr-based there's a little
bit of serology involved as well the

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440
bit of serology involved as well the
 

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:25.840
bit of serology involved as well the
most recent one looked both by pcr and

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:25.850
most recent one looked both by pcr and
 

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:28.100
most recent one looked both by pcr and
serology they also attempted to grow

00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:28.110
serology they also attempted to grow
 

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:30.860
serology they also attempted to grow
virus from the cells in a similar way as

00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:30.870
virus from the cells in a similar way as
 

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:32.870
virus from the cells in a similar way as
the original study reported but didn't

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880
the original study reported but didn't
 

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.430
the original study reported but didn't
find any of it while this is all going

00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440
find any of it while this is all going
 

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.540
find any of it while this is all going
on this group ela sings group in a

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:41.550
on this group ela sings group in a
 

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.630
on this group ela sings group in a
couple of others looked to see if any of

00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640
couple of others looked to see if any of
 

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.100
couple of others looked to see if any of
the AIDS antiviral drugs could inhibit

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:48.110
the AIDS antiviral drugs could inhibit
 

00:45:48.110 --> 00:45:51.050
the AIDS antiviral drugs could inhibit
XMRV so this pub this paper is an

00:45:51.050 --> 00:45:51.060
XMRV so this pub this paper is an
 

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:54.310
XMRV so this pub this paper is an
example raltegravir is an inhibitor of

00:45:54.310 --> 00:45:54.320
example raltegravir is an inhibitor of
 

00:45:54.320 --> 00:46:00.010
example raltegravir is an inhibitor of
XMRV so this is a by a drug that is used

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:00.020
XMRV so this is a by a drug that is used
 

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:03.680
XMRV so this is a by a drug that is used
to treat HIV infections it's an

00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:03.690
to treat HIV infections it's an

asked me does this mean that the virus

00:47:55.059 --> 00:47:55.069
asked me does this mean that the virus
 

00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:58.400
asked me does this mean that the virus
causes chronic fatigue syndrome so you

00:47:58.400 --> 00:47:58.410
causes chronic fatigue syndrome so you
 

00:47:58.410 --> 00:47:59.900
causes chronic fatigue syndrome so you
have to be very careful when you have

00:47:59.900 --> 00:47:59.910
have to be very careful when you have
 

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:02.029

certain kits that you buy to do PCR some

00:50:07.880 --> 00:50:07.890
certain kits that you buy to do PCR some
 

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:09.470
certain kits that you buy to do PCR some
of them have an antibody in them it's

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:09.480
of them have an antibody in them it's
 

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:12.440

reaction these are mouse monoclonal

00:50:14.810 --> 00:50:14.820
reaction these are mouse monoclonal
 

00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:17.150
reaction these are mouse monoclonal
antibodies they're contaminated with

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160
antibodies they're contaminated with
 

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.020
antibodies they're contaminated with
mouse DNA so you can get positive XMRV

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:21.030
mouse DNA so you can get positive XMRV
 

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:24.710
mouse DNA so you can get positive XMRV
PCR reactions if you use those kits so

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720
PCR reactions if you use those kits so
 

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.510
PCR reactions if you use those kits so
they said okay this doesn't mean that

00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520
they said okay this doesn't mean that
 

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.310
they said okay this doesn't mean that
the previous studies were compromised

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:28.320
the previous studies were compromised
 

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.210
the previous studies were compromised
but you have to be really careful that's

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220
but you have to be really careful that's
 

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:34.640
but you have to be really careful that's
the second paper third one contamination

Mouse DNA in it so that they were
 

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:54.950
Mouse DNA in it so that they were
positive because they had Mouse DNA so

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960
positive because they had Mouse DNA so
 

00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.120

prostate cancer so John coffin says PCR

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:11.460
prostate cancer so John coffin says PCR
 

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.310
prostate cancer so John coffin says PCR
is so sensitive if you took a drop of

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:13.320
is so sensitive if you took a drop of
 

00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:15.890
is so sensitive if you took a drop of
mouse blood and put it in a swimming

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900
mouse blood and put it in a swimming
 

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.410

pool yeah 30,000 gallons swimming pool

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420
pool yeah 30,000 gallons swimming pool
 

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.780
pool yeah 30,000 gallons swimming pool
and then you took a mil of slightly

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:20.790
and then you took a mil of slightly
 

00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:23.030
and then you took a mil of slightly
mixed it up took a mil of swimming pool

00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040
mixed it up took a mil of swimming pool
 

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.210

from that drop because PCR is so

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:31.130
from that drop because PCR is so
 

00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:33.880
from that drop because PCR is so
sensitive so this is why he says nicer

00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:33.890
sensitive so this is why he says nicer
 

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:36.580

kinds of samples i think we probably

00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:39.470
kinds of samples i think we probably
 

00:51:39.470 --> 00:51:42.970

have Mouse nucleic acid a water if you

00:51:42.970 --> 00:51:42.980
have Mouse nucleic acid a water if you
 

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.770
have Mouse nucleic acid a water if you
think about it comes from reservoirs

sequence this virus and they sequence

00:52:24.339 --> 00:52:24.349
sequence this virus and they sequence
 

00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:27.400
sequence this virus and they sequence
multiple isolates and said the variation

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:27.410
multiple isolates and said the variation
 

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:30.190

from chronic fatigue syndrome and so
 

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:40.150
from chronic fatigue syndrome and so
they said this isn't consistent with a

question what do you think and I said I

00:52:54.339 --> 00:52:54.349
question what do you think and I said I
 

00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:56.109

and all these patients started emailing
 

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:03.339
and all these patients started emailing
and posting on my blog and I went back

00:53:03.339 --> 00:53:03.349
and posting on my blog and I went back
 

00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:05.380
and posting on my blog and I went back
and looked and in fact none of this

00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:05.390
and looked and in fact none of this
 

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:06.970

infected it with XMRV and had analyzed
the integration sites in that cell line

00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:11.100
the integration sites in that cell line
 

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.430
the integration sites in that cell line
and they published them and what they

00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440
and they published them and what they
 

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.990
and they published them and what they
found in this group was that the

00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000
found in this group was that the
 

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.720
found in this group was that the
prostate sequences the integration sites

00:54:17.720 --> 00:54:17.730
prostate sequences the integration sites
 

00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:20.000
prostate sequences the integration sites
were the same for two of the integration

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:20.010
were the same for two of the integration
 

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:21.710
were the same for two of the integration
sites between the cell line and the

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720
sites between the cell line and the
 

00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.290
sites between the cell line and the
prostate tumor okay so this never

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:24.300
prostate tumor okay so this never
 

00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:25.940
prostate tumor okay so this never
happens you never get identical

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:25.950
happens you never get identical
 

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:27.920
happens you never get identical
retroviral integration sites in a cell

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:27.930
retroviral integration sites in a cell
 

00:54:27.930 --> 00:54:30.050
retroviral integration sites in a cell
line versus a another cell line or a

line versus a another cell line or a
 

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.990
line versus a another cell line or a
tumor so they said that these sites are

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000
tumor so they said that these sites are
 

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.960

make this cell line 22 rv1 so what they

00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940
make this cell line 22 rv1 so what they
 

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:39.650
make this cell line 22 rv1 so what they
did is they sequenced mouse strain DNA

00:55:39.650 --> 00:55:39.660
did is they sequenced mouse strain DNA
 

00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:43.730
did is they sequenced mouse strain DNA
and they found precursors to xmrv in two

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740
and they found precursors to xmrv in two
 

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.010
and they found precursors to xmrv in two

00:55:51.849 --> 00:55:54.479
two Pro viruses
the idea is you they put the human

00:55:54.479 --> 00:55:54.489
the idea is you they put the human
 

00:55:54.489 --> 00:55:57.529
the idea is you they put the human
prostate tumor into a nude Mouse train

00:55:57.529 --> 00:55:57.539

was that infected by the virus is in the

00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:01.150
was that infected by the virus is in the
 

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:04.589
was that infected by the virus is in the
mice and then the two viruses recombined

00:56:04.589 --> 00:56:04.599
mice and then the two viruses recombined
 

00:56:04.599 --> 00:56:07.890
mice and then the two viruses recombined
to produce xmrv and you can actually do

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:07.900
to produce xmrv and you can actually do
 

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:09.809
to produce xmrv and you can actually do
the recombination of these two sequences

00:56:09.809 --> 00:56:09.819
the recombination of these two sequences
 

00:56:09.819 --> 00:56:11.729
the recombination of these two sequences
right in front of you you could take the

00:56:11.729 --> 00:56:11.739
right in front of you you could take the
 

00:56:11.739 --> 00:56:13.589
right in front of you you could take the
sequence and mix it up and you produce

00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599
sequence and mix it up and you produce
 

00:56:13.599 --> 00:56:16.499
sequence and mix it up and you produce
exact xmrv from these two precursors

00:56:16.499 --> 00:56:16.509
exact xmrv from these two precursors
 

00:56:16.509 --> 00:56:18.690
exact xmrv from these two precursors
okay so is that clear these are from

00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:18.700
okay so is that clear these are from
 

00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.789
okay so is that clear these are from
mice these are two precursors that

00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799
mice these are two precursors that
 

00:56:20.799 --> 00:56:25.589
mice these are two precursors that
recombined to produce xmrv so they feel

00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599

out yet so we can't go over the details
 

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:38.999
out yet so we can't go over the details
but their idea is that this virus arose

00:56:38.999 --> 00:56:39.009
but their idea is that this virus arose

have a handful of XMRV sequences from
 

00:56:57.729 --> 00:56:59.640
have a handful of XMRV sequences from
human specimens and they're all

00:56:59.640 --> 00:56:59.650
human specimens and they're all
 

00:56:59.650 --> 00:57:02.940
human specimens and they're all
identical to this virus if we had more

00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:02.950
identical to this virus if we had more
 

00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:05.219
identical to this virus if we had more
diverse set of sequences then it would

00:57:05.219 --> 00:57:05.229
diverse set of sequences then it would
 

00:57:05.229 --> 00:57:07.620
diverse set of sequences then it would
support perhaps the idea that this virus

00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:07.630
support perhaps the idea that this virus
 

00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:09.150
support perhaps the idea that this virus
is involved but we don't have those a

00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:09.160

number of individuals have said they
exist but they haven't been published so

at the end what do we know and what
don't we know what's the role in these

find MLV and the other find XMRV so it

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:25.900
find MLV and the other find XMRV so it
 

00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:31.890
find MLV and the other find XMRV so it
doesn't make any sense to me as I said

00:58:31.890 --> 00:58:31.900
doesn't make any sense to me as I said
 

00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:34.980
doesn't make any sense to me as I said
there might be more diverse XMRV out

00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:34.990
there might be more diverse XMRV out
 

00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:36.420
there might be more diverse XMRV out
there but it hasn't been published so

00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:36.430
there but it hasn't been published so
 

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:38.700
there but it hasn't been published so
far all the XMRV looks just like it was

00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:38.710
far all the XMRV looks just like it was
 

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:42.809
far all the XMRV looks just like it was
made in the 22 rv1 cell line but some

00:58:42.809 --> 00:58:42.819
made in the 22 rv1 cell line but some
 

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:44.700
made in the 22 rv1 cell line but some
other possibilities that still are out

00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:44.710
other possibilities that still are out
 

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:46.500
other possibilities that still are out
there there could be pockets of local

00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:46.510
there there could be pockets of local
 

00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:50.030
there there could be pockets of local
infection that account for these results

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.040
infection that account for these results
 

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.950
infection that account for these results
contamination as I said might result in

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:52.960
contamination as I said might result in
 

00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:56.370
contamination as I said might result in
these findings and a lot of that when

00:58:56.370 --> 00:58:56.380
these findings and a lot of that when
 

00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:59.510
these findings and a lot of that when
these when this conference finding was

00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520
these when this conference finding was
 

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:03.329
these when this conference finding was
put on the web last month a lot of

00:59:03.329 --> 00:59:03.339
put on the web last month a lot of
 

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:05.250
put on the web last month a lot of
patients asked ok if this is a

00:59:05.250 --> 00:59:05.260
patients asked ok if this is a
 

00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:07.109
patients asked ok if this is a
contaminant why do I have antibodies

00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119
contaminant why do I have antibodies
 

00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:10.890
contaminant why do I have antibodies
against the virus and the you can

00:59:10.890 --> 00:59:10.900
against the virus and the you can
 

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:12.870
against the virus and the you can
actually there is a commercial test now

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880
actually there is a commercial test now
 

00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.540
actually there is a commercial test now
that will detect antibodies to the virus

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:15.550
that will detect antibodies to the virus
 

00:59:15.550 --> 00:59:19.589
that will detect antibodies to the virus
in your serum but that's why I spent a

00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599
in your serum but that's why I spent a
 

00:59:19.599 --> 00:59:21.630
in your serum but that's why I spent a
long time telling you about how the

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:21.640
long time telling you about how the
 

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:25.650
long time telling you about how the
tests or are run none of those tests

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:25.660
tests or are run none of those tests
 

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:26.940
tests or are run none of those tests
tell you that the antibodies are

00:59:26.940 --> 00:59:26.950
tell you that the antibodies are
 

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:30.319
tell you that the antibodies are
specific for XMRV they just say they are

00:59:30.319 --> 00:59:30.329
specific for XMRV they just say they are
 

00:59:30.329 --> 00:59:33.569
specific for XMRV they just say they are
detecting a related virus so the

00:59:33.569 --> 00:59:33.579
detecting a related virus so the
 

00:59:33.579 --> 00:59:35.819
detecting a related virus so the
patients may have be positive 4x and RV

00:59:35.819 --> 00:59:35.829
patients may have be positive 4x and RV
 

00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:37.260
patients may have be positive 4x and RV
but they may be antibodies against the

00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:37.270
but they may be antibodies against the
 

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:40.109
but they may be antibodies against the
different retrovirus so in fact it may

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:40.119
different retrovirus so in fact it may
 

00:59:40.119 --> 00:59:44.280
different retrovirus so in fact it may
be that there are infections common

00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:44.290
be that there are infections common
 

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:46.410

people and so some of us have antibodies

00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319
people and so some of us have antibodies
 

00:59:49.319 --> 00:59:52.230
people and so some of us have antibodies
but maybe it doesn't cause any disease

00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240
but maybe it doesn't cause any disease
 

00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:54.930
but maybe it doesn't cause any disease
we don't we don't really know so cross

00:59:54.930 --> 00:59:54.940

better you know that this is anecdotal
 

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:14.640
better you know that this is anecdotal
and so it's not even worth considering

and so it's not even worth considering
 

01:00:14.650 --> 01:00:16.720
and so it's not even worth considering
so I don't know maybe there are a

so I don't know maybe there are a
 

01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:18.910

then they were able to grow out virus
but that could be a contamination so you

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:05.590
but that could be a contamination so you
 

01:02:05.590 --> 01:02:07.830
but that could be a contamination so you
don't have any measure of viral load in

the first antibody tests februari of 85

01:03:05.849 --> 01:03:05.859
the first antibody tests februari of 85
 

01:03:05.859 --> 01:03:07.230
the first antibody tests februari of 85
and then you can start looking at

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240
and then you can start looking at
 

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.570
and then you can start looking at
populations and saying do people with

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:09.580
populations and saying do people with
 

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.849
populations and saying do people with
the disease have the virus and then you

01:03:11.849 --> 01:03:11.859
the disease have the virus and then you
 

01:03:11.859 --> 01:03:13.800
the disease have the virus and then you
get the information you not even at that

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:13.810
get the information you not even at that
 

01:03:13.810 --> 01:03:16.320
get the information you not even at that
point yet with xmrv where you can have a

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:16.330
point yet with xmrv where you can have a
 

01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:18.450
point yet with xmrv where you can have a
reliable test we're not sure where to

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:18.460
reliable test we're not sure where to
 

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:19.890
reliable test we're not sure where to
look it's not clear that the blood is

01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:19.900
look it's not clear that the blood is
 

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:22.589
look it's not clear that the blood is
the right place to look and then in

01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599
the right place to look and then in
 

01:03:22.599 --> 01:03:24.130
the right place to look and then in
nineteen eighty seven eight

01:03:24.130 --> 01:03:24.140
nineteen eighty seven eight
 

01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:27.310
nineteen eighty seven eight
dt the first antiviral was approved by

01:03:27.310 --> 01:03:27.320
dt the first antiviral was approved by
 

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.880
dt the first antiviral was approved by
the fda so and then heart came many

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:30.890
the fda so and then heart came many
 

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:34.270
the fda so and then heart came many
years later 1995 so at the minimum seven

01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:34.280
years later 1995 so at the minimum seven
 

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.240
years later 1995 so at the minimum seven
years it took in the 1980s with pretty

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:37.250
years it took in the 1980s with pretty
 

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:39.430
years it took in the 1980s with pretty
good technology and this is because

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440
good technology and this is because
 

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:41.770
good technology and this is because
there is a lot of virus present and the

01:03:41.770 --> 01:03:41.780
there is a lot of virus present and the
 

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:45.700
there is a lot of virus present and the
diagnosis is very clear so we're only

01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:45.710
diagnosis is very clear so we're only
 

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:48.760
diagnosis is very clear so we're only
was the first example of the first

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:48.770
was the first example of the first
 

01:03:48.770 --> 01:03:52.450
was the first example of the first
isolation in 2006 so we're five years

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:52.460
isolation in 2006 so we're five years
 

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:56.020
isolation in 2006 so we're five years
down and we still haven't decided

01:03:56.020 --> 01:03:56.030
down and we still haven't decided
 

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:58.390
down and we still haven't decided
whether this is the etiologic agent or

01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400
whether this is the etiologic agent or
 

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:02.200
whether this is the etiologic agent or
not but I think so if you want my

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:02.210
not but I think so if you want my
 

01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:05.380
not but I think so if you want my
opinion it's not looking good but I

01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:05.390
opinion it's not looking good but I
 

01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:07.890
opinion it's not looking good but I
don't think the story is over in fact

01:04:07.890 --> 01:04:07.900
don't think the story is over in fact
 

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:12.990
don't think the story is over in fact
there are a couple of papers in press

01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.000
there are a couple of papers in press
 

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.670
there are a couple of papers in press
that are going to sort this out there's

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680
that are going to sort this out there's
 

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:18.510
that are going to sort this out there's
a large study going on at Columbia

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:18.520
a large study going on at Columbia
 

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:23.290
a large study going on at Columbia
that's going to sort it out the and

01:04:23.290 --> 01:04:23.300
that's going to sort it out the and
 

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:25.120
that's going to sort it out the and
you're going to know in the next two

01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:25.130
you're going to know in the next two
 

01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:27.760
you're going to know in the next two
weeks basically all right so they're

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:27.770
weeks basically all right so they're
 

01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:29.050
weeks basically all right so they're
going to be published in various good

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:29.060
going to be published in various good
 

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.000
going to be published in various good
journals and they will answer the

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:31.010
journals and they will answer the
 

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:34.060
journals and they will answer the
question of whether this virus is

01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:34.070
question of whether this virus is
 

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:35.800
question of whether this virus is
causing a disease or not whether it's

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:35.810
causing a disease or not whether it's
 

01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:39.070
causing a disease or not whether it's
infecting people but the whole story for

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:39.080
infecting people but the whole story for
 

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:40.990
infecting people but the whole story for
the last five years has been amazing to

01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:41.000
the last five years has been amazing to
 

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.430
the last five years has been amazing to
watch it's developed this is why I want

01:04:42.430 --> 01:04:42.440
watch it's developed this is why I want
 

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:43.930
watch it's developed this is why I want
to tell you this story because it's

01:04:43.930 --> 01:04:43.940
to tell you this story because it's
 

01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:45.370
to tell you this story because it's
developing right in front of us I've

01:04:45.370 --> 01:04:45.380
developing right in front of us I've
 

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.280
developing right in front of us I've
been following it from the start and

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:47.290
been following it from the start and
 

01:04:47.290 --> 01:04:50.080
been following it from the start and
it's you can see what it takes to say

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:50.090
it's you can see what it takes to say
 

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.570
it's you can see what it takes to say
that a virus causes a human disease and

01:04:52.570 --> 01:04:52.580
that a virus causes a human disease and
 

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:55.180
that a virus causes a human disease and
not only the science but you get to see

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:55.190
not only the science but you get to see
 

01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:59.470
not only the science but you get to see
how the scientists get involved so the

01:04:59.470 --> 01:04:59.480
how the scientists get involved so the
 

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:02.920
how the scientists get involved so the
group in Nevada who originally found

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:02.930
group in Nevada who originally found
 

01:05:02.930 --> 01:05:06.160
group in Nevada who originally found
this have been the most ardent

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:06.170
this have been the most ardent
 

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:08.740
this have been the most ardent
supporters of the idea that the virus is

01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:08.750
supporters of the idea that the virus is
 

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:10.180
supporters of the idea that the virus is
causing the disease but they have only

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:10.190
causing the disease but they have only
 

01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:13.030
causing the disease but they have only
published the one paper and nothing else

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:13.040
published the one paper and nothing else
 

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.650
published the one paper and nothing else
has come out of that and they have said

01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:14.660
has come out of that and they have said
 

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:17.080
has come out of that and they have said
at various meetings that they have a lot

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:17.090
at various meetings that they have a lot
 

01:05:17.090 --> 01:05:18.760
at various meetings that they have a lot
of more evidence that have more sequence

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:18.770
of more evidence that have more sequence
 

01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:20.800
of more evidence that have more sequence
variation but it's never been published

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:20.810
variation but it's never been published
 

01:05:20.810 --> 01:05:24.310
variation but it's never been published
so rule the rule number one you have to

01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:24.320
so rule the rule number one you have to
 

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.200
so rule the rule number one you have to
publish your data otherwise no one can

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:26.210
publish your data otherwise no one can
 

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:28.960
publish your data otherwise no one can
ever use it there's also been a lot of

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:28.970
ever use it there's also been a lot of
 

01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:31.210
ever use it there's also been a lot of
conflict among the scientists because as

01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:31.220
conflict among the scientists because as
 

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:33.100
conflict among the scientists because as
you can see there are people who find

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:33.110
you can see there are people who find
 

01:05:33.110 --> 01:05:35.380
you can see there are people who find
the virus and people who don't so at

01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:35.390
the virus and people who don't so at
 

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:37.780
the virus and people who don't so at
various meetings lots of accusations

01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:37.790
various meetings lots of accusations
 

01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:39.340
various meetings lots of accusations
and the patients now are getting

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:39.350
and the patients now are getting
 

01:05:39.350 --> 01:05:42.010
and the patients now are getting
involved because the internet makes all

01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:42.020
involved because the internet makes all
 

01:05:42.020 --> 01:05:44.710
involved because the internet makes all
of this accessible in a way that wasn't

01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720
of this accessible in a way that wasn't
 

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.390
of this accessible in a way that wasn't
the case that even at the beginning of

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400
the case that even at the beginning of
 

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.610
the case that even at the beginning of
the AIDS epidemic so they can see the

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:48.620
the AIDS epidemic so they can see the
 

01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:50.560
the AIDS epidemic so they can see the
results themselves online they can go

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:50.570
results themselves online they can go
 

01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:52.840
results themselves online they can go
they can blog about it they can post

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:52.850
they can blog about it they can post
 

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:56.020
they can blog about it they can post
comments I'm a firm believer that in the

01:05:56.020 --> 01:05:56.030
comments I'm a firm believer that in the
 

01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:58.600
comments I'm a firm believer that in the
end science always figures out what's

01:05:58.600 --> 01:05:58.610
end science always figures out what's
 

01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:01.540
end science always figures out what's
right not scientists science does and

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:01.550
right not scientists science does and
 

01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:03.130
right not scientists science does and
that's because you have an interesting

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:03.140
that's because you have an interesting
 

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:04.870
that's because you have an interesting
question eventually the science will

01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880
question eventually the science will
 

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.270
question eventually the science will
come to the right conclusion but you

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280
come to the right conclusion but you
 

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.220
come to the right conclusion but you
can't trust individual scientists

01:06:09.220 --> 01:06:09.230
can't trust individual scientists
 

01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:11.230
can't trust individual scientists
because they're all kinds of agenda so

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.240
because they're all kinds of agenda so
 

01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.790
because they're all kinds of agenda so
trust science if you remember one thing

01:06:12.790 --> 01:06:12.800
trust science if you remember one thing
 

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.120
trust science if you remember one thing
from the trust science not scientists

01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:16.130
from the trust science not scientists
 

01:06:16.130 --> 01:06:19.120
from the trust science not scientists
