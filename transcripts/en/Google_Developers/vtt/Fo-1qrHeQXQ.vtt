[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:07.510
GAREN CHECKLEY: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.787
Good afternoon.

00:00:08.787 --> 00:00:10.620
My name is Garen, and
I'm a product designer

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.794
that works on emerging markets
projects here at Google.

00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:15.960
TRACEY CHAN: And I'm Tracey,
a researcher that works

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.180
on emerging markets at YouTube.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.763
GAREN CHECKLEY: And we're super
excited that you're joining us

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:23.730
this afternoon to talk and learn
about design for new internet

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.140
users.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.660
Most recently, Tracey and
I spent the last few years

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.570
working on YouTube Go, which
is a new version of YouTube--

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.940
a new app that's been designed
and built from the ground

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.360
up for new internet users
in countries like India.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.480
And you may have heard
about this in the keynote

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.620
back on Wednesday
that was announced

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.535
as part of the Android
Go operating system.

00:00:42.535 --> 00:00:44.910
So if you're interested in
designing apps that work great

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.400
on Android Go, or just
work great for new internet

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.190
users in general, then
we're glad you're here,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.590
this talk is for you.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.060
This is important because
the majority of people coming

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.490
online, and actually the
majority of people online right

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.370
now, are in emerging market
countries like India,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.564
Indonesia, Brazil, and Nigeria.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:07.230
So if you're interested
in going global,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.670
if you're interested in scaling
any projects or products--

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.750
it's important to consider their
experiences and their context.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.105
So you might be thinking, well,
Android is doing really well.

00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:20.730
There is this
announcement that Android

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.470
has over 2 billion users.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.930
Why do we have to do
anything differently?

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.450
We know from a host of
qualitative and quantitative

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.810
data that these internet users
have very different experiences

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.760
from those of us in this room.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.970
If you think about your
first computer experience,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.780
it was probably a
couple of decades ago.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.480
You probably started
using a desktop,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.630
you probably started
connecting to the internet

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.680
on that desktop.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.740
Your internet connection
was probably fast, reliable,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.072
and not too expensive.

00:01:50.072 --> 00:01:51.780
Right now, you probably
have a cell phone

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.570
that's pretty good, has a
good screen, it's pretty fast.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.150
You're on Wi-Fi now, or
you're on Wi-Fi at home,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.590
at work, or events like this.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.090
And when you're not
on Wi-Fi, you've

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.820
got pretty good access to mobile
data to be online all the time.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.009
Compare this to a typical
persona of a new internet user.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.880
These folks are coming online
with their first computer

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.580
or their first internet
experience being a smartphone.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.800
And it's oftentimes not this
kind of fancy smartphone

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.180
that we carry around.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.770
It's a lower end smartphone,
sub $100, sub $50 smartphone.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.822
These phones don't
have great screens,

00:02:27.822 --> 00:02:28.905
don't have great contrast.

00:02:31.096 --> 00:02:32.970
They've got different
kind of touch feedback,

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.222
they've got low
storage, low RAM.

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:37.680
Oftentimes, they're running
older versions of the operating

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.060
system, they're not updating
their apps as frequently.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.340
They're using the internet
on slow, expensive, flaky

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.420
connections.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.140
And rarely, if ever,
are folks using Wi-Fi.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.350
So while we still believe that
universally we are all human--

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.560
regardless of whether somebody
is in India, Indonesia,

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.600
Nigeria, or United States,
or London, we're all human--

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.020
we do think it's really
important that we consider

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.840
the context, the
different cultures,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.090
the different constraints,
and different mental models

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.555
that people bring to
their internet experience.

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:09.930
So over the past
few years, we've

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.080
invested a lot in
thinking and figuring out

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.390
what to do within Google.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.350
And we're excited
to share a framework

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.220
that we use within the company
for building for new internet

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.150
users.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.650
So in the course
of this talk, we're

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.899
going to talk about what it
means to make your product

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:28.080
usable, useful, and engaging
for these types of users.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.990
We're going to give you very
quick, very focused tips

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.460
for each one of
these components.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.830
So it's not going to be really
nebulous, very design-y.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.190
It's going to be very applied.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.800
And, Tracey, do you
want to kick us off?

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.940
TRACEY CHAN: Sure.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.200
So our first bucket is usable,
which focuses on the question--

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.450
which is simple, but
challenging-- can your product

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.239
be used?

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.030
And this bucket contains
three components--

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.560
cost, connectedness,
and compatibility.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.760
So the first will be cost.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.500
We could start
with a comparison.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.520
To afford one gigabyte of
data in the United States,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.260
you would need to work a
little bit over 20 minutes,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.370
on average.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.960
But to afford the
same exact thing

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.240
in Indonesia, one
gigabyte of data,

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.630
you would have to
work 316 minutes.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.680
So, nearly five
and a half hours.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.470
So in markets like
these, like Indonesia,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.870
data is much harder to come by.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.570
And for that reason, people
savor every MB that much more.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:26.400
Also in these markets, most
of the data is prepaid.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.840
Specifically, in India,
95% of it is prepaid.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.970
And prepaid is where people buy
fixed amounts of data upfront.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.220
It's not an ongoing
commitment, which

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.910
we might be familiar with.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.300
So imagine going into a store
and you buy a small paper

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.310
card with a scratch
code on the back

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.370
that maybe you buy
for 40 or 50 rupees.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.740
And you get 100
megabytes of data

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.487
that might last one day, five
days, or even up to 28 days.

00:04:50.487 --> 00:04:52.320
So, the behavior we're
seeing is that people

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.950
are buying denominations
based on what they can afford,

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:58.110
what they foresee
as actually needing.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.670
And then they budget
out their data

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.360
use over that time
period, as necessary.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.390
So overall, data just feels
like money in these markets.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.970
And compare this to
what happens in the US.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.340
We usually buy a pretty
high data cap plan by month,

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.660
or we pay on every month.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.180
But we pretty much
commit for a long time,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.950
and we're often
connected to Wi-Fi.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.070
So, we don't really worry about
running out of data, maybe only

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.760
at the end of the month.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.390
So what is Wi-Fi really
like in these markets?

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.300
Wi-Fi is actually
rarely connected to,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.190
because it's not
that accessible.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.360
Globally, there's one Wi-Fi
hotspot for every 150 people.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.950
And in India, it's a lot higher.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.050
There's about 31,500 hotspots
overall in the country.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.480
So that means one hotspot
for every 3,900 people.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.120
So if India wanted to
meet the global average,

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.660
they would have to install
eight million more hotspots.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.720
And the point here is that
public Wi-Fi access is rare,

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.410
making data, again, that much
more precious and expensive.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:05.440
So now, you might be
thinking, Wi-Fi at home.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.870
Home is where we have
the comfort of Wi-Fi.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.327
We're wrapped in the comfort
of our own connection,

00:06:10.327 --> 00:06:11.410
our nice security blanket.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.560
We're not spending any
of that mobile data.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.770
But this is not necessarily
true in these types of markets.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.520
Currently, less than 2% of
the entire population in India

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.100
subscribe to a fixed-line
broadband internet

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.750
connection in their home.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.180
And if they are accessing
internet at home,

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.000
it's mostly through their mobile
data on their mobile device.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.560
So in sum, Wi-Fi access
is still very rare.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.780
And we can't be
assuming that Wi-Fi

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.240
is going to come along
as certain cadencies

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.640
for these users to
fix whatever blockages

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.460
or barriers they may hit in
other connectivity states.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:50.180
So our tip here, for the
first component of cost--

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.810
for data heavy tasks, provide
transparency and control

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.910
over data consumption.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.310
The example on the right is
actually from YouTube Go.

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:00.260
After selecting a
video, users are

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.070
given the control to select
their quality before watching.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.050
So they know upfront
how much data

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.200
they'll spend before committing
to an action to either play

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.240
or save the video.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.940
And we specifically say
for data heavy tasks,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.010
because this type
of transparency

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.200
might be less important
for smaller amounts that

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.610
could be considered
negligible, like 10 KB.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.670
GAREN CHECKLEY: So the next
component of the usable bucket

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:26.452
is connectivity.

00:07:26.452 --> 00:07:28.910
We know that the internet is
much slower in different parts

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:29.550
of the world.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:32.060
The statistic is that in
India, on average, the internet

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.240
is three times slower than it
is here in the United States.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.130
And most of the folks
that are coming online

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.600
for the very first
time are coming

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.490
online on the
slowest connections--

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.770
on cheap 2G, 3G connections,
or overloaded free public Wi-Fi

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.030
networks.

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:50.150
But on top of it
being slow, it's

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.060
also important to consider the
flakiness and the intermittency

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.590
of the connections.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:00.190
So 65% to 80% of the time,
a 3G connection round trip

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.387
will actually work.

00:08:01.387 --> 00:08:03.470
There will be uptime only
for this amount of time.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.303
So you can imagine for
seconds, for minutes,

00:08:05.303 --> 00:08:08.070
for hours at a time, even
though you might have data--

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.950
you might not be
on airplane mode--

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:12.142
the internet still might
not be working for you.

00:08:12.142 --> 00:08:14.600
So, it's crucial for those of
us that are creating software

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.610
to acknowledge and
actually embrace

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.410
these states of intermittency.

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.134
As designers, we
usually approach

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.800
designing for these
types of connections

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.790
by looking at states.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.974
So typically, these
are the states

00:08:26.974 --> 00:08:29.140
that we're often used to
designing in Silicon Valley

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.630
or in well-connected tech
company environments.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.030
There is an online state,
which is kind of considered

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.929
the ideal state.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.150
Sometimes we think about
partial loading states.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.150
And oftentimes, we'll design
error states, as well.

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:43.870
So a typical mock might
look like this for us.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:45.640
Or a typical flow
of mocks or designs

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.170
might look like this for us.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.740
You might move from one online
mock, to another online mock,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.710
to another online mock.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:55.160
And that might be how we design
how an app experience actually

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:55.660
is.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.430
Maybe you design an
error case, as well.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.590
But this isn't
really comprehensive.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:01.090
This doesn't actually
meet the needs

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:05.170
or doesn't portray the
experience of a new internet

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.290
user.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.050
So we've actually added
a few other states

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.760
to make this more comprehensive.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.820
In addition to considering
the online state as ideal,

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.160
we also think about the
offline state as ideal.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.810
Both because
connections are flaky,

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.890
and because connections
are expensive.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.760
So people turn off their
mobile data frequently.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.414
In addition to loading
being in progress--

00:09:24.414 --> 00:09:26.080
partially loading--
we also have loading

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.630
started, just to let folks
know that something is actually

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:29.860
happening.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.570
In addition to having
an error content,

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:34.592
we also have a state that
portrays when you're offline

00:09:34.592 --> 00:09:35.800
and there just is no content.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.570
It's not a problem if you
don't have connectivity,

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.944
and it's not a
problem if nothing

00:09:38.944 --> 00:09:41.200
is cached on your device.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.700
So if you use this
kind of framework

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.824
and you're walking through
the design of a product,

00:09:44.824 --> 00:09:47.800
you end up with a lifecycle
that looks kind of like this.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.620
You're offline, you don't have
any content, you switch it on,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:51.850
the loading starts.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.010
There is partial loading
that's happening,

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.780
then you're in a
full online state,

00:09:55.780 --> 00:10:02.170
and then maybe you switch off
your connection, it's flaky.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.940
And then, you go into
an offline state.

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.690
And we consider all of these
states first-class citizens.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:10.780
So our tip for connectivity
is to expect latency

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:16.480
by designing offline, loading,
retry, and success experiences.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.760
Make great connectivity
an edge case.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.720
So oftentimes, we're used
to designing edge cases

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.000
as when there's no network.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.030
Have no and slow networks
be your primary use cases,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:30.980
and have great connectivity
be the edge case.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.640
The example that we have here
is Chrome's offline page,

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.760
which has recently added a
download page later button.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.540
So not only does
Chrome work offline

00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:41.902
and give you helps to
figure out what's going on,

00:10:41.902 --> 00:10:43.360
but there's also
an action that you

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:47.120
can take on this page on
this piece of content.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.670
Another example for this
tip is Google Search.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.590
Google Search has
launched a new feature

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.560
where when you're
offline, or when

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.620
you're on a flaky connection
and the connection to Google

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.600
doesn't work, you can
search for something.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.090
And then Google Search will
give you a notification

00:11:04.090 --> 00:11:05.909
of the content when it's ready.

00:11:05.909 --> 00:11:08.200
So you can turn to Google
Search in great connectivity,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.600
in flaky connectivity,
or no connectivity

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.530
and still count on
getting an answer back.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.230
The final component of the
usable bucket is compatibility.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.230
And oftentimes, when we
talk about compatibility

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.188
for emerging markets or
for new internet users,

00:11:22.188 --> 00:11:25.240
we talk about operating
systems, hardware, software.

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.210
And all of those are
very important-- for all

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:29.440
the developers in the audience--
these are important things

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:32.065
to focus on, but I want to talk
about something that's actually

00:11:32.065 --> 00:11:38.140
design related, which is
half of the phones in India,

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.510
right now, being sold
are less than $100.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.120
And actually, many of them are
$30, $40, $50 phones, as well.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.507
And as you can
imagine, a $50 phone

00:11:46.507 --> 00:11:48.340
doesn't really have the
same type of screen,

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.881
doesn't have the
same touch feedback,

00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:51.470
doesn't have the same contrast.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.380
It doesn't have
the same resolution

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:58.870
as an expensive premium
device screen does, as well.

00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:00.730
It's also got lower processing.

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.370
On top of that, because
phones are expensive,

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.704
people keep using broken phones.

00:12:04.704 --> 00:12:06.994
Just because the phone breaks,
doesn't mean they go out

00:12:06.994 --> 00:12:07.870
and buy a new phone.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.367
Oftentimes, broken
phones are used.

00:12:09.367 --> 00:12:11.200
And when a new phone
comes, the broken phone

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.210
will still be used by
another family member,

00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:18.310
or by somebody in a more
remote or more rural location.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.050
So, it's important
that we understand

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.330
that low cost and broken
phones are actually

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:27.420
part of the ecosystem in which
people are using our products.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.362
Material design provides a
variety of affordance options.

00:12:30.362 --> 00:12:32.820
And it's always being revised,
and there's more affordances

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:33.390
that are being added.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.920
And so we encourage
you to choose

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.290
the types of affordances
that make the most sense

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.010
for these types of phones.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.490
The tip here is to
design clearer, larger,

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:45.210
farther apart affordances to
prevent mistaken taps caused

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:49.380
by bad and broken screens and
high contrast environments.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:52.440
You'll see the example
here is from YouTube Go.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.617
There's a modal,
there's two buttons.

00:12:54.617 --> 00:12:56.200
The buttons are not
just text buttons,

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.890
we didn't choose to use
that affordance option.

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:03.000
We chose to use big
buttons with high contrast

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.010
and big backgrounds.

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:11.279
And this ends up
being easier to see

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:13.320
when you're in the sunlight,
or when you're using

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.876
a screen that isn't as great.

00:13:14.876 --> 00:13:16.794
TRACEY CHAN: Yeah, and
to add something, too--

00:13:16.794 --> 00:13:18.210
what we've learned
really strongly

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.540
in our user research is that
pairing together icon and text

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:23.820
can really help people
understand or remember

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.480
what an affordance does.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.080
You can consider each item,
the icon and the text,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.280
as compensating for each other
for any little bit of each

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:37.180
that might get, inevitably,
lost in translation.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.860
So now, we move on to the
second bucket of useful.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.740
This contains, also, the second
set of components-- culture,

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.200
content, and
commerce-- evaluating,

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.760
is your product valuable?

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.250
Not just if it can be used,
but is it also providing

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:53.850
good use to the users?

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.900
The first is culture,
and culture manifests

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.860
in numerous ways.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.860
But we're just going to
explore one branch of it

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:02.230
for time purposes.

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.360
So before search
engines existed,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.770
there were sites like this.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.410
Like DMOZ, which was like
a portal to the internet,

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.337
a directory of the internet's
top level contents.

00:14:11.337 --> 00:14:13.420
And whether you knew what
you wanted to search for

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.970
or didn't, you'd start
with a related category

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.660
and go from there.

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:21.760
But now, we've evolved more
into this very familiar format

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.760
of searching to all of
us which is, arguably,

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:26.690
a little less guided.

00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:29.890
But this works for us, because
we had portals like DMOZ

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.350
help us build a really
strong mental model for what

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:34.360
lived on the internet,
and how to find it

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:38.020
with the high level categories,
and then the subcategories.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:41.080
And studies have actually
shown that your mental models

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:44.260
and your visual preferences
are heavily shaped and affected

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.900
by the physical
landscapes you grow up in,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.625
and the environments
you grow up in.

00:14:48.625 --> 00:14:52.850
So why can't this be applied
to digital environments, too?

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.600
We can't assume that
everyone coming online, who

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.630
hasn't had this DMOZ
type background,

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:01.190
has the same mental
model of searching.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:03.940
It can be really hard to know
what you want to search for,

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.370
and also, to formulate a query.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:08.350
Imagine how
intimidating it could

00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:10.889
be to form a query in
your second, third,

00:15:10.889 --> 00:15:11.680
or fourth language.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.120
And then, hope to find some
semblance of a relevant result

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:19.424
come up afterwards.

00:15:19.424 --> 00:15:20.840
So our tip for
this bit of culture

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.320
is to show the breadth of
what's possible in your product.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.100
Don't assume an
existing mental model.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.050
The example we have here is
actually Google Search, itself,

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:31.050
on this mobile device.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.286
So there are
options to discover.

00:15:33.286 --> 00:15:34.910
Not just particular
categories, but you

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.100
can also dive directly
into news content.

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.410
You can find out
the current weather,

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.320
before even worrying
about typing.

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.040
And typing can still be
very hard on mobile devices.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.910
Another example are categories
within the Google Play Store.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.760
Again, this screen
guides users to show

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.410
what the Play Store contains.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:56.570
And it clearly shows
the various categories

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.440
with matching icons on the side.

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.010
The next component is content.

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.970
And one way, just one way
that content manifests

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.010
is with language.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.590
Statistics on English
speaking ability

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:12.410
can be pretty unreliable,
but it's generally

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:15.320
accepted that about 30%
of the population in India

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.790
can speak English.

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.490
And a third of that
have some semblance

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.560
of reading and writing aptitude.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.420
So, 10% overall.

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.180
And this is a really
interesting statistic

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.720
to consider, alongside the
fact that a lot of users

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:33.010
in these markets, and
globally, use their Android

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:36.200
OS in English, despite it not
being their first language,

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.200
and despite not fully
understanding written English.

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.730
So another thing we can't assume
is that users in these markets

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:46.700
will use interfaces in
their native language,

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.800
if that's even
offered as an option.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.930
And we also can't
assume that they want

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:53.360
to type in their native script.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.530
So, we need to work on
improving our English UIs.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.810
Our tip here is to
simplify language--

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.750
short, simple, direct
for maximum clarity.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:06.170
And with this, to avoid very
culturally specific phrases,

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:07.824
like "Shucks!"

00:17:07.824 --> 00:17:09.740
Most of the examples
we've been showing so far

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.960
are examples of what to do.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.940
And we want to show
a quick example here

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.420
of a screen that may not work
so great in other markets.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.490
This is a past YouTube
onboarding flow that

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.950
said, "New awesomeness awaits."

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:23.810
And the word "awesomeness"
doesn't really

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:29.309
mean awesome or, really,
anything in other vernaculars.

00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:31.100
GAREN CHECKLEY: Finally,
the last component

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.250
of the useful
bucket is commerce.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:35.750
And oftentimes, when we talk
about commerce and new internet

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.670
users, we talk about
forms of payment

00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:40.975
because so many
economies run on cash.

00:17:40.975 --> 00:17:42.350
That's important
for your product

00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:44.720
to consider from your
business standpoint, as well.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.350
But we want to talk about a
UI specific design example,

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.040
as well.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.040
And that's around sachet
economics, sachet marketing.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.210
So sachets are small little
packets of consumer goods,

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.831
like shampoo or detergent.

00:17:59.831 --> 00:18:01.580
And what they are is
they're really cheap,

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:02.930
so people can go and buy them.

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:06.860
And this allows folks to get
a sense of what the product is

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.322
and try it out at
a very low cost.

00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:11.030
They can try the
experience a little bit,

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:13.430
before they commit to
buying something even more.

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.320
So instead of buying a
big bottle of shampoo,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.285
they'll buy a single, one
time use sachet of shampoo.

00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:19.910
And we can actually
bring this learning

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:23.390
back into how we design
digital experiences, as well.

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:26.390
And our tip here is to allow
people to try before they buy,

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:29.390
providing tastes of
experiences before you

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:31.790
want them to commit to them.

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.260
The example here
that we're showing

00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:35.720
is the website of Flipkart.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.690
Flipkart is a big
e-commerce company in India.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.520
And what we're not
showing here, actually,

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.000
is the Flipkart Android app.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.980
Great Android app, but
Flipkart is heavily invested

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.700
in a web presence, as well.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.970
So for folks that don't
really know what Flipkart is,

00:18:49.970 --> 00:18:51.830
they don't want to
invest in the data

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.470
and the storage and the
battery to download an app.

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:55.940
They can go poke
around the website

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.950
to get a sense of what
the app is before they

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.830
commit to downloading the app.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.372
Another example of this
is within YouTube Go,

00:19:03.372 --> 00:19:05.330
where when you tap on a
video before you choose

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.730
to play or download
the video, we

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:09.590
show you a little
preview of what's inside.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:11.690
We're not going to give
away the entire video.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:13.773
But we show you a sense
of what you'll be getting,

00:19:13.773 --> 00:19:18.050
if you choose to spend
the MBs to download it.

00:19:18.050 --> 00:19:20.030
Keep in mind, like
Tracey said, data

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.720
feels like money
for a lot of folks.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.450
So it's not just spending
money that feels like money.

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:26.900
It's also spending data,
it's spending limited storage

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:28.820
that folks have
on their devices,

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.235
spending limited battery.

00:19:32.235 --> 00:19:35.550
TRACEY CHAN: So the final bucket
of this framework is engaging.

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:39.030
Does your product delight
by being social, sensorial,

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.550
and surprising?

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.070
In this context, social
touches on the fact

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.250
that the cultures in these
types of emerging markets

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:50.290
is collectivistic, it's
not individualistic.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:53.370
They rely on human networks
to fetch information,

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:56.040
to learn new
things, to discover.

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.290
Friends are their search engine.

00:19:58.290 --> 00:20:00.090
For us, Google is
our search engine.

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:01.590
And there's nothing
wrong with that.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:04.110
But considering how
we fetch information

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.795
with search engines,
while we are leveraging

00:20:06.795 --> 00:20:08.670
the other people's
knowledge on the internet,

00:20:08.670 --> 00:20:12.570
it's still, very often,
an individual experience.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.150
Additionally, content,
like a funny video,

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:19.350
is very valuable social currency
in these types of environments,

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:22.170
where new online content
is a lot harder to search

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.870
for, and therefore a
lot harder to access.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.430
Our tip here is to encourage
the sharing of experiences.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:31.420
Don't just design
for the individual,

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.270
but for the community as well.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.880
If you allow people to show off
to their friends and family,

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.870
it really bumps up the social
currency of your entire app.

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:42.270
In this example, YouTube
provides a pretty clear shared

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:45.594
affordance, centered underneath
the video and the title.

00:20:45.594 --> 00:20:47.010
So it makes the
action really easy

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:50.040
to discover and act
upon at the moment

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.617
you realize you want
to share this content.

00:20:52.617 --> 00:20:54.450
This is just one way,
though, that a product

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:56.460
has encouraged sharing.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:21:01.500
Our second example is the
peer-to-peer sharing feature

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.950
within YouTube Go, which allows
people to transfer videos

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:08.220
or social currency to any
friend nearby with very, very

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.590
minimal use of data.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.860
The second component
is sensorial.

00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.890
So not all cultures
embrace what we

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.560
deem this minimalistic
aesthetic that

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.590
seems to be quite coveted
in Western cultures.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.715
And why it's not always
coveted in other cultures

00:21:26.715 --> 00:21:28.090
could be due to
a lot of reasons,

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.840
be it traditions, resources,
beliefs, or what have you.

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.760
But in these markets
and cultures,

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.100
you'll see a lot of
different uses of color,

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:40.720
patterns, and designs that can
connote a feeling of vibrancy

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.630
or energy to our Western eyes.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:45.790
So for instance, here
we see a comparison

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.330
of clothing and textiles across
three different countries

00:21:49.330 --> 00:21:51.640
that differ vastly
from each other,

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.390
and also from Western markets,
too, be it the context in which

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:57.820
they're wearing the clothes,
how they're crafted,

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.090
the colors, the meanings behind
the patterns, et cetera--

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.610
many more things.

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:06.970
Another really interesting
example is information density,

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.540
with respect to high context
and low context environments.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:13.000
The center image is from a
really interesting study that

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.450
showed that users in Indonesia
preferred icons that depicted

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:20.500
more of the surrounding
context of the object,

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:23.350
and more detail in
the icon depictions.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.970
Whereas, users in
the United States

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.260
prefer the more abstract,
simple icons or more low context

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.880
designs.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.250
The images on the
sides are common scenes

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.310
that you'll see walking
the streets in India--

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.470
very dense signage
or stores that

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:41.200
are organized-- maybe how you
would consider your storage

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.540
room is organized.

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.000
And the main point is that
what's considered clutter

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.490
to us, or not clean
and simple design,

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:50.650
could be the
preference for others.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:53.470
A lot of these differences can
also be really overwhelming,

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.800
but ultimately, we say
they should be embraced.

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.650
So our tip, really, is don't
westernize everything, that's

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.510
not really what people want.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:04.300
Nod to local aesthetics
by drawing inspiration

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:06.700
from regionally
popular products,

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:08.890
or hiring local designers.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.920
This will make your product feel
more relatable, that you care

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.860
and pay attention to
the cultural aesthetics.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.950
A really great example here
is Google Allo stickers.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.590
That team hired local
designers in India

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:23.230
to create these
downloadable sticker packs.

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.020
And not only can you see
the pretty clear inspiration

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.510
of local aesthetics,
but also the addition

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:30.615
of common
transliterated phrases.

00:23:32.917 --> 00:23:34.500
GAREN CHECKLEY: And
our last component

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.320
for the engaging
bucket is surprising.

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.760
This is the one that's
the most nebulous.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.660
But we strongly recommend
to surprise and delight

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.370
by doing one thing or just
a focused set of things

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:46.714
very, very well.

00:23:46.714 --> 00:23:48.630
It's really easy to think
of emerging markets,

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:51.750
to think of new internet users
as having a lower tolerance

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:54.840
or being less savvy, and
that's absolutely wrong.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.090
Just because they're new to
the internet does not mean

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.840
they're new to life,
does not mean they're

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:00.450
willing to settle for less.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.270
They've got different mental
models, different desires.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:05.280
But they also deserve,
they desire, they

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.780
want great experiences.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.400
And because many
of them are coming

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.930
online for the
first time, they're

00:24:09.930 --> 00:24:12.147
trying to evaluate how
they use their technology.

00:24:12.147 --> 00:24:13.230
They'll try something out.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.000
And if it doesn't
make sense, they'll

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.990
move on to the next thing.

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:20.550
So at an umbrella level,
it's absolutely critical

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:22.110
that you keep your
product focused,

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.640
not have too many
gimmicks, and just

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.080
focus on doing this one thing--

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:28.410
delivering the
value very clearly.

00:24:28.410 --> 00:24:31.510
People are critical.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.761
They're looking for
great experiences

00:24:34.761 --> 00:24:35.760
that resonate with them.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.552
And we think that this
is the way to do it.

00:24:37.552 --> 00:24:39.593
This is the way that a
lot of product development

00:24:39.593 --> 00:24:41.010
happens at Google,
as well, where

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:43.570
we focus on figuring out
what this value makes sense

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:48.876
and just being very
focused on delivering that.

00:24:48.876 --> 00:24:50.250
So thank you for
following along,

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.125
as we've discussed these
different components

00:24:52.125 --> 00:24:54.450
of these different buckets
on making your product

00:24:54.450 --> 00:24:56.554
usable, useful, and engaging.

00:24:56.554 --> 00:24:58.470
In India alone, over the
next couple of years,

00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.740
100 million people
are going to be coming

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.070
online every single year.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:06.450
So let's not forget that
while we're all human,

00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:08.160
while we all care
about our families,

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.972
we have similar aspirations
for our families, our lives,

00:25:12.972 --> 00:25:15.180
there are many different
cultures, different context,

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.820
constraints, and mental models
that we can accommodate for,

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.800
as well.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.080
We think that they deserve
great internet experiences.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.038
And we're excited that
you're here, that you're

00:25:24.038 --> 00:25:25.350
thinking about this.

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:26.767
And if there's one
piece of advice

00:25:26.767 --> 00:25:29.183
that we can give you, other
than following this framework,

00:25:29.183 --> 00:25:30.420
it's to listen to your users.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:33.270
And whether that means going to
a place where your product is

00:25:33.270 --> 00:25:36.000
popular, or you want it to be
popular, to conduct some user

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.980
research, or to
building feedback

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:39.990
mechanisms into your product.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:42.300
Even just looking at
the Google Play reviews

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:44.580
and looking at where the
feedback is coming from,

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.514
which geographies
they are coming from,

00:25:47.514 --> 00:25:48.930
we think that
focusing on the user

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.670
is the way to help
understand how

00:25:50.670 --> 00:25:54.337
to deliver that focused value.

00:25:54.337 --> 00:25:55.170
Thank you very much.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:26:00.840
And this framework is published
online in the ACM Interactions

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.410
magazine.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:05.320
So you can go ahead and check
that out at this short link.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.420
We also have a website,
developers.google.com/billions.

00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.940
And we'll leave you with this
framework and these tips,

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:13.140
all on one slide.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.754
And we invite any Q&amp;A, as well.

00:26:14.754 --> 00:26:16.920
So, please come up to the
microphones in the aisles.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.553
Thank you.

00:26:17.553 --> 00:26:18.511
TRACEY CHAN: Thank you.

00:26:18.511 --> 00:26:21.644
