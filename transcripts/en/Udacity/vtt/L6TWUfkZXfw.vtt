00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.140
Okay so we're going to do that.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.370
And I want you to figure out what would
happen if we got all the way down to

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.210
step five and
A is let's say, the mother.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.250
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So what would happen step five?

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.030
&gt;&gt; A gets the baby.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.880
&gt;&gt; A gets the baby.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.149
&gt;&gt; A pays B and B pays F.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.860
So F is basically a penalty to B for
lying.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.460
&gt;&gt; Right.
And A [LAUGH] is worth the penalty to A.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:33.810
But it should be, well, it depends on
how much B sets the value of V for.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:35.912
&gt;&gt; Right, so,
what would B set the value of V for?

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:37.140
What are the possibilities?

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.189
Okay, it could be like,
1 million dollars, right?

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:43.550
So that would definitely
discourage A from saying yes.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.382
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I say you pick the million
dollars because you think a million

00:00:46.382 --> 00:00:48.840
dollars is more than the value
of the baby to the real mother?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.590
That the idea here?

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.690
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, I guess so.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.250
&gt;&gt; Okay, so
some value of V greater than V real.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.850
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.360
&gt;&gt; Which for
the sake of this discussion,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.350
let's say is 1 million dollars.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.520
&gt;&gt; Okay, excellent.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.580
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to claim
that B would never do that.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.990
&gt;&gt; B would never?

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.900
So the disincentive for B for
that is that A can be like,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.070
you know what I can't afford
a baby at a million dollars.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.040
It's more than the actual
value of my baby to me.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.720
You get the baby, but you're going to
have to pay the million dollars.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.910
&gt;&gt; Right, now, that's not just
something that could happen,

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.161
that's something that
would happen right?

00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:20.463
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Because we've tied

00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:21.767
everything up in the value.

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:25.760
So if V Is bigger than V real, then we
get down here and ask is it your child?

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.130
A will say no because paying V for

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.220
the baby is more than
what the baby is worth.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.060
And so B will get the baby,
but B will pay V.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.360
What do we know about V?

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.380
V is bigger than V real, which
means it's also bigger than V fake.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.050
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.700
So okay, so we're assuming
that B has a value of B fake.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.340
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.697
&gt;&gt; So-
&gt;&gt; Well in this case we're assuming

00:01:46.697 --> 00:01:48.740
A was the real mother and B was not.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.140
&gt;&gt; A was the real mother and B was not.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.010
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.940
&gt;&gt; That's what I said, right?

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.530
So B has a value of V fake.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.060
So then what value of V would B pick?

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.728
&gt;&gt; So, B shouldn't be willing,
I mean B doesn't want the baby for

00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:02.740
more than V fake.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.720
That's how much B values the baby.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.820
And if B suggests a value of V or
announces a value of V in step 3,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.560
that's bigger than V fake,
B might get, you know, B is at risk.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.220
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.060
&gt;&gt; Right, if getting the baby and
overpaying for it.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.510
&gt;&gt; Right, and
having to pay more of this.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.600
&gt;&gt; Economists are weird.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.467
&gt;&gt; Economists are weird.

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:22.750
But that's okay.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.820
So that means that not only will B not
pick something bigger than V real,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.260
V would not pick anything
bigger than V fake.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and in fact,

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.430
in principle, B would rather pay
up to V fake to get the baby.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.350
Anything less than that and if B doesn't
get the baby, B.'s going to be sad for

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.870
not having offered more.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.550
So at the end of the day,
B's going to pick V fake as V.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.380
Okay so if B picks V fake as B, then
what do we know is going to happen at

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.570
this question,
when A gets asked if it's your child?

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.190
A's going to say yes.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.330
&gt;&gt; A is going to say yes.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.560
&gt;&gt; Why?
&gt;&gt; Well because if the value that B

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.170
announced is V fake and A would have
regret for not getting the baby,

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.450
yeah, for not getting the baby, and
not bidding up to V real, no, bidding is

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.570
probably not the right word, but let's
go with it kind of suggesting it, or

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.550
being it, A would have been willing
to pay up to V real for the baby.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.140
So A would be happy to pay V fake for
the baby.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.420
&gt;&gt; because V fake's less than V real.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.350
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so A will, in fact, say yes.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.680
A will get the baby,
will pay less than the value for it.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.720
And what happens to B?

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.080
&gt;&gt; What happens to be B?

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.110
B pays a nominal fine.

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.560
&gt;&gt; Right, but that's greater than 0.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.530
&gt;&gt; So if they both thought this all
the way through, now we can unroll back

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.090
all the way to step 2 where B is asked,
is this your child?

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.390
Now B is saying, I could say no and
A gets the baby and I just walk away.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.200
&gt;&gt; I get zero.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.830
&gt;&gt; Or I could say yes and
I'm going to end up paying a fine.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:49.730
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.770
&gt;&gt; But least A is going to have
to pay a lot of money, so ha.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.270
&gt;&gt; But it's all built into
the value here,all right.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:00.230
So that means that since B is never
going to be willing to assert a V

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.990
greater than V fake, which means that B
is never going to be able to make it so

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.980
expensive that the real
mother would say no,

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.170
B has no reason to ever let it get this
far, because B will pay something.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.250
B will get minus F,
which is less than 0,

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.420
which means if we ever get to step 2,
B will bail and say no.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.920
&gt;&gt; I see.
