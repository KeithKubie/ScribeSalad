00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.120
- [Instructor] In this
video we are going to use

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.570
the GDP equation that we have seen before

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.380
to think about how national
savings relates to investment.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.020
And really it's a way to
algebraically manipulate things

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.170
to ensure that it fits with our intuition.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.970
So another way to think about a GDP

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.370
is it's the same thing as national income,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.580
which we donate with a capital letter Y.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.010
And GDP or national income,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.410
we can account for it by saying,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.210
hey, that's going to be
the sum of consumption plus

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.530
investment plus government
spending in a closed economy.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.330
We could also think about an open economy

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.760
where you have net
exports right over here,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.970
but let's just focus on
a closed economy for now.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.300
So I'm gonna just actually label this.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.260
We're gonna deal with a
closed, closed economy.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.270
In a future video I will
open the economy up.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.760
But how could we solve for savings?

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.250
Well, what happens if
we subtract consumption

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.980
and government spending from
both sides of this equation?

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.570
Well then you're gonna
have national income

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.870
minus consumption, minus
government spending,

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.600
is equal to investment.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.450
Now, what is another way of thinking about

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.130
this left-hand side of this equation?

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.630
So at a national level this is the income

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.560
minus how much is being consumed

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.080
and how much the government is spending.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.410
So it's income minus the
different types of spending.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.010
Well, you could view
this as national savings.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.580
National savings.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.030
And we see here this identity
that national savings,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.530
which is often denoted with a capital S,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.200
is equal to investment.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.960
And if that isn't
intuitive for you at first,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.770
just think about it at
a kind of human scale.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.090
If I am saving things and I
am putting it into a bank,

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.220
that bank will then lend that money

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.830
that can be used for investment.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.090
And we can break this down even more

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.500
if we wanna think about taxes.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.350
So let's just say T is equal to taxes.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.920
So let's just think about
the private economy first.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.070
So if we think about the national income

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.340
minus consumption spending,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.160
and then folks have
got to pay their taxes.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.540
So minus taxes.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.310
And then where do those taxes go?

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.250
Well, they go to the government,

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.380
so they stay in the economy.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.990
So notice, I'm not changing this equation,

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.490
I'm just subtracting taxes
and then adding taxes.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.440
And then I subtract from
that government spending.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.730
These two equations are equivalent

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.140
and this is going to be equal to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.090
our investment in our closed economy.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.530
Now, if you look at this
left-hand side right over here,

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.600
you could view this as private savings.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.840
This is the national income,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.730
minus how much is being consumed,

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.430
minus how much is being
paid to the government.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.563
So this is private, private savings.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.060
And if you look at the second part,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.970
the taxes the government gets

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.230
minus how much the government spends,

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.360
this you could view as public savings.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.890
Public savings.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.760
In most countries this
is neutral to negative,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.440
so it's actually the
public savings are negative

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.730
'cause the government spends more

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.060
than the amount of revenue gets in taxes.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.110
But either way you could see the T minus G

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.660
would be the public savings,

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.960
and you add public savings
and private savings together,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.353
you get national savings.
