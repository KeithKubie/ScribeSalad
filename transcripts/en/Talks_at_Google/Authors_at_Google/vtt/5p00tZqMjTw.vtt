[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:08.390
SPEAKER 1: Professor Goldsmith
teaches at the Harvard Law

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.250
School.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.850
He's the Henry Shaddock
Professor over there,

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.510
and he's also a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.000
While I was in
Boston, I took a class

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.040
with him and Bruce Schneier.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.760
And I then became
acquainted with his work

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.860
from the legal
perspective that is

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.170
relevant to a lot of the
things that we do here

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:31.450
in Security and Privacy.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.794
So with that, I'll turn
it to Professor Goldsmith.

00:00:35.794 --> 00:00:37.460
JACK GOLDSMITH: Thanks
for coming today.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.890
I'm grateful to be here.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.050
My talk is the "United States
is Losing the Digital Cold War."

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.957
I'm going to collect a
bunch of facts and arguments

00:00:46.957 --> 00:00:48.790
that you've all heard
before and that you're

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.250
more familiar with
than I am probably,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.880
but to suggest some larger
patterns that I think

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.100
haven't been
sufficiently appreciated

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.466
and some of the
implications for how

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.090
I think the United
States is ultimately

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.230
going to have to change--

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.520
the United States government.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.290
I don't speak for its companies.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.290
Maybe you can tell me
about that in the question

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.970
and answer about how the US
government will have to change

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.350
its international posture.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.440
So the Cold War is basically,
as I'm describing it,

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.790
it's a fight over what the
networks inside countries

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:22.720
look like.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.150
And the United States
has a particular vision,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.160
which I'm going to talk
about in the second.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.530
And at the other extremes
are the Chinese and Russians

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.990
and Irans of the world, who
have a particular vision.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.190
And somewhere in the middle
is the European Union.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.540
And there's a fight going on.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.190
It's on the surface, but it's
also happening more vigorously

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.440
below the surface,
about what networks

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.810
look like both in
these countries

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.180
and in these geographies.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.030
And these countries
and geographies

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.140
have views about how they
look in other countries.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.970
The United States' vision,
Secretary of State Clinton

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.630
gave a speech in
January of 2010 stating

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.229
what she described as the State
Department's Open Internet

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.810
Agenda, or Internet
Freedom Agenda.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.540
And it really-- the speech
got a lot of coverage

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.190
as something new and important.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.830
But in fact, it represents
the United States view

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.310
about internet regulation
globally going back

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.650
to the 1990s.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.130
These are the main tenets.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.100
The United States is in favor
of free flow of information

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.420
across borders, generally
against censorship on networks,

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.920
generally against
blocking online services

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.430
and most types of take down--

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.150
the exceptions is largely
for intellectual property--

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.020
against burdensome
internet regulations.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.580
The Internet Freedom
Initiative was

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.780
designed to push all
of these positions

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.590
globally and also, beyond
that, to pay for and subsidize

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.280
and to proliferate
and distribute

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.800
tools in authoritarian
states that allowed activists

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.367
to circumvent control on digital
networks in those nations.

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:11.200
That was an important
part of the initiative

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.950
to try to help literally bring
the technology to activists

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.060
in other countries to
help them circumvent

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.310
the control on those networks.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.922
Clinton said in her
speech that, of course,

00:03:22.922 --> 00:03:24.380
we can't have all
of these freedoms

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.730
without robust cybersecurity.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.780
So that was an
important part of this.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.230
And she said, we should try
to create international norms

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.910
to guarantee this.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.590
Now, these are
familiar principles

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.990
because they're basically
Google's principles.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.210
This is from a 2013 paper.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:45.020
And the US government's vision
is basically Google's vision.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.140
It's basically the
large IT industry,

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.150
global IT industry centered
mostly here's vision.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.000
And so there's really not
much difference, as far

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.380
as I can tell, between
your vision and this vision

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.630
of the US government they've
been pushing for 20 years

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.910
and that you've been pushing,
as far as I can tell,

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.060
since you've been founded.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.330
The vision is in tatters
is what I'm going to argue.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.010
It's in tatters because nations
increasingly and successfully

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:15.890
are imposing control,
digital borders,

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:21.690
and imposing control on
networks within their borders.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.800
This is nothing new.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.900
It's been happening for a while,
even though 20 years ago, we

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.110
were told it was impossible.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.920
But it's gotten--

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.170
I think authoritarian states
have become more and more

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.045
successful at this,
which is contrary to what

00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:34.130
a lot of people predicted.

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.260
This digital control
abroad is having

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.750
an impact in the United States.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.980
This is the example of
the right to be forgotten.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.870
I'll come back to this example.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.790
But sometimes digital
control abroad,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.950
such as Europe's attempt
to impose a right

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.800
to be forgotten rule
on Google, if they

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.930
order Google-- there's
a big case in Europe

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.360
now to take down certain
data not just on servers

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.767
on Google in France or
in Europe, but globally.

00:04:59.767 --> 00:05:01.100
That's what this debate's about.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.400
Can Europe, in effect, impose
a global rule on Google?

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.890
And if they can, then
they are, in effect,

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.190
effecting internet freedom
here in the United States.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:12.840
And finally, as the
election showed,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.380
but that's only one
example, adversaries

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.570
exploit internet openness
in the United States.

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.850
And more generally--
well, let's just

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:22.550
say those are the three
main pieces of evidence

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.900
that this agenda's in tatters.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.926
I'm going to talk about
this and why it's happened.

00:05:27.926 --> 00:05:31.665
So these are the three reasons
why the agenda's a failure.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:34.040
And I don't know the extent
to which you appreciate this,

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.790
especially if you're
in the United States.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.870
But the United States talks
about internet freedom

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.910
and internet openness.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.640
But it is, both its
government and its firms,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.850
widely seen as the
biggest bully on the block

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.150
when it comes to malicious
activity in the networks,

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.420
starting with the
militarization of the network.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.970
Stuxnet that is the
greatest example.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.034
But as President Obama bragged
in his press conference,

00:05:58.034 --> 00:06:00.200
at his last press conference
at the end of the year,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:04.444
no nation has more
powerful offensive weapons,

00:06:04.444 --> 00:06:06.110
digital weapons, than
the United States.

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:10.640
And it appears that no nation
is using them as robustly.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.520
Although that's now in question
since we're on the receiving

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.890
end of a lot of it.

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.770
The Snowden revelations,
it's hard to exaggerate

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:20.540
how much the Snowden
revelations, which

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.050
were two years after
Clinton's speech, really

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.670
just was widely viewed as
exposing the open internet

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.780
agenda of the United
States and the sham,

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.810
since it showed that
the United States was

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.340
inside digital networks
throughout the world,

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:39.530
breaking into endless
numbers of systems,

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.860
extracting information, and
using it for various reasons.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.031
And if there's one event
that increased the backlash

00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:48.530
against this
initiative, I would say

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:52.490
it's the Snowden revelations.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.560
Finally, US firms are viewed
as imperialist arms of the US

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.610
government.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.560
I'm not sure this is
true of consumers.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.240
But certainly in
Europe, the governments

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.950
view US firms as imposing
their particular US

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.174
vision of the internet
on their countries

00:07:11.174 --> 00:07:12.590
in ways that affect
their culture.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:13.548
It affects their norms.

00:07:13.548 --> 00:07:15.950
It affects their
fundamental commitments.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:19.970
So one big reason why
this initiative has failed

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:21.425
is because people don't like it.

00:07:21.425 --> 00:07:23.300
They don't like it, and
they think the United

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.812
States is hypocritical.

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:26.270
The second two
reasons are what I'm

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.853
going to focus on
the rest of my talk,

00:07:27.853 --> 00:07:30.680
that the United
States simply can't,

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.220
has been unsuccessful in
imposing openness abroad

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.620
in other countries, and
that openness at home

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.070
is increasingly not all
it's cracked up to be.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.680
So I'm not going to go
into detail about this,

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.560
but just looking at China.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.154
China has-- I wrote a book
with Tim Wu 10 years ago called

00:07:52.154 --> 00:07:53.320
"Who Controls the Internet?"

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.970
And we had a chapter about China
and how China had 10 years ago

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.050
pretty successfully, despite
widespread predictions

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:08.140
to the contrary and despite the
fact that there was flourishing

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.962
internet activity in China,
that China had brought pretty

00:08:10.962 --> 00:08:12.670
good control, through
various techniques,

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:16.090
filtering at the border,
lots of monitoring inside,

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:18.820
and a variety of other
techniques-- censorship

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:21.430
inside, monitoring
inside, enforcement

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.170
of laws inside
the-- in the country

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.720
that had a deterrent
effect on others.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.330
China has only gotten
much, much better

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:30.900
at controlling its networks
in the last decades

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.350
since I wrote that book.

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:35.770
And these are some of the
many ways that nations

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.779
have used to, in effect,
impose the will that they

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:42.820
want-- and I'm talking
about authoritarian states

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.980
here-- impose their
view of what's

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:48.050
acceptable and not acceptable
behavior on the net.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:53.919
So filtering at the wall,
China just is implementing.

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:55.960
It's still not clear how
successful this will be,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.260
but it appears that it might
be successful at an internet

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:02.650
identity registration program
and having a social credit

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.710
system attached to that.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.310
It can be used for all sorts
of methods of social control,

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.910
including control in the
network, surveillance,

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:14.590
wiretapping, censorship,
denial of information access,

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.620
or accessing information inside
the user that the state--

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.100
inside the computers
or the devices

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.530
that the state wants to control.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:26.854
States have gotten good at
temporarily shutting off

00:09:26.854 --> 00:09:29.020
the internet, taking content
down from the internet,

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.210
slowing down the
internet, shutting down

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.490
cell towers when
necessary, and interrupting

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.560
the communications they want.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.440
They have ramped
up laws and actions

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:44.961
against tools designed to
circumvent these crackdown

00:09:44.961 --> 00:09:45.460
methods.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.680
And they're trying to
develop homegrown platforms

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.420
to replace foreign
platforms over which

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.359
they have more control.

00:09:54.359 --> 00:09:56.150
This next bullet point
is much of the same.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:01.960
They use law to go after authors
and dissidents and journalists

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.780
in a way that has a significant
deterrent effect on speech

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.340
in the country.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.190
And there's regional
coordination about this.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.035
The Shanghai Cooperation
Organization,

00:10:11.035 --> 00:10:14.500
I think that's what it's called,
is an organization primarily

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.160
with China and Russia.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.257
But India and
Pakistan just joined.

00:10:18.257 --> 00:10:20.590
And it's an organization--
and there are other nations--

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:27.070
that is designed to basically
to package these norms

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.100
and promote them as part
of the global order.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:31.990
It's basically
organization that's

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.930
over and against Western
Europe and the United States.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.200
But they are coordinating and
trying to export this vision.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.470
Now, in the Arab
Spring, many people

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:44.690
thought that social media--

00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:46.270
let me just say the last note.

00:10:46.270 --> 00:10:48.594
Encryption alters
methods of control,

00:10:48.594 --> 00:10:50.260
and many people
thought-- and again, I'm

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.740
not going to tell
anyone in this room.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.156
In fact, I can
learn from everyone

00:10:53.156 --> 00:10:54.910
in this room about this.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.270
Encryption was thought
to, and it does,

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.670
enable confidential
communications that the state

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.760
has a hard time getting at.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.880
But there is a new report by
my colleagues in the Berkman

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.870
Center at Harvard
just this summer

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.810
that showed that encryption
presents a problem for states,

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.580
but they found techniques
to deal with it,

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:20.470
including this entire list,
as substitute ways of control.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.280
Plus, encryption, at least
encrypted communications

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.250
from abroad, it makes
it, as I understand it,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:31.060
impossible for the state to
filter out at the site level

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.362
but not at the platform level.

00:11:32.362 --> 00:11:34.820
So they can keep Wikipedia out
of the country if they want,

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.150
even if they can't
block particular pages.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.130
So what encryption does
is it forces the state

00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:41.650
to make a choice, an
all-or-nothing choice.

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:43.690
Some states have
made that choice.

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.210
The point is, is that
encryption is not

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.727
the killer thing
that's going to bring

00:11:48.727 --> 00:11:49.810
the states to their knees.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:52.210
They have other methods
of imposing control

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.450
within their borders.

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.360
So the Arab Spring is
a pretty good example.

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.440
It seemed to be coordinated
by social media.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.350
It seemed that social media is
what enabled the organization

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:07.960
and collaboration
of the protests

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.880
inside authoritarian-- inside
the Middle Eastern countries

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.460
and North African countries
where it took place.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.830
There was a question at
the time about how much

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:20.560
this movement was
really internet enabled

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.420
and how much it
was something else.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.180
But the key point is that
the authoritarian states

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.366
learned from that experience.

00:12:27.366 --> 00:12:28.990
And frankly, in a
lot of cases, they're

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.970
using the network
against the dissidents.

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:34.327
They are attacking them back
and using the network as a way

00:12:34.327 --> 00:12:35.410
to monitor the dissidents.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:38.530
But the point is that there's
been a ton of learning

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:42.610
and a ton of learning
about how to control

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:45.160
social media in these states,
to the extent the states want

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.530
to use them.

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:50.010
And as Ron Deibert said,
the authoritarian regimes

00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:52.440
have proven themselves
surprisingly and dismayingly

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.680
light-footed and adaptable at
controlling internet and social

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:57.720
media and using
them, through some

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.910
of the ways I said in
the previous slide,

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:01.300
to assert control.

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.090
So this is a
Freedom House study.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.650
You can't, obviously, see
the countries very well.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.450
And these are
qualitative judgments

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:12.210
about the extent of internet
freedom in the country

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.920
that talks about access, content
control, unlawful surveillance,

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:19.930
or surveillance and the like.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:24.390
And the purple
countries are not free.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:26.160
The yellow countries
are partially free.

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:30.090
The green countries are free
by these qualitative standards.

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.500
Without getting
into the details,

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.710
and, again, this is
a qualitative study,

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:35.160
it's not the most
rigorous study.

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.750
It is the most rigorous
study because it's

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.874
the only study of its kind.

00:13:37.874 --> 00:13:39.220
But it's not terribly rigorous.

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.990
It's very qualitative.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.955
But using their
qualitative standards,

00:13:42.955 --> 00:13:44.580
they've said every
year in the last six

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.580
years that freedom has declined
and in any number of ways.

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.490
And the content
control, in particular,

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:52.090
is not just about
political speech.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.230
It's about all sorts of speech--
religious speech and the like.

00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:00.846
And the study concludes
that 2/3 of internet users

00:14:00.846 --> 00:14:02.970
live in countries where
criticism of the government

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:06.120
or the military is censored.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.090
So that is, in effect--

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:12.850
so I would say that in
this battle for control--

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:17.127
for openness versus control
in authoritarian states,

00:14:17.127 --> 00:14:19.210
I would say that authoritarian
states are winning.

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:23.140
And I would love to know if
any of you disagree with that.

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.250
I think that's conventional
wisdom that they're winning.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.160
The EU vision is much closer to
ours but importantly different.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.680
And I don't need to tell
people at Google about this.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.846
They have a different
conception of the government's

00:14:33.846 --> 00:14:36.870
relationship to the individual
and the individual's

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.940
relationship to data and firms.

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:41.820
They have different
conceptions of privacy,

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:46.320
and they tend to value privacy
and their conception of privacy

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.110
and consumer protection over
free speech and free trade,

00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:50.960
as we understand it.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.550
They're much more inclined
to regulate than we are,

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:55.950
and especially after Snowden.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.650
At the European level, which is
where the regulation goes on,

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.960
they have a heightened
suspicion of surveillance.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.490
So, again, I don't
need to tell you

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:03.906
what the consequences
of this are,

00:15:03.906 --> 00:15:07.200
because Google's
living this now.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.800
But basically in
this space, when

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.860
Europe has a more
burdensome regime

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.780
on a company like Google
doing business there,

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.430
it's successfully
able to impose it.

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:21.100
And we've seen this
in all of these areas,

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.770
and Google has suffered
fines and penalties

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:26.792
and legal restrictions
and threats of regulation

00:15:26.792 --> 00:15:29.000
and all of these measures,
in all of these contexts--

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.940
antitrust, hate
speech, privacy, taxes.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:36.457
A lot of these
might be motivated

00:15:36.457 --> 00:15:37.540
by protectionist concerns.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.010
A lot of them might be
motivated by value differences.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.860
A lot of it is probably
some mixture of the two.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.400
The point is that Europe
has a very different vision

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:52.210
of what counts as
proper communications

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:53.710
within their borders
and what counts

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:56.560
as what can be done with the
data within their borders.

00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.350
And the key point is, just as
the authoritarian states are

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:00.742
able to control
in their borders,

00:16:00.742 --> 00:16:02.200
Europe is able to
do what it wants.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.680
It's a giant market, to
which all the major companies

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.760
want access.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.540
And it has successfully, so far,
imposed its different rules,

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.680
different and more burdensome
than in the United States.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.730
It's not just-- so
the point to here

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:20.920
is the authoritarian
states are doing what

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.155
they want within their borders.

00:16:23.155 --> 00:16:25.030
Let me just say I'm not
saying they're always

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.330
getting exactly what they want.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.840
There's often an arms race,
a technological arms race,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.760
that, again, I don't
need to tell you about,

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.280
between methods of control
and circumvention of control

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.410
or methods of freedom.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:38.680
But in general, the trend
has been towards control

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.570
and towards states,
especially states

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.960
with decent market power, where
big firms want to do business.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.690
They're able to impose their
vision on those companies

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:48.850
and through other
means to ensure

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:50.350
the types of
communication they want

00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:51.760
to allow in their countries.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:52.720
It's not perfect.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.110
And from their perspective,
regulation never is.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:57.940
But it's successful.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.860
So I've talked thus
far about nations

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:03.550
being able to control content
flows in their borders.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.940
But there is also, as part of
this larger set of conflicts

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.450
going on between
nations for control

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:14.495
over communications within their
borders, there's also exports.

00:17:14.495 --> 00:17:16.119
Part of the Internet
Freedom Initiative

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:19.089
was for the United States to
export digital freedom tools

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:22.180
and anonymity tools,
censorship circumvention

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:23.920
tools, and the like.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.260
US companies also
export technologies

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:28.851
of control, filtering
technologies

00:17:28.851 --> 00:17:30.100
of various sorts and the like.

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.650
So we're in the business,
the United States, of both

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:36.220
exporting the tools of
freedom and tools of control.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.030
The authoritarian countries,
China, in particular,

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.870
has a robust export
business in selling

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:47.200
what it's learned over the
last 20 years, its technologies

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:48.280
of control.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.600
And it has helped Russia.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.480
It has helped Iran.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.229
It has helped endless
number of countries.

00:17:52.229 --> 00:17:55.360
I'm not sure exactly what
the technologies that

00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:56.500
are being exported are.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.600
But there's a lot of
consultation and coordination

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:02.590
and sale of hardware and
software products from China

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:06.880
to authoritarian countries
that want to replicate its

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.750
means of control.

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:13.130
And finally, those are real
exports, and the last category,

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.637
these are sort of
indirect exports.

00:18:15.637 --> 00:18:17.470
And that was talked
about just a second ago.

00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:20.710
The right to be forgotten, if
this case in the highest court

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:24.400
in Europe succeeds,
and I think it's--

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.740
I believe it is Google
Spain, in Spain, that

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:30.520
was socked with this
order, where it started,

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.100
about giving individuals
a right to remove

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:38.540
certain data about them
from Google searches.

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.460
And the ultimate
order, I think it

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.020
was in the highest
court in Spain,

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:45.680
was that to make this
effective, the data

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.190
had to be removed not just from
Google SP or whatever it is,

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:53.117
but from all of
Google's networks,

00:18:53.117 --> 00:18:54.200
from all of its databases.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.660
You can't get access
through its searches

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.020
to this information
anywhere in the world.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.629
So to the extent that happens,
to the extent's enforced

00:19:02.629 --> 00:19:04.670
and to the extent Google
accepts it and continues

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:08.240
to do business in Europe,
as I predict it will,

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.165
that means that--

00:19:09.165 --> 00:19:10.790
I don't know how big
an effect this is.

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.230
But if it's a big
effect in Europe,

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:13.670
it's going to be the same
effect in the United States,

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.086
and that information won't be
available on Google searches

00:19:16.086 --> 00:19:17.120
in the United States.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:19.530
So that's a form of
export of control.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.190
Same thing with privacy--

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:25.160
the data privacy regime that
Europe's Europeans have,

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.650
which is more restrictive
than in the United States,

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:29.540
same impact in
terms of companies

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:33.380
tend to, if they want to
do business in both places

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.490
and if they want to be
able to mingle their data,

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.530
they tend to bow to the
most restrictive regime.

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.740
And so, in effect,
European privacy rules

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.960
have an impact both
on our privacy rules

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.810
here, which you might think is
a good thing, you might not.

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.592
And it also have an impact
on our surveillance rules,

00:19:50.592 --> 00:19:52.550
because that's what
they're really angry about.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.190
What they're really angry about
is data coming from Europe

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:59.180
to the United States to US firms
in a way that the United States

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:00.970
government can get
the information,

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.800
either through direct orders
or through some other means.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.870
And so to the extent
that we've been

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:08.900
in a argument the last three or
four years with the Europeans

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.480
about whether we need to
tighten up our surveillance

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.907
practices in order to satisfy
their privacy rules, again,

00:20:14.907 --> 00:20:16.490
it might or might
not be a good thing.

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.080
I want to stay away from
that normative question.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.330
The only point I want to
make is that Europe has

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:22.830
a big extraterritorial impact.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:27.030
Finally, I'll say that
this is a prediction,

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.980
but the Europeans
are, in general, ahead

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:34.940
of the United States in
thinking about and beginning

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.990
to legislate ways to force
companies to give them

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:43.410
back doors or some equivalent
to encrypted communications.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.600
And this is a prediction.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.150
If it starts happening,
I don't think

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:48.220
it's going to happen here.

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.340
I don't think there's
much of a chance of it

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.090
happening here in the
current environment.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.690
But the dynamic will
change, I predict,

00:20:53.690 --> 00:20:56.630
if European
countries, Australia,

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.600
and even non-Western
democracies,

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.400
nations that aren't
Western democracies,

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.040
start insisting on
this, it's going

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.887
to be harder and
harder for companies

00:21:05.887 --> 00:21:07.970
to resist these types of
initiatives in the United

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:08.719
States, I predict.

00:21:08.719 --> 00:21:13.340
So that's a form of exporting
digital control indirectly.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:18.560
So I've been talking
thus far about the ways

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.570
that the Internet
Freedom Initiative is not

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:21.724
working in other countries.

00:21:21.724 --> 00:21:24.140
Again, the initiative was to
bring the American conception

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.630
everywhere.

00:21:25.630 --> 00:21:28.880
And I've been talking about
the ways in that's not working.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.049
Now I want to briefly talk
about the ways in which--

00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:35.090
we're just at the beginning
of this conversation,

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:36.290
at the beginning of
understanding it.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:38.206
And again, you know more
about this than I do,

00:21:38.206 --> 00:21:39.680
so I'd love to learn from you--

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.660
but the ways in which
openness isn't all it's

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.250
cracked up to be at home
and for two reasons.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:46.250
I'm going to focus on two
reasons, cybersecurity

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.810
and speech.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:51.230
So not all of these are actually
assaults on the US networks.

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:52.880
This is just a list
of things pulled

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.960
from the headlines of 2017 that
involves some kind of cyber

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.470
attack or data breach
or cyber exploitation

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:01.910
or something like that.

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:03.900
And the list goes on and on.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.255
And the point is simply as--

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:13.450
the White House
Cybersecurity Czar Rob Joyce

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:15.440
was talking in
Cambridge the other day.

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.266
And he said that basically
that we've become numb to it.

00:22:19.266 --> 00:22:20.140
It happens every day.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.530
We're like the frog slowly
boiling in the kettle.

00:22:23.530 --> 00:22:26.440
It's getting worse and worse
and worse and worse by the day.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.560
And we really don't have a
plan to deal, as a nation,

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.160
with our cyber insecurities.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.790
And so the point I want
to make is that openness

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:37.720
contributes to this.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.820
It contributes to this
because-- and, again,

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:41.590
you all know more
about this than I do--

00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:43.790
closed societies
are able to have,

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.840
to the extent they can
impose, get rid of anonymity.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.360
To the extent they can control,
information flows better.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.910
To the extent that
they can eliminate

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:53.800
encrypted
communications, they're

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.470
able to deal with the
cybersecurity problems better

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.090
than open societies.

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:00.790
Something that's not
as easily understood

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:05.470
is that our very openness makes
it harder for the United States

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.960
to respond to cyber attacks.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:11.710
And I can give you
three examples of this.

00:23:11.710 --> 00:23:13.180
President Obama
here was speaking

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.450
at his press conference at
the end of-- his last press

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:17.500
conference last year.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.140
I think it was that on.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.120
It may have been the one before.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.911
It was the press
conference in which he was

00:23:20.911 --> 00:23:22.480
talking about the Russia hack.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.210
And he was being questioned
about why the United States did

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.290
not do more.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.170
And he explained that-- and
this is a perpetual problem

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:31.600
in our deterrence strategy.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:35.680
Deterrence requires--
to deter, you

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.920
have to credibly be able
to commit to impose pain

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.130
on the adversary when the
adversary does something to you

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:43.672
that you don't want
to happen to you.

00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:45.796
And the problem that the
United States finds itself

00:23:45.796 --> 00:23:47.380
in over and over
again, and this is

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.265
what Clapper is talking about,
is that every time the United

00:23:50.265 --> 00:23:51.640
States thinks
about retaliating--

00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:56.260
this happened with the
Iranian bank attack in 2012.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:01.060
It happened with the Korean
attack, the Sony hack.

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:04.880
It happened most
notably in the DNC hack.

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.851
That the United States hesitated
and in some situations did.

00:24:07.851 --> 00:24:08.350
nothing.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:09.490
Why?

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.230
Because when they
gamed it out, they

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.630
thought that the retaliation
to our retaliation

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.430
would be worse for us.

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:18.375
And they did a
so-called escalation.

00:24:18.375 --> 00:24:20.000
We're going to end
up being much worse.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:20.680
Why?

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.440
Because our networks are
open, because we're more

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.310
digitally connected, because
we're more digitally dependent,

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.180
and we have more to lose
from that escalation.

00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.460
So that's what Obama
was talking about when

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:36.460
he says that we're more
vulnerable partly because we

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.354
have a more open society.

00:24:38.354 --> 00:24:40.520
There are other ways in
which we're more vulnerable.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.930
I'll get to that in a second.

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:47.270
And it's why this is James
Clapper, Obama's Director

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:51.080
of the DNI, the Director
of National Intelligence,

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:52.010
and he said that--

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:54.772
he was explaining that we didn't
respond to the Iranian attacks

00:24:54.772 --> 00:24:57.230
precisely because we thought
the consequences for our banks

00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.770
would be worse when
Iran counter-retaliated.

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:02.420
And he said earlier,
and this is, I

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:04.211
think, the conclusion
of the US government,

00:25:04.211 --> 00:25:06.961
we simply can't do deterrence.

00:25:06.961 --> 00:25:08.710
We can't do defense
very well as a nation.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.250
We can't do deterrence very
well as a nation, which is

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:13.290
why the frog is slowly boiling.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:17.890
This is a big topic.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:20.730
But the internet has
really changed speech

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.346
in this country in
such a way that--

00:25:24.346 --> 00:25:25.950
and I'm only going
to be able to touch

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:31.770
on this briefly-- but in such
a way that makes openness

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.560
and the open networks
and the speech

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:38.100
that our social media
that is uncensored largely

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.250
makes possible, it has a
lot of pretty bad effects.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.130
We've seen-- I don't
have to remind you--

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:50.610
about how social media can
be used for disinformation,

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.144
misinformation, and propaganda.

00:25:52.144 --> 00:25:53.560
This was going on
in the election.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:55.080
It's very clear now.

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.880
We've seen troll armies.

00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:01.850
That because the
internet enables groups,

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.420
enables private individuals to
both coordinate in large groups

00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:09.810
and attack someone in ways
that are very intimidating,

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.550
and so we see speakers
being intimidated.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.430
We see flooding tactics
that distort or overcome

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:18.780
disfavored speech through fake
news, fake commentators, bots

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.550
of various sorts, and the like.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:25.170
We see the splintering of news
media, such that everyone has--

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:26.020
not everyone.

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:26.520
I don't.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.150
But many people have what Cass
Sunstein calls the "daily me."

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.730
We only get the information
that confirms your biases,

00:26:32.730 --> 00:26:35.190
and you don't have
to confront facts

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:36.990
that don't confirm your biases.

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.880
This is all by way of
introducing a topic

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.940
that I think we're familiar
with, which is that there's

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.170
a lot of downsides to openness.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:46.500
The free speech assumptions
behind the Open Internet

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.930
Initiative were the old
free speach assumptions

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.680
that don't really apply when
every speaker has access

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.940
to a platform and can speak,
and that speakers can coordinate

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:02.820
and send out successfully
harmful information

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.250
or misinformation
in a way that drowns

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.460
out what some might think
is more legitimate speech.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:15.450
So I think the most ironic thing
about how the open internet--

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.540
the openness agenda has
been upended is Clinton

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:22.710
gave her speech in
2010, and it was

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.630
directed overtly at
authoritarian countries.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.360
Russia, at the time,
was complaining.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.890
China, at the time,
was complaining.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.350
Part of their platform and
the Shanghai Cooperation

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:34.801
Organization is
that nations should

00:27:34.801 --> 00:27:36.300
have sovereignty
over their borders,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.370
and other nations
shouldn't meddle.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:39.930
And Clinton's
speech was basically

00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:41.429
about how we're
going to be meddling

00:27:41.429 --> 00:27:44.220
in authoritarian networks
to help bring openness

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.930
to those networks.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:49.645
And let me say that China
and Russia view that--

00:27:49.645 --> 00:27:50.520
I'm not defending it.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.870
I'm explaining it.

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:53.580
They view that
about the same way

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.670
that we view their Russian
meddling in our election.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.390
And frankly, it
is the same thing,

00:27:58.390 --> 00:28:01.840
except that they are
meddling in a democracy,

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.530
and we're meddling in
an authoritarian state.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.430
And that might be-- it
is different normatively.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:10.470
But from their perspective
it's exactly the same thing.

00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:15.300
And Putin was sure, and he
said so, there were protests.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.757
After the 2011 legislative
elections in Russia,

00:28:18.757 --> 00:28:19.590
there were protests.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:23.220
He explicitly blamed Hillary
Clinton for basically

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:26.205
organizing-- her State
Department for organizing and--

00:28:28.687 --> 00:28:30.770
basically organizing and
coordinating the protests

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.814
and helping them get started
and giving money for them.

00:28:33.814 --> 00:28:35.230
And frankly, the
United States has

00:28:35.230 --> 00:28:37.040
a history of meddling
in Russian elections.

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.330
President Clinton's
administration

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:44.080
intervened in a lot of ways in
the election of Putin-- excuse

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.580
me, of Boris Yeltsin in 1995.

00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:49.380
And his assistant, Vladimir
Putin, was watching.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:51.010
The United States
has long interfered

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:55.870
in foreign elections, as has
the Soviet Union and Russia.

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:57.864
So anyway, this Open
Internet Initiative,

00:28:57.864 --> 00:28:59.780
which was supposed to
bring freedom to Russia,

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:02.271
basically is what
happened to us.

00:29:02.271 --> 00:29:04.270
We said we were going to
meddle in your networks

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:07.300
to bring freedom, and they
meddled in our networks.

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.940
And it turns out that
Putin won, and it turns out

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:14.760
that openness is on the
defense, when he basically

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:21.360
combined a very simple
phishing operation and taking

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.390
advantage of our open media
and uncontrolled media.

00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:28.592
And that's all it was, and it
had a devastating impact on--

00:29:28.592 --> 00:29:30.550
who knows if it had an
impact on the election--

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:32.970
but certainly in the
confidence of our institutions.

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:34.855
So the very-- not
the very tactics,

00:29:34.855 --> 00:29:36.600
but close to the
very tactics we said

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.890
that we were going to use
to bring freedom to Russia,

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:44.220
they basically used to
us to call into question

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:48.110
the legitimacy of
our electoral system.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.830
Last slide, these
are predictions.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.690
And they are very
long-term predictions.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.481
And I'm just starting
to think about these.

00:29:54.481 --> 00:29:58.230
But I basically think that
what the United States,

00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:59.080
its approach--

00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.920
I'm not talking about companies.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.350
I'm talking about
the government.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.320
Its approach towards these
issues is unsustainable.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.270
I imagine that
companies like Google

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.570
will muddle through and
accept the $2.1 billion fine

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:14.280
and what I take to be a tweak to
their advertising and move on.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.400
I don't know what the
limit is to Europe.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:19.770
Europe is just going after
big American IT firms

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:21.567
like crazy now.

00:30:21.567 --> 00:30:22.650
I don't know the limit is.

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:24.300
I think the limiting
factor is what

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.880
the consumers in Europe, whom
I think like American products,

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.870
will put up with.

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:31.950
But for now, the European
Union, along the dimensions

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:35.490
I mentioned, sees US companies
as a big, giant target,

00:30:35.490 --> 00:30:37.196
and they're going after them.

00:30:37.196 --> 00:30:38.820
I imagine that the
Googles of the world

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:39.986
will be able to handle that.

00:30:39.986 --> 00:30:41.370
I don't know where that will go.

00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:45.250
But I think we'll
muddle through on that.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.400
And when it comes to
the Chinas of the world,

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.466
it's been clear for a long
time American companies that

00:30:50.466 --> 00:30:51.840
want to do business
in China will

00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:53.967
have to do business in
China on China's terms.

00:30:53.967 --> 00:30:56.050
And the US government is
not going to change that.

00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:58.633
And I think American companies
that want to do business there,

00:30:58.633 --> 00:31:02.160
they have been complying with
China's increasing demands

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:04.620
for access to
proprietary information,

00:31:04.620 --> 00:31:06.120
for cooperation
with the government,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:08.310
for cooperation with
local firms and the like.

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.520
So we'll muddle-- you,
the Googles of the world,

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.000
will muddle through with
those foreign regulations,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.342
using the tools they can
to try to deal with them.

00:31:18.342 --> 00:31:20.550
I think that the Internet
Freedom Agenda is certainly

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.299
dead with the Donald
Trump administration.

00:31:22.299 --> 00:31:24.057
Nobody's talking about that.

00:31:24.057 --> 00:31:25.390
No one seems to care about that.

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:30.340
But I think the very idea of the
United States bringing openness

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:33.880
to these countries is dead.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.160
I don't think it's
a viable strategy,

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:38.170
and I don't think it
will ever be achieved.

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:40.270
Maybe it will be part of
our rhetorical strategy,

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:42.280
but I think it's dead.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:46.070
This is another big topic.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.550
But I really want to
emphasize that what

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:50.770
we see as these
terrible intrusions

00:31:50.770 --> 00:31:55.210
into our electoral system
and into our networks

00:31:55.210 --> 00:31:58.870
by the Russians hacking
into the DNC, hacking

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:01.330
into electoral
systems, it's widely

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:04.200
viewed by the rest of the
world that this is what we do.

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.450
And along different
dimensions, it is what we do.

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:09.690
We're in other nations' networks
in a very aggressive way.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:11.160
We use military
tools aggressively.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:13.200
Stuxnet is the best example.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:16.060
The Snowden revelations were a
shock to the rest of the world

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.100
and to people in
this country as well.

00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.820
And I think that the
United States never

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:24.134
has a chance of getting
relief from these type of very

00:32:24.134 --> 00:32:26.550
aggressive intrusions by other
countries that are going on

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:27.300
in many dimensions--

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.050
I didn't talk about
them much-- until it's

00:32:29.050 --> 00:32:31.540
willing to put
something on the table.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.820
What are you going to give up?

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.190
I mean, is the United
States willing to pledge

00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:36.889
that meddle in
Russian elections,

00:32:36.889 --> 00:32:39.180
the way it was alleged to
have done in 2011 and the way

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.086
it did in 1995, in exchange for
Russia not doing that for us?

00:32:43.086 --> 00:32:44.960
I'm not even sure that's
a possible deal that

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:45.543
could be made.

00:32:45.543 --> 00:32:48.460
But is it even something the
United States would consider?

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.670
Would we consider pulling
back on the use of some

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:56.457
of our offensive cyber
exploitation and attack tools

00:32:56.457 --> 00:32:58.290
in exchange for relief
from other countries?

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.790
I predict that we're going to
have to face that possibility,

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.157
even though no one's no
one's talking about it now.

00:33:03.157 --> 00:33:04.740
And I think that
there's going to be--

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.160
and, again, this is
very big picture,

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:07.840
and I certainly don't
know the details,

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.310
but we're going to have to
rethink openness at home.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.230
There's going to be
a lot of pressure

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:16.170
on the Googles of the
world, and especially social

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.320
media platforms,
to bring control

00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:21.450
over so-called fake news.

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:22.866
That's a very difficult task.

00:33:22.866 --> 00:33:24.240
And the attempt
to do so is going

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.760
to burden a lot of
legitimate speech.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:29.115
And I think we're only
beginning to get on that path,

00:33:29.115 --> 00:33:31.330
and we haven't figured
out what that looks like.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:34.230
But there's going to be a
rethinking of freedom of speech

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:39.450
in this country due to what
the downsides of open speech

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.810
on these networks is.

00:33:40.810 --> 00:33:42.470
So those are my predictions.

00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:45.670
And if you have any questions,
I would love to take them.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.880
AUDIENCE: So you made a
series of predictions.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.360
What prescriptions
might you make?

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.120
Like, that's
something we will do.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.432
What you think we
actually should do?

00:33:53.432 --> 00:33:54.640
JACK GOLDSMITH: That's tough.

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.973
I tried not to say anything
in the whole talk about what

00:33:56.973 --> 00:33:58.980
we should do because
it's just very tough.

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:06.010
I think that something like
each of these three things

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:08.560
should happen, will
have to happen,

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.005
and they probably should
happen in reaction

00:34:11.005 --> 00:34:11.880
to the changed world.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:12.880
But I really don't know.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.349
So even if the Internet
Freedom Agenda doesn't work,

00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:22.929
does that mean we should stop
supporting dissidents abroad

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.489
who are trying to achieve
freedom in those countries,

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:26.110
trying to circumvent control?

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:27.300
I don't think that.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.681
But if there's a relationship
between our support for that

00:34:30.681 --> 00:34:32.139
and this terrible
predicament we're

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.597
in with our electoral system
and with other things going on

00:34:34.597 --> 00:34:37.150
in this country, then I think
it does need to be rethought.

00:34:37.150 --> 00:34:40.929
The same about very aggressive
use by the National Security

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.120
Agency of its cyber tools.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.949
If there's is a
relationship between, and I

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:48.310
believe there is, our very
aggressive use of those tools

00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:50.290
abroad and what's
happening to us at home,

00:34:50.290 --> 00:34:54.250
I think we need to rethink that,
if we can tamp down on that.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:55.750
And there's definitely
going to be--

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:59.292
we're in the middle of
rethinking about what kind

00:34:59.292 --> 00:35:01.750
of speech we appreciate and
how we're going to regulate it.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.520
And I know that's
going to happen.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.450
I don't know that
should look like, sorry.

00:35:06.450 --> 00:35:08.160
AUDIENCE: We have a
question from Zurich.

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.970
How do you see the role of
multinational corporations?

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:12.780
What are the points
of collaboration

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.000
between governments
and corporations

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.060
for promoting political,
social, and economic openness?

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:21.340
And who should be
taking the lead?

00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:23.189
JACK GOLDSMITH: That's
a tough question.

00:35:23.189 --> 00:35:25.230
So I don't know how this
person is communicating.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.146
I'll try to answer it.

00:35:26.146 --> 00:35:28.380
And he or she may
want to follow up.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:30.810
So my view about this
is pretty simple.

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:33.730
Each company decide for
itself what its values

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:37.080
are consistent with what
the law of the United States

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.195
permits it to do.

00:35:38.195 --> 00:35:39.570
There are a lot
of companies that

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:42.890
are exporting tools that are
facilitating oppression abroad.

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.610
That's not illegal.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:46.440
A lot of it is not illegal.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.637
So companies have
different values.

00:35:48.637 --> 00:35:50.220
And they have to
decide for themselves

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:53.190
and their shareholders
what they want to do.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.670
Governments-- so I
will just say this.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:58.200
I think I can answer
the question this way.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:02.280
Governments will impose
order on corporations

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:06.360
within their borders to the
extent that they want to.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.210
The only question is
whether the US government

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:13.230
should take a stand about the
extent to which US corporations

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:15.570
can be doing business,
say, in China or Iran

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:16.860
or something like that.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:19.091
And to date, we do
have laws about that.

00:36:19.091 --> 00:36:20.340
They're called sanctions laws.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.740
You can't do business
in some nations.

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.870
I ultimately think--
my very simplistic view

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.180
is that corporations
should be able to do

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:29.460
what they want to do
consistent with their values

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.470
and whatever they're
trying to maximize,

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:34.540
consistent with the law,
anywhere in the world.

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.005
And if the US
government, which is

00:36:36.005 --> 00:36:38.130
where these corporations
are, wants to change that,

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.647
then there needs to be
a law that's passed.

00:36:40.647 --> 00:36:41.230
And that's it.

00:36:41.230 --> 00:36:46.630
And actually, I hesitate very
much to have the US government

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:49.180
intervene in places like
China to tell companies what

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:51.300
they can and can't do there.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.539
For a whole host of reasons
I think that's a bad idea.

00:36:54.539 --> 00:36:56.830
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
what you think the United

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:59.806
States will do or should do.

00:36:59.806 --> 00:37:01.180
But we, at this
point, don't seem

00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:04.160
to have a good idea of what
our conception of open networks

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:04.660
are?

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.826
Like there's an ongoing
debate about net neutrality.

00:37:06.826 --> 00:37:09.190
There's stuff about the NSA.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:11.560
Is it possible for
us to do anything?

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.420
I mean, I guess
doing something, that

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.850
means that the Rob Joyces
and Hillary Clintons

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.430
world and Googles of the world
get together and figure things

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:18.929
out.

00:37:18.929 --> 00:37:21.190
is that a possible way forward?

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:23.110
Or do we need an
open conversation?

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.610
And if we need an
open conversation,

00:37:24.610 --> 00:37:26.380
how do we do that,
when in the past,

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:29.410
the way that things have seemed
to been done with things like--

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.350
The NSA essentially came out
of secret Bush administration

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:32.950
programs.

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:35.740
The Open Internet Agenda was
an Obama administration thing

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.110
that they just sort of wanted
to do, without a whole lot

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:40.030
of public discussion around it.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:43.360
So how do we avoid that the next
time around, especially given

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.177
the state of
current US politics?

00:37:45.177 --> 00:37:46.760
JACK GOLDSMITH: OK,
hold on to the mic

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.530
because I have a
question for you.

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.040
I don't really understand
what the question is.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:49.590
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:51.756
JACK GOLDSMITH: So I
understand everything you said.

00:37:51.756 --> 00:37:53.760
But could you-- let
me just say one thing

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.593
and then you can tell
me about the question.

00:37:55.593 --> 00:37:57.382
So the Open Internet
Initiative, when

00:37:57.382 --> 00:37:58.840
I started thinking
about this, it's

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.642
actually hard to pin
down what that means.

00:38:01.642 --> 00:38:03.100
It means a lot of
different things,

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.475
and different
people-- and I gave

00:38:04.475 --> 00:38:06.310
a list that was basically
the general list

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:08.380
that I was able to
discern from her speech

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:09.950
and from other things.

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.200
And it's basically free
trade in digital goods.

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.740
I mean, that's basically
what it is, both domestically

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.150
and internationally.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.934
So with that background,
could you just

00:38:18.934 --> 00:38:20.600
give me a short version
of the question?

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:23.100
Because I didn't really follow
what you wanted me to answer.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so how do we--

00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.900
do so do we need an open
conversation about what

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:32.350
the United States should or can
do within the United States?

00:38:32.350 --> 00:38:35.620
Do we need to agree about what
our conception of the US role

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:37.150
in the internet is ?

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:40.090
And two, how do
we do that, given

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:44.020
that in previous iterations of
this problem, when the United

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.460
States has taken a stance
on these sorts of things,

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:49.780
whether it's regarding the
NSA or sort of open internet

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:54.610
of things, that seemed to have
been small groups of people

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:57.190
in various policy communities
essentially saying,

00:38:57.190 --> 00:38:59.710
we're going to do this, and
either doing it secretly

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:01.990
or doing it without
sort of public mandate.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:05.100
The Obama administration
did not have open internet

00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:07.570
as a major sort of
plank of their platform.

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.950
Obviously they talked about it.

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:10.620
JACK GOLDSMITH: You
mean Trump or Obama?

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.286
AUDIENCE: Obama.

00:39:11.286 --> 00:39:12.239
JACK GOLDSMITH: OK.

00:39:12.239 --> 00:39:14.530
AUDIENCE: President Obama,
when people say, why did you

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.360
vote for him, I'm not sure
that open internet was

00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.490
the first thing on
their mind, right?

00:39:17.490 --> 00:39:19.000
There's not sort
of a public mandate

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.439
for him to go off and start
imposing open internet

00:39:21.439 --> 00:39:22.480
on the rest of the world.

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:23.090
JACK GOLDSMITH: I agree.

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.300
So let me just say
a couple of things,

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:26.091
and I think this will
answer your question.

00:39:26.091 --> 00:39:29.740
The first one is, yes,
unless we as a country

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.785
have a coherent conception--

00:39:32.785 --> 00:39:34.410
I'm talking about
the government level.

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:37.400
I mean, firms have
different motives,

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.397
and it's hard for the
government to coerce them

00:39:39.397 --> 00:39:41.480
and their business abroad
for reasons I just said.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.312
It doesn't happen that much.

00:39:43.312 --> 00:39:45.020
But let's just talk
about the government.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:47.600
The government needs to
have a coherent conception

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:49.280
about what it's doing and why.

00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:51.470
I don't see actually
that much of a difference

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:53.314
across administrations.

00:39:53.314 --> 00:39:55.730
The only thing Hillary Clinton
really added in that speech

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:58.580
to what Bill Clinton
was saying in the 1990s

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.040
was this idea that we're
going to subsidize and pay

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.410
for these--

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:04.100
and that might not
even have been new--

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:07.250
these tools to help people
circumvent control abroad.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.620
And the NSA stuff, yes,
that started with Bush,

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.880
but it continued
right through Obama.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.512
And so there's
actually continuity

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:15.470
across administrations.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:17.303
I don't know about the
Trump administration.

00:40:17.303 --> 00:40:20.240
Where I don't think we have
had the right conversation,

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.949
I think this answer's
your question, is--

00:40:21.949 --> 00:40:23.364
and I've talked
to a lot of people

00:40:23.364 --> 00:40:25.160
in the government about
this, and they just

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.990
shrug like, what are
you talking about?

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:28.531
We haven't had a
conversation between

00:40:28.531 --> 00:40:32.810
the open internet freedom
people and the national security

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:33.980
people.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:38.600
And those are-- you can't
be promoting, in my opinion,

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.590
openness abroad, and you
can't be promoting freedom

00:40:42.590 --> 00:40:44.600
on the net, if you are,
in effect, undermining

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.587
those networks and
exploiting them,

00:40:46.587 --> 00:40:48.670
especially if part of the
reason you're doing that

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.300
is to achieve political
ends in those countries.

00:40:51.300 --> 00:40:53.330
So that is what I see as
the fundamental tension

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:55.220
within the US government,
that the US government doesn't

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.178
see at all, because it's
just a gigantic thing.

00:40:57.178 --> 00:40:59.360
And they can have these
two different agendas.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:02.720
And the Snowden revelations
caused that hypocrisy

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.500
to get noticed.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.797
But it didn't cause
it to change at all.

00:41:05.797 --> 00:41:07.880
And that's where the
conversation needs to be had,

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:09.750
and that's a very hard
conversation to have.

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:13.310
And it hasn't happened yet.

00:41:13.310 --> 00:41:15.860
That's the point that we need
to figure out our priorities,

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.220
I think.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.136
Does that makes sense?

00:41:17.136 --> 00:41:18.290
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:20.331
AUDIENCE: Given what you
said about the increased

00:41:20.331 --> 00:41:22.430
domestic surveillance
since 9/11, and even

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:26.330
the recent Department Justice
subpoena of Facebook activists'

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:28.070
user information,
do you think we're

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.325
trending towards greater
authoritarian control

00:41:30.325 --> 00:41:31.950
on the part of
the US government?

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:33.950
JACK GOLDSMITH: I wouldn't
call it authoritarian

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:36.080
control because it's all
democratically sanctioned

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:36.920
in some extent.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:38.774
And it's governed
by the rule of law.

00:41:38.774 --> 00:41:40.190
We could have a
debate about that.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.580
But I firmly believe it's
governed by the rule of law.

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:47.300
But, yes, we have
increasing, I would

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:50.630
say, national security
control of our networks

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.450
since 9/11 through
a variety of means.

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:56.464
And there's no doubt about that.

00:41:56.464 --> 00:41:57.630
There's no doubt about that.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:00.220
And I don't see that
turning back any time.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.272
And, in fact, here's
another prediction

00:42:02.272 --> 00:42:04.480
I don't really want to
defend, but I'll just make it.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.452
I think that the
cybersecurity imperative is--

00:42:07.452 --> 00:42:08.910
I'm not saying this
is a good idea.

00:42:08.910 --> 00:42:10.420
But I think the
cybersecurity imperative

00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:11.620
is going to lead the
government to be more

00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.240
involved in domestic networks.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:17.290
So I think that the combination
of the 9/11 anti-terrorism

00:42:17.290 --> 00:42:19.692
imperative and the
cybersecurity imperative,

00:42:19.692 --> 00:42:20.650
that those two things--

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:22.180
I wouldn't call it
authoritarian because I

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.221
think it will happen
pursuant to the rule of law.

00:42:24.221 --> 00:42:27.160
But it's definitely not
pro-civil liberties.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:31.130
And I do think that trend will
continue, and I don't see it--

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:33.910
the 702 is up for
re-authorization,

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.490
and there might be some
narrowing of it a little bit.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:39.080
But fundamentally I think that
program will stay in place.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:45.160
And I really do think that
the cybersecurity problems are

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.620
going to require, I don't know
how and I don't know when,

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.630
but the government to be much
more involved in networks.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:50.780
So is that an answer
to your question?

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:51.700
I think it is.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.180
AUDIENCE: What do you mean by,
quote, "European governments

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:57.400
have had more success
than the US government

00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.182
when it comes imposing back
doors to private companies?"

00:43:00.182 --> 00:43:01.390
Do you have examples in mind?

00:43:01.390 --> 00:43:01.940
JACK GOLDSMITH: I do.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:03.130
I don't have the
legislation before me,

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:04.387
and I didn't quite say that.

00:43:04.387 --> 00:43:05.720
I was careful about what I said.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.820
I said that they're
further along

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:10.510
in accepting the idea that
we're going to have to have

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:11.920
compromises on encryption.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.170
There've been legislation
proposed and, in some cases,

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:15.317
been passed.

00:43:15.317 --> 00:43:16.900
I'm happy if the
person wants to email

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.941
me to send them the data
and decent papers on it.

00:43:18.941 --> 00:43:21.250
I don't have the details
on the tip of my tongue.

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:23.140
But they're much
further along on that.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:27.910
And they seem to be more
willing to accept that,

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:30.880
especially for
anti-terrorism reasons.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:34.990
And the prediction is that if
that comes to fruition, then

00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:38.140
it's going to put pressure on
similar measures in the United

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.710
States.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.450
AUDIENCE: So I'm British.

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:43.180
And I agree with
what you're saying

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:45.800
about the US has
far more rule of law

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.660
in the way it handles things.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.720
But in this space there's
some interesting things

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.470
been going on in the
last few decades that

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:53.150
become more and more obvious.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:56.360
And I'm curious what your view
is about secret law, things

00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:01.070
like the interpretations of
the law made by certain, say,

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:02.850
Department of Justice
internal lawyers

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:05.260
or what goes on in
the FISA courts,

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:07.849
those sorts of settings,
where the law is made

00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:09.890
and interpretations of
the law are being applied,

00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:12.330
but they're not
publicly accessible,

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:14.242
which is unusual for the US.

00:44:14.242 --> 00:44:15.450
I'm curious how to take that.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:15.800
JACK GOLDSMITH: Yeah.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.510
So you probably don't
know this, but not

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:19.805
only do I have views about
it, I've done it myself.

00:44:19.805 --> 00:44:21.430
I've been a Justice
Department official

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:24.740
who interpreted law in
secret in some very highly

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.595
classified contexts.

00:44:26.595 --> 00:44:29.095
I didn't like it then, and I
don't think it's a great thing.

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:34.190
I've written papers
about this, and I'd

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:35.398
be happy to send them to you.

00:44:35.398 --> 00:44:39.440
But, in general, I think
that sometimes there

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:43.040
is a need for secret
legal interpretation, when

00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.897
exposing the legal
interpretation

00:44:44.897 --> 00:44:46.730
wouldn't make a public
legal interpretation,

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:49.277
but reveal programs
whose revelation

00:44:49.277 --> 00:44:50.735
would be damaging
to those programs

00:44:50.735 --> 00:44:53.318
and which are important to the
national security of the United

00:44:53.318 --> 00:44:53.870
States.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:55.580
So I think it's an
inevitable practice.

00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:57.380
I think it's over broad.

00:44:57.380 --> 00:45:00.860
I think that a lot more legal
interpretation that takes place

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:04.244
in secret can be disclosed.

00:45:04.244 --> 00:45:05.660
And I think it
should be disclosed

00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:06.800
and has been disclosed.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:10.070
One of the many virtues
of the Snowden revelations

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:13.040
is that the Director of National
Intelligence, the National

00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:17.770
Security Agency, and all the
national security departments

00:45:17.770 --> 00:45:23.740
and agencies have been much more
robust, not perfectly, but much

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:27.190
more robust than disclosing
much more so, thousands

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:30.580
and thousands of pages of
documents of FISA court

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.510
decisions and legal
interpretations

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:36.200
that that formerly they
never would have disclosed.

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:37.710
And I think that there's--

00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:40.210
I think there should be more
of that to the extent possible.

00:45:40.210 --> 00:45:42.702
But let me say also,
this can also be--

00:45:42.702 --> 00:45:44.410
this is going to maybe
seem paradoxical--

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:46.960
there can and should
be more transparency

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.040
inside the government.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.867
So one practice
that I found strange

00:45:50.867 --> 00:45:52.450
when I was in the
government, and I've

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:55.060
written about since I've
been of the government, is--

00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:56.650
so there is actually
a separation

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:58.480
of powers that takes
place in secret

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:01.330
in national security
inside the government.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:05.164
And it's a deformed form of
the one we usually think of,

00:46:05.164 --> 00:46:07.580
but it's a lot better than
nothing, and it's a substitute.

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:09.850
There's the executive branch,
which interprets the law

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.290
and enforces it.

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:14.510
A lot of the time it is reviewed
by the secret court, the FISA

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:15.010
court.

00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:17.470
And that is not a
rubber-stamp court.

00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:20.500
And there is reporting to the
Congressional intelligence

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.200
committees.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.230
It ebbs and flows, but
they have much more,

00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:27.670
in my opinion, a
more robust role.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:32.024
Senator Wyden has been extremely
consequential in holding

00:46:32.024 --> 00:46:33.690
the executive branch's
feet to the fire.

00:46:33.690 --> 00:46:36.350
And other members of that
committee have as well.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:37.390
So one thing that--

00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:39.514
here's the thing about
secret legal interpretation.

00:46:39.514 --> 00:46:41.680
As I say, I did it myself.

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.020
When you're in those
secret rooms making

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.350
those interpretations,
it would lead

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:51.310
to much better and more
rigorous and narrower

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:54.400
legal interpretations if
all of those interpretations

00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.690
were being shown to
other institutions.

00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:59.170
We weren't in the business
of showing them generally

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:00.680
to the congressional
intelligence committees.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:01.805
I think that should happen.

00:47:01.805 --> 00:47:02.800
It does happen more.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.502
That very act of disclosure
in secret to another body

00:47:06.502 --> 00:47:08.710
really has a disciplining
effect on the United States

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:12.460
and takes away the
inevitable-- it diminishes

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.440
the harm of the
inevitable compromise

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.960
that I think is
necessary for secret law.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.790
So that's what I'd say.

00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:22.000
I would say that the
problem is a serious one,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.950
but it's improved
since and because

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:27.190
of the Snowden revelations,
one of many things

00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:28.757
that Snowden did.

00:47:28.757 --> 00:47:31.090
I believe he caused great
harm to the national security,

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:35.824
but he also achieved
many great benefits.

00:47:35.824 --> 00:47:38.240
AUDIENCE: What is the connection
between openness, defined

00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:40.900
as free speech and information,
and information security?

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:43.890
You repeatedly say that
openness weakens security.

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:47.776
How will censorship of speech on
the internet improve security?

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.100
JACK GOLDSMITH: I didn't
say that censorship

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.940
would improve security.

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:56.900
And I'm not sure that follows.

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:01.860
So the example I had in
mind is that the kind

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:06.660
of information operation
that the Russians did,

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:09.780
that's a much more successful
operation in an open society

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:13.050
where the press is not
controlled, where people can

00:48:13.050 --> 00:48:14.640
speak and say what they want.

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.921
And it's easier to sow
division in a world in which

00:48:17.921 --> 00:48:19.920
the government is not
controlling speech and not

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.570
controlling the press than it
is in one in which they are.

00:48:22.570 --> 00:48:24.890
That's one example
I had in mind.

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:26.580
AUDIENCE: During
the past decades,

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:29.030
there have been incidents
where the authoritarian--

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:30.180
JACK GOLDSMITH: Which case?

00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:31.930
AUDIENCE: There have
been some cases where

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:38.360
the authoritarian
countries, their internet

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:41.120
control makes a spill
out of their border

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:49.340
and affecting other countries'
users of their use of internet.

00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:53.810
So my question would be
that, did US government

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:56.510
consider cooperating
with other countries

00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:04.820
or maybe authoritative agencies
of the cyberspace to push back

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.039
these kind of controls?

00:49:07.039 --> 00:49:08.830
JACK GOLDSMITH: Can
you give me an example?

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.480
AUDIENCE: For example,
I think it was maybe

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:14.840
five or six years ago when
the Chinese government used

00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:20.045
the great firewall to block the
"New York Times" and Wikipedia.

00:49:20.045 --> 00:49:21.920
JACK GOLDSMITH: Yeah,
they still do, I think.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah, of course,
but one particular method

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:26.957
was to pollute the DNS server.

00:49:26.957 --> 00:49:28.040
JACK GOLDSMITH: Oh, I see.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:33.310
And there had been incidents
where the global DNS server got

00:49:33.310 --> 00:49:34.890
polluted instead of--

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:36.265
JACK GOLDSMITH:
So in other words

00:49:36.265 --> 00:49:38.960
filtering "The York Times" and
Wikipedia, the Chinese border,

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.700
because of the
techniques they used,

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.117
caused the services to be
denigrated outside of China?

00:49:43.117 --> 00:49:43.700
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:45.290
JACK GOLDSMITH:
Yes, this happened.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:48.770
This is another example
of exporting control

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:50.320
I could have added to my list.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.320
So what is the question?

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.010
What can the United
States do about it?

00:49:54.010 --> 00:49:55.730
AUDIENCE: Did the
United States consider

00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:57.740
like cooperating
with other countries

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:04.580
or authoritative agencies of
the cyberspace to pressure,

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:09.480
let's say, China's government
to scale back such behaviors,

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:09.980
I guess?

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.510
JACK GOLDSMITH: So I don't know.

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:14.780
There are no authoritative
cybersecurity agencies.

00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.490
And that's part of the problem.

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:18.430
But I don't know about
that particular case

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:19.580
what the United States did.

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:21.350
But who is it going
to cooperate with?

00:50:21.350 --> 00:50:22.475
And what is it going to do?

00:50:22.475 --> 00:50:24.020
What are its options?

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:28.040
If the problem is bad enough,
if the extraterritorial effect

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.950
of what China is doing at
its borders is bad enough,

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:32.202
then we have a whole--

00:50:32.202 --> 00:50:34.160
it's just like any other
international dispute,

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:35.360
where China does
something that has

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.110
an adverse effect
in the United States

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:38.660
and that we do the same thing.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:42.170
There's a whole range of
tools from calling someone

00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:43.970
and yelling at them
and threatening them

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:47.690
to imposing sanctions
through retaliating in cyber

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:49.820
or retaliating outside of cyber.

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.550
There are a whole host
of tools that we have.

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:55.430
And we've got
extraordinary cyber weapons

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:56.930
that we could use.

00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:01.130
But the question is, was that
really a big enough deal?

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:02.220
Did it last long?

00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:03.260
Was it on purpose?

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:04.670
Did it go away?

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:07.370
And is the United
States really going

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:11.870
to use its tools to try to
fight back against China?

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:13.910
It's a very tricky proposition.

00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:17.076
I imagine what happened,
what usually happens is--

00:51:17.076 --> 00:51:18.450
but I don't know
about this case.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.991
I mean, I heard about it, but
I don't know how it went away--

00:51:20.991 --> 00:51:22.670
is there were some
diplomatic exchange.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:24.424
And the United States
probably made clear

00:51:24.424 --> 00:51:26.465
that it wasn't pleased
with what China was doing,

00:51:26.465 --> 00:51:30.750
and I think it doesn't
happen anymore.

00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:35.100
But the real truth is
there's not much we can do.

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:40.940
What can the United States do
if it tells Google to take down

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:44.650
data from its searches globally
to protect Europeans privacy

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:47.150
and that means that you can't
find some information that you

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:48.550
might want to get?

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:51.120
What can the United States do?

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.160
It's really Google's
decision, and Google

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.045
wants to keep doing
business, as we've

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:57.420
seen, with its compliance with
the right to be forgotten.

00:51:57.420 --> 00:51:59.128
It wants to keep doing
business in Europe

00:51:59.128 --> 00:52:01.206
because it makes a
lot of money there.

00:52:01.206 --> 00:52:03.330
And so there's not a lot
that United States can do.

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:06.930
If the problem rose to a level
where they were taking down

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:09.210
sites for a long period of
time in the United States,

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:11.580
it would elevate.

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:15.397
But it would probably be
resolved diplomatically.

00:52:15.397 --> 00:52:16.230
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:18.290
Actually, one more question.

00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:20.870
So, again, the example
would be China.

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:26.570
But the Chinese government
used the security laws--

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:30.980
I mean, I wouldn't
call it an excuse,

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:35.660
but they used security laws
to impose their control

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:37.904
over the internet.

00:52:37.904 --> 00:52:39.070
JACK GOLDSMITH: Yes, I know.

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:39.590
Correct.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:43.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
and you mentioned

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:45.620
that for the US
government, it needs

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:49.490
to improve the domestic internet
security as well, right?

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:53.510
So do you predict
that this method will

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:56.450
take a authoritarian twist?

00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:57.950
JACK GOLDSMITH: Which method?

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:04.070
AUDIENCE: Like use law
to promote security,

00:53:04.070 --> 00:53:04.820
internet security.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:05.780
JACK GOLDSMITH: In
the United States?

00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:06.230
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.770
JACK GOLDSMITH:
Yes, I mean, this

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.960
is what I predicted
15 minutes ago.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:10.430
Maybe I wasn't clear.

00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:11.330
I do think--

00:53:11.330 --> 00:53:13.370
I don't know along
what dimension,

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:15.570
and I don't know
how it'll happen.

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:18.500
But I do think that the
imperative-- you're talking

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.320
about anti-terrorism measures
that China uses as an excuse

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.967
to surveil and control the
network more aggressively.

00:53:26.967 --> 00:53:27.550
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:28.700
JACK GOLDSMITH: Yeah, in the
United States, we did that,

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:28.780
too.

00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:30.640
After 9/11, the
reaction to 9/11 was

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.980
to do more domestic collection.

00:53:32.980 --> 00:53:35.234
And so that's what
states do when

00:53:35.234 --> 00:53:37.150
they face a threat that
they don't understand,

00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:39.358
they can't control, and
they're trying to understand,

00:53:39.358 --> 00:53:41.500
and they want to get
more information.

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.080
So I think that that does
happen to some degree here,

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:46.780
not nearly to the degree
as in China, obviously.

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.510
And I also think
that, as I said,

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:52.060
that the imperative
to do something

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:54.490
to make our networks more
secure will, in some way,

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:57.930
lead the government to be more
involved in those networks.

00:53:57.930 --> 00:53:59.800
That's a pretty
vague prediction.

00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.190
And I'm confident at
that level of abstraction

00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:04.990
but not any more
concretely than that.

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:05.990
SPEAKER 1: Thank you very much.

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.630
JACK GOLDSMITH:
Thank you very much.

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:07.989
I appreciate it.

00:54:07.989 --> 00:54:09.280
Thanks for your good questions.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.779
SPEAKER 1: Thank
you for joining us.

00:54:10.779 --> 00:54:13.900
