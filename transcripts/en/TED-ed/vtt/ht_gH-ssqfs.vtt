It is, technology and all that stuff,

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:09.403
is really important,

00:00:09.403 --> 00:00:11.892
but those can be learned.

00:00:11.892 --> 00:00:13.806
I think emotional intelligence

00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:16.641
is the key differentiator in the market,

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:17.684
and I think that's true now,

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:21.677
and I think it will be even truer in 10 years.

00:00:21.677 --> 00:00:23.528
If you can communicate,

00:00:23.528 --> 00:00:25.219
if you can have humility,

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:26.969
if you can have compassion,

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:30.098
if you can make a connection with somebody

00:00:30.098 --> 00:00:32.987
in an authentic way,

00:00:32.987 --> 00:00:36.499
then I think that you will succeed.

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:39.700
And I think that's absolutely more important

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.831
than an incredible CV or resume.

00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:47.089
I just think that is vital,

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.318
if you can get along with people,

00:00:49.318 --> 00:00:53.262
because collaboration is where we are headed,

00:00:53.262 --> 00:00:55.197
or we're dead.
