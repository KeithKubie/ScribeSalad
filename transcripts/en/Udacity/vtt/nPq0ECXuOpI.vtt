00:00:00.175 --> 00:00:02.735
We need to create a contract 
for our other table

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:05.168
that contains location entries.

00:00:05.441 --> 00:00:08.229
Location entries must contain a city name.

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:13.193
This innerclass will be created 
in much the same way as weatherentry.

00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:15.375
It will implement base columns.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:19.273
Contain the table name and contain 
the names of each column.

00:00:19.273 --> 00:00:23.085
Note: the idea of each row 
in the location entry class,

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:24.972
will be stored in WeatherEntry.
