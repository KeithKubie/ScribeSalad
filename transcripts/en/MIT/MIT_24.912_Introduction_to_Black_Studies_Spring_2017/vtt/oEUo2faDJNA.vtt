00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.127
AUDIENCE: So my question
is sort of two-fold.

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:31.031
It sort of goes back on
some of the other things

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:35.068
we've discussed with
the recent elections.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:38.605
So I've recently been
following some of your stuff.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:40.340
And there's evidence
that suggests

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.245
that you sort of predicted
the rise of the Trump campaign

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:48.481
about seven years ago.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:53.186
And I'm sort of curious,
what was so different

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:55.121
about this election?

00:00:55.221 --> 00:01:00.827
I presume you've seen the rise
of many presidential candidates

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:01.828
over the years.

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:03.830
And I'm sort of
curious to understand,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.935
what sort of prompted
that speculation?

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:11.004
And the second
part of my question

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:14.774
sort of is looking more
so into the future.

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:18.878
So as we've discussed, America
is probably more polarized.

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:21.481
And it's sort of been--

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:22.949
in the past.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.151
And there's s of this
idea that the clustering

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:29.322
of like-minded Americans
is tearing us apart.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:32.759
So where do you see the
future of this nation going?

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.198
NOAM CHOMSKY:
Well, I mean, there

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:40.800
are many special factors
in the United States.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.602
Societies are different.

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:46.940
But notice that what happened
in this election, what actually

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.478
happened in the 2016 election
is that the mainstream

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:56.683
establishment institutions
were basically destroyed.

00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:00.487
The two major phenomena
in this election

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:03.790
were the Sanders campaign
among the Democrats

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.860
and the Trump campaign
among the Republicans.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.562
And they were both
anti-establishment.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:14.567
And the voters went that way.

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:17.737
If you take a look at polling
results, you can see it.

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:21.574
I mean, anger and
contempt for institutions

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.877
is just phenomenal.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:28.515
If you ask people in
polls, do you have any--

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:31.184
what do you think
about Congress?

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:35.021
You know, 90% say they
should be all thrown out.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.689
In fact, about the
only institution

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.292
that has any respect
is the military

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:42.428
because you're taught
somehow, the military

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.631
is defending us
from who knows what.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.701
And the same is true in Europe.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.272
Take a look at the French
election a couple of days ago.

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.074
The two candidates
were outsiders.

00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.945
The political parties
barely participated.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:03.950
Macron and Le Pen are from
outside the mainstream that

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.853
has run Europe for 50 years.

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:10.390
The center right and center
left parties are gone.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.193
Same thing happened in
England with Brexit.

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:16.329
Same thing's happening in
other European countries.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.799
We're seeing the phenomenon
all over the Western world

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.802
in which the centrist--

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:25.605
center left, center right--

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:28.374
institutions are under attack.

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:30.310
People are angry about them.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.344
They hate them.

00:03:31.444 --> 00:03:33.613
They think they're
not working for us.

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:35.148
And they're right.

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:39.052
That's the effect of
the neoliberal programs.

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:43.456
We're all subjected to the
same socioeconomic programs.

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:46.426
They've had a similar
effect everywhere.

00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:50.463
They've led to
stagnation, decline,

00:03:50.563 --> 00:03:56.970
undermining of public
services, inability--

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.007
Reagan's slogan, the state is
the problem, not the solution.

00:04:01.107 --> 00:04:04.911
Let's turn it over to private
tyrannies, which make it worse.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:06.412
That's happening.

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.215
Bits and pieces of that
are happening everywhere.

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:10.817
So it happened in
the United States

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:12.986
in its own particular way.

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:16.422
But notice that
it's two directions.

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:18.891
It's Sanders and Trump.

00:04:18.992 --> 00:04:20.860
And I think in
many ways, they're

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.263
appealing to the
same sentiments.

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.665
And they could even converge.

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.800
A lot of the pop--

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.170
if you look at what
people believe,

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:35.074
the policies that they favor.

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:37.010
A lot of it's shared.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.747
So for example,
across the population,

00:04:40.847 --> 00:04:43.116
all the way over
to the Tea Party,

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:47.887
people think there ought to
be higher taxes on the rich.

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:50.523
Probably a majority
of the population

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:54.227
thinks there ought to
be national health care.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:58.298
In fact, the support for
nationally guaranteed health

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:01.601
care has been so
high over the years,

00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:05.271
that sometimes it's
almost hard to believe.

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:10.376
So in the late Reagan years,
for example, about 70%

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:15.081
of the population thought that
guaranteed national health care

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:17.850
ought to be in the
Constitution because it's

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.253
such an obvious demand.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:22.855
About 40% of the population
thought it already

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.991
was in the Constitution.

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:27.060
Nobody knows what's
in the Constitution.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.229
Just everything good must
be in the Constitution.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.966
Since this is so obviously good,
it must be in the Constitution.

00:05:34.067 --> 00:05:37.370
And right at the present,
the most recent polls

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.075
show somewhat over 50%
supporting national health

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.443
care.

00:05:43.543 --> 00:05:47.480
When Obama's Affordable Care
Act was being pushed through,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.219
at first one of the proposals,
one of the parts of it,

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.822
was what was called a
public option, which

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:58.457
means you could
choose if you wanted

00:05:58.558 --> 00:06:02.595
to be part of a government
health care program.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.698
About two thirds of the
population favored that,

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:09.235
but it was just thrown
out without discussion.

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:12.138
And in fact, if you
go case by case,

00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:15.842
there's a lot of
similarity in the attitudes

00:06:15.942 --> 00:06:18.244
about social/political issues.

00:06:18.344 --> 00:06:21.614
Not necessarily cultural issues,
but social/political issues

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:24.584
among parts of the
population that appear

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:27.420
to be extremely polarized.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.755
It's very interesting.

00:06:28.855 --> 00:06:35.161
In England right now, if you
followed it, Jeremy Corbyn,

00:06:35.261 --> 00:06:36.696
who's kind of a--

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:39.432
a little bit like
Sanders, is bitterly

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:43.970
attacked by the media,
including the liberal media,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.673
like The Guardian and by the
parliamentary labor party.

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:52.178
Meaning the guys who sort of--
the elites who run the party.

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.616
They just came out with a--

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:58.651
I happened to be in England
a couple of days ago,

00:06:58.751 --> 00:07:01.120
so I was reading
the British press.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.522
They just came out with--

00:07:02.622 --> 00:07:05.024
the labor party--
with their program,

00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:07.960
which was just
lambasted by the media--

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.096
crazy, lunatic, insane.

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:12.031
It will destroy the labor party.

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:16.536
At the same time, polls
came out asking people

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:20.840
about the components
of the program.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.075
They're all very popular.

00:07:23.176 --> 00:07:26.579
Very strong support among the
population for the elements

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:27.780
of the program.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.618
But attack on the party
that's proposing them.

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:33.820
And in particular, on Corbyn.

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:41.260
Serious activism and
organizing could overcome this.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.897
I mean, you're
fighting elite elements

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:50.903
who have their own image of the
way they want society to go.

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:55.241
And in fact, there's quite a lot
of interesting things going on.

00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:59.045
A lot of it is stuff that you
guys might be interested in.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.247
It has to do with
data harvesting.

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:05.852
There's a company called
Cambridge Analytics, I think,

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:11.924
which is run by some
ultra-right billionaires.

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:14.760
Peter Thiel, the
guy who owns PayPal

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.230
and a bunch of other things.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.967
Robert Mercer, who's a
big hedge fund manager,

00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:24.003
multi-billionaire,
a couple of others.

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:25.271
What they've been doing--

00:08:25.371 --> 00:08:28.441
and this essentially gave
the election to Trump--

00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:32.378
is extremely careful
data analysis.

00:08:32.477 --> 00:08:34.881
There's a ton of data
now from Facebook

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:38.417
and other things about
people's personal preferences

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:44.757
and attitudes and feelings.

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:48.094
Are you depressed,
all kinds of things.

00:08:48.194 --> 00:08:52.965
And what they're doing is
looking carefully at this data

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:55.268
and analyzing it
to see if you can

00:08:55.368 --> 00:09:02.074
find small numbers of people
in particular areas who

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:06.412
are vulnerable to one or
another form of manipulation.

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:08.981
And what they're doing
is trying to say, look.

00:09:09.081 --> 00:09:11.551
If they kind of
tend to be liberal,

00:09:11.651 --> 00:09:14.020
try to get them to
get so disillusioned

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.721
that they won't vote.

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:18.791
And if they tend to be, say,
traditionally conservative,

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:24.130
maybe religious or whatever,
try to get them to--

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.365
reach them individually
in ways which

00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:28.901
will increase the
probability they'll

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:30.403
vote for the right wing.

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:33.639
This has small effects,
but the elections

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:37.843
are won on very small effects.

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:40.513
As you know, Trump
lost the popular vote

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:41.781
by a couple of million.

00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:45.718
But in particular counties
that made the difference,

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:49.255
a couple of 100,000 votes
shifted the election.

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.123
In England, Brexit was the same.

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:55.194
They estimate about
maybe 600,000 votes.

00:09:55.294 --> 00:09:56.862
The whole country switched.

00:09:56.963 --> 00:10:01.867
Now, these companies using a lot
of complicated data processing

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:05.171
and statistics, and so
on, are working on ways

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:08.507
to try to control the
electoral process.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.010
I mean, this is way
more important than any

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.746
of the nonsense about
the Russian hacking.

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:15.514
That's all garbage.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.017
But this stuff is real.

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:21.821
And it's right in
front of our eyes.

00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:24.223
It's the people we know.

00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:27.660
MIT students going off
to work on these things.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:31.330
And it has a big
effect on controlling

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.900
formal democratic systems.

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.235
This is Steve Bannon.

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:41.040
This is his image of how you
control the world, you know?

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.042
These are people
who are influential.

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:45.011
They have tons of money.

00:10:45.111 --> 00:10:46.379
Deeply reactionary.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:52.385
And they want to use
modern data processing.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:56.155
You know, big data, statistical
analysis, and so on,

00:10:56.255 --> 00:11:00.326
to see if you can just find
ways of swinging elections

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:04.430
by going after individual
vulnerabilities using

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:09.135
the massive data that people
provide through Google

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:12.638
and Facebook, and
all of this stuff.

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:15.975
Google and the rest of them
use it for advertisers,

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:20.813
so that advertisers can go
after you individually and say--

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:24.784
you try to get a book on Amazon
and they suggest 10 other books

00:11:24.884 --> 00:11:27.453
you ought to buy because they've
got so much information on you

00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:31.857
that they think, maybe I
can sort of sell this one.

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:33.259
That's going on all the time.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:36.095
But here, it's right in the
middle of a political system.

00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:38.564
And it's really significant.

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:43.069
Quite unlike the Russian
hacking story, this is real.

00:11:43.169 --> 00:11:45.037
And it's not very far from us.

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:46.539
In fact, it's
happening right here.

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:52.244
There are things that
can be done about that.

00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:53.946
Like exposing it for one thing.

00:11:57.049 --> 00:11:59.585
These should be live issues,
I think, amongst students.

00:11:59.685 --> 00:12:03.889
Do we want to devote our
lives to destroying democracy?

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:04.390
Maybe.
