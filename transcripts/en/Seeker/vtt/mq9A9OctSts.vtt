00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
Evolution is everywhere!

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.330
Everywhere!

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.954
All around you.

00:00:02.954 --> 00:00:06.560
It's even happening right here
in this very studio, sort of.

00:00:12.632 --> 00:00:14.090
Everyone, Laci
Green here for DNews

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.680
with a special
guest, Catie Wayne.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.505
You may recognize Catie
from Animalist News

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:21.720
or from her own channels,
Boxxybabee and ANewHopeee.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.310
Thanks for joining
me on DNews, lady.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.400
Thanks for having me.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.157
Of course.

00:00:25.157 --> 00:00:27.740
So Miss Catie Wayne, do you know
what the most common argument

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.090
I hear against evolutionists?

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.050
What?

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.200
That there's no proof for
it because you can't see it.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.270
But don't they know that it
takes hundreds of thousands

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.480
of millions of years to happen?

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.210
Apparently not.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.720
But you know what's awesome?

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.710
Not all examples
of evolution happen

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.390
outside the course
of a human life.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.020
There's some animals evolving
right before our very eyes.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.590
Yeah!

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.830
Like wild elephants naturally
selecting to have no tusks.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.260
It's pretty sad, actually.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.375
In 25 years, the wild
elephant population

00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:57.520
in both Asia and Africa has
been reduced to less than half

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.730
because of poachers.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.570
Poachers have become
such a serious threat

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.510
to their existence that the rate
of elephants born without tusks

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.790
has shot through the roof.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.020
In some parts of the world,
tusk-less elephants only

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.080
made up about 5%
of the population,

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.800
and now it's getting
close to a third.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.640
So to be clear,
natural selection

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.730
is the driving force
behind evolution.

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.290
You may have heard of the
survival of the fittest?

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.040
It's a scientific
theory that animals

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.490
best suited to survive
pass their traits on.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.190
So good traits for
survival become

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.090
more common in a species,
while bad traits, in this case

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.320
the tusks, become less common.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.320
Their bad traits get them killed
or eaten, so they die off,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.916
or perhaps none of
the animals want

00:01:32.916 --> 00:01:34.790
to mate with them because
of those bad genes.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.470
So basically, the tusks
are a greater threat

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.380
to the elephants'
survival than not

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.499
being able to dig
for food and water.

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:42.040
That's right.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.150
You ready for another
depressing example?

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.740
No, but yes.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.360
You're ready.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.240
I know you're ready.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.740
Before the Industrial
Revolution,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.929
when Britain wasn't
polluted, pale moths

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.470
were able to rest
on the pale growths

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.844
on trees, which are called
lichen, to hide from the birds

00:01:54.844 --> 00:01:55.680
and predators.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.410
Fast forward after
the industrial boom,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.680
and suddenly there's a
lot more smoke in the air,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.900
killing the lichen growths
off and causing the tree

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:02.970
bark to darken.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.950
Then the pale moths
became easy targets.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.870
Meanwhile, the dark
moths were well hidden,

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.870
so they were able to
survive and reproduce.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.510
And they eventually became
the most common moth color,

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.090
while the pale ones were rare.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.640
Boom!

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.110
The moths had evolved.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.790
Indeed.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.850
And when Britain started
reducing its pollution levels,

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.380
the pale moth started
to flourish again.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.890
Boom!

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.440
Evolving again.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.590
But you know, one of my favorite
examples of evolution in action

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.105
is actually in humans.

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.530
Oh, really?

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.210
Humans are losing
their pinky toes.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.950
Good, because I
really can't think

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.440
of a more useless
thing on my body.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.427
Well, you know, Laci, they
weren't always so useless.

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:38.510
Our whole foot used to
look more like monkey feet,

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.930
meaning they used
to look like hands.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.380
They were prehensile,
and we used

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.062
to climb trees and
stuff with them.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.270
Now that we're bipedal and
stopped doing such things,

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.978
we don't really need
the fifth appendage.

00:02:46.978 --> 00:02:48.620
We could easily get
by with just four.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.220
We don't even use the pinky
toe for balance or anything.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.040
Aren't wisdom teeth
kind of the same deal?

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.410
Yes.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.450
That's why we get them removed,
because they're so stupid

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.180
and stuff.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.840
And probably also
because our jaws

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.466
are getting a little smaller.

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:01.715
Our teeth no longer play a
vital role in our survival,

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:03.712
so they're getting selected out.

00:03:03.712 --> 00:03:06.130
And because they're
so stupid and stuff.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.745
And also that.

00:03:06.745 --> 00:03:08.370
Thanks for joining
us for DNews, folks.
