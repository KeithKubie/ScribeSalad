00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.829
I think that fundamentalists and

00:00:05.829 --> 00:00:05.839
I think that fundamentalists and
 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:08.419
I think that fundamentalists and
atheistic scientists have the same

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429
atheistic scientists have the same
 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.140
atheistic scientists have the same
problem the fundamentalists so we could

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150
problem the fundamentalists so we could
 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.759
problem the fundamentalists so we could
say the Christian fundamentalists in the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769
say the Christian fundamentalists in the
 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.470
say the Christian fundamentalists in the
US make the proposition that biblical

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
US make the proposition that biblical
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.570
US make the proposition that biblical
stories will call the mythological

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
stories will call the mythological
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.509
stories will call the mythological
stories our literal representations of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
stories our literal representations of
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.259
stories our literal representations of
the truth but and that might be true

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269
the truth but and that might be true
 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.970
the truth but and that might be true
depending on what you mean by literal

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980
depending on what you mean by literal
 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.400
depending on what you mean by literal
but what they mean by literal or what

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410
but what they mean by literal or what
 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.990
but what they mean by literal or what
they attempt to make literal mean is

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000
they attempt to make literal mean is
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.370
they attempt to make literal mean is
that they're in the same category as

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
that they're in the same category as
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.209
that they're in the same category as
scientific facts because they don't have

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219
scientific facts because they don't have
 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.840
scientific facts because they don't have
the idea that there are different ways

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850
the idea that there are different ways
 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.790
the idea that there are different ways
of approaching truth and and that truths

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800
of approaching truth and and that truths
 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.200
of approaching truth and and that truths
can serve different purposes they don't

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
can serve different purposes they don't
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.720
can serve different purposes they don't
have a sense that your definition of

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
have a sense that your definition of
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.310
have a sense that your definition of
truth is actually something like a tool

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
truth is actually something like a tool
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.830
truth is actually something like a tool
rather than an ontological statement

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
rather than an ontological statement
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.450
rather than an ontological statement
about the reality of the world and so

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
about the reality of the world and so
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.810
about the reality of the world and so
the the fundamentalists basically make

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820
the the fundamentalists basically make
 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.090
the the fundamentalists basically make
the proposition that the idea that God

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100
the proposition that the idea that God
 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.799
the proposition that the idea that God
created the world in six days five

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
created the world in six days five
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.709
created the world in six days five
thousand years ago is literally true and

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719
thousand years ago is literally true and
 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.469
thousand years ago is literally true and
they get the five thousand year estimate

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
they get the five thousand year estimate
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.090
they get the five thousand year estimate
by the way by going through the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100
by the way by going through the
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.740
by the way by going through the
genealogies in the Old Testament and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
genealogies in the Old Testament and
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450
genealogies in the Old Testament and
adding up the hypothetical ages and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460
adding up the hypothetical ages and
 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.250
adding up the hypothetical ages and
figuring out you know how long before

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260
figuring out you know how long before
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.700
figuring out you know how long before
Moses Adam lived and some Bishop did

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
Moses Adam lived and some Bishop did
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.230
Moses Adam lived and some Bishop did
that back in the I think it was in the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
that back in the I think it was in the
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.140
that back in the I think it was in the
mid 1800s I might be wrong about that

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
mid 1800s I might be wrong about that
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.550
mid 1800s I might be wrong about that
but it was somewhere back about that

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
but it was somewhere back about that
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.830
but it was somewhere back about that
time and more or less that's being

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
time and more or less that's being
 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.050
time and more or less that's being
accepted as canonical fact ever since

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
accepted as canonical fact ever since
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.719
accepted as canonical fact ever since
and then the scientists say well yeah

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
and then the scientists say well yeah
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.580
and then the scientists say well yeah
those are empirical truths they're just

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590
those are empirical truths they're just
 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.020
those are empirical truths they're just
wrong see then that's the only

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030
wrong see then that's the only
 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.219
wrong see then that's the only
difference there is between the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
difference there is between the
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.450
difference there is between the
fundamentalist and the Atheist

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
fundamentalist and the Atheist
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.399
fundamentalist and the Atheist
scientists the fundamentalist say those

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
scientists the fundamentalist say those
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.499
scientists the fundamentalist say those
are fundamental scientific truths and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
are fundamental scientific truths and
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.880
are fundamental scientific truths and
they're right and the scientists say

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890
they're right and the scientists say
 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590
they're right and the scientists say
well they're scientific truths they just

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600
well they're scientific truths they just
 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.340
well they're scientific truths they just
happen to be wrong well I think that's a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350
happen to be wrong well I think that's a
 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.920
happen to be wrong well I think that's a
stupid argument personally I mean for a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
stupid argument personally I mean for a
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.920
stupid argument personally I mean for a
bunch of reasons one is that the people

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
bunch of reasons one is that the people
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.410
bunch of reasons one is that the people
who wrote the the ancient stories that

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420
who wrote the the ancient stories that
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.709
who wrote the the ancient stories that
we have access to were in no way shape

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719
we have access to were in no way shape
 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.679
we have access to were in no way shape
or form scientists you know modern

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
or form scientists you know modern
 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.359
or form scientists you know modern
people tend to think that you think like

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
people tend to think that you think like
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.620
people tend to think that you think like
a scientist and people have always

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630
a scientist and people have always
 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.810
a scientist and people have always
thought that way first of all you do not

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
thought that way first of all you do not
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.300
thought that way first of all you do not
think like a scientist even scientists

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
think like a scientist even scientists
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.130
think like a scientist even scientists
hardly even think like scientists but if

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140
hardly even think like scientists but if
 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.930
hardly even think like scientists but if
you're not scientifically trained you

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940
you're not scientifically trained you
 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.640
you're not scientifically trained you
don't think like a scientist at all

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
don't think like a scientist at all
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.130
don't think like a scientist at all
so one of the things for example that

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140
so one of the things for example that
 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.539
so one of the things for example that
characterizes your thinking is

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549
characterizes your thinking is
 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.369
characterizes your thinking is
confirmation bias and so if you have a

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379
confirmation bias and so if you have a
 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:19.910
confirmation bias and so if you have a
theory

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
theory
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.740
theory
what you do is wander around in the

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750
what you do is wander around in the
 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.509
what you do is wander around in the
world looking for reasons why it's true

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519
world looking for reasons why it's true
 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.850
world looking for reasons why it's true
and the scientist does exactly the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860
and the scientist does exactly the
 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.890
and the scientist does exactly the
opposite of that in the little tiny

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
opposite of that in the little tiny
 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.509
opposite of that in the little tiny
narrow domain where he or she is

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519
narrow domain where he or she is
 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.610
narrow domain where he or she is
actually capable of being a scientist

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
actually capable of being a scientist
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.589
actually capable of being a scientist
and what they have is a theory and look

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599
and what they have is a theory and look
 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.780
and what they have is a theory and look
for a way to prove it wrong but believe

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790
for a way to prove it wrong but believe
 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.369
for a way to prove it wrong but believe
me you don't run around doing that

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379
me you don't run around doing that
 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.770
me you don't run around doing that
I mean you you can train yourself so now

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780
I mean you you can train yourself so now
 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.300
I mean you you can train yourself so now
and then you can do that you know you

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
and then you can do that you know you
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.680
and then you can do that you know you
can learn to listen to people for

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
can learn to listen to people for
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.690
can learn to listen to people for
example on the off chance that you might

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700
example on the off chance that you might
 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.880
example on the off chance that you might
be wrong but that is by no means a

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890
be wrong but that is by no means a
 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.420
be wrong but that is by no means a
natural way of thinking and of course

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430
natural way of thinking and of course
 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.619
natural way of thinking and of course
the the the fundamental philosophical

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:53.629
the the the fundamental philosophical
 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.900
the the the fundamental philosophical
axioms of the scientific method weren't

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910
axioms of the scientific method weren't
 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.270
axioms of the scientific method weren't
developed until Descartes and bacon and

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280
developed until Descartes and bacon and
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.670
developed until Descartes and bacon and
who else decart bacon there's one more

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680
who else decart bacon there's one more
 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.599
who else decart bacon there's one more
anyways the name escapes me at the

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609
anyways the name escapes me at the
 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.550
anyways the name escapes me at the
moment but you can argue about when

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560
moment but you can argue about when
 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.149
moment but you can argue about when
science emerged but you you it certainly

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159
science emerged but you you it certainly
 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.699
science emerged but you you it certainly
emerged in its articulated form within

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709
emerged in its articulated form within
 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.160
emerged in its articulated form within
the last thousand years I think you

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170
the last thousand years I think you
 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.930
the last thousand years I think you
could say even more specifically that it

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
could say even more specifically that it
 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.210
could say even more specifically that it
emerged in the last five hundred years

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220
emerged in the last five hundred years
 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.770
emerged in the last five hundred years
now you might argue with that and say

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780
now you might argue with that and say
 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.970
now you might argue with that and say
well what about the Greeks and other

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980
well what about the Greeks and other
 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.430
well what about the Greeks and other
people who were fairly technologically

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440
people who were fairly technologically
 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.440
people who were fairly technologically
sophisticated or who invented geometry

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450
sophisticated or who invented geometry
 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.369
sophisticated or who invented geometry
or that kind of thing but yeah yeah

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379
or that kind of thing but yeah yeah
 

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.809
or that kind of thing but yeah yeah
Bayer precursors to the idea of

Bayer precursors to the idea of

to him to actually go out in the world

to him to actually go out in the world
and look at it to see if what he assumed

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030
and look at it to see if what he assumed
 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.059
and look at it to see if what he assumed
about it was true and it certainly never

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069
about it was true and it certainly never
 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.420
about it was true and it certainly never
occurred to Aristotle to get twenty

they went about doing it compare the
 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.670
they went about doing it compare the
records and then extract out what was

records and then extract out what was
 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.939
records and then extract out what was
common and that's a that seems

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949
common and that's a that seems
 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.309

problematic for people and it's
 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.189

problematic in a real way I think

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199
problematic in a real way I think
 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:25.830
problematic in a real way I think
because one of the problems with the

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840
because one of the problems with the
 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.390
because one of the problems with the
scientific viewpoint is it doesn't tell

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400
scientific viewpoint is it doesn't tell
 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.589
scientific viewpoint is it doesn't tell
you anything about what you should do

you anything about what you should do

the problem of value at all in fact it

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360
the problem of value at all in fact it
 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.600
the problem of value at all in fact it
might make it more difficult because one

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610
might make it more difficult because one

of the fundamental scientific claims
 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.559
of the fundamental scientific claims
roughly speaking is that every fact is

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:40.569
roughly speaking is that every fact is
 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:43.260
roughly speaking is that every fact is
of an equal utility at least from a

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270
of an equal utility at least from a
 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.600
of an equal utility at least from a
scientific perspective right there's no

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610
scientific perspective right there's no
 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.269
scientific perspective right there's no
hierarchy of facts it's not exactly it's

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:48.279
hierarchy of facts it's not exactly it's
 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:50.670
hierarchy of facts it's not exactly it's
not exactly true because you can think

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680
not exactly true because you can think
 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.490
not exactly true because you can think
of one theory is more true than another

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:53.500
of one theory is more true than another
 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.100
of one theory is more true than another
but that boils down to saying that it's

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110
but that boils down to saying that it's
 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:57.959
but that boils down to saying that it's
more useful than another so I don't

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:57.969
more useful than another so I don't
 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:58.950
more useful than another so I don't
think that that's a really good

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960
think that that's a really good
 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.209
think that that's a really good
exception okay so fine you got the

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219
exception okay so fine you got the
 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:04.980
exception okay so fine you got the
scientific atheists on one end and you

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990
scientific atheists on one end and you
 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.510
scientific atheists on one end and you
got the religious fundamentalists on the

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:06.520
got the religious fundamentalists on the
 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.680
got the religious fundamentalists on the
other and what they both agree on

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:07.690
other and what they both agree on
 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.249
other and what they both agree on
whether they like it or not is that

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259
whether they like it or not is that
 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:12.719
whether they like it or not is that
there's so much power in the scientific

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729
there's so much power in the scientific
 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.249
there's so much power in the scientific
method that it's difficult to dispute

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259
method that it's difficult to dispute
 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:15.930
method that it's difficult to dispute
the validity of scientific facts and

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940
the validity of scientific facts and
 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.439
the validity of scientific facts and
they seem to exist in contradiction to

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:18.449
they seem to exist in contradiction to
 

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:22.499
they seem to exist in contradiction to
the older archaic stories if you also

00:06:22.499 --> 00:06:22.509
the older archaic stories if you also
 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:25.369
the older archaic stories if you also
accept them as fast fact-based accounts

00:06:25.369 --> 00:06:25.379
accept them as fast fact-based accounts
 

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:28.050
accept them as fast fact-based accounts
so what do we do about that well if

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060
so what do we do about that well if
 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.820
so what do we do about that well if
you're on the scientific atheist end of

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:29.830
you're on the scientific atheist end of
 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.950
you're on the scientific atheist end of
things you say well those old stories

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960
things you say well those old stories
 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.330
things you say well those old stories
are just superstitious science

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340
are just superstitious science

second-rate barbaric archaic forms of

second-rate barbaric archaic forms of
 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.519
second-rate barbaric archaic forms of

they're nothing but trouble and if there

they're nothing but trouble and if there

you say well we'll try to shoehorn

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790
you say well we'll try to shoehorn
 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.020
you say well we'll try to shoehorn
science into this framework and really

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030
science into this framework and really
 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.370
science into this framework and really
that doesn't work very well it doesn't

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:47.380
that doesn't work very well it doesn't
 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.600
that doesn't work very well it doesn't
work very well with the claims of

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:48.610
work very well with the claims of
 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.370
work very well with the claims of
evolution for example in fact it works

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:50.380
evolution for example in fact it works
 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.700
evolution for example in fact it works
very badly and that's a problem because

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:52.710
very badly and that's a problem because
 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.290
very badly and that's a problem because
evolutionary theory is like it's a

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300
evolutionary theory is like it's a
 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.840
evolutionary theory is like it's a
killer theory and that's really it's

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850
killer theory and that's really it's
 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.450
killer theory and that's really it's
it's it's really really hard and like

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:00.460
it's it's really really hard and like
 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.770
it's it's really really hard and like
it's not a complete theory and there's

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780
it's not a complete theory and there's
 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.850
it's not a complete theory and there's
lots of things we don't know about

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860
lots of things we don't know about
 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:08.640
lots of things we don't know about
evolution but you know trying to win

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.650
evolution but you know trying to win
 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.930
evolution but you know trying to win
hand-wave that way

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940
hand-wave that way
 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.640
hand-wave that way
that's that's not going to work without

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650
that's that's not going to work without
 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.750
that's that's not going to work without
dispensing with most of biology so so

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760
dispensing with most of biology so so
 

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.570
dispensing with most of biology so so
that's a big problem so here's another

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:18.580
that's a big problem so here's another
 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.930
that's a big problem so here's another
way of thinking about it you don't just

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:21.940
way of thinking about it you don't just
 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.200
way of thinking about it you don't just
need one way of looking at the world

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.210
need one way of looking at the world
 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.490
need one way of looking at the world
maybe you need two ways of looking at

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:26.500
maybe you need two ways of looking at
 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.080
maybe you need two ways of looking at
the world and I'm not exactly sure how

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.090
the world and I'm not exactly sure how
 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:30.930
the world and I'm not exactly sure how
they should be related to one another

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:30.940
they should be related to one another
 

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.030
they should be related to one another
like which should take precedence under

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:33.040
like which should take precedence under
 

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.660
like which should take precedence under
which circumstance but one problem is

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:35.670
which circumstance but one problem is
 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.240
which circumstance but one problem is
what's the world made of you know what's

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.250
what's the world made of you know what's
 

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.070
what's the world made of you know what's
the world conceptualized as an objective

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.080
the world conceptualized as an objective
 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:45.120
the world conceptualized as an objective
place made of another is how should you

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.130
place made of another is how should you
 

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.120
place made of another is how should you
conduct yourself while you're alive and

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.130
conduct yourself while you're alive and
 

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.500
conduct yourself while you're alive and
there's no reason to assume that those

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:49.510
there's no reason to assume that those
 

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.580
there's no reason to assume that those
questions can be answered using the same

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:53.590
questions can be answered using the same
 

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:54.300
questions can be answered using the same
approach

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:54.310
approach
 

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:59.310
approach
I mean physics has its methods and

00:07:59.310 --> 00:07:59.320
I mean physics has its methods and
 

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.050
I mean physics has its methods and
chemistry has its methods and biology

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:01.060
chemistry has its methods and biology
 

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.010
chemistry has its methods and biology
has its methods so a method for

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020
has its methods so a method for
 

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.960
has its methods so a method for
obtaining the truth can be bound to a

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:06.970
obtaining the truth can be bound to a
 

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.270
obtaining the truth can be bound to a
domain so why would we necessarily

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280
domain so why would we necessarily
 

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:11.760
domain so why would we necessarily
assume that you could use the same set

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:11.770
assume that you could use the same set
 

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.160
assume that you could use the same set
of tools to represent the world as a

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:14.170
of tools to represent the world as a
 

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.900
of tools to represent the world as a
place of objects and to represent it as

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:15.910
place of objects and to represent it as
 

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.940
place of objects and to represent it as
a place in which a biological creature

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:17.950
a place in which a biological creature
 

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:18.810
a place in which a biological creature
would act

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:18.820
would act
 

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.600
would act
I mean anyways I'm suggesting that we

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:23.610
I mean anyways I'm suggesting that we
 

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:26.760
I mean anyways I'm suggesting that we
that we don't view it that way that we

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:26.770
that we don't view it that way that we
 

00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:30.000
that we don't view it that way that we
have two different viewpoints maybe they

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.010
have two different viewpoints maybe they
 

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.410
have two different viewpoints maybe they
can be brought together although it's

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:31.420
can be brought together although it's
 

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.140
can be brought together although it's
not obvious how but that it's not a

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:34.150
not obvious how but that it's not a
 

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.480
not obvious how but that it's not a
tenable solution to get rid of one in

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:36.490
tenable solution to get rid of one in
 

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.029
tenable solution to get rid of one in
favor of the other and I think the

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039
favor of the other and I think the
 

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:43.950
favor of the other and I think the
reason for that is that you need to know

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:43.960
reason for that is that you need to know
 

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.960
reason for that is that you need to know
how to conduct yourself in the world you

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:45.970
how to conduct yourself in the world you
 

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.180
how to conduct yourself in the world you
have to have a value system you can't

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:48.190
have to have a value system you can't
 

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.740
have to have a value system you can't
even look at the damn world without a

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:49.750
even look at the damn world without a
 

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.920
even look at the damn world without a
value system it's not possible your

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:52.930
value system it's not possible your
 

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:54.900
value system it's not possible your
emotional health is dependent on a value

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:54.910
emotional health is dependent on a value
 

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.490
emotional health is dependent on a value
system the way you interact with other

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.080

people is dependent on a value system

there's no getting away from it and you

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.240
there's no getting away from it and you
 

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.360
there's no getting away from it and you
say well there's no justification for

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:03.370
say well there's no justification for
 

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.920
say well there's no justification for
any value system from a scientific

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:04.930
any value system from a scientific
 

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.480
any value system from a scientific
perspective you're gonna draw that

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:06.490
perspective you're gonna draw that
 

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.880
perspective you're gonna draw that
conclusion that no value system is valid

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:08.890
conclusion that no value system is valid
 

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:10.260

where the hell does that leave you

where the hell does that leave you

there's no down there's no up there's no

there's no down there's no up there's no

there's not even really any rationale

there's not even really any rationale

like that well why why the hell should I

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:21.130
like that well why why the hell should I

who's gonna know the difference it's

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800
who's gonna know the difference it's
 

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:28.050
who's gonna know the difference it's
like yeah yeah true stupid but true and

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:28.060
like yeah yeah true stupid but true and
 

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.060
like yeah yeah true stupid but true and
the reason I think it's stupid is

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:30.070
the reason I think it's stupid is
 

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.400
the reason I think it's stupid is

well seems like the wrong frame of

like to me you know because at some

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:53.590
like to me you know because at some
 

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.380
like to me you know because at some
point you question the damn frame of

and it certainly seems to me that

and it certainly seems to me that
situations like that don't allow you to

situations like that don't allow you to
use that kind of frame of reference

use that kind of frame of reference

use that kind of frame of reference
there's something inhumane about it and

there's something inhumane about it and

there's something inhumane about it and
that trumps the logic or at least it

that trumps the logic or at least it

that trumps the logic or at least it
should and if it doesn't then all hell
