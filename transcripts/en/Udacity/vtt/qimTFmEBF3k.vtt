00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Is this data exactly linear without any deviation from linearity,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
approximately linear--that is can you see a linear trend, or at the other extreme

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
are height and weight pretty much unrelated--that is you can't really see

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a dependance between height and weight?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I know there are other possibilities here but I just want to narrow it down

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to these three possibilities to derive a very crisp and clear answer.
