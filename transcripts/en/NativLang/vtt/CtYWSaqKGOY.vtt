Solloway at their own mess. That's Latin for hello world.

2
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.330
This is Jessica from comp Trump. We're borrowing her right now.

3
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:11.580
She's off wondering if AI is breeding humans,

4
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:14.190
the code behind matchmaking apps and other fun stuff,

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.790
but native Lang and comp job are teaming up and heading to youtube to film a

6
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:21.420
short series about the amazing ways code and language overlap and get mixed

7
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.970
together. The history of computer translation,

8
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.690
like passwords aren't real words anymore. She has some cool things to show us.

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.680
We're also giving her a chance to share a personal note about being a female

10
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:32.514
programmer,

11
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.390
so please enjoy these extra linguistic insights from our visiting coder before

12
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:38.190
we get back to our regular programming.

13
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.950
It'll be hard work and I'm grateful to have her here.

14
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.390
We hope you'll catch the videos,

15
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:45.840
particularly if you're a fan of computational linguistics or programming

16
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:48.990
languages. See you in just a couple of Fridays. Until then,

17
00:00:48.991 --> 00:00:51.060
stay tuned and subscribe for language.
