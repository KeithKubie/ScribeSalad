00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.290
Summer is coming to an end, so it’s time
to stop enjoying all those barbecues, and

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.320
start worrying about cancer!

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.990
Hello extra crispy colonels, Trace here for
DNews.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.200
We all hate it when our food gets burnt.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.400
I know I’ve flipped over more than one table
at a fancy restaurant because my Brussels

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.650
sprouts weren't just overcooked -- but BURNT.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:22.650
BURNT, Jessie.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:23.990
I'm still bitter about it.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.579
But as it turns out, my seemingly excessive
displays of disgust are more reasonable than

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:29.869
it might seem.

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.390
Besides tasting and smelling absolutely awful,
research has shown that burnt and overcooked

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.640
food might actually cause cancer.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.640
Your Mom was right.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.640
Sort of.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.960
Although studies on dietary consumption of
burnt food won't directly say “you will

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.030
get cancer if you eat that blackened wing”,
the risk is still there.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.340
See, in 2002 scientists at Stockholm University
found that starchy foods, like French fries

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.420
or garlic bread, developed acrylamide after
being heated to 120 degrees Celsius.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.640
The chemical is produced by a reaction between
asparagine, a non-essential amino acid, and

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.710
certain sugars like fructose.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.460
This chemical was not found in unheated foods,
or those that had been boiled and unable to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.680
reach the necessary temperature.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.000
So, it’s not only burnt foods, but pretty
much all starchy foods exposed to high enough

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.390
heat, including well-done, fried, and baked.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.280
Now, you might be inclined to think that getting
cancer from burning food to a crisp would

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.840
work in the same way as getting cancer from
smoking.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.890
And you’re sort of right.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.270
That’s because the cancer risk stems from
the chemical acrylamide, and acrylamide is

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.890
also found in cigarette smoke.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.770
So, pat yourselves on the back for being on
the money.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.689
In studies where acrylamide was given to lab
rats in their drinking water, it caused tumors

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.880
in the lungs, thyroid, adrenal glands, and
testicles.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.950
[eesh] It also seemingly caused mutations
in mouse sperm DNA that can then be passed

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.950
onto their offspring.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.590
So not only does it give animals cancer, but
it also hurts their babies.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.410
In humans, the acrylamide irritates skin and
is believed to be a tumor initiator, but the

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.100
link to cancer isn't as hard and fast.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.530
In studies where it actually caused cancer
in rats and mice, those animals were being

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.000
fed doses roughly 1,000 to 10,000 times higher
than what could possibly be found in a burnt

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.179
batch of French fries or a crispy burger.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.090
Nonetheless, acrylamide is classified as a
Group 2A carcinogen by the International Agency

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.879
for Research on Cancer, meaning it probably
causes cancer in humans, but not conclusively.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:24.180
In 2010, Harvard researchers found an increased
risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer in

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.060
women who didn't smoke, but did eat foods
with lots of acrylamide.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.019
And, a meta-analysis from 2015 found that
dietary acrylamide might be related to kidney

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.019
cancer.

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.870
Still, and again, there is no conclusive evidence
that acrylamide is responsible for any of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.970
the most common cancers, like breast cancer.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.769
So, since there’s no direct proof, you can
just limit your intake of well-cooked foods

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.819
and you’ll be fine right?

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:48.819
Wrong.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.280
See, cooked and burnt foods can still give
you cancer even if you don’t eat them!

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.010
BECAUSE OF SECOND-HAND SMOKE.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.010
Not really.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.010
But kinda!

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.129
When you cook food over an open flame, especially
muscle meats like beef, pork, fish, or poultry,

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.159
the drippy-byproducts fall into the fire,
producing two types of chemicals: polycyclic

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.519
aromatic hydrocarbons -- PAHs -- and heterocyclic
amines.

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.270
As you cook, those two chemical groups both
become airborne, or volatile, and are also

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.090
considered “mutagenic”, which is not a
word you want associated with standing near

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.400
an open barbeque pit.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.180
A mutagen is something that causes changes
in your DNA, and it can lead to an increased

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.409
risk of cancer.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.970
PAHs have been correlated with skin, lung,
bladder, liver, and stomach cancer in animal

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:34.970
testing.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.420
And prostate, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers
have been associated with eating burnt, or

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.900
nearly burnt meats, which The National Cancer
Institute ties to these chemical groups.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.189
Now look, this all sounds pretty scary.

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.910
But remember, the studies are just pointing
out these chemicals exist in the world, and

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.420
cause cancers sometimes.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.030
They're relatively inconclusive.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.900
Although there is some correlation between
eating well-cooked meat, or starchy foods

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.590
cooked at high temperatures and certain types
of cancers, it is nowhere near as clear as

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.489
the link between, say, cigarettes and lung
cancer, or sun exposure and skin cancer.

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.780
You can be guaranteed research is still ongoing
in this area.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.959
Just moderate your intake of these risky foods,
and you should be okay.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.260
Plus, less mammal meat is better for you and
the environment anyway -- just don't grill

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.630
your veggies...

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.470
Cancer-free quinoa, here I come!

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.510
It's not just grilled foods and starches,
there is another indication that everyone's

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.510
favorite belly meat -- BACON.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.980
YES BACON -- might be killing you.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.610
In fact, processed meats in general were named
cancer-causers… but what IS a processed

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.610
meat?

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:41.650
I looked into it last year, and it was fascinating!

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.170
Check it out.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:05:01.280
What do you think is the best way to cook
meat?
