00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.030
All of this kind of induces a tree,
right?

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.200
You start in some state, there
are several actions you could take,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.500
which gets you to another set of states,
and so on and so forth.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.335
And this tree really, really,
really, really kind of builds up.

00:00:12.335 --> 00:00:14.480
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And you have a whole bunch,

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.440
in fact, a hyper exponential number,
of possible stories.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.710
Well, if I have a probability
distribution for

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.960
all partial trajectories,
then it turns out that

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.580
whatever state I happen to be in
right now, let's say this one,

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.860
I don't actually have to care
about any of the rest of the tree.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.640
It doesn't matter because
I can't get there.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.480
See as you pointed out, it's cyclical.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.890
So, even though I can get from
one plot point to another,

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.110
I can't see a sequence that
doesn't involve going this way.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.220
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.730
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right,
but underneath that node,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.800
there's still an awful
lot of other nodes.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.960
&gt;&gt; But if I have a probability
distribution for all of the next

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.450
states I could get to, then I
simply have to execute the action.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.500
And then I will end up in
one of these states, and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.440
when I do, it doesn't matter
what the other ones were.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.310
And so all that's ever happening
is that I am following

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.030
one particular path down the tree.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.670
&gt;&gt; And how do we get from that target
distribution that kind of specifies

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.970
the goal, to a target distribution over
all the intermediate nodes of the tree.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.380
&gt;&gt; Right, that's the hard part.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.730
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; But it turns out there are easy

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.780
answers to it.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.580
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I'm just not going to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.320
tell you what they are.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.730
&gt;&gt; Cool and have you used this for
actually making stories?

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we actually done this for
making stories and

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.350
actually shown that you
can get people to feel

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.780
satisfied in their stories or
experiences that they're having.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.520
And you can do it in real-time,

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.910
on the fly and and I'll just leave
you with this little teaser.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.864
It involves using Kubrick live or
diversions.

00:01:46.864 --> 00:01:50.405
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Is not exactly
the most exciting teaser.

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:52.426
I thought you we're going to say
something about wolves again.

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:54.190
&gt;&gt; Well in the end that's all a wolf is.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.676
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I would love to talk about it, but

00:01:57.676 --> 00:02:00.190
I think it's probably beyond
the scope of the class.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.150
But we'll put in the resources link
a series of papers that talk about this.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.229
But the real answer is that, any time
you're trying to match probability

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.680
distributions, you care
about KL divergence.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.810
And KL divergence is just a bunch
of sums of probabilities, and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.940
sums mean linear independence.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.900
Independence means I can
do them in any order.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.450
So I can basically just ignore all the
things that I don't actually see, and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.880
I only ever see a finite and
not just finite but

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.380
linear in the number of plot
points at any given time.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.540
And the hard part is as you recognize
is figuring out what probability

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.950
distributions are for
the intermediate node.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.510
I mean that can be very hard because it
can require computing the whole hyper

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.750
exponential tree.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.640
Or can be very easy if you have
a nice function that can map

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.530
partial trajectories into probabilities
or some other kind of value.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.270
&gt;&gt; Cool, okay.
