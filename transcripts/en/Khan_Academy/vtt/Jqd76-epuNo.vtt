00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.606
- [Voiceover] So I'm here with Amy Jarich,

00:00:01.606 --> 00:00:02.978
who's the Director of Admissions

00:00:02.978 --> 00:00:05.150
at the University of
California at Berkeley.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.126
And my question to you is when you imagine

00:00:08.126 --> 00:00:10.405
college admissions,
there's traditional notion

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:12.968
of you get a GPA.

00:00:14.036 --> 00:00:15.875
You have to take certain
classes and all of these

00:00:15.875 --> 00:00:18.772
to be "qualified."

00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:21.970
Is that always the case, or
is there a path for students

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.967
who might not have a traditional GPA

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:26.912
or might not have all
the traditional classes?

00:00:26.912 --> 00:00:28.409
- So I would say

00:00:29.455 --> 00:00:30.969
particularly in selective admissions,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.409
our job is not so much to
focus on the admit rate

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:36.923
and what those numbers
look like when you look

00:00:36.923 --> 00:00:39.937
at the incoming profile,
much more to think

00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:42.398
about who's a student who's
gonna graduate successfully

00:00:42.398 --> 00:00:43.906
from our institution.

00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:46.307
And I think if we're doing our job well,

00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:49.281
we're finding those students,
and it means that to keep up

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:52.340
with the ways students learn
today, we have to look beyond

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.623
those traditional measures,
so we do look past GPAs.

00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:58.253
We look beyond test scores.

00:00:59.272 --> 00:01:01.752
In terms of the tools that we use,

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:04.817
we probably haven't tapped
into the very best ones

00:01:04.817 --> 00:01:08.832
available yet, but we
do read their writing.

00:01:08.832 --> 00:01:12.502
We look to see what extra
curriculars they're a part of.

00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:14.991
There's never going to
be a personal statement

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:18.669
or an essay that trumps
the academic work though.

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:22.480
Really it's thinking about
academically, are you prepared

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.253
for a classroom like the one at Berkeley

00:01:25.253 --> 00:01:27.701
or the one at Virginia or
the one at Stanford, right,

00:01:27.701 --> 00:01:30.422
to make sure that you'll
succeed when you're there?

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:32.973
I think for us we really
have started to see students

00:01:32.973 --> 00:01:35.508
who are branching out and
learning in different ways.

00:01:36.547 --> 00:01:38.430
And they're leading us, right.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.867
We're having to figure
out the ways to evaluate,

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:44.477
and we don't have a
whole lot of experience.

00:01:44.477 --> 00:01:45.759
We certainly have

00:01:46.823 --> 00:01:48.835
a whole group of schools in the Northeast

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:51.402
that are some of our
oldest secondary schools,

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:55.138
who haven't given a letter
grade, and that's fine.

00:01:55.138 --> 00:01:57.103
We work with those, we always have.

00:01:57.103 --> 00:01:58.617
We've worked with homeschool students

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:01.292
who typically bring us a different kind

00:02:01.292 --> 00:02:05.008
of high school record, so we're learning.

00:02:05.015 --> 00:02:07.369
But I do think that the process

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.361
of changing secondary education is slowly

00:02:11.361 --> 00:02:13.221
also changing what we look at

00:02:13.227 --> 00:02:15.790
and how we evaluate for success

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.249
once you get onto our campus.

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:19.969
- [Voiceover] You mentioned
academics are very important,

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:21.415
and I completely understand that,

00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:24.101
but how would you evaluate
someone's academic potential

00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:26.303
if they don't have a traditional GPA?

00:02:26.303 --> 00:02:29.314
- So a lot of what we're gonna
rely on the school to provide

00:02:29.314 --> 00:02:33.558
is something that articulates
in words or numbers,

00:02:33.558 --> 00:02:35.527
letters, whatever it is,

00:02:35.527 --> 00:02:39.827
the type of environment
the student is learning in,

00:02:39.836 --> 00:02:43.618
what the core mastery is supposed to be,

00:02:43.618 --> 00:02:47.793
and then just helping us
understand the evaluation scale

00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:51.079
and where does the student
fall on that scale.

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.257
And I think sometimes that could be

00:02:53.257 --> 00:02:55.099
in the form of a paragraph.

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.873
Sometimes it may be in
the form of a chart.

00:03:00.728 --> 00:03:02.259
What we do now is

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:06.258
we read within context,
so it's not crazy to think

00:03:06.258 --> 00:03:09.722
that we have to investigate
the way a school teaches

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:12.392
before we can make the
very best decisions about

00:03:12.392 --> 00:03:14.762
how the learns in that school.

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:16.515
And that's something

00:03:16.515 --> 00:03:18.592
that's our responsibility to do.

00:03:18.602 --> 00:03:20.813
We're not in the business of building

00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:23.101
secondary school curriculums, right.

00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:26.619
We just need to learn what
type of curriculum you have

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.880
and how it's articulated to us in terms

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.168
of the measurement of success.

00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:34.089
- [Voiceover] So you
all take a closer look

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.429
or as much context as you can
have on that particular school

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:39.354
that might be in some ways nontraditional.

00:03:39.354 --> 00:03:42.116
And then there's also things
like standardized tests.

00:03:42.126 --> 00:03:45.424
- Sure, so we have standardized tests.

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:48.078
Not all universities and colleges that use

00:03:48.078 --> 00:03:51.145
selective admissions look for
standardized tests anymore,

00:03:51.145 --> 00:03:53.239
but most still do.

00:03:54.371 --> 00:03:58.185
In most cases, they're simply
validating something else

00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:00.661
we see in the application though.

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:04.137
For most schools, they're
not the decision maker.

00:04:04.137 --> 00:04:05.868
They're showing us that,

00:04:05.868 --> 00:04:07.724
"Oh look, this student is strong in math.

00:04:07.724 --> 00:04:08.919
"Let's look at the SAT.

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.065
"Yup, turns out they're strong

00:04:10.065 --> 00:04:11.061
(interviewer laughs)
"in math."

00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:12.769
Right, there's no big surprise.

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.998
Every once in a while there's a gap,

00:04:14.998 --> 00:04:18.511
and that sometimes leads to
really good conversations

00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:21.857
in our own environment
about why that happens.

00:04:21.857 --> 00:04:23.152
Is it test prep?

00:04:23.157 --> 00:04:25.630
Is it test anxiety?

00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:29.605
We have a provost at Berkeley
who's worked quite strongly

00:04:29.605 --> 00:04:33.615
in talking about the stereotype
threats and the whole idea

00:04:33.615 --> 00:04:36.480
that when you walk into a
space, someone has already

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.072
prejudged the way you behave.

00:04:38.072 --> 00:04:39.961
And standardized test is usually

00:04:41.031 --> 00:04:43.401
the lab they use to show that,

00:04:43.401 --> 00:04:46.180
so we talk about that when there's a gap,

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.135
but usually standardized tests
just validates what we see

00:04:50.138 --> 00:04:53.597
elsewhere in that academic
profile of the student.

00:04:53.597 --> 00:04:54.619
- [Voiceover] And there these notions

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:56.470
of approved curricular.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.468
Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:04:57.468 --> 00:05:00.171
Especially here in California,
I think there's something

00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:02.132
to the effect of A to B, or there's some A

00:05:02.132 --> 00:05:03.215
to some type of,
- [Amy] G.

00:05:03.215 --> 00:05:04.808
- [Voiceover] A to G, A to G.

00:05:04.808 --> 00:05:05.886
What are those things,

00:05:05.886 --> 00:05:08.890
and how strictly are those enforced

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.284
that you have to somehow align to that?

00:05:11.284 --> 00:05:15.657
- Sure so the university
system in California is really

00:05:15.657 --> 00:05:18.591
aligned, and it's been aligned
through the master plan

00:05:18.591 --> 00:05:22.581
that was developed in the 60s
to be able to allow students

00:05:22.581 --> 00:05:26.387
to build a path and stay in California,

00:05:26.387 --> 00:05:28.857
starting in the secondary
school and moving up.

00:05:28.857 --> 00:05:32.829
So the UC system, as the
most selective public school

00:05:32.829 --> 00:05:35.907
system in the state,
is looking to make sure

00:05:35.907 --> 00:05:39.267
that the curriculum in the high school is

00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:44.002
allowing the student to get the best prep.

00:05:44.002 --> 00:05:47.129
To do that, the UC system for years

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:48.686
has actually evaluated

00:05:48.686 --> 00:05:50.086
the curriculum of a high school.

00:05:50.086 --> 00:05:52.734
So a high school, if they
come up with a new course,

00:05:52.734 --> 00:05:56.207
they need to submit it to the
UC system to get approval.

00:05:56.207 --> 00:05:58.683
And then when the application
is being filled out

00:05:58.683 --> 00:06:02.145
by the student, they'll see
that course is UC approved.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.231
Do we admit students from
schools that don't have

00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:07.422
UC-approved coursework?

00:06:07.422 --> 00:06:08.675
Absolutely.

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.764
Think about all of the
out-of-state students

00:06:10.764 --> 00:06:12.454
that are applying, none of them have

00:06:12.454 --> 00:06:14.251
UC-approved coursework, right.

00:06:14.251 --> 00:06:16.513
So we are certainly thinking outside

00:06:16.513 --> 00:06:19.592
of that A through G box, but
we use the A through G language

00:06:19.592 --> 00:06:23.473
to help people understand
what the college prep path

00:06:23.473 --> 00:06:25.290
in California looks like.

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.199
And the only way we can
make sure it's consistent

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.858
is having a system that
evaluates each course.

00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:34.491
A bit like standardized testing, right,

00:06:34.491 --> 00:06:36.988
there's something about it
that feels standardized,

00:06:36.988 --> 00:06:40.201
so that you can trust
it a little bit more.

00:06:40.211 --> 00:06:41.426
- [Voiceover] Yeah.

00:06:41.427 --> 00:06:43.611
And you have, as you
mentioned, it could be

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.519
out-of-state students who
obviously weren't participating

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:48.786
in the A to G requirements,
and some of those might

00:06:48.786 --> 00:06:50.031
even be nontraditional.

00:06:50.031 --> 00:06:51.135
Might not have
- [Amy] Right, of course.

00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:52.157
- [Voiceover] a traditional GPA.

00:06:52.157 --> 00:06:53.516
- Yeah.

00:06:53.516 --> 00:06:56.478
And we also see a lot of students now.

00:06:57.488 --> 00:07:00.154
One of the hardest questions,
particularly for students

00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:01.976
out of state, I think
right now, when they think

00:07:01.976 --> 00:07:04.755
about A through G, it includes art.

00:07:05.812 --> 00:07:09.121
So if you're a student who
is incredibly interested

00:07:09.121 --> 00:07:12.364
in being admitted to one of
Berkeley's STEM programs,

00:07:12.364 --> 00:07:14.921
particularly engineering,
you have the opportunity

00:07:14.921 --> 00:07:18.563
to take a second year of
physics at an advanced level

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.668
or complete the A through G requirements

00:07:20.668 --> 00:07:24.030
by taking art, what am I supposed to say?

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.756
I want you to take the physics, right.

00:07:25.756 --> 00:07:27.869
I want you to have that background.

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:29.769
I believe in art, course I do.

00:07:29.769 --> 00:07:32.293
I know why it's a part of A through G,

00:07:32.293 --> 00:07:34.014
but for that student's development

00:07:34.014 --> 00:07:36.498
and that student's interest,

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:40.019
that A through G equation
just doesn't fit.

00:07:42.602 --> 00:07:45.165
As we adjust to see what
students are learning

00:07:45.165 --> 00:07:48.909
and how they're learning
and what are the topics

00:07:48.909 --> 00:07:52.879
that are most interesting
to them, we're just evolving

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:54.994
in the admissions process
to be able to meet them

00:07:54.994 --> 00:07:56.756
where they are.

00:07:56.766 --> 00:07:59.268
And I'll be honest, we're
little bit behind, right.

00:07:59.268 --> 00:08:02.758
There plenty of schools
that challenge us with

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:04.943
the way that they teach

00:08:04.943 --> 00:08:05.956
or what they're teaching.

00:08:05.956 --> 00:08:07.926
But when those students come to our campus

00:08:07.926 --> 00:08:10.820
as admitted students, and
they choose to attend,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.202
they're the ones who go to faculty hours.

00:08:13.202 --> 00:08:16.120
They're the ones who understand the value

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.872
of having lab time and
doing hands-on activities

00:08:19.872 --> 00:08:23.286
and research, and I think
that's a really important part

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:24.717
of the college experience.

00:08:24.717 --> 00:08:27.452
They don't have to
spend quite as much time

00:08:28.485 --> 00:08:30.935
building up that confidence
level in whether or not

00:08:30.935 --> 00:08:32.552
they should go to talk to the teacher

00:08:32.552 --> 00:08:34.707
or whether or not they

00:08:34.707 --> 00:08:38.469
could possibly participate
in hands-on learning.

00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:39.780
- [Voiceover] Yeah and
so your general sense,

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.228
and obviously it's hard to
make overbroad statements.

00:08:43.228 --> 00:08:47.302
But a student, nontraditional
school or background,

00:08:47.302 --> 00:08:49.280
maybe doesn't have traditional GPA,

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:51.717
but they're able to show that
their academic capabilities,

00:08:51.717 --> 00:08:53.765
maybe it's through standardized
tests or they take some

00:08:53.765 --> 00:08:56.915
other types of exams, they
can show that they are

00:08:56.915 --> 00:08:59.192
of the caliber that you all would expect,

00:08:59.192 --> 00:09:01.028
so that they could come
and do well at a place

00:09:01.028 --> 00:09:03.384
like Berkeley, and they
also show other things.

00:09:03.384 --> 00:09:05.112
They made cool projects, or they have

00:09:06.242 --> 00:09:08.693
really great portfolios of work.

00:09:08.693 --> 00:09:10.895
That's something that you
all take a serious look at.

00:09:10.895 --> 00:09:11.893
- Yeah.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.643
Through our process, we
actually ask the student

00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:16.718
to articulate that.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.121
So in their personal
statement, they might talk

00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:22.441
about an internship that
they had and why it mattered,

00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:24.083
what they did.

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:27.166
Other schools actually might
have a letter of recommendation

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:29.988
process or a portfolio review process

00:09:29.988 --> 00:09:33.547
where they'll look at the
things that were developed,

00:09:33.547 --> 00:09:35.391
or they'll hear the voice of the person

00:09:35.391 --> 00:09:39.538
who was this individual's
supervisor or mentor.

00:09:39.538 --> 00:09:43.951
And I think that's an
important piece of any type of

00:09:45.095 --> 00:09:48.740
less than traditional model because

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.686
relying on a student

00:09:50.686 --> 00:09:53.411
who has only known that model

00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:56.671
to explain everything that's unique

00:09:56.671 --> 00:09:58.391
and cool about it doesn't make

00:09:58.391 --> 00:09:59.772
a lot of sense, right.

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:01.942
You need someone from
the outside perspective

00:10:01.942 --> 00:10:05.845
to be able to compare and
contrast to maybe the way

00:10:05.845 --> 00:10:09.225
that they were educated and understanding

00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:12.789
that student's story is very
different and very powerful

00:10:12.789 --> 00:10:14.277
in a modern way.

00:10:14.277 --> 00:10:15.637
- Yeah, well thank you so much.

00:10:15.637 --> 00:10:17.376
This is really valuable.
- [Amy] Yeah, of course!

00:10:17.376 --> 00:10:19.485
(laughter)
Happy to help.
