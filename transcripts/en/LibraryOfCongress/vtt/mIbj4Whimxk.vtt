00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.660
&gt;&gt; Well, good afternoon and
welcome to The Library of Congress.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.960
I'm John Cole.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.200 position:56%
I'm the Director of the Center for
the Book in the Library of Congress,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.090
which is the part of the
library that promotes books,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.910
reading, literacy, and libraries.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.750
We do it through both
promotion activities,

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.050 position:56%
but also we encourage research and
study about the importance of books,

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.040
reading, literacy, and
libraries in our culture.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.160
And we operate primarily not only
through programs such as this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.800
at the library, which is our
Books and Beyond speaker series

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.890
of new books by authors
who have used Library

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.190
of Congress collections, but we
also have two national networks.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.020
There are affiliates in each state,
which promote largely state writers

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.540
but also develop projects
that relate

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.930
to book fairs and book festivals.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.960
And often where libraries are
the homes, they collect databases

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.300
about the writers of the state.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.500
And our second network consists
of nonprofit organizations

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.210
that are interested in
promoting books and literacy.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.870
And it's through that network that
we have a couple of big projects.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.750 position:56%
One is The Library of Congress
Literacy Awards, which are supported

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.030
by generous benefactor,
David Rubenstein.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.440
And secondly, through both the
partners and the state affiliates,

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.310
we have a major role in the
library's national book festival.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.460
How many people here have
been to the book festival?

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.060
I hope you LC employees
all have been.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.830
Some of you may not have been.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.500
This year's festival will be

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.390
in the Washington Convention
Center on September 24th.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.320
And we will have around 120
different writers representing

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.240
different fields who will speak
and also have book signings.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.240
And it's a wonderful
one-day event that also,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.600
since it's moved off the mall

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.100
into the Convention Center,
we have new facilities.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.880
We have air conditioning.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.020
We have beautiful bathrooms.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.860
Some of the other things that
were noted that weren't quite

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.680
up to what they might
have been on the mall,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.190
even though it was a great
patriotic experience to be

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.750
on the mall for 13 years.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.110 position:56%
But now we have moved permanently
to the Washington Convention Center.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.390
The Books and Beyond program
not only features that books

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.780
that are often books or research
materials from The Library

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.810
of Congress, but they're also
cosponsored by those divisions

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.810
that have helped make
these books possible.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.750
And in this case, we
have to cosponsors.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.230
One is the manuscript
division, and you'll hear more

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.140
about the manuscript
collections from our speaker.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.740
And the second is the Daniel
A.P. Murray Association,

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.730
and we're grateful for their
help and support as well.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.160
One of my other halves
is a historian

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.030
of The Library of Congress.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.360
And one of the early joys I
had in studying the library,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.190
when it was first in the Capitol,
was learning about Daniel Murray

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.410
and his strong association with
the Library of the Congress

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.620
and importance in the library's
history as a bibliographer

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.500
and as an associate librarian.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.070
So it's entirely appropriate that
we have both the Murray association

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.400
and the manuscript division.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.270
All of our programs in the Books
and Beyond series are filmed

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.950
for the Library of Congress,
Center for the Book Webcasts

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.960
and will be available later.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.290
And for that reason, I ask you to
turn off all things electronic.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.440
The plan of action will be
to introduce our speaker.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.380
You will learn much about
Richard Durham and his career

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.640
and our author's perspective.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:31.290
We also will have a question and
answer period towards the end

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:38.720 position:56%
of the talk and a book signing which
must start by 1:00, about 1:00 here,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.130
to keep with the Library of
Congress's program and schedule.

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.010
So welcome to talk about
our speaker and a little bit

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.200
about our manuscript collections.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.780
I'm pleased to introduce
Adrienne Cannon

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.740
who is a manuscript historian,
who came to The Library

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.040
of Congress, she told me, in 1996.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.650 position:56%
I talked to her a little bit
earlier because I was reviewing some

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.410
of our webcasts and I found
a couple where Adrienne

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.890
and I had done this trick
before, where she had talked

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:18.020
about the collections and we were
able to get an author here to talk

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.030
about an interesting subject
and an interesting collection.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.080
But let me introduce
Adrienne for our introduction.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.510
Adrienne. Let's give her a round.

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.030
[ Applause ]

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:34.820
&gt;&gt; Thank you, John,
and good afternoon.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.190
It is my pleasure to
introduce Sonja D. Williams,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.660
who will discuss her new
biography, Word Warrior;

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.900
Richard Durham, Radio and Freedom.

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.480
Chicago based Richard Durham was
the most successful black writer

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.840
on radio during the 1930s and '40s.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.170
He created the groundbreaking
radio series Destination Freedom,

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.000
which dramatized the lives
of black history makers

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.250
in a variety of fields.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.730
It aired on NBC station
WMAQ from 1948 to 1950.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.280
Durham later worked in
television as a lead writer

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.970
for the acclaimed PBS series
Bird of the Iron Feather.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:28.880
He served as editor of a
Nation of Islam newspaper,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.470
While Hammett Speaks, and
an investigative reporter

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.570
for the Chicago Defender.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:39.770
In 1975 he wrote Mohammed
Ali's biography;

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.260
The Greatest, My Own Story.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.290
His career also included stints as
a labor union writer and organizer,

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.100
and speech writer advisor
for Harold Washington,

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.820
Chicago's first black mayor.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.070
Durham was posthumously inducted

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.090
into the National Radio
Hall of Fame in 2007.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.060
The Root.com selected
Word Warrior as one

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:10.260
of its top 10 nonfiction
books of 2015.

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:15.320
Will Haygood, a former reporter
for The Washington Post and author

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:20.400 position:56%
of The Butler, A Witness to History,
and a new acclaimed biography

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.550
on Thurgood Marshall, wrote, quote,
"The enigmatic life of writer

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.750
and radio dramatist Richard
Durham has for many years cried

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.040
out for probing and understanding.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.170
Sonja D. Williams has answered
the call with this fiercely smart

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:41.290
and important book," unquote.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:49.280
Jabari Asim, editor of the NAACP's
Crisis magazine noted, quote,

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.720
"Sonja Williams exhaustively
researched biography

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.170
of Richard Durham sheds light

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:59.340
on an inexcusably neglected
historical figure.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:05.070 position:56%
Throughout his many lives, including
activism, writing, and broadcasting,

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.350
Durham demonstrated the
importance of narrative

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.700
in the struggle for justice.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.870
As Williams proves, the right to
tell the story is a critical part

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.040
of the quest for equality
and freedom.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:26.510 position:56%
And those who fought for that right
should be remembered with gratitude.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:30.330 position:56%
Ms. Williams conducted some of her
research in the manuscript division,

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:35.360
which is home of approximately 63
million primary source documents

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.600
of American History and Culture
spanning the Colonial Period

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.060
to the present.

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.040
She examined the US Word

Studies Project Files,

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.510
and the Illinois State
Study Project Files.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:09:01.400
She also conducted research in the
J. Fred McDonald archives housed

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.740
in the American Folk Life Center.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:09.310

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.550
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:22.850
How's everyone?

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:24.150
&gt;&gt; Good, thank you.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.450
&gt;&gt; I see some familiar
faces and some new faces.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:26.750
So welcome.

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.330
Thank you so much for coming.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:29.640
And since it's so gray outside,

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.170
I hope that this presentation
brings some sunshine into the room.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.020
I always kind of ask this.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:40.460
How many people have
heard of Richard Durham?

00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:46.870
Okay, three hands,
four hands, a half.

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.500
Okay. I was like you 20 years ago.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.280
You know, when I first heard about
Durham, I'm like Richard who?

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.580
You mean Richard Wright?

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.130
No. No, Richard Durham.

00:10:56.130 --> 00:10:59.240
And he was a phenomenal writer.

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.540
He really was.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:06.660 position:56%
What I wanted to do before I get
into a lot of details about his life

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.950
and his accomplishments, and also
what I was able to gather here

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.740
at The Library of Congress, as you
all know this is a great resource.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:15.190
And I live just down the street.

00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:21.010 position:56%
So many times it was a question of
do I live here or am I in Northeast?

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.700
So I would sometimes walk here.

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.380
I swim right down the street
at one of the city pools here.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.350 position:56%
And I would leave the pool, go get
something to eat, and then come here

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.080
and spend the rest of the day here.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.140
And folks would say, well,
where were you today?

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:39.060
And I say, well, you
know, Library of Congress.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:42.450 position:56%
And it was really, really simulating

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.140
and exciting the more
that I found out.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.830
So what I wanted to
do is to start off,

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.200
is kind of hopefully let you hear
some of the things that excited me

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.730
when I first got into this project.

00:11:54.730 --> 00:12:00.210
And I got into it because, as
was mentioned, I was able to work

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:04.370
on a Smithsonian series
that was called Black Radio,

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.670
Telling it Like it Was.

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:10.540
It was a 13-part series for
public radio that aired in 1996.

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:13.520
So it aired nationwide, and then
it was repeated several other

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.820
years later.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:17.650
But it looked at the
history of Blacks and radio.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:21.200
And two of my colleagues at
Howard University said, well,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.440
if you're going to look at the
role or the existence of Blacks

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:30.220
on radio during the 1930s and '40s,
you have to include Richard Durham

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.260
and you have to include a series
called Destination Freedom,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.080
which I had never heard of.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.420
And when I heard the tapes,
thank goodness the tapes existed,

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.740
and J. Fred McDonald who
was just mentioned in terms

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:49.550
of his collection now being housed
here in The Library Congress.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:53.630
J. Fred McDonald was able to save
those tapes because they were

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:56.040
at Northwestern University
and they were getting ready

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.340
to throw them out.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:58.640
Said what is this?

00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.940
We don't really need this.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.240
We need space.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.540
So we're going to throw these out.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.030
And he said no, you can't do that.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.330
I'll take them.

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.530
And they are now part of
his archive of collection.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.870
So I was able to hear the tapes.

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.380
And I was just blown
away by the lyricism,

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.100
the storytelling, the
drama, the comedy.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:23.460
So what you're seeing here on
the screen is an advertisement

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.320
for Destination of Freedom.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:32.440
Destination Freedom aired from
June 1948 through August 1950,

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.740
and it was pretty unique.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.970
If you think about it, in the
'40s, '30s, but definitely even

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:42.150
through the '40s, if you
heard Black voices on radio,

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.320
inevitably they were
stereotypical voices.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.800
They were servants.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:47.210
They were maids.

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.250
They were comic relief.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.140
They were stereotypes.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:55.640
What Durham said, as a
boy growing up in Chicago,

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.020
his family was part of
the great migration.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.660
And I'll get into that
a little bit later.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.860
But he said, no, in my neighborhood
I know that there are doctors

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:08.480
and lawyers, and educators and
really dignified African-Americans

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.780
who have accomplished a lot.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.850
So what he wanted to do in
the series was to amplify

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.940
and dramatize those stories.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:22.020
So what I want to do is
play one segment of one

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:25.070
of his shows from the series.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:29.700
This is Denmark Vesey or a
statute of Denmark Vesey.

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:33.980 position:56%
And one of the shows in the series
looked at the life of Denmark Vesey.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:39.650
If you know his story, he
was in 1822 a free slave.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.950
He freed himself, actually.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:46.150
And he led one of the
largest revolts,

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:50.320
although it was pretty much
squashed before it took off.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:54.890
But in 1822, he organized
about 9,000 African-Americans

00:14:54.890 --> 00:14:59.100
to free themselves from slavery
in Charleston, South Carolina.

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.500
By the way, Vesey was also the
founder or one of the co-founders

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.570
of Emanuel AME Church, the church
which unfortunately just, you know,

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:09.870
had their tragic situation

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.840
of the nine parishioners
being killed last summer.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.590
So what I want to do
is play this segment.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:22.330
This is from the beginning
of this episode

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:27.510
where Vesey took part
in a lottery, a gamble.

00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:33.010
And he was able to win
like $4,000 in this gamble.

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:34.890
So what does he decide?

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:39.030
He decides he's going to use
that money to free himself.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.560
&gt;&gt; How much am I worth?

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.860
Master, how much am I worth?

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.160
Ach!

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.460
&gt;&gt; It's that talk again.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.760
This freedom is a sickness.

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.060
It's unbecoming a slave.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.840
Get it out of your mind!

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.370
It's those books you
read that turn your head.

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.420
A slave shouldn't read too much.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.030
I've watched you talk
to people in the market.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.650
You tell the slaves
they're born equal.

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.090
Ah, that's nonsense!

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:07.350
If you stay with me,
you'll stop this reading

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:08.650
and writing to everybody.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:09.950
&gt;&gt; Lately, I've stopped reading.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:14.360
&gt;&gt; But now you're out working in
your spare time for other masters.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:18.120
Denmark hopes to save
enough to buy Denmark.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.790
You know how long that
would take you?

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.550
All your life!

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.180
I need money, too.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:26.330 position:56%
I know how hard it comes these days.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:28.450
&gt;&gt; Why don't you sell me?

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:31.010
&gt;&gt; If I could get your price.

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:32.920
&gt;&gt; How much am I worth?

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.480
&gt;&gt; I'd say $2,000.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.640
&gt;&gt; Two thousand dollars?

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.010
&gt;&gt; You've got 2,000?

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.220
&gt;&gt; I've got my release papers.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:45.520
Will you sign them?

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:47.510
You need the money?

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:48.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.110
&gt;&gt; I need my freedom.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.920
&gt;&gt; You'd find a way to escape
if I didn't let you go.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:59.530
My pen? I feel like I
am releasing a tornado.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.610
What will you do with this freedom?

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.290 position:56%
&gt;&gt; What will you do with this money?

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.390
&gt;&gt; I'll use it to help
me and my family.

00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.660
&gt;&gt; I'll use my freedom to
help others become free.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:14.490
&gt;&gt; It's strange to have owned
a man's body for 20 years,

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:18.400
yet not know the first
thing about his mind.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.700
You're free.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.050
[ Music ]

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:22.350
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:27.440
When I played pieces of the
Destination Freedom series

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.070
for my students, I
had them listen to it.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.230
They're like, that
organ, that's old-timey.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:34.810
This really dates it.

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:38.010
But it also kind of hits
home that when they listen

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.320
to the story, they
really get into it.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:46.830
This episodes ends when after
Vesey and his co-conspirators,

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.170
as they're called, are captured.

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.390
And at this trial he makes a
statement, because he's being tried

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.510
for treason against the
State of South Carolina.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.460
And basically he says that
the revolution will go

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.770 position:56%
on until all men are free and equal.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.100
Now this was 1948.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:08.920
To hear a Black character, a
Black man say this on radio

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:12.760
in the 1940s was revolutionary
in and of itself.

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.910
But that was a kind
of thing Durham did.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:21.770
In this next episode he looked
at the life and accomplishments

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.670
of Lena Horne, who, by the way,

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.900
was born the same year
Durham was born in 1917.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:33.570
So what he did was he looked at
her development and then some

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.000
of the discrimination
that she experienced

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.480
and how she dealt with it.

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.570
This episode or this
little segment really is

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:46.250
from when she's a young girl and
she's traveling with her mother

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:50.130
from New York, where they lived, to
the south, because her mother had

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.790
to move for health reasons.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.970
And they're on the train.

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:58.980
They had just gotten to
Washington, D.C. And because

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:03.110
of Jim Crow segregation, they
had to move from the place

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:06.310
where they were sitting
into the Negro car.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.030
&gt;&gt; You lost something, girl?

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:24.660
&gt;&gt; No, I was looking
for better seats.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.820
Some of these are still empty.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Your first trip south on a train?

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.020
&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.560
&gt;&gt; Oh, why do they leave
me to do the educating?

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.510
&gt;&gt; What's the matter?

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.580
&gt;&gt; Look around, gal.

00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:46.450
What do you see?

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:47.750
&gt;&gt; People.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.300
&gt;&gt; Nah. Nah, you don't
see just people.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.420
You see white people,
only white people.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:20:03.770
Go on back up to the colored
people's car where you belong.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.710
It's the law of the land.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:08.890
&gt;&gt; My mother paid to sit up here.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:12.260
&gt;&gt; Will you get while
the getting's good?

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.560
&gt;&gt; I won't.

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:14.890
&gt;&gt; Oh, yes, you will.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:16.190
Now, come on.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:17.490
Now get up.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:18.790
[Inaudible].

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:20.090
&gt;&gt; Passengers in the aisle.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.390
Passengers jeered, damn right.

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:22.690
A girl light with blonde
hair [inaudible].

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:23.990
I was pulled into the Jim Crow car.

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.290
&gt;&gt; [Background Music]
Then I knew my way

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.590
to the Golden Clippers
would be rough.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.890
I was a Negro.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.190
I was Cinderella.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.270 position:56%
My stepsisters were [inaudible]
those who made profit off prejudice.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:36.280
&gt;&gt; So what he did was
he found creative ways

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.350 position:56%
to tell these men and women's story.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:43.950
In fact he called this
episode Negro Cinderella.

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:48.390
So he cast Lena Horne as Cinderella
with stepsisters, as you heard.

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:53.700
And then you find out in the end
how she kind of comes out of this.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:21:00.340
And once she's a successful and
world renowned singer, actress,

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:03.820
you know, what it meant to stand

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:09.460
up against prejudice
and discrimination.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:14.230
The last segment I want to play is
Durham's piece on Jackie Robinson.

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:18.000
And so one of the things
about Destination Freedom was

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.980
that it dealt with both
historic figures, Harriet Tubman,

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:27.250
Frederick Douglas, Sojourn
Truth, but it also dealt

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:30.800
with contemporary figures.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:37.910
At the time that this aired,
and this aired in 1949,

00:21:37.910 --> 00:21:46.180
Jackie Robinson had in 1947
just integrated baseball.

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:53.510
And so what did was he found a way
to creatively tell Jackie's story.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:56.400
But I wanted to play
this one short thing,

00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.000
and I won't be able to
play the whole thing.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.090
But hopefully afterwards,
you can go online

00:22:03.090 --> 00:22:11.230
and you can actually listen to it.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:14.390
One of his fellow actors.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:17.050
Durham himself was not an actor.

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:19.090
He was a writer.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.670
He was solely a behind-the-scenes
kind of guy.

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:21.970
But he had professional actors,

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.270
one of whom was a guy I
think you may have heard of.

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.570
His name was Studs Terkel.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.870
And Studs and he had
become friends in the '30s,

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:27.170
which I'll get to in a second.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:28.470
And so Studs then was trying
his hand out as an actor.

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:29.770 position:56%
So what he does is he plays this all
seeing, all knowing Dodger's fan.

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:31.070
He's, you know, Mr. Dodger.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:32.370
And he goes to a Dodger's
game at Edwards Field

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.670
and this is what you'll find.

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:34.970
Let's see, okay.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.270

see [inaudible].

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:05.170

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:07.220

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:50.440

Dodger comes to the plate.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.740
&gt;&gt; Hey, batter [inaudible].

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:53.220
Jackie Robinson.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.850
&gt;&gt; There was umpires,
umpires everywhere.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.440
And the pitcher hadn't
thrown a ball.

00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:11.760
But when this [inaudible]
the umpire calls.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.240
&gt;&gt; Strike two.

00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:16.540
&gt;&gt; Did you hear it?

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:17.840
Did you hear it?

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:19.260
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I heard it.

00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:21.050
&gt;&gt; But you didn't say nothing.

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:23.930
It was quiet [inaudible].

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.340
Here was the umpire
calling two strikes

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:30.820
on a man before he gets to bat.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:34.870
&gt;&gt; So you get the sense that
he used this as a device.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:38.060
And basically the whole idea
of that, Jackie Robinson,

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.420
simply because he was black.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.240
Not because he didn't have
the skill or the talent,

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.360
that anytime he stepped up to the
plate he already had two strikes

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.660
against him.

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.080
And he used that until he got
to the end when, you know,

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.280
Jackie Robinson is accepted by his
team and becomes a major player.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:25:01.380
So just as an example of the kind
of writing, the kind of drama

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.270
that Durham used in his radio work.

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.490
And I want to get to how did he
become such a skilled dramatist

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:11.550
and writer, and then
also his journalism work.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.000
He was born in Mississippi.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.460
And the highlighted section there
is the county that he was from,

00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:18.420
Hines County, Mississippi.

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:23.800
He was born right just south
of Jackson, the state capitol.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:26.340
And his family, his
mother and father and his,

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.900
at the time, five siblings.

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:33.490 position:56%
But there were eight children, seven
of who survived into adulthood.

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.830
They became part of the Great
Migration and they literally moved

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:39.440
in 1921 when he was about 5.

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.400
They moved to Chicago.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.380
This is his mother and father.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.920
The thing that I say in the book,
and really I was able to find a lot

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.470
of details both here and in
Chicago, where his papers reside,

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:56.940
was that his family was all about
education, his mother and father.

00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:01.180
His father had two years of
college at Alcorn State University,

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:03.560
what was then Alcorn University.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:09.410
And his mother was more or less
self taught, but she was all

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:12.760
about education and she knew
that that was the ticket

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.000
to a better life for her children.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.930
So this was the house that
they moved to in Chicago,

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:22.220
on the south side, what
is now Brownsville.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.340
It is still in the
Durham family today.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.070
So it's pretty unique.

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.220
This is Durham in his 20s.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:33.640
Now at this point, he is a
child of depression as well.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.910
And so he's in Chicago.

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:37.270
The depression hits.

00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.990
The family, like everyone else
in the country, is struggling.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:46.330
And what he does as a 21-year-old
is he decides that luckily

00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:50.610 position:56%
because there's something called the
WPA, Works Progress Administration,

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.500
and the Illinois Writers
Project, he decides he's going

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.660
to apply and he's able to get in.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:27:03.420
So he becomes one of the writers
who works on the Writers Project.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.250
Before I get into the
Writers Project though,

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:08.950
what you're seeing here
is what enabled Durham

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:12.390 position:56%
to become the writer that he became.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:15.470
Somewhere in his teens,
his family members told me.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.780
They didn't know exactly
when he started writing.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:22.290
But he started out as a poet, and
literally his lyricism carried him

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:23.750
through the rest of his life.

00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:25.180
But he was a poet.

00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:28.180
One of his mentors
was Langston Hughes.

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:32.100
Langston and he became friends,
because he had the audacity

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.460
to send Langston his poems.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.840
Langston actually critiqued
them and sent them back

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.530
and said you have talent,
you need to keep writing.

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:42.900
And as a result they
became lifelong friends

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.450
until Langston died in the '60s.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:49.170
This is from a book that Ana
Vantomps [phonetic] compiled,

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:53.770
an Anthology of Writing for
Young People, Negro poets.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:58.000
And you'll notice amazingly
enough or erratically enough

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.520
that Richard Durham's name,
or his home is right next

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:05.490
to Langston Hughes in
this particular anthology.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:09.920
This is actually a photograph
of Langston Hughes on the left

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.550
and Ana Vontomps on the
right, on the right left.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.900
So that what happened
was when he was accepted

00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:23.570
into the Illinois Writers
Project, he becomes a writer

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:27.270
who is documenting life
in depression era Chicago.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:31.300
And Ana is his supervisor.

00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:35.620
There are Negro in Illinois
Studies and there's also a study

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:39.180
about the Negro Press in Chicago.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.220
And so Durham becomes one
of the writers on that,

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:45.690
but Ana is his supervisor.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:50.080
What Ana does write about
says that he, Durham,

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:54.970
and one of the other younger
Black writers got enthralled

00:28:54.970 --> 00:29:00.000
with this unit that met every week
at the Illinois Writers Project.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.890
And it was called the
Radio Division,

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.940
the Illinois Writers Division.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.960 position:56%
And so every week this men and women
would sit around a conference table

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:14.540 position:56%
and they would write scripts that
were literally going to be broadcast

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.650
on Chicago stations
each and every week.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:24.120
His colleague, who he meets
at this time, is Studs Terkel.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.230
Studs Terkel is also
one of the writers.

00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:29.640
He's maybe four or five
years older than Durham,

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.010
but they become fast friends
and again remain friends

00:29:33.010 --> 00:29:36.090
through the rest of their lives.

00:29:36.090 --> 00:29:37.630
And the thing that was unique

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:43.590 position:56%
about this Radio Division is they're
writing these 15-minute dramas,

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:47.820
original dramas and
adaptations of works

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:52.580 position:56%
by Anton Chekhov and Edgar Alan Poe.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:56.660 position:56%
This is one of Durham's earlier
scripts, at least that I could find,

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:02.080 position:56%
which is here in the manuscript
division of The Library of Congress.

00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.360
And this actually was from a
series called Legends of Illinois

00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:11.280
and it looked at the life of
Mormon Leader, Joseph Smith.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.900
And so one of the things
that was interesting,

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.110 position:56%
and this was just the actual script.

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.320
The other one was a cover page.

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:21.640
And this is actually from another
script where he looks at the life

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:26.910
of Winslow Homer, the painter,
that he wasn't just dealing with.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.160
In fact, in the Illinois
Writers Project he didn't deal

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.120
with Black issues, per se.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.820
He dealt with writing for the
ear and learning how to do that.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:42.180
And the wonderful resource about
being able to come to this library

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.630
and sit down and touch and
read these documents is

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:48.130
that you see the growth.

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:53.900 position:56%
From that Joseph Smith script to his
later WPA scripts, he really grew.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.570
His first ones were terrible.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:00.070
And as a radio writer
myself, I know the pain.

00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:04.480
The first scripts were long and
they had these long soliloquies.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.270
It's like this is not.

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:07.990
You're not writing for the stage.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:09.290
You're writing for the ear.

00:31:09.290 --> 00:31:10.800
So we have to have some movement.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:13.110
You have to identify
who the characters are.

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.510
He had a gazillion
characters in 15 minutes.

00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:17.610
So you didn't know who was talking.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:23.310
But again because the scripts
still exist and they're right here,

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:27.910
I could see the development
and the growth and the progress

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.520
and he really fine tuned.

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:34.180
He stays with the Illinois
Writers Project until it ends

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:38.130
in the early '40s, and
then is struggling.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.950
But he's freelancing.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:41.290
He's staying in radio.

00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:44.340
He decides I'm going to
work as a writer in radio.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:50.220
And then he eventually moves into
or gets the opportunity to move

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.160
into working as a reporter
for the Chicago Defender.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.970
You'll notice that the headline

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:58.910
under the banner was the
World's Greatest Weekly.

00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:04.750 position:56%
And they took that on a play as what
the Chicago Tribune called itself,

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:07.780
the World's Greatest Daily.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.000
So this is kind of a play on that.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.650
But he becomes a reporter.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:15.630
He had no reporting experience,
but he was a storyteller.

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:19.750
And he knew what telling
good stories was about,

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.620
whether they're factual stories or
stories that, you know, he made up.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:29.680
And he moves into this
sphere of being a journalist.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:35.450
One of his first articles they sent
him back to the south, to Memphis.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.680
And I don't know if you've
heard the name of Edward Crump,

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.450
but Crump was a major
power player in Memphis.

00:32:42.450 --> 00:32:45.740
He kind of ran the city, even
though he was not the mayor.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:49.470
But he had that kind of power.

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:54.330
And so Durham was tasked to go down
to interview Crump and asked him

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:58.620
about the situation of
African-Americans in that city,

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.080
whether they were being
treated fairly,

00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:04.120
what Jim Crow discrimination meant
and all, and then the whole idea

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:09.080
of the Poll Tax that prevented
many African-Americans from voting.

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.130
And this was the resulting article.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:13.680
One of the things that
happened though,

00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.600
is that as he again developed his
journalist skills it was clear

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:24.420
that he was a fantastic storyteller
and he had great investigative

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:27.200
and astute analytical skills.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.310
So he became an investigative
reporter as opposed to, you know,

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:35.620
deadline, you know, shooting out
the latest, greatest right then.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:41.040
And this is just another article
that I found while I was here

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:47.660
at the library doing research
through Pro Quest that he wrote

00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:53.230
about Thomas Dewey, who in 1944
was the republican challenger

00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:56.340
to Roosevelt in the
presidential election.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:59.300
And this got him in
a bit of hot water,

00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:02.050
because what happened is he went

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:05.680
to Thomas Dewey's mother's
house to interview her.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:11.590
And so the thing was he talks
about how the town was lily white.

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:14.200
It was one of those towns
where it was a sundown town.

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.130
I don't know if you've
heard that phrase.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:18.220
But it was one of those
towns where they said, okay,

00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:22.910
if you're Black you have to be
gone by the time the sun goes down.

00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:26.260
And if you're not, you'll
[inaudible] or worse.

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:30.800
So that he went to talk this
woman and to get a broader picture

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.300
of the kind of place that
Thomas Dewey grew up in.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:36.150 position:56%
But what happened is, toward the end

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:41.020
of the interview Ms. Dewey made
some anti-semantic statements.

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:43.420
So when that was printed
in the Chicago Defender

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:48.460
and it was then reported in
New York, a mess broke loose.

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.370
And they were like wait a minute.

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:51.670
Did she say this?

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.970
And, of course, she denied it.

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:55.470
And he said no, I have
proof she did say it.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:57.040
I'm quoting her directly.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.030
So that brought him a
little bit of notoriety.

00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:02.330
This is Durham.

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:03.630
I'm going to fast forward some.

00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:07.140
That was in the mid
'40s, because he worked

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.350
at The Defender during
the World War II years.

00:35:10.350 --> 00:35:14.190
And then he got back into radio.

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:20.410
And in radio, he again decided
that there are ways to really kind

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:25.460 position:56%
of deal with some creative more
dignified images of Black Americans.

00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:28.250
And this is him in his home.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.120
We call it office, but it
was really his dining table

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.420
in his small apartment.

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.110
And this is where he wrote the
scripts for Destination Freedom

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.730
and the other shows
that led up to it.

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.120
And this is some of
the cast members.

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:44.640
You'll see here, because
this was [inaudible],

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.800
they focused on the
Black cast members.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:53.860 position:56%
Including down at the bottom left is
Oscar Brown, Junior, who, you know,

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.970
continued to act and sing be
a really fine entertainer.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:36:01.320
But the thing that was also unique
about Destination Freedom is

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:03.720
that it was a multiracial cast.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.090
And at that time, that
was not the norm.

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.140
Or again, if you heard
a black voice,

00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:16.360
inevitably a white actor was
portraying that Black character.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:22.800
This is in WMAQ's studio, the NBC
studios in Chicago, a table read.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:28.060
And at the top of the table
in the back is Homer Heck,

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.990
who was the director of
the show, an NBC employee.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:37.250
And there you see the
multiracial quality of the cast.

00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:40.240
Oscar Brown, Junior is on the left.

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:44.190
Weslyn Tilden [phonetic] is in
the middle, and Fred Pinkert.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:45.490
They were the regulars.

00:36:45.490 --> 00:36:50.850
And the organ that you hear,
here's the organist along

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:55.550 position:56%
with Homer Heck who is the director.

00:36:55.550 --> 00:37:04.020
And this is finally, in 1949, the
first anniversary of the show.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:08.390
The cast had a party and this is
the entire crew at that point.

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:12.700
One of the things that
happened was it won all kind

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.870
of awards, both local and national.

00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.480
And so while it was in danger

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:21.390 position:56%
of being taken off the air several
times because of lack of sponsorship

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:26.560
or protests or whatever, it
was so popular in Chicago

00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.230
and you could only
hear it in Chicago,

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.580
that WMAQ decided to keep it on.

00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:35.230
But Durham wanted national
distribution.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.960
He wanted this to do
what Amos and Andy did.

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.260
And Amos and Andy, by the
way, was on the same station

00:37:42.260 --> 00:37:45.420
that his program was one.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:50.350
But NBC decided no, we're not
going to do that because guess

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:53.960
who wouldn't pick up
this particular series?

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:56.820
Southern affiliates.

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:01.890 position:56%
They were like no, we're not playing
that kind of show on our station.

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:04.440
So he kept pushing and pushing.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:08.620
And finally by 1950 said, okay,
I'm not going to beat my head

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.920
against the wall anymore.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:12.760
I'm going to go ahead and
take this out and do it myself

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:17.140
and find sponsors who
will allow me to air it.

00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:23.990
But then a few months after
he left, August of 1950,

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:27.530
a few months later WMAQ started
airing this award winning show,

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:32.560
the return of this award winning
show called Destination Freedom,

00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:36.200
but this time it was about
all white characters.

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.570
And Durham said, no, not
having it, and he sued.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.790
Now if you're a Black man
and you're going to sue,

00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:45.670
you're going to be the
David and you're going

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:50.510
to sue this major Goliath
in the media industry,

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:54.900
you pretty much are crazy or
will be seen as being crazy.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.540
But he sued and his lawsuit
kind of wound its way through.

00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:03.290
But as a result of that, he could
obviously no longer work in radio.

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:08.970
So he moves into organizing,
working for a labor union.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:15.860
And then by the '60s, he is now
approached by members of the Nation

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:22.300
of Islam who were then trying to
establish this national newspaper

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.500
that they're going to call or
they're calling Mohammad Speaks.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.190
And he considers it and,
you know, kind of mulls it

00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:30.200
around with his wife and friends.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.510
And then he decides, you
know, this is just another way

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.970
to reach another audience
and to talk about images

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:41.050
of Black people not just in this
country, but internationally.

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:44.630
So he becomes the editor
of Mohammad Speaks.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:48.180
And as a result of that,
again I was able to track

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:51.600
down all of the episodes.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.080
Not episodes.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:57.400
The copies of the Mohammad
Speaks newspapers here

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.170
in The Library of Congress.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:03.350
So you can see that he talks
about issues of lynching

00:40:03.350 --> 00:40:06.500
and discrimination here
in the United States,

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:10.470
about what's happening in
southern Odesia, today's Zimbabwe,

00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:13.870
and of course what's going
on in Vietnam as it relates

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.720
to Black GIs and Black people.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:18.020
So he does that.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:22.130 position:56%
And as a result of that, he becomes,
I don't want to say friends,

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:26.500
but he's acquainted with and
really likes this fine specimen

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.620
of man here.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.280
I think you all know who he is.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.850
And, if not, then this is
Mohammad Ali in his prime.

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:38.830
Mohammad Ali had joined the
Nation of Islam in the early '60s,

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:42.510
and that was of course as a
result of Durham being the editor

00:40:42.510 --> 00:40:44.700
of the national newspaper.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:49.220
They developed the relationship so
that when he could no longer fight,

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:52.730
one of the things they decided
was, well, maybe one of the ways

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:58.250
that Mohammad Ali can make a living
is by writing his autobiography.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:02.740
Well, Mohammad is an
excellent talker or crazy guy,

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:06.720 position:56%
you would think, but is he a writer?

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.230
Not so much.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:12.940
So they turned to Durham and
say would you be willing to work

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:15.010
with Ali, to write this book?

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:16.310
And he said yes.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:20.480 position:56%
And so for the next five years
almost, four and a half, five years,

00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:23.590
he travels everywhere with Ali.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:27.570
Once Ali is able to fight
again, he's at every fight.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:28.870
He talks to family members.

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.170
He talks to friends.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:32.360
He talks to other boxers.

00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.010
And they travel the world.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:39.630
And then finally The Greatest,
My Own Story comes out in 1975.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:43.520
But it comes out in all
languages, including German.

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:46.990
I was able to track it down.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:51.570
It was out of print when I
started this progress, process,

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:56.580
but it does exist here in The
Library of Congress's archives.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:01.470
And I was able to then kind of
see some of the versions of it.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:06.040
His wife actually has
this German edition.

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:10.970
But it came out then, and
he was actively involved

00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:13.090
in helping to push it.

00:42:13.090 --> 00:42:17.470
Well, as a result of that, he
then decided that he was going

00:42:17.470 --> 00:42:20.830
to try to do some other things.

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:22.560
He didn't get back into radio.

00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.720
He did do some television,
as was mentioned earlier.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:29.670
But he also had connections
politically with the politics

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:32.030
of Chicago and the politicians.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:36.000
And he was good friends with this
gentleman here, whose head is down.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.520
And Durham's in the back
of him writing on the pad.

00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.170
And that was Harold Washington.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:44.610
Their friendship dated
back to the 1940s.

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:55.120
But Washington, when he decided to
run for the mayor position in 1982,

00:42:55.120 --> 00:43:02.880 position:56%
he decided that he needed obviously
a crew of people who would help him.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.210
And everybody around him said,
well, if you're going to do this

00:43:06.210 --> 00:43:08.520
and you need somebody to
help you craft your message

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:12.250
to write the speeches and make
sure that you're on track,

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:13.550
Richard Durham is the man.

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:18.420 position:56%
And so Richard, almost every morning
on the campaign trail, would follow,

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:25.310 position:56%
would go with Harold Washington as
they made their way around the city.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:30.300
And, of course, he wrote his
acceptance speech the night before

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.960
the actual election
because he was confident

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.670
that Harold Washington
was going to win.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:38.500
And he did, with 51
percent of the vote.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:42.360
So as a result of that,
everyone thought that, okay,

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.830
Richard Durham is now going to move

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.690
into Harold Washington's
administration

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:50.650
and probably do something
with the press.

00:43:50.650 --> 00:43:53.440
But he decided he wanted
to do some other things.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.670
And unfortunately, a
year later, he was gone.

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:58.150
He died of a heart attack.

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:02.240
But the thing is, one
of the things that kind

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:04.330
of [inaudible] line
forward to Durham is

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:05.920
that you could use the media,

00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:08.840
and you could use your
words, as weapons.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.050
Weapons against injustice.

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:13.580
Weapons against inequality.

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:17.560
And that the way you
do that should vary,

00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.530
based on whatever that medium is.

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.960
So if you're writing for the
ear, it may be one thing.

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:27.050
You can use drama, and drama
and comedy can draw people in.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:30.990
You can do it for print,
whether it's newspapers or books,

00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:34.780
and you can do it on television,
the visual and the audio.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.920
And I think that the
thing with Durham is

00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:45.510
that he was a real dedicated
and accomplished wordsmith,

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:50.920
but he also really was the
epitome of using your words

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:54.510
for a positive cause or
a positive social change

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.320
for your justice and equality.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.120
So, thank you.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:04.900
[ Applause ]

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:06.200
So is time for?

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.500
&gt;&gt; Yes, time for questions.

00:45:07.500 --> 00:45:08.800
Yes.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.100
&gt;&gt; Okay, time for questions.

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:11.400
Any questions?

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.700
Yes, ma'am?

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:14.480
&gt;&gt; How was he received at NBC?

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:17.860
I was kind of surprised that they
even went along with his idea

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.320
to have a multiracial
cast on the show

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:25.110
and they supported these
positive images of Black people?

00:45:25.110 --> 00:45:28.410
Was that difficult for him
to get the show on the air?

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.090
&gt;&gt; So, anyway, you
separate the question?

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:33.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Okay, the question was how was he
received at NBC, and how was he able

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.630
to get the show on the air.

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:41.790
Because we're talking about 1948,
for one, he had a track record.

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:44.260
So he wasn't just coming
out of nowhere.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.770
He had worked in radio by that
point for about ten, 12 years.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:51.140
So he had a track record.

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:55.680
And the other thing was, I was
going to say Irna Phillips.

00:45:55.680 --> 00:46:00.020
Oh, lord, is it Irna Phillips?

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:06.300
Yes. No. Okay, let me back up.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.050
The woman who was Judith Waller.

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:12.340
Not Irna Phillips.

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:15.080
Judith Waller was the
director of education

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.290
of programs at NBC, at WMAQ.

00:46:17.290 --> 00:46:24.470
And she was the one who
actually brought Amos and Andy

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:31.270 position:56%
to WMAQ and/or suggested that NBC
taking and distributed it nationwide

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:33.930
and it became the top show.

00:46:33.930 --> 00:46:37.940
When he approached NBC, and
he actually approached NBC

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:42.130
with the idea, they actually
said, well, this could work.

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:44.760
We don't know how it's going to
work, and we're not even sure

00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.150
that it will work, but
we'll take a chance.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:49.270
And it was about taking a chance.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:54.630
When they saw that the response in
the Black community was phenomenal,

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:57.450
but also the response in
the broader community.

00:46:57.450 --> 00:46:59.260
So it wasn't just Black
people listening

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:03.420
to this half-hour show
every Sunday morning at 10.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.910
It was a larger community.

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:08.720
So then they decided, okay, well,
this maybe has some currency.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.020
We'll keep it going.

00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.370
So that was some of it.

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:18.440
In terms of the multiracial
aspect, Studs Terkel told me.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:24.620 position:56%
Now Destination Freedom was recorded
live in the studio every week.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:26.560
So this was not a prerecorded
kind of thing.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:28.280
They actually did it live.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:31.520
And they would show up on
Sunday morning about 7,

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:33.710
go through a rehearsal,
several rehearsals,

00:47:33.710 --> 00:47:37.010
and then by 10:00 they
were on the air.

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:41.300
And they said when they first got
there, some of the NBC employees

00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:45.050
who were all white would look
at them and say who are these?

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:46.810
What are they doing here?

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:50.610
But then again, it was
about telling stories.

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:53.910
And he found inventive ways.

00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:56.310
It was not a cookie
cutter kind of thing

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:59.430
where every story had
the same approach.

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:02.460
Every week there was something
different, and I think they came

00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:06.000
to respect and highly regard that.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.300
So, yeah, good question.

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.180
Any other questions?

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.480
Yes, sir?

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.510
&gt;&gt; I was just curious
when you mentioned

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:21.240
about the $250,000
lawsuit against NBC.

00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:24.400
You mentioned David and Goliath.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:29.730
If anybody knows about the
feel of the story, David wins.

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:35.010
What happened in that lawsuit
and how did it affect his career?

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.310
&gt;&gt; Good question.

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:39.590
In terms of the outcome,
you've got to read the book.

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:40.890
&gt;&gt; Will you summarize?

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:42.190
[Laughter].

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:43.490
&gt;&gt; Okay, Director Cole
asked me to summarize it.

00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:47.250
And that's basically, your question
was, if you know the story of David

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.390
and Goliath, David
actually wins in the end.

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:54.390
So what happened with Durham?

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:55.860
&gt;&gt; That particular
[inaudible] lawsuit.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:49:00.290
Were they thrown out of court?

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:01.590
&gt;&gt; Yes, okay.

00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:05.090
I'm not going to say,
because I think

00:49:05.090 --> 00:49:06.750
that you'll find out in the book.

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:10.030
And also in the book, what I
do, is I kind of tease you,

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.470
say this happened and
then this happened.

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:16.230
Because it was about a
five-, six-year journey.

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:18.240
It was not, you know, a quick end.

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.560
It didn't have a quick end.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.340
But the thing was that, yes,
it did affect his career.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:25.640
Because think about it.

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:32.620
NBC. You're going to sue a
national broadcast company?

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.630
And you're a single individual.

00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:37.990
He didn't have a company
or a group behind him.

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:40.030 position:56%
So he could no longer work in radio.

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:44.800
And the thing was, this
was 1950; 1950, 1951.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:48.460
So what was the medium was
then becoming the new kid

00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.410
on the block at that point?

00:49:50.410 --> 00:49:51.710
Television.

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:56.110
And he saw taking Destination
Freedom and the dramatizations

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:59.780
from radio to television,
and then really being able

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:02.430
to reach a much, much
broader audience.

00:50:02.430 --> 00:50:06.390
Well, again NBC was also
television and radio.

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:08.610
So he couldn't do it.

00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:12.430
And he knew that his broadcast
career was either going

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:15.730
to be totally dead or
he'd have to put it

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:17.030
on hold, which is what he did.

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:20.190
So in the '50s he didn't work.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:24.250
Well, yeah, he didn't work in
radio or television at all,

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:29.670
although I did find some evidence
that he did some freelance work.

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:32.410 position:56%
But he probably didn't use his name.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:34.490
So there was no way to really kind

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:39.480
of track exactly what shows he
worked on, other than what he said,

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:44.270
because given his status
he couldn't do it.

00:50:44.270 --> 00:50:49.950
Yeah. But in terms of what
happened, yes, it's in the book.

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:54.800
Other questions or thoughts?

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.630
Yes, sir?

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:58.310
&gt;&gt; You mentioned a
little bit about his work

00:50:58.310 --> 00:50:59.990
with the Illinois Writers Project.

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.500
What kind of writing?

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.680
He was employed for a
while, a couple years.

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, no, no.

00:51:06.070 --> 00:51:07.390 position:56%
No, it was more than a couple years.

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:09.310
He started at the Illinois
Writers Project.

00:51:09.310 --> 00:51:12.000
&gt;&gt; It would have been
the end of '39, probably.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.480
&gt;&gt; It was in '39.

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:19.500 position:56%
He applied in '38 and he was hired
in '39, and he stayed until 1942ish.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:23.340
&gt;&gt; Do you know whether he worked on
the Guide Book for Illinois or not?

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:24.810
&gt;&gt; He did not.

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:26.930
He did not.

00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:33.440
But what he did was, before he got
into the radio division he worked.

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:37.330
They had him looking at various
aspects of life in Chicago.

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:42.930
And he looked at coverage of
censorship issues in the press,

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:47.260
in newspapers and magazines,
and then he wrote about that.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:51.950
And he also talked about life on
the south side, which is also what,

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:54.720
by the way, Richard
Wright was a member

00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.670
of the Illinois Writers Project.

00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:59.090
And again here at The
Library of Congress,

00:51:59.090 --> 00:52:03.320
it was really just wonderful
to be able to go and sit

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.830
with the federal writers
on projects' documents

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:12.140
and to see Richard
Wright's writing from 1940,

00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:16.600
1941 about what life was
like on the south side.

00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:19.590
So you had these Black
writers, white writers.

00:52:19.590 --> 00:52:23.590
And the other thing that was
really kind of phenomenal

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:26.070
about the Writers Project,
which again you can see here

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:31.340
in these archives in the manuscript
division, is that you had men

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:35.920 position:56%
and women who would go on to be some
major figures in the literary world.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:39.220
Saul Bellow was a member
of the Writers Project.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:44.660
Of course, Ana Vontomps,
Richard Wright, Margaret Walker,

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:49.960
Nelson Aldrin, Studs Terkel.

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:54.070
So you had these men and
women at various points

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:59.200
in their career working on
documenting life in Illinois,

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:03.270
in Chicago in particular, and then
using that as a stepping stone

00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:07.940
for other ways that they would then
take their writing in the future.

00:53:07.940 --> 00:53:11.650
But, yeah, so before he got
into the radio division,

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:13.500
he worked on various
kinds of things.

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:19.840
And he was one of Ana
Vontomp's writers who looked

00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.650
at the Negro press in Chicago.

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:27.460
So he did a chapter in that
study, which was never published

00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:29.500
but it does exist downstairs.

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:35.460 position:56%
The other thing though, is that
once we got into the radio division,

00:53:35.460 --> 00:53:39.240
that was it, and he stayed in that
division the whole time he was

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:40.700
with the Writers Project.

00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:42.000
Yes, sir?

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.870
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] politics, or
in terms of finding employment

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:50.560
in the early '50s, that
he would be accused

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.080
of being a Communist [inaudible].

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:54.050
&gt;&gt; Yes, he was, and he was.

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:56.010
So he was accused and he was.

00:53:56.010 --> 00:53:59.360
He joined the Communist party
sometime in the late '30s.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:03.870
He was really impressed with the
way that the Communist party stood

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:08.950
up for human rights, looked
at issues around housing

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:12.920
and restrictive covenants, and
employment discrimination and all.

00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:16.360
So he was, as a young man, and
we're talking about him being

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.840
like 21, 22 at this point.

00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.850
He really got involved.

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:25.700
But as he kind of went
through the party,

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:27.640
he didn't like by the time we get

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:31.280
into the '40s, the
World War II years.

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:36.070
He didn't like the way that the
Communist party saw the response

00:54:36.070 --> 00:54:37.810
to what was still happening
in America.

00:54:37.810 --> 00:54:41.600
The whole idea of that
in the Black community,

00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.080
there was this double V campaign.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:48.040
Victory abroad, victory at
home, end of discrimination.

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:52.280
End of, you know, fascism
and Nazism.

00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:56.160
So the fact that for
his vantage point,

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.270 position:56%
the Communist party just said,
well, you know we got to concentrate

00:54:59.270 --> 00:55:03.960
on getting rid of, you know, the
injustice overseas in Europe.

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:08.840
And he didn't feel that there
was the kind of same fervor

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.210
by that point here
in the United States.

00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:13.580
So he left the Communist
party at some point,

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.460
but his leftist sensibilities
were always there.

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:20.280
And I couldn't find evidence

00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:24.510
that he was ever blacklisted,
but his friends were.

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:29.600
Langston Hughes was accused of
being, you know, in the party,

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.160
and several of his other friends.

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:37.690
I think that what happened was
both his audaciousness of suing,

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:42.820
you know, NBC, and his leftist
sensibilities forced him

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:45.880
to do some things that again
he didn't get credit for.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:54.390
So he worked in television as early
as the mid 1950s, maybe even late,

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:56.730
but he didn't get credit
for it until the '60s

00:55:56.730 --> 00:56:00.160
when he worked on the
PBS series, yeah.

00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:04.450
&gt;&gt; Time for one more question.

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:07.620
Well, yes, please.

00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:08.920
One more.

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:13.980
&gt;&gt; Did you say that we can
listened to the series online?

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:15.280
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.520
Again in my book, but
before you get it,

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:22.190
if you Google Destination
Freedom there is an archive.

00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:24.070
There's an online audio archive.

00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:29.490
And about 40 of the 90 plus
shows in the series are

00:56:29.490 --> 00:56:32.070
on there including the Lena Horne,

00:56:32.070 --> 00:56:35.000
the Denmark Vesey,
and several others.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.300
Jackie Robinson.

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:40.750
Yeah, the Jackie Robinson's
story's there, too.

00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:42.050
So, yeah.

00:56:42.050 --> 00:56:43.350
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, thank you very much.

00:56:43.350 --> 00:56:45.510
Join me in thanking Sonja.

00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:48.370
[ Applause ]

00:56:48.370 --> 00:56:49.880
You really did a wonderful job

00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:53.690
of explaining the period
as well as Mr. Durham.

00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:56.580
I'm assuming this is the
first biography of him.

00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:57.880
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:01.160
&gt;&gt; Well, good for you and good for
The Library of Congress for helping

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.500
to support it with
those collections.

00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:08.300
I know a little bit about the
WPA Writers Project archive

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:09.720
and the manuscript division.

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:14.580
And back in 1991, we actually
had a symposium about all

00:57:14.580 --> 00:57:18.550 position:56%
of the WPA materials, the multimedia
materials throughout the library.

00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:21.430
And the manuscript
division participated,

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:23.640
but it was the Writers Project

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.780
that really brought
part of this together.

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.650
But the radio side is new to me.

00:57:29.650 --> 00:57:34.550
That you use those archives, I
think, is really another reason

00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:38.800
to have these resources be
made more widely available.

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:41.360
I had one question in
my mind, not for you.

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:43.660
And that is that The
Library of Congress,

00:57:43.660 --> 00:57:49.370 position:56%
when Archibald McCleesh [phonetic]
was librarian between 1939 and 1944,

00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:53.850
he helped bring the WPA collections
to the library at the time

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:56.510
when those projects
folded, when Congress got

00:57:56.510 --> 00:58:00.400
after the theater project and
suddenly everything collapsed.

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:04.690
But McCleesh got money for The
Library of Congress Radio Project

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:07.210
that only lasted two years.

00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:12.490
But I just wonder, since he had
the WPA connection, I mean he knew

00:58:12.490 --> 00:58:17.810 position:56%
about it, and the fact that maybe he
picked up on the radio part of this,

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:19.250
and I would be wonderful

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:23.940
to know whether McCleesh
ever knew Richard Durham.

00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:25.240
I wouldn't know either.

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.990
At any rate, we're about
to have the book signing.

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:30.380
Sonja will sign books over here.

00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:32.900
They're for sale at a
10 percent discount,

00:58:32.900 --> 00:58:35.290
The Library of Congress
staff discount.

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:38.430
So please buy a copy
and get it signed,

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:41.160
and enjoy continuing
our conversation.

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:44.510
Let's have a final round of
applause for Sonja Williams.

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:47.960
[ Applause ]

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:51.600
