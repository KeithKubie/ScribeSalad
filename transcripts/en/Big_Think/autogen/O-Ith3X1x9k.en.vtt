people get into psychology you're
 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.580
people get into psychology you're
interested in why there's so much pain

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590
interested in why there's so much pain
 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.409
interested in why there's so much pain
and suffering around you I certainly saw

that at home just growing up and decided

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470
that at home just growing up and decided
 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.069
that at home just growing up and decided
early on that it was a place to put my

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:27.079
early on that it was a place to put my
 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:28.810
early on that it was a place to put my
science interests and also this my

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820
science interests and also this my
 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.609
science interests and also this my
humanitarian interests and you could put

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619
humanitarian interests and you could put
 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.720
humanitarian interests and you could put
those two together in one field after I

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730
those two together in one field after I
 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.600
those two together in one field after I
was a psychologist I developed a panic

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610
was a psychologist I developed a panic
 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.920
was a psychologist I developed a panic
disorder and that changed a lot of what

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930
disorder and that changed a lot of what
 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.920
disorder and that changed a lot of what
kind of work I'd I do because I was

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:44.930
kind of work I'd I do because I was
 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.930
kind of work I'd I do because I was
trained as a paper therapist and as a

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940
trained as a paper therapist and as a
 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.729
trained as a paper therapist and as a
cognitive behavior therapist and when I

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739
cognitive behavior therapist and when I
 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:51.340
cognitive behavior therapist and when I
applied the methods that I would apply

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350
applied the methods that I would apply
 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.590
applied the methods that I would apply
with others when they had panic disorder

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600
with others when they had panic disorder
 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.549

it didn't really fully hit what I

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559
it didn't really fully hit what I
 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.100
it didn't really fully hit what I
thought what was needed for me and I

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110
thought what was needed for me and I
 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.130
thought what was needed for me and I
turned back towards things several

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140
turned back towards things several
 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.719
turned back towards things several
things that were sort of in my

the 60s and grew up in California so was
 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.709
the 60s and grew up in California so was
exposed to the kind of garden-variety

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719
exposed to the kind of garden-variety
 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.480
exposed to the kind of garden-variety
eastern thinking that most folks in my

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490
eastern thinking that most folks in my
 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.029
eastern thinking that most folks in my
generation were exposed to and I

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039
generation were exposed to and I
 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:27.940
generation were exposed to and I
actually found more in mindfulness and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950
actually found more in mindfulness and
 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.849
actually found more in mindfulness and
acceptance kind of methods that were

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859
acceptance kind of methods that were
 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:34.059
acceptance kind of methods that were
directly benefit to me then in the

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069
directly benefit to me then in the
 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:36.989
directly benefit to me then in the
traditions I was nominally part of so

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999
traditions I was nominally part of so
 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:39.429
traditions I was nominally part of so
that really changed my thinking and that

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439
that really changed my thinking and that
 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:42.339
that really changed my thinking and that
caused me to set out on about a 30-year

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349
caused me to set out on about a 30-year
 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:45.730
caused me to set out on about a 30-year
journey as to how to dig down to the

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740
journey as to how to dig down to the
 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.550
journey as to how to dig down to the
essence of what's inside some of our

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560
essence of what's inside some of our
 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.649
essence of what's inside some of our
deepest clinical traditions but also our

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659
deepest clinical traditions but also our
 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.199

spiritual and religious traditions
 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:54.279

traditions have methods that are
designed to change how you interact with

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:04.249
designed to change how you interact with
 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.929
designed to change how you interact with
your logical analytical linear thinking

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939
your logical analytical linear thinking
 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.160
your logical analytical linear thinking
and I didn't want to leave that just

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170
and I didn't want to leave that just
 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.589
and I didn't want to leave that just
intact I didn't want to simply be a

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599
intact I didn't want to simply be a
 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.540

meditation teacher or something I wanted
 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.699
meditation teacher or something I wanted
to understand it and we spent a lot of

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709
to understand it and we spent a lot of
 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.710
to understand it and we spent a lot of
time kind of pulling it as a joint and

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720
time kind of pulling it as a joint and
 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.550
time kind of pulling it as a joint and
trying to understand

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560
trying to understand
 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.800
trying to understand
why these things might be helpful to

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
why these things might be helpful to
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.630
why these things might be helpful to
people I think particularly helpful to

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640
people I think particularly helpful to
 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.039
people I think particularly helpful to
people in the modern world who are

committed effective way so it's kind of
 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.259
committed effective way so it's kind of
how I came there where I ended up where

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269
how I came there where I ended up where
 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.270
how I came there where I ended up where
I ended up

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280
 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.610
well the empirical clinical traditions

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620
well the empirical clinical traditions
 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.110
well the empirical clinical traditions
especially in the cognitive behavioral

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120
especially in the cognitive behavioral
 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.720
especially in the cognitive behavioral
tradition early on they're trying to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730
tradition early on they're trying to
 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.610
tradition early on they're trying to
apply behavioral principles mostly

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620
apply behavioral principles mostly
 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.710
apply behavioral principles mostly
developed with animal models directly to

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720
developed with animal models directly to
 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.450
developed with animal models directly to
people and there's a lot of benefit that

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460
people and there's a lot of benefit that
 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.950
people and there's a lot of benefit that
happened there it's still relevant today

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960
happened there it's still relevant today

you can do a lot of good things for

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900
you can do a lot of good things for
 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.570
you can do a lot of good things for
people who suffer with anxiety

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580
people who suffer with anxiety
 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.640
people who suffer with anxiety
depression and so on using those methods

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
depression and so on using those methods
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.200
depression and so on using those methods
I'm old enough to have seen all three of

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.210
I'm old enough to have seen all three of
 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.660
I'm old enough to have seen all three of
these steps and somewhere in the late

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670
these steps and somewhere in the late
 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.750
these steps and somewhere in the late
70s and mid 80s people realized that you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760
70s and mid 80s people realized that you
 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.510
70s and mid 80s people realized that you
had to have a better way of dealing with

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520
had to have a better way of dealing with
 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.040
had to have a better way of dealing with
cognition and they couldn't find it in

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050
cognition and they couldn't find it in
 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.400
cognition and they couldn't find it in
the animal models so they went to more

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410
the animal models so they went to more
 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.610
the animal models so they went to more
common-sense clinical models where they

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620
common-sense clinical models where they
 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.460
common-sense clinical models where they
would sort of divide thinking styles up

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470
would sort of divide thinking styles up
 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.930
would sort of divide thinking styles up
into rational and irrational processes

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940
into rational and irrational processes
 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.760
into rational and irrational processes
making cognitive errors and so forth and

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770
making cognitive errors and so forth and
 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.890
making cognitive errors and so forth and
they thought if you get just just get

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900
they thought if you get just just get
 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.680
they thought if you get just just get
people to think more rationally and

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690
people to think more rationally and
 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.310
people to think more rationally and
focus on the evidence and take some of

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320
focus on the evidence and take some of
 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.490
focus on the evidence and take some of
those over expansive thoughts that are

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500
those over expansive thoughts that are
 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.350
those over expansive thoughts that are
creating difficulty for them and change

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360
creating difficulty for them and change
 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.800
creating difficulty for them and change
them then they do better and someone was

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810
them then they do better and someone was
 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.900
them then they do better and someone was
in the techniques were helpful but the

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.040
too great
and makes it very hard to have

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.050
and makes it very hard to have
 

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:07.700
and makes it very hard to have
relationships of the kind that you

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:07.710
relationships of the kind that you
 

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:09.379
relationships of the kind that you
really want so there there's an example

you'll find that's where the values are
another one is just to think of the

00:08:16.369 --> 00:08:16.379
another one is just to think of the
 

00:08:16.379 --> 00:08:19.850
another one is just to think of the
times that you felt most with yourself

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:19.860
times that you felt most with yourself

some of these specific memories and you
walk inside them you're gonna find that

walk inside them you're gonna find that
 

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.699
walk inside them you're gonna find that
there's things in there that you care

you never fully reach these things I
mean give you an example there are times

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:47.730
mean give you an example there are times
 

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.360

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720
life and you'll find in there a kind of
 

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.109
life and you'll find in there a kind of
a light that can direct you and it gets

00:09:41.109 --> 00:09:41.119
a light that can direct you and it gets
 

00:09:41.119 --> 00:09:43.090
a light that can direct you and it gets
them in the cacophony gets very noisy

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:43.100
them in the cacophony gets very noisy
 

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.579
them in the cacophony gets very noisy
and you get confused and lost that can

00:09:45.579 --> 00:09:45.589
and you get confused and lost that can
 

00:09:45.589 --> 00:09:51.730
and you get confused and lost that can
direct you towards what you care about

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:51.740
 

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.770
a little bit because this psychology is

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:53.780
a little bit because this psychology is
 

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.960
a little bit because this psychology is
a psychology of the normal a lot of the

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:55.970
a psychology of the normal a lot of the
 

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.250
a psychology of the normal a lot of the
psychologists that are out there are

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:57.260
psychologists that are out there are
 

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.990
psychologists that are out there are
built on the psychology psychology they

00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.000
built on the psychology psychology they
 

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.970
built on the psychology psychology they
have normal we have all these syndra

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:00.980
have normal we have all these syndra
 

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.040
have normal we have all these syndra
mailboxes that we can put people in and

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.050
mailboxes that we can put people in and
 

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.110
mailboxes that we can put people in and
so forth the actual evidence on

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120
so forth the actual evidence on
 

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.730
so forth the actual evidence on
syndromes is not very good I mean

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:06.740
syndromes is not very good I mean
 

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.850
syndromes is not very good I mean
there's no specific biological marker

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:09.860
there's no specific biological marker
 

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.950
there's no specific biological marker
for example for any of the things that

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:11.960
for example for any of the things that
 

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.750
for example for any of the things that
you see talking about in the media even

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760
you see talking about in the media even
 

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.190
you see talking about in the media even
things like schizophrenia there's no

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200
things like schizophrenia there's no
 

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.050
things like schizophrenia there's no
specific and sensitive biological

specific and sensitive biological
 

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.420
specific and sensitive biological
markers for these things so yeah there

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:19.430
markers for these things so yeah there
 

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.250
markers for these things so yeah there
may be some abnormal processes involved

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:21.260
may be some abnormal processes involved
 

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.770
may be some abnormal processes involved
in some of them but vastly more of human

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:23.780
in some of them but vastly more of human
 

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.810
in some of them but vastly more of human
suffering comes from normal processes

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:25.820
suffering comes from normal processes
 

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.890
suffering comes from normal processes
that are run away from us like normal

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:29.900
that are run away from us like normal
 

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.590
that are run away from us like normal
processes of problem-solving work great

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600
processes of problem-solving work great
 

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.540
processes of problem-solving work great
on the world without when it's applied

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:34.550
on the world without when it's applied

isn't the same thing as dirt on the

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:47.960
isn't the same thing as dirt on the
 

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.690
isn't the same thing as dirt on the
floor or paint peeling off the walls

floor or paint peeling off the walls
 

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.250
floor or paint peeling off the walls
it's not going to be solved in that way

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:51.260
it's not going to be solved in that way
 

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.530
it's not going to be solved in that way
it's more like learning how to carry at

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:53.540
it's more like learning how to carry at
 

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.590
it's more like learning how to carry at
the contact it to see it because it's

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:56.600
the contact it to see it because it's
 

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.300
the contact it to see it because it's
based on the psychology of the normal

00:10:58.300 --> 00:10:58.310
based on the psychology of the normal
 

00:10:58.310 --> 00:11:00.460

with a therapist as part of that too and

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:00.470
with a therapist as part of that too and
 

00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:03.190
with a therapist as part of that too and
so when the purpose gets in there and is

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200
so when the purpose gets in there and is
 

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.020
so when the purpose gets in there and is
working on acceptance and mindfulness

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:05.030
working on acceptance and mindfulness
 

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.390
working on acceptance and mindfulness
and values they too are working with

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:07.400
and values they too are working with
 

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.790
and values they too are working with
those very same processes and so it

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800
those very same processes and so it
 

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.580
those very same processes and so it
requires a therapist not to be a master

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:12.590
requires a therapist not to be a master
 

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:14.200
requires a therapist not to be a master
at it you don't even have to be good at

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:14.210
at it you don't even have to be good at
 

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.630
at it you don't even have to be good at
it but just to see the value of it and

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640
it but just to see the value of it and
 

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.370
it but just to see the value of it and
to be willing to to look at their own

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:20.380
to be willing to to look at their own
 

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.080
to be willing to to look at their own
difficult emotions and thoughts and find

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:23.090
difficult emotions and thoughts and find
 

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.240
difficult emotions and thoughts and find
a way to carry them gently in the

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:25.250
a way to carry them gently in the
 

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:27.370
a way to carry them gently in the
service of the clients that they're

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:27.380
service of the clients that they're
 

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.970
service of the clients that they're
serving so for example if a therapist is

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:30.980
serving so for example if a therapist is
 

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.100
serving so for example if a therapist is
feeling insecure in therapy a lot of

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:35.110
feeling insecure in therapy a lot of
 

00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:38.440
feeling insecure in therapy a lot of
therapists will try to sort of push that

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:38.450
therapists will try to sort of push that
 

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.780
therapists will try to sort of push that
too aside to try to do the therapy

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:40.790
too aside to try to do the therapy
 

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:43.540
too aside to try to do the therapy

instead we would ask people to get with
 

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.520
instead we would ask people to get with
that feeling of insecurity because after

that feeling of insecurity because after
all the client is being asked to do the

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:47.720
all the client is being asked to do the
 

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.910
all the client is being asked to do the
same thing so it tends to be relatively

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:50.920
same thing so it tends to be relatively
 

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.600

I've mentioned even in this office you
 

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.910
I've mentioned even in this office you
know the same processes are there we've

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920
know the same processes are there we've
 

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.220

between people so it isn't just in the
psychotherapy areas and why that would

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:51.560
psychotherapy areas and why that would
 

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.700
psychotherapy areas and why that would
be as an empirical fact there's a pretty

be as an empirical fact there's a pretty
 

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:59.070
be as an empirical fact there's a pretty
enormous breadth to these methods and

00:12:59.070 --> 00:12:59.080
enormous breadth to these methods and
 

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:02.620
enormous breadth to these methods and
the why that would be because everywhere

the why that would be because everywhere

the why that would be because everywhere

are just normal psychological processes

are just normal psychological processes
 

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.370
are just normal psychological processes
that are built-in to language and

that are built-in to language and
 

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.620

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:38.840
problem-solving and so if you take the
 

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:42.100

barriers and that's true at work it's

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:51.500
barriers and that's true at work it's
 

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.100

we're going the reason why it spreads
out we have pretty good evidence for

out we have pretty good evidence for

this I know it sounds a little grandiose
but the mental cognitive processes that

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:07.940
but the mental cognitive processes that
 

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.240
but the mental cognitive processes that
we're targeting are ones that narrow

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:10.250
we're targeting are ones that narrow

we're targeting are ones that narrow
human beings repertoire and make it

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:12.380
human beings repertoire and make it
 

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.260
human beings repertoire and make it
harder for them to learn to be more

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:14.270
harder for them to learn to be more
 

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.210

opportunities in front of them and we

opportunities in front of them and we
think that's something we can have

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:22.570
think that's something we can have

something to say about some of the help

something to say about some of the help
within all of these different areas

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680
within all of these different areas
 

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.930
within all of these different areas
maybe even in areas like child

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:28.940

so we've taken the work for example into

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.130
so we've taken the work for example into
 

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.009
so we've taken the work for example into

things like prejudice and stigma because
 

00:14:42.019 --> 00:14:43.600
things like prejudice and stigma because
in the modern world if we can't solve

in the modern world if we can't solve

in the modern world if we can't solve
that we have planes flying into

that we have planes flying into
 

00:14:45.769 --> 00:14:47.710
that we have planes flying into
buildings and then we have planes flying

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:47.720
buildings and then we have planes flying
 

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:51.970

dehumanization that's on the planet
isn't something we can tolerate anymore

isn't something we can tolerate anymore

isn't something we can tolerate anymore
in a world and that's coming of suitcase

00:15:02.379 --> 00:15:02.389
in a world and that's coming of suitcase
 

00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:04.720
in a world and that's coming of suitcase
bombs and the ability to amplify that

bombs and the ability to amplify that
 

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:09.210
bombs and the ability to amplify that
hate out into harm towards each other so

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:09.220
hate out into harm towards each other so

there's many different definitions of it
 

00:15:20.589 --> 00:15:22.650
there's many different definitions of it
well I think one dangerous definition of

well I think one dangerous definition of
 

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.110
well I think one dangerous definition of

well brain disease there would be a
 

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.499
well brain disease there would be a
specific biological marker for the so

that it's a brain disease is the brain
 

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:02.239
that it's a brain disease is the brain
involved in depression yes the brain is

00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:02.249
involved in depression yes the brain is
 

00:25:02.249 --> 00:25:03.889
involved in depression yes the brain is
involved with what you and I are doing

00:25:03.889 --> 00:25:03.899

right now neither one of us had a brain

00:25:05.989 --> 00:25:05.999
right now neither one of us had a brain

we wouldn't be having a conversation but
 

00:25:08.399 --> 00:25:10.249
we wouldn't be having a conversation but
that doesn't mean it's a brain disease

00:25:10.249 --> 00:25:10.259
that doesn't mean it's a brain disease
 

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:13.450
that doesn't mean it's a brain disease
and so the prescriber is very often

00:25:13.450 --> 00:25:13.460
and so the prescriber is very often
 

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.879
and so the prescriber is very often
overstate oversell and the detail people

overstate oversell and the detail people
 

00:25:16.889 --> 00:25:18.349
overstate oversell and the detail people
are only too happy to tell them to do

00:25:18.349 --> 00:25:18.359
are only too happy to tell them to do
 

00:25:18.359 --> 00:25:20.479
are only too happy to tell them to do
that this idea that there's something

that this idea that there's something
wrong with your brain and because of

wrong with your brain and because of
 

00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:23.299
wrong with your brain and because of
that you're permanently by the way

that you're permanently by the way
 

00:25:23.309 --> 00:25:25.279
that you're permanently by the way
almost never are these medications

00:25:25.279 --> 00:25:25.289
almost never are these medications
 

00:25:25.289 --> 00:25:27.499
almost never are these medications
evaluated with what will happen if

00:25:27.499 --> 00:25:27.509
evaluated with what will happen if
 

00:25:27.509 --> 00:25:30.379
evaluated with what will happen if
you're on them for 3 4 or 5 10 15 years

00:25:30.379 --> 00:25:30.389
you're on them for 3 4 or 5 10 15 years
 

00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:32.119
you're on them for 3 4 or 5 10 15 years
sometimes some of the side effects that

00:25:32.119 --> 00:25:32.129
sometimes some of the side effects that
 

00:25:32.129 --> 00:25:32.960
sometimes some of the side effects that
come up come up

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:32.970
come up come up
 

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.879
come up come up
only later and sometimes they're very

00:25:34.879 --> 00:25:34.889
only later and sometimes they're very
 

00:25:34.889 --> 00:25:38.810
only later and sometimes they're very
severe even a reversible side effects so

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:38.820
severe even a reversible side effects so
 

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.799
severe even a reversible side effects so
I would like it to be more like yes

00:25:41.799 --> 00:25:41.809
I would like it to be more like yes
 

00:25:41.809 --> 00:25:44.450
I would like it to be more like yes
these medications might be helpful to a

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460
these medications might be helpful to a
 

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.919
these medications might be helpful to a
degree but what they do in areas like

00:25:48.919 --> 00:25:48.929
degree but what they do in areas like
 

00:25:48.929 --> 00:25:50.899
degree but what they do in areas like
depression or antipsychotics is they

00:25:50.899 --> 00:25:50.909
depression or antipsychotics is they
 

00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:52.759
depression or antipsychotics is they
give you a little more distance between

00:25:52.759 --> 00:25:52.769
give you a little more distance between
 

00:25:52.769 --> 00:25:54.799
give you a little more distance between
the things that cause you to get

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:54.809
the things that cause you to get
 

00:25:54.809 --> 00:25:57.289
the things that cause you to get
entangled with thoughts and feelings and

00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299
entangled with thoughts and feelings and
 

00:25:57.299 --> 00:25:59.889
entangled with thoughts and feelings and
so they might be of some help now can

00:25:59.889 --> 00:25:59.899
so they might be of some help now can
 

00:25:59.899 --> 00:26:02.629
so they might be of some help now can
open up a little window now can we go in

00:26:02.629 --> 00:26:02.639
open up a little window now can we go in
 

00:26:02.639 --> 00:26:04.279
open up a little window now can we go in
there and learn some of these methods

00:26:04.279 --> 00:26:04.289
there and learn some of these methods
 

00:26:04.289 --> 00:26:07.149
there and learn some of these methods
directly to do that for example

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159
directly to do that for example
 

00:26:07.159 --> 00:26:09.349
directly to do that for example
antidepressant medications you still

00:26:09.349 --> 00:26:09.359
antidepressant medications you still
 

00:26:09.359 --> 00:26:10.839
antidepressant medications you still
have some depressive thoughts

00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:10.849
have some depressive thoughts
 

00:26:10.849 --> 00:26:13.039
have some depressive thoughts
antipsychotic medications you still have

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:13.049
antipsychotic medications you still have
 

00:26:13.049 --> 00:26:14.659
antipsychotic medications you still have
some psychotic symptoms for the vast

00:26:14.659 --> 00:26:14.669
some psychotic symptoms for the vast
 

00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:16.729
some psychotic symptoms for the vast
majority than people taking them but it

00:26:16.729 --> 00:26:16.739
majority than people taking them but it
 

00:26:16.739 --> 00:26:18.799
majority than people taking them but it
gives them a little separation and it

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:18.809
gives them a little separation and it
 

00:26:18.809 --> 00:26:20.989
gives them a little separation and it
doesn't controls behavior as much when

00:26:20.989 --> 00:26:20.999
doesn't controls behavior as much when
 

00:26:20.999 --> 00:26:22.639
doesn't controls behavior as much when
you have a sad feeling difficult thought

00:26:22.639 --> 00:26:22.649
you have a sad feeling difficult thought
 

00:26:22.649 --> 00:26:25.729
you have a sad feeling difficult thought
an odd perceptual experience we can

00:26:25.729 --> 00:26:25.739
an odd perceptual experience we can
 

00:26:25.739 --> 00:26:28.820
an odd perceptual experience we can
teach people those exact skills in

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:28.830
teach people those exact skills in
 

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.099
teach people those exact skills in
therapy and so evidence is pretty good

00:26:31.099 --> 00:26:31.109
therapy and so evidence is pretty good
 

00:26:31.109 --> 00:26:32.989
therapy and so evidence is pretty good
if you use it as a just a window to get

00:26:32.989 --> 00:26:32.999
if you use it as a just a window to get
 

00:26:32.999 --> 00:26:36.009
if you use it as a just a window to get
in there and teach these skills you get

00:26:36.009 --> 00:26:36.019
in there and teach these skills you get
 

00:26:36.019 --> 00:26:38.330
in there and teach these skills you get
longer-term benefits and without the

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:38.340
longer-term benefits and without the
 

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:42.769
longer-term benefits and without the
side effects so don't be sold just

00:26:42.769 --> 00:26:42.779
side effects so don't be sold just
 

00:26:42.779 --> 00:26:44.839
side effects so don't be sold just
because a commercial interest wants to

00:26:44.839 --> 00:26:44.849
because a commercial interest wants to
 

00:26:44.849 --> 00:26:47.629

help out because average citizen can't
 

00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:51.830
help out because average citizen can't
go out and be doing we use the

go out and be doing we use the
 

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.649
go out and be doing we use the
scientific literature and focus on the

scientific literature and focus on the
 

00:26:54.659 --> 00:26:57.019
scientific literature and focus on the
processes that have low side effects and

processes that have low side effects and
 

00:26:57.029 --> 00:26:59.539
processes that have low side effects and
good long-term outcomes right now you're

00:26:59.539 --> 00:26:59.549
good long-term outcomes right now you're
 

00:26:59.549 --> 00:27:01.159
good long-term outcomes right now you're
going to find those in the psychosocial

00:27:01.159 --> 00:27:01.169
going to find those in the psychosocial
 

00:27:01.169 --> 00:27:03.619
going to find those in the psychosocial
area and the therapy area and the

act or cognitive behave
 

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:12.010
act or cognitive behave
therapy behavioral therapy and go there

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:12.020
therapy behavioral therapy and go there
 

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.830
therapy behavioral therapy and go there
first rather than going to the pill

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840
first rather than going to the pill
 

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.810
first rather than going to the pill
bottle as if it's going to be the the

bottle as if it's going to be the the
 

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.320
bottle as if it's going to be the the
end of your journey the sort of its

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:21.330
end of your journey the sort of its

gonna solve the problem very often it's

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:24.900
gonna solve the problem very often it's
 

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.860
gonna solve the problem very often it's
only gonna help and even only to a minor

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:27.870
only gonna help and even only to a minor
 

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:32.150
only gonna help and even only to a minor
degree and more is going to be needed

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:32.160
 

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.150
well the advice I'd give and if you were

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:35.160
well the advice I'd give and if you were
 

00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:36.320
well the advice I'd give and if you were
my patient I'd be a little different

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:36.330
my patient I'd be a little different
 

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:37.730
my patient I'd be a little different
because we'd have a little more time but

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.740
because we'd have a little more time but
 

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.500
because we'd have a little more time but
