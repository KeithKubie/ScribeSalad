First it was loops, then methods,
then class inheritance, and now modules.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.310
When it comes to keeping code dry,

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.330
there's no shortage of
tools you can use in Ruby.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.400
Whether your project is big or

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.550
small, it's important to practice
using these tools whenever you can.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.280
With enough practice, you will start to
develop an intuition about code patterns

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.100
and refactoring strategies.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.520
It definitely takes time,
but it's worth it.
