1
00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.510
Like a boss.

2
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.670
I was watching something on that Tesla s and it's like the self driving fucking

3
00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:15.710
car and these two guys computer,
look at guys,

4
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:17.330
I'll say that because they both had glasses.

5
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:21.290
So if you have glasses in my world that means you're smart and a lot of people's

6
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:25.100
world it meets that you know.
But you know I want to be politically correct.

7
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:28.520
Maybe they will both a couple of fuckheads but anyways,

8
00:00:28.521 --> 00:00:30.060
they were in this car and uh,

9
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:35.120
they put on the self driving mode and according to the video they put blankets

10
00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:37.280
over themselves and they took a fucking nap.

11
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.150
<v 0>Now Tesla said that there's some alarming youtube videos of people doing shit in</v>

13
00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:56.070
their cars that you're not supposed to be doing,

14
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.350
but they basically took a nap and then somebody wrote in one of the comments

15
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:05.910
underneath it like,
would you get arrested if you got shit faced,

16
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.970
put it on self driving mode and then sat in the backseat

17
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.030
and you don't make,
you don't know me.
Maybe you're thinking of me,

18
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:17.070
but I'm always bitching about technology.

19
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:21.630
I actually am coming around to the self driving car.

20
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.400
Just provided that you could still drive it if you want to.
Um,
cause that is,

21
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.630
that is pretty fucking cool.

22
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:32.400
Do you realize how fucking on a shape in life,
you know,

23
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:37.050
how bad like this is going to be for procrastinators?
You know,

24
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:40.110
the fact that they no longer have to drive themselves to work and they're going

25
00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:44.190
to be trying to finish their fucking presentation in their car.
You know,

26
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.670
you've seen people brushing their teeth or just people literally with an eye

27
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:48.504
mask on,

28
00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.130
just fucking sleeping in the jam jams and then they pull up to work.

29
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.233
You know,

30
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.500
like you set your car alarm and that's like your fucking alarm to wake you up.

31
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:02.310
Like when it stops and it's in park,
you know,

32
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.720
maybe the horn just goes bad,
bad,
bad.

33
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.980
That'd be too jarring.
They'd be too jarring for people are the future.
Right.

34
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.010
They don't want to fucking deal with anything.
They just want to lay around.

35
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:17.130
Right.
So they fucking let you lay there in the car.
And I,
you know,

36
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:20.190
those fucking creepy self vibrating fucking seats.

37
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.080
When you get too close to something,
maybe it does that he just lay in there,

38
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:28.830
right?
And it just sort of shakes you a little bit and some weird creepy computer

39
00:02:28.831 --> 00:02:30.720
voice.
She can pick the voice too,
right?

40
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.490
<v 1>Take a right here.
Make that.</v>

41
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.470
Ultimately it's up to you to decide where would you like to go today?

42
00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:45.150
My young friend,
I'm Kinda hungry.
Where would you like to eat?

43
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.100
Sandwich place.
Sure.
That's what you want.
Churches.
Chicken is up on the right.

44
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.130
<v 0>You don't got no celebrities will jump all over that.</v>

45
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:57.900
They do the fucking voiceovers to make a little bit of cash because no one pays

46
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:00.820
for movies anymore.
And they're sick of being in those mighty heroes.

47
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:03.910
Fucking superhero movies,
one after another.

48
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.220
They're literally out of ideas.
Uh,

49
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.080
I mean once you have like the superhero was fighting each other that they gotta

50
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:15.700
be nervous in Hollywood just going like,
where do we go from here?
You know,

51
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.760
can we reboot this thing again?
Can we reboot the fucking joker and all that.

52
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.120
But you know what the funny thing is though,
is people will keep showing up.

53
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.690
I guess that makes sense,
right?

54
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.200
God knows they've had the comic books forever and people keep reading those.

55
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:35.050
You know what?
I'm taking that one back.
I'm wrong about that one again.

56
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:38.260
Have I been right yet?
Fuck.

57
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.270
Bunch of swings and misses

58
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.320
<v 2>car.
Mr Car,
excuse me.
Airline is an island,
so how,</v>

59
00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.240
oh no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
Stop.
Let me,

60
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.710
that's not good.
Oh No,
no.
Excuse me.
Please.
