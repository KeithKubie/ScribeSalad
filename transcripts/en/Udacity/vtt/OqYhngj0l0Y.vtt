00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.270
Let's take a quick look
at the layout of the app.

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.100
Here are the Java classes.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.510
The Dinner class has methods for
figuring out what dinner to suggest.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.990
The MainActivity shows the main screen.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.360
To start with the main screen only has
this one button, What's for dinner?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.760
And when you press the button
it fires off an intent

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.088
to the show dinner activity.

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:26.300
So the dinner shows here and
then you get these buttons.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.790
And each of these buttons fires off
an intent to start the appropriate

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.670
activity.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:31.390
So for example,

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.470
the Show Recipe button sends an intent
to start the show recipe activity.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.740
And actually, Choose Again does
not have a corresponding activity,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.020
it just has a method inside the class.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.170
Now this class here,
the useInfoBoxFragment

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.760
is a fragment that simply displays
an info box and a heading.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.760
This let's you reuse the fragment
wherever you need it, and

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.400
helps simplify the code.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.260
And for example, the showRecipeActivity,
the removeMealActivity,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.410
the orderDinnerActivity,
all these activities use this fragment.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.200
And the app has a couple of menus.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.500
There's the main menu,
which just shows the settings.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.980
But actually, we're not going to use
the settings in this application.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.720
More interestingly, the food prefs menu,
displays a list of food options.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.010
This pop-up is used whenever we want
the user, choose the food preference.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.840
There's one other quick
thing I want to mention.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.450
In the intro lesson to this
course you learned how to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.250
implement the unconnected code to
use the Google API Client Library.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.790
However, for both Google Analytics and
Google Tag Manager,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.540
you do not need to implement any code
to use the Google API Client Library.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.040
All the app needs is to specify
the version of the client library

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.540
in the android manifest, like this.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.030
And to specify the dependency on
play-services in the build.gradle file.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.560
And these dependencies have already
been set up for you in the What's For

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.370
Dinner sample app.
