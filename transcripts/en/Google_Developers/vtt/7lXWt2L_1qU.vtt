LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.980
Louis Gray here from
the Moscone

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.970
Center at San Francisco.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.950
I've got Chris Lyon, hardware
engineer on the Chromebook

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.060
Pixel here with me,
as well as Andrew

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.450
Bowers, director of product.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.270
So I'm really excited to have
you guys both onstage.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.710
Thanks for joining me again.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.790
CHRIS LYON: Thank you.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.200
ANDREW BOWERS: Thank you.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.200
LOUIS GRAY: Now, the Chromebook
Pixel, it's just

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.620
been one of the best devices
I've ever had.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.390
Just straight out.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.200
Chrome OS has really been
something that's really

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.280
intriguing to me for
a long time.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.680
We've really enjoyed having
the ability to have all my

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.760
content in one place.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.120
And you can switch from computer
to computer, and it

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.350
follows you.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.370
But for the first time ever,
this is a device that was

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.770
completely designed in
hardware by Google.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.570
So I wanted to talk to
you guys about that.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.570
And talk me through that
process, in terms of how did

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.580
that happen?

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.960
And what were we trying
to achieve?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.400
ANDREW BOWERS: Yeah.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.110
So the first thing we were
trying to do is really just

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.350
create the best Chromebook
possible, no holds barred, and

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.530
really thinking about someone
who's using a Chromebook all

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.430
day long as well.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.900
So a lot of focus, attention
to detail, on

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.970
how the device feels.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.780
We really want the hardware
to disappear.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.430
We want to make it feel like an
immersive movie, where you

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.910
forget that you're in a movie
theater and you're just really

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.130
focused on what you're doing.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.460
And so part of that's making
that hardware disappear so you

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.320
don't feel the keyboard, the
trackpad, things like that.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.280
LOUIS GRAY: Now, what are the
kind of attributes in hardware

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.420
that you were trying
to get to?

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.510
How did you decide whether it
had an 11-inch screen or a

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.950
15-inch screen?

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.380
What were the things where you
made a decision on that?

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.410
How do you go about deciding?

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.520
CHRIS LYON: So for those items,
when we were setting

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.890
out in the early design process,
we did a large number

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.270
of user studies on various
screen sizes, various

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.060
configurations, keyboard
placement, et cetera.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.730
And a lot of those various
parameters all fit together to

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.470
give us the proper shape
of the laptop.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.960
One of the early goals was
we definitely wanted an

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.370
absolutely full metal
enclosure.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.800
It feels very nice hold,
really solid design.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.070
But that comes with a lot of
additional challenges as to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.480
how you fit all of the
other components

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.960
together inside the system.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.800
LOUIS GRAY: OK.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.620
And so when I look at this,
having tried the previous

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.690
Chromebook models that were
plastic, they'd come out.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.810
They were very light.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.270
This one has a stronger feel.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.730
It's kind of more industrial.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.970
And one of the things that's
happened as a result of

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.330
making, I guess, the ultimate
Chromebook is it's a little

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.080
bit more expensive than the
original Chromebook.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.680
We've been looking at.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.460
Samsung.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.630
I've got three of those
at my house.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.370
Got one for my wife.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.200
Got one for myself.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.380
Got two for my parents.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.750
And they're all $249.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.950
And obviously, the Pixel
is a different beast.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.660
It's starting at, I think,
$1,249, and you basically got

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.020
a little bit more expensive.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.530
So what was the thought
behind that?

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.240
Was that something where we
wanted to set it up kind of as

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.810
a reference model?

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.730
Or do we expect these to
be for the mass market?

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.710
CHRIS LYON: So Pixel should be
thought of as a halo device,

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.190
something where we really want
to showcase a large number of

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.830
new technologies that aren't
necessarily in the other

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.530
Chromebooks, but things that
we want developers to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.930
experiment with--

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.730
things like the high pixel
density touchscreen, things

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:03.940
like keyboard backlight.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.980
I'm not sure if you're
aware, but there's a

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.530
microphone array in here.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.620
There's two up top
for beam forming.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.330
There's noise cancellation.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.130
There's the LTE.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.790
This is the first Chromebook
with that.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.060
And again, these are a number of
features where the hardware

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.350
has to lead the software
a bit.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.460
We have to get the features out
there, build a critical

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.910
mass of users, and then
encourage the developers to

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.100
target those features.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.070
LOUIS GRAY: You mentioned
the high screen density.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.920
One thing about the Pixel is
that you shouldn't have to

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.870
ever see a pixel.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.490
I mean, that's sort of what
we've been talking about.

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.170
You say Chrome.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.320
You want to get the Chrome out
of the way, the browser, and

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.970
really have the user be directly
interfacing with

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.480
their data, with
their content.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.790
I'm glad you mentioned LTE.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.090
I'm actually on LTE right now.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.440
The Wi-Fi at the conference has
been really exceptional.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.290
It goes up.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.980
It goes down.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.800
There's a lot of people fighting
for attention, and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.060
I've really cut through all
of that by getting on LTE.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.630
And having it on this type of
a device has really been

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.590
exceptional.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.190
And so when I look at the Pixel
specifically, there's

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.950
really those three things
that have set it apart--

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.450
the inclusion of the LTE, the
high density pixel screen, and

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.370
the touch aspect of it.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.910
Now, touch is something you
traditionally accept with a

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.990
tablet or a mobile phone.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.740
What was the thought process
behind having a touchscreen?

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.810
And how are we seeing users
behave with the touchscreen,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.630
or possibly developers
coding for it?

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.350
ANDREW BOWERS: So I think that
you hit on it right there,

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.950
which is touchscreens
are becoming

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.580
pervasive in our lives.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.800
So they're on your phone.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.580
They're on tablets.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.960
They're even on ATMs and
the gas station pumps.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.010
And so if you look at children
interacting with a laptop,

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.850
they've probably used their
parents' phone or their

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.680
tablet, and so they're touching
the screen already.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.140
And so it's just a very
intuitive way versus an

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:45.610
indirect on a trackpad
or a mouse.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.620
And so we're seeing it become
more and more pervasive, and

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.640
we think of it as yet
another way to

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.040
interact with the computer.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.070
It's not the only way you
interact with a laptop, but

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.620
it's another way.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.560
So to give you an example, on
Tuesday I spent five hours on

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.600
a plane, a cramped seat.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.470
But I could hold my Pixel like
this, and I could scroll and

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.190
archive email on the plane
much more easily.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.120
LOUIS GRAY: The viewers at home
can't see your hands.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.870
ANDREW BOWERS: That's
a good point.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.990
So a lot of times, you'll find
you'll use something in a

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.580
different way.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.810
Like for instance, when you're
cramped in on plane, using it

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.600
like this rather than having
to use the trackpad.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.320
So it opens up new
opportunities.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.520
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.730
Absolutely.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.610
And I've seen that a lot.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.290
There's one really cool thing
that you get the right screen

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.180
combination, you can rotate the
entire screen 90 degrees

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.930
or 180 degrees to be fixed.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:33.160
And literally, you look at the
Chromebook right side up, even

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.690
if it's on its side, which
is kind of entertaining.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.530
And so for a lot of people who
have like a vertical monitor,

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.530
I can see them possibly
extending out and having that

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:41.640
vertical monitor.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.190
And the processor in here is
strong enough that they can

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.090
push all those pixels even in
that new configuration.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:49.790
So I want to talk a little
bit about the speed.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:51.865
This is obviously faster.

00:05:51.865 --> 00:05:52.980
It's faster.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.830
It's brighter.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.100
It's got a lot of attributes
to it.

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.600
So what about the speed?

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.600
How did that come into play?

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.560
CHRIS LYON: So we designed the
Pixel to be Chrome fast.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.660
The idea here was hardware
should not get in the way of

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.710
the experience.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.760
We wanted this to be able to
show off the browser and the

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.060
operating system as
well as possible.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.480
This is an Intel
i5 CPU in here.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.070
There's four gigabytes of RAM,
pretty standard other features

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.550
internally aside from that.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.050
But it's more than
enough for web

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.860
applications, for HTML5 games.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.640
And it should actually enable a
significant amount of future

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.500
development coming there.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.710
One of the things we're really
excited about is HTML5 games

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.680
are becoming more and
more popular.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.700
And actually, we're seeing
developers make use of the

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.700
touchscreen, of the
high PPI display.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:42.490
And we're really hoping that
as we can build more of a

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.840
critical mass of systems out
there with those features that

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.940
people will be implementing
more and more higher end

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:50.640
applications.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.110
So we really wanted to make
sure that it had the

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.550
horsepower under the
hood there to be

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.130
able to handle that.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:56.115
ANDREW BOWERS: And just to
add to that real quick.

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:58.956
I think one of the ways we also
think about is not we

00:06:58.956 --> 00:07:01.460
don't want consumers to have to
think about what processor

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.860
do they have in the machine.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.800
We just want it to be, is
it fast enough for what

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.090
I want it to do?

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.520
And so we want to get
to that world too.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.170
LOUIS GRAY: And one of things
that I've experienced having

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.350
the touchscreen on the laptop
is you can have more of an

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.680
immersive experience, be
it with Maps or Photos.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.070
There's something really
breathtaking about diving into

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.140
Google Maps or the Google+
Photos experience and just

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.710
being able to pinch to zoom
and getting right

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.380
into what you want.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.870
And you just swipe to the side
and have it go away.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.990
And it's something that's
really become natural.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.280
It's one of those funny things
about having a glossy screen

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.750
that you touch all the time.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.810
I was in the car the other day
making a quick web change--

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.690
I was on LTE-- and I
saw my fingerprints

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.830
all over the screen.

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.560
How do you guys handle just
managing that type of thing,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.080
where you get a little bit dirty
and you clean it off?

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.670
So what do you think about
that kind of stuff?

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:45.140
ANDREW BOWERS: It's
called a cloth.

00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:46.940
CHRIS LYON: It is actually a big
engineering challenge, and

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:49.210
it is something that we
put a fair amount of

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.430
work into with Pixel.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.120
Obviously, there's still a
long ways to go in that

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.310
direction, and it's something
we're continuing to research.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:56.320
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah, it's one
of those fun things.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.490
And you don't realize how often
you touch it until you

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:00.739
get the little bit of glare, and
you're like wow, I touch

00:08:00.739 --> 00:08:01.760
this thing all the time.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.930
You've got the hands on there.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.300
CHRIS LYON: One of the nice
things though-- the screen is

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:08.620
Gorilla Glass coating,
just very resilient.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.310
So at least even if you are
smudging it, you don't have to

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.090
worry about damaging it.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:13.930
LOUIS GRAY: What I find is I
often am reaching to other

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.610
people's computers and expecting
that I can impact

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.310
the touchscreen.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:17.940
And I'm like, are
you kidding me?

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.240
Why are you using
that product?

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.680
CHRIS LYON: Actually, that's
been an interesting problem in

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.110
the office.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.950
So when we were using these
initially internally a lot,

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.920
people got in the habit of when
they'd written an email

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.110
then just pushing the Send or
the Compose button on there.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.510
And you'd see people walking
around when this was still

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.700
secret and we couldn't have
them in every meeting.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.299
And they'd have their ThinkPad
out, and they'd push the

00:08:36.299 --> 00:08:37.059
screen, and they'd get mad.

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:38.110
LOUIS GRAY: Nothing
would happen.

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.010
CHRIS LYON: Definitely a number
of our vendors and

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.270
partners probably caught
on to that.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.709
LOUIS GRAY: We have like five
minutes left, so I want to

00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:45.470
talk a little about Chrome OS.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.690
Now, you know Chrome OS is still
a little bit new for a

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.980
lot of people, and it's really
kind of growing in maturity in

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:50.900
terms of the capability.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.030
Every time Chrome gets better,
Chrome OS gets better.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.580
And about two years ago-- maybe
it was even three at

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.440
this point-- with the Cr-48
model coming out, really kind

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.280
of the first reference
point of having a

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.570
Chrome device out there.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:04.120
It wasn't super fast.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.140
There were some aspects of the
hardware which were not

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.270
perfect, but it was a
fun reference point.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.620
And since then, we've continued
to see iterations

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.725
from Chrome via devices from
Samsung, Lenovo, HP, Acer.

00:09:15.725 --> 00:09:17.240
I hope I've mentioned
them all.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.450
And you've seen people come up
with different price points

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:20.520
and different sizes.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.450
Now, what has been your kind of
response to see how Chrome

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:25.070
OS is evolving?

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.010
And what is left?

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.340
What is kind of the last things
that the Chrome OS

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.030
should be doing, where people
can really safely leave more

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:36.190
traditional operating systems?

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:38.960
ANDREW BOWERS: So the Samsung
Chromebook has been the number

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.540
one laptop on Amazon for about
190 days since its launch,

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:43.710
consecutively.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.220
And so I think that speaks for
itself in terms of what people

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:48.530
are ready for.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:51.600
With the Pixel, we've taken it
a step further as well in

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.140
terms of there are a lot of
people that wanted high-end

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.430
hardware, precision hardware.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:57.720
They spend 10 hours a
day on a Chromebook.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:01.540
And so when we say for everyone,
we don't just mean

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:05.580
people that want a very
affordable laptop, but also a

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:08.110
precision experience with a
great keyboard and trackpad

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:08.850
and touchscreen.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.210
And so with the Pixel, we're
bringing that as well.

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:13.250
So you cover different
needs out there

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:14.280
for different people.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.590
LOUIS GRAY: Sure.

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:16.510
And I think you're mentioning
that you say for everyone, but

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:18.650
it's also for everything.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:22.320
As someone who's very Google
Drive-centric, with all of my

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.840
files and my applications there,
going to Gmail, going

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.800
to my Google+, I really believe
at this point every

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.770
computer is my computer.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.850
So long as I can get
to my Google

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:32.160
content, it's all there.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.320
But actually, I'd much rather
be using a Pixel.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.250
If you handed me a ThinkPad,
I'd be fine.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.530
I'd be able to boot up Chrome
and do all my work.

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.610
But with the Pixel, it just
has such kind of a

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.470
professional, high quality
experience.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:44.640
You don't want to suffer the
screen display of something

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.610
else which isn't as strong.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.880
And even just the little bits
with like the keys and the

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.130
hardware and the trackpad are
so professionally designed.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.230
And so I think you can really
see that, for those people who

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.083
do get an opportunity to
get their hands on it

00:10:56.083 --> 00:10:57.700
to check that out.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:00.220
So for the many people who are
watching on the livestream,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.386
how do they get their
hands on a Pixel?

00:11:02.386 --> 00:11:04.270
ANDREW BOWERS: So they can go
to the Google Play store

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.380
online or bestbuy.com as well.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.670
LOUIS GRAY: And Best Buy
has them in display.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.510
I remember that's actually
where I bought the three

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:12.820
Samsung Chromebooks
that I got.

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.360
I almost cleaned them out.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.770
And I think I sold five other
ones in the 10 minutes I was

00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.290
there just playing demo.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.680
And so I think it's great that
you have the Pixels out there

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.410
getting really big
distribution.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.490
Anything else that the viewers
should know about the Pixel

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:26.950
before we cut?

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.440
ANDREW BOWERS: I think that you
really have to experience

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.460
it to understand what it
is and what it means.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.240
And I think it brings
Chromebooks to a whole other

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.095
level of user that want
to use Chromebooks.

00:11:39.095 --> 00:11:41.940
And so we hope that it'll open
up a lot of opportunities for

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.420
people to experience Chromebooks
and how easy they

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.586
are to use and how great it
is to live with them.

00:11:46.586 --> 00:11:48.370
LOUIS GRAY: Well, thank you
very much, both for you

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:50.600
joining me on stage and for
all the work that you did

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.110
putting into this product.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:54.940
It's obviously something I use
every single day, not just at

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:55.470
the conference.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.780
And I constantly run into
my kids saying, hey,

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:58.290
Daddy, look at that.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.420
And they'll click on my
touchscreen and accidentally

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.900
click on an ad or something.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.080
But they understand exactly
how to interface with a

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.560
touchscreen, because they've
been growing up with tablets.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.080
And we're seeing really the next
generation of personal

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.620
computing happen right
in front of us.

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:10.980
So thank you very
much for that.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:11.300
CHRIS LYON: Thank you.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.150
LOUIS GRAY: So for all of you
watching on this livestream,

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.520
appreciate you joining us.

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.380
We're going to kick you
back to the sessions.

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.360
I believe up next we have
an event with Android.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.860
You won't want to miss Reto
Meier talking with Hugo Barra

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.110
and Hiroshi Lockheimer.
