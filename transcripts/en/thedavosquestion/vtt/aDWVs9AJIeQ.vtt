&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Majid Abraham and, uh, I'm answering
at Davos the key

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.130
question which is what countries can do to
improve the world.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.280
Every country shares the same, uh, challenge
that if they do correctly

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.180
they can definitely improve the status of
their population in the

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.040
world and that is education.
Umm, but we also know that there are a lot

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.230
of different standards of
education across the different countries and

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.900
in particular there is a
lot of, uh, points of views that are very

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.710
different across the
countries.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.370
And what would be really interesting is to
create ultimately some kind

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.810
of a forum for young students, uh, maybe selected
by a process like

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.100
"American Idol" but would be "The Davos Idol"
or would be "The World

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.160
Idol," uh, where, umm, the local TV programs
would take very -- would

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.439
take interest in the competition at the local
level and we will also

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.049
cover it in terms of what happens at the global
level and it would

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.159
serve as a mechanism to, uh, share a, uh -- share
a dialogue and

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.040
eventually hopefully share a common point
of view on the challenges,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.920
uh, that the world, uh, faces, uh, what the
different countries, uh,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.570
can do but mostly to help, uh -- to help make
the, uh, the opinions

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.630
and the ideas that are available in different
countries, uh, become

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.180
more harmonious and to learn about what, uh,
other people consider as

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.440
important.
