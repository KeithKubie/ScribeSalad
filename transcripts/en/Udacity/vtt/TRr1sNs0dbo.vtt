00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.010
This lesson was hard. And it's hard to learn

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.320
and it's equally as hard to teach. But there're

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.210
some major concepts I want you to take away

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.430
from this. So let's try to summarize them into five

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.950
main points. Point one. Most traits are complex. And

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.930
they exemplify the paradigm of nature and nurture. Point

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.110
two, polygenic traits like eye color are controlled by

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.060
multiple genes with minimal environmental

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.750
influence, whereas multifactorial traits are

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.560
controlled by multiple genes with a measurable

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.380
environmental impact. Point three, quantitative traits like

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.420
weight and height vary continuously over a

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.770
range of measurements. Whereas qualitative traits, like Huntington's

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.800
disease, are either present or their not.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.550
Point four, monozygotic and dizygotic twins are useful

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.750
in studying the heritability of a trait,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.020
when twin correlations are helpful for quantitative traits,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.540
and twin concordances are useful for qualitative

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.965
traits. And point five. Genome wide association

00:00:56.965 --> 00:00:59.461
studies are useful in determining whether any

00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:02.820
candidate alleles influence a particularly complex trait.
