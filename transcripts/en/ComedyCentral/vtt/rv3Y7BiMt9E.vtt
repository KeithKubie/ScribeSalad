00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.415
Their Ex?"

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.680
The game show where two
contestants compete to prove

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.014
they're doing totally fine.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.255
Let's meet our players,
Amy and Julian.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.460
Come on out, guys.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.860
Welcome to the show.
No.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.720
Amy, tell us about your
relationship.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.680
Oh, well, actually Aiden and I
aren't broken up-broken up.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.583
We're just kind of on hiatus
because he made out with

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:23.750
somebody at a party in front of
me, and I totally overreacted.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.040
I tried to apologize,
but it was too late.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.800
I already made things
super weird.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.260
Pathetic.
Julian.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.820
Oh... story's
a little different.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.080
I was about to propose
to Maggie.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.480
Who wouldn't, right?

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.350
And then she, uh, decided
to move to San Francisco.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.695
But it's cool.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.160
I have my own things going on,
you know what I mean?

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.020
I developed this new
social networking app.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.255
It's called Klooper.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.895
And you'll be hearing
about it.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.635
No, I won't.
Let's play!

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.976
Contestants, you will now
receive a phone call

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.480
from your ex.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.416
Whoever holds out the longest
without picking up plays first.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.820
He looks like Aiden.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.280
Not even remotely.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.360
(phone vibrating)

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.297
Remember, all you have to do
is nothing.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.971
You just have to have
an ounce of dignity.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.580
Hey, are you in town or--
(buzzer)

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.040
You fool, it was me.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.000
Is she--
Is she with you?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.860
No, she's not with me,
she's in San Francisco

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.295
having the time of her life.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.900
You're with me
in this room.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.435
Amy, you've got control
of the board.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.611
Hit that button
to select your challenge.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.880
"Mutual Friend!"

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.540
Okay, Amy,
your challenge is

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.075
to have a conversation
with a mutual friend of Aiden's

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.415
and not ask about him.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.255
Let's bring out your friend
Melanie.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.196
Hey, Mel.
Hey.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.300
What's up?

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.700
Nothing... hung over.
Ugh.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.135
What'd you get into
last night?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.476
Oh, popcorn at home.
You?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.650
Some party in Greenpoint.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.760
Did you go with Kelly or...

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.420
Yeah.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.790
Was Aiden there?
(buzzer)

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.500
Yeah.
Okay, what was his
vibe like?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.960
Like, did he seem sad or--
Disappointing.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.160
All right, Julian,
you've got control.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.760
Hit that button.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.640
"Change Your Status!"

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.140
Okay, Julian, your challenge
is simply to change

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.140
your online
relationship status.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.900
Okay, piece of cake.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.140
No problem.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.240
We're just gonna
change that to

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.075
"It's Complicated."
(buzzer)

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.180
Hear me out.
Nothing complicated about it.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.182
You are alone, Julian.
Amy, hit that button.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.640
"No Excuses!"
All right, Amy,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.000
your challenge is to hear
a piece of information

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.500
that could be used as an
excuse to reach out to your ex

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.960
and not act on it.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.460
Oh.
Not a problem.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.920
It shouldn't be,
but here we are.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.320
"There was a fire four blocks
and two avenues away

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.220
from Aiden's house yesterday."

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.120
The thing with this particular
one is that he walks to work

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.155
that way sometimes,
so I feel like

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.760
I should probably just
step out and call him

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.795
and make sure he's okay.
(buzzer)

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.160
Actually, you know
he's okay because

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.820
he was at that party
in Greenpoint.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.120
You really need to
pull yourself together,

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.620
you're embarrassing
yourself on television.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.631
All right, it's time to play
the final round.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.677
Contestants, please step into
the nostalgia chamber.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.280
♪

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.480
Your challenge is
to hear the song

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.380
"I Can't Make You Love Me"
by Bonnie Raitt

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.120
and not cry or eat carrot cake--
are you ready?

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.120
Uh, can we do
a different song?

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.260
No.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.895
Play the song.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.260
(muffled song playing)

Julian's crying and eating cake.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.500
Amy, that makes you our winner!
Step on out of there!

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.070
Congratulations,
your prize is Aiden.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.440
You win your ex back, Amy.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.975
Oh!
Oh, my God!

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.640
Baby, I missed you so much!

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.375
(buzzer)

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.040
Ooh, sorry, Amy, but that was
your final test.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.340
You're not over your ex.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.300
What?
Tough break.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.635
(mumbling)

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.595
Yeah, sorry about that.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.235
Julian, you don't win either.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.876
Nobody wins.
There's no way to win this game.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.440
Well, that's all the time
we have.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.640
Tina, if you're watching,
give me a call anytime.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.509
(bleep) you, I love you--
this is all for you!
