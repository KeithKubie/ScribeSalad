but of course they are they are
 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.330 align:start position:0%
but of course they are they are
development<00:00:38.469><c> of</c><00:00:38.559><c> each</c><00:00:38.620><c> other</c><00:00:38.860><c> and</c><00:00:39.100><c> there</c><00:00:39.280><c> is</c>

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 align:start position:0%
development of each other and there is
 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
development of each other and there is
it<00:00:39.520><c> there</c><00:00:39.790><c> is</c><00:00:39.880><c> a</c><00:00:39.910><c> continuation</c><00:00:40.540><c> yeah</c><00:00:40.690><c> I</c><00:00:40.720><c> think</c>

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:40.990 align:start position:0%
it there is a continuation yeah I think
 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
it there is a continuation yeah I think
that's<00:00:41.860><c> our</c><00:00:42.180><c> ambition</c><00:00:43.180><c> and</c><00:00:44.490><c> our</c><00:00:45.490><c> eventual</c>

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.150 align:start position:0%
that's our ambition and our eventual
 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.530 align:start position:0%
that's our ambition and our eventual
goal<00:00:46.360><c> is</c><00:00:46.720><c> to</c><00:00:47.200><c> be</c><00:00:47.320><c> able</c><00:00:47.440><c> to</c><00:00:48.390><c> hook</c><00:00:49.390><c> together</c><00:00:50.160><c> any</c>

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:51.540 align:start position:0%
goal is to be able to hook together any

goal is to be able to hook together any
any<00:00:52.540><c> order</c><00:00:52.870><c> to</c><00:00:53.079><c> any</c><00:00:53.410><c> two</c><00:00:53.710><c> organic</c><00:00:54.130><c> groups</c><00:00:54.910><c> and</c>

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 align:start position:0%
any order to any two organic groups and
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.380 align:start position:0%
any order to any two organic groups and
we<00:00:56.590><c> believe</c><00:00:56.950><c> that</c><00:00:56.980><c> our</c><00:00:57.300><c> are</c><00:00:58.739><c> you</c><00:00:59.739><c> know</c><00:00:59.860><c> we</c><00:01:00.040><c> have</c>

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 align:start position:0%
covered a little more than halfway
 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
covered a little more than halfway
through<00:01:03.449><c> towards</c><00:01:04.449><c> this</c><00:01:04.570><c> goal</c><00:01:05.250><c> but</c><00:01:06.250><c> in</c><00:01:06.460><c> each</c>

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 align:start position:0%
through towards this goal but in each
 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.109 align:start position:0%
through towards this goal but in each
case<00:01:06.700><c> as</c><00:01:07.299><c> I</c><00:01:07.689><c> said</c><00:01:08.070><c> eventually</c><00:01:09.070><c> it</c><00:01:09.670><c> would</c><00:01:09.939><c> be</c>

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
case as I said eventually it would be
 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.129 align:start position:0%
case as I said eventually it would be
very<00:01:10.329><c> nice</c><00:01:10.630><c> to</c><00:01:10.930><c> replace</c><00:01:11.439><c> memo</c><00:01:11.799><c> with</c><00:01:12.189><c> hydrogen</c>

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:13.139 align:start position:0%
very nice to replace memo with hydrogen
 

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:16.889 align:start position:0%
very nice to replace memo with hydrogen
but<00:01:14.139><c> to</c><00:01:15.009><c> what</c><00:01:15.039><c> extent</c><00:01:15.490><c> we</c><00:01:15.700><c> can</c><00:01:15.729><c> do</c><00:01:16.060><c> is</c><00:01:16.240><c> our</c>

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 align:start position:0%
but to what extent we can do is our
