&gt;&gt; Mary Jane Deeb: Good afternoon
ladies and gentlemen and welcome

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.030
to the African Mid East Division.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.610
I am Mary Jane Deeb,
Chief of the division

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.750
and I'm delighted to
see you all here.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.810
This is a very special
program we're bringing back

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.790
to the library some
of the people we love.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:53.230
And Ms. Tambra Raye
Stevenson is one of the people

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:00.560 position:56%
who have done a great deal in her
life and has contributed in her work

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.870
to a better understanding
of a region

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.600
for which this division
is responsible for Africa.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.570
And she would share her thoughts
and her ideas with you in a moment.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.910
Before this, before
we get into the meat

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.240
of the program I always do a
little commercial for this division

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.830
and highlight the fact
that we are responsible

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.370
for seventy eight countries
in the world.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.520
We're responsible for the whole
continent of Africa, sub-Saharan,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.220
North Africa and the Middle
East and the Hebraic world.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.050
So there are three sections, the
Hebraic section which connects

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.070
from the whole world in Hebrew
and Yiddish like you know.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.000
The Near East section which extends
to another already the Arab world,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.780
Turkey and Iran but also
Central Asia and the Caucuses.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.860
And as I mentioned Africa
is the whole continent,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.960
we collect in the vernacular,
we serve people here

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.420
in the reading room
and we do programs

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.900
and conferences and exhibits.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:23.350 position:56%
And concerts, sometimes we show
films as well and we invite scholars

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.830
to come and share with them
the research and the work

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.420
and the work they're doing.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.940
So that we are all kept up to date
with the developments in the region

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:43.490
and that we help our patrons
also get a better understanding

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.640
for the culture, for the
society, for the history.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.190
And today is a case in point so
Miss Stevenson will be talking

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.720
about a very important aspect
of culture which is food.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.390
And food is not only to feed
the body, to keep us going

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.160
but it has a great
many other implications

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.260
and she will share with us.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.260
Our division is also made up
researchers of the specialists

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.730
who help the researchers
and they are the ones

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.250
who are responsible
for these programs.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.730
And so today Eve Ferguson
who is a reference librarian

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.430
in the African section
has organised this program

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.010
and will introduce the speaker.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.810
So Eve.

&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Good afternoon.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.800
I'm glad to see you all
here today on what promise

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.980
to be a really horribly rainy day,
but as my speaker who will come

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.970
up has said when you're on a
mission the weather cooperates

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.340
and obviously it did,
it stopped raining.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.140
So, what can I say about Tambra
Raye Stevenson that I'm not going

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.850
to read right now except to say

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.040
that she is perhaps the most
dynamic young woman I know.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.230
Always comes up with new
ideas, always doing something

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.380
and when I saw little WANDA I
fell in love with little WANDA.

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:17.870
She is a wonderfully cute
little character based

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.830
on a wonderfully cute little girl.

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:25.960
I'll let my speakers say more
about how little WANDA came about

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.510
and I just love the mission and I
said, you know, this is something

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.680
that we need to let
the world know about.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.190
Well, before I did a flyer or
anything she had tweeted it

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.730
out to everybody and
it went all over

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.200
and I understand we're
on Facebook live now.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.280
So, I love the way the younger
generation uses social media

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.530
to get the word out, you don't
necessarily have to be here.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.620
Of course if you're not here
you're not going to get any

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.370
of the light refreshments
that we're to serve later.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.320
So, that can't be Facebook
lived but everything else can

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:06.910
and before I read my introduction I
just want to get everybody in here

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.920
to wish Miss Tambra Raye
Stevenson a happy birthday.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.920

and a half ago but close enough.

so happy birthday Tambra, you know,

great things ahead for you.

that kick started Where's WANDA
through a crowd funding campaign.

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:16.510

preview of how far we've come.

[ Video and Music Playing ]

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:47.470
So, is as what has been shared
since the last time I was here

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.610
which is just two and
half years ago.

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:55.130
I became National Geographic travel
year of sharing my personal story

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:58.730
of really looking at
the health issues

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.690
in the Afro-American community
and realizing what can we learn

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.480
when we go back to what I
call the original soul food.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.380
African heritage foods and unlock
the secrets from those foods

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:18.120 position:56%
and that was my last presentation
back just two years ago in 2014 here

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.420
at the Library of Congress.

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:25.210
And so since then between
overcoming Ebola, Boko Haram,

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:28.230
the presidential elections
in Nigeria I fairly made

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.980
to track this summer to Nigeria

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.070
which really prompted me creating
WANDA as a way to give back

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.950
to the community in northern
Nigeria which is heavily impacted

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:41.160
by malnutrition right now.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.680 position:56%
And also recognizing that we have
shared commonalities in the struggle

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.310
around good nutrition
in our communities.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.610
It's estimated that more

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:57.170
than 3 billion people have low
quality diets that impacts eighteen

00:11:57.170 --> 00:12:02.240
of the sustainable development
goals listed by the United Nations.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.850 position:56%
So, nutrition really is the heart
of our economy as well as the health

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:12.100
of our community and so
since then having recognized

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:16.470 position:56%
that this double burden is not
simply just malnutrition in the form

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:18.170
of what we perceive it to be.

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.740
But it's also in the
form of obesity as well

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.380
in many countries including
America to Africa

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:26.880
and the Middle East are
facing this issue right now.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.300
And people are asking the question,
well, how do we make ag cool again?

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.240 position:56%
How do we inspire young people to go

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.860
into this sector of
food security in ag?

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.380
And so since then I had
an opportunity to go

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:44.400
to the African Union Summit on food
security and ag in 2014 and wrestle

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:47.850
with that question we had to
make a pledge how were we going

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:49.800
to address youth unemployment.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.840
And I look within and
said, you know,

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.220
with the issues going on between.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:59.700
As a child I did not
embrace my womanhood,

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:04.800
I did not embrace my heritage, I
didn't really embrace my culture

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.510
and I think that was
a survival technique.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:12.540
And I think over time having
gone on to become a mother,

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:17.160
having gone on to realize that
yoga retreats helped as well

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.020 position:56%
that everything I needed was already
within me and so from there that's

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.700
where I found the source of
inspiration of creating WANDA

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.220
because of everything
led up to that point.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:38.380
So, one interesting stat that I
couldn't believe that NCD free

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:44.850
which is an international NGO
shared that in 2015 more people die

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.670
from heart disease,
diabetes which are known

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:53.700
as non-communicable diseases than
HIV, TB and malaria combined.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.650
And these diseases
are all preventable,

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.570
it's based off lifestyle, it's
based off developmental policies

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.710
that create jobs in the
name of fast food chains

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:09.700 position:56%
across Sub-Saharan Africa and
Northern Africa and the Middle East.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:16.300
And how do we harness the potential
of the local foods, the local women

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:21.250
and girls to be able to
provide a better viable option

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.550
that improves the health

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:26.890
and the economic outlook
for these communities.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:31.050
And so some of these diseases
I've already stated and the some

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.850
of the risk factors I've mentioned
as well such as unhealthy diets,

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:40.790 position:56%
obesity as well as even gender
which we'll focus on now with WANDA.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:45.040
So, when you Google black women
in agriculture and when you're try

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:50.480
to overcome stereotypes this is
the kind of images that pop up

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:56.020
and I think when we think about
people who aspire to go into sports

00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:01.840
or music you have characters
that are portrayed

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.750
in a really bright light, right?

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:05.350
But when you Google things

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.600
like agriculture you
don't see positive images

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:13.840
and that really reminded
me why I choose not to go

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.530
in this sector even though
I grew up in Oklahoma

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:20.230
in a very agricultural state
cows across the street.

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:27.450 position:56%
Is that an ag town, Stillwater,
Oklahoma and surrounded by livestock

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:31.290
and I wanted to get out of there
and I think a lot of people

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.540
in the room whether here again
in America or Africa head

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.020
for the city's thinking
life will be better for you.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:43.120
But ultimately it is the land
that is part of our survival

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.700
and so it's taken time
for me to recognize

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.450
that again everything being already
within me and looking at, well,

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:53.150
how do we retell the story
through imagery, through narrative.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:16:00.640 position:56%
And so I looked at these little
girls, the first is my daughter Ruby

00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:05.560 position:56%
and how does my daughter's
generation have positive role models

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:10.400
in images and narratives
that inspire them to want

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.870
to be these food sheroes
in their community.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:18.690
And, you know, a lot goes to
dynamic women like Michelle Obama

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:23.990
who has inspired a generation and
thinking about how do we continue

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:28.980
to hold that torch up even after
she leaves the administration.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:34.590
And so the other two little girls
that I highlight is Hailey Thomas,

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:39.970
who's a vegan chef, not even a
teen and then we had Michaela Omar

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.100
who wrote this multimillion dollar
contract deal with Whole Foods,

00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:47.920
with her grandma's recipe in
selling sweet pea lemonade.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.090
Phenomenal little girls and this is
what we need for our communities,

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:57.230
healthy food, entrepreneurs who are
looking within themselves and being

00:16:57.230 --> 00:17:01.290
that source of inspiration
for not only their generation

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:04.190
but really adults as well.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.540
And so I took time to
put this collage together

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.080
because I asked one
friend the question about,

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.400 position:56%
can we remember anyone before the
civil rights movement that was known

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:17.570
as a food fighter, a female
food fighter for our community?

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:22.880 position:56%
I can only come up with anything and
so I realized it is only until now

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.610
that we start identifying and
start collecting the history

00:17:26.610 --> 00:17:30.040
and documenting women
in food movements

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.230
and how that's another form
of owning your feminine power

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:39.660
and being able to turn that
narrative of back in the 60s

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:43.610
with the whole liberation
in 70s that I was that kid

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:46.820
who got a congressional
nomination for West Point.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.970
I wanted to hightail it
again out of Oklahoma

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:55.820
and I did not see anything related
to gender being a positive thing.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:02.240
And so it has taken time to really,
in therapy, to really recognize

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:08.780
that again we need new images
to inspire us to go blaze trails

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:14.120
in a sector that has not
been in that positive light.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.390
Because home economics most times
we can acknowledge that we thought,

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:22.030
you know, who wants to be
Susie homemaker, right?

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.770
That's not a part of the
movement for liberation for women

00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:28.510
but I now being a mom
have realized that is

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.670
where the power was,
is in the kitchen.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.620
And realizing that women
have provide the first foods

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.630
for the babies, they are the first
in the markets selling the foods,

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:41.310
working the farms in many
countries and just owning again

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:45.130
that intersection of women,
food and power in a dynamic way

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.310
that wasn't really told before.

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:50.810
But something that we needed to
escape from but really that's

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:52.660
where the power is again now.

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.820
And so for me it's been how do we
share the story of these big WANDAs

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:01.200
to inspire the little
WANDAs in our community?

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:04.410
And so that meant coming
up with new imagery,

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:08.920
the women you see here are part
of WANDA either as a volunteer

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:13.640
or a board member representing
Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Eritrea,

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:18.540
Jamaica, America and we need
to have again new imagery

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.570
that inspires a new generation.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:23.280
And so that means also
providing mentorship

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.320
and service learning
opportunities and being able

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:31.620
to create a safe space for
women to be able to be that full

00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.170
that food sheroes that they want
to be that they never thought

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:40.760 position:56%
that they could exchange between
geographies, generations and sectors

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:45.380
to really help be that source of
inspiration for their community.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:50.610
And so this is me and my
daughter, Ruby, and I truly believe

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.750
in this idea that when
you empower women

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.890
and girls you nourish the world.

00:19:55.890 --> 00:20:00.460
And the thing is for
us to own that power

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:03.840
as women again becomes
really important a part

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.620
of that inspiration.

00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:09.710
And this is my son, Elliot,
he didn't really feel

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:14.150
that he had a role to play
in WANDA but I had and a lot

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.920
of men were asking, where is MANDA?

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.220
I was like what, MANDA,
what do you mean MANDA?

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.490
I'm like there go, there they go,

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.770
was like why can't you just
embrace WANDA and be there for us

00:20:25.770 --> 00:20:31.790
and so the reality is I knew
that that conversation will come,

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.860
and I simply ask men,
do you have a mother?

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.930
Do you have a daughter?

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.500
Do you have a niece?

00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:43.100
Do you have a loved one who happens
to be female that you believe that,

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.940
if given the opportunity, that
she could make a difference

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.580
in her community?

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.250
And when they begin
reflecting on that question

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.120
and realize the hard labor
that the mothers have gone

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.720
through as either single mothers
or had to be doing everything even

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.000
if they did have a husband,
they realize like wow, yeah,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.610 position:56%
my mom deserved to be more than what
she was in her life and I looked

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.850
at my own mother doing
the same thing.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:16.290
They make sacrifices for us,
that's what they do and I think

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:21.330 position:56%
if we just realized that as men they
become gate openers of opportunities

00:21:21.330 --> 00:21:25.720
and little boys as the same way
I can count the number of stories

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.930
of men who've have already
made a difference for WANDA.

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:34.280
And so this is a space that, again,
we have half of the population

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:41.030 position:56%
in DC alone, alone in the world are
women and so there is a strong stack

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:43.470 position:56%
that if you want to overcome poverty

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:47.100
in the world you empower the
women and the girls to do so.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:52.130
And so everyone has a
role in supporting WANDA.

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:59.720
So, Dangote of Dangote Foundation
in Nigeria made a great quote about

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.260 position:56%
"I believe the single most important
intervention I can support is better

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:07.860
nutrition in Nigeria" and that is
definitely the truth given the fact

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.040
that it has some of the toughest
nutrition challenges right now

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:13.910
facing the continent.

00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:18.570
And it becomes really a prized
opportunity to be that model

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:22.600
for everyone else in the
continent and really the world.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.840
And so when we inspire
women and girls it means

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:30.190
about having stakeholders, people
beyond just the gender sector

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.880 position:56%
or nutrition sector but law and
media and economics and investments.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:39.070
Everyone plays a role in creating
a new pipeline of opportunity

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:43.590
and little WANDA really is just
that Smokey the Bear that champion,

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:47.220
who is tooting the horn
along the way of making sure

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:51.620
that everyone creates the village
that surrounds her and supports her

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.430
in providing those opportunities.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.330
And so in doing so what we
do we educate, we advocate

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.530
and we innovate meaning
that it is not simply enough

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:05.530
to provide nutrition, education but
nutrition, education that speaks

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.160
of their cultural food ways.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.100
And understanding that those food
ways have not been documented

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.430
in a substantial way
on the continent;

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.970
a lot of the nutrition
books are coming

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.070
from America, from
India, from the UK.

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:22.310 position:56%
But again how are we documenting the
knowledge of the nutritional value

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:27.470 position:56%
of these foods and making sure that
not only are the future nutritionist

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:30.950 position:56%
on the continent is getting that
information but also those who serve

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:35.070
after the immigrant community here
in the US and in Europe as well.

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:39.070
And using technology
to fuel that scale

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:41.460 position:56%
and impact becomes really important.

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:44.470
We were just at Microsoft
winner just this past weekend

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:47.500
and using the artificial
intelligence and being able

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:51.210
to create instant messaging for
people that ask questions related

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.780
to food resources in
their community.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.990
It becomes a real key opportunity
to see the intersectionality

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:01.830
of technologies to drive
the change that we need.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:05.900
And so in visiting Nigeria
and in sharing little WANDA,

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.770
I went to a Steam International
in Abuja and the kids are awesome.

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:13.600
Ramatu Saani is the
head schoolmaster there

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.710
and the girls had phenomenal
questions

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:19.250 position:56%
from diabetes to gluten-free issues.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:22.410
And wondering can they tune
into little WANDA on Saturday

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:27.460
as a cartoon and it just gave me
new ideas about what can we do

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:33.230
in providing a creative educational
but entertaining narrative for them

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:37.470
to use storytelling as a means
of educating them in a way

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.670
that they really grasp
the information.

00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:44.130
It's not simply enough to spit out
a lecture but putting and packaging

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:47.810
in a way that has a gender lens, a
cultural lens is really important

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.200
and lies at the heart of how
we develop our programing

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.290
for little WANDA and the
Where's WANDA series.

00:24:55.290 --> 00:25:00.480
And so in visiting one of
the parents who's a dietician

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.230 position:56%
at the local hospital in Abuja, she
shared how they're using local foods

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:10.890
from cinnamon to garlic to turmeric
to cloves to tamarind as a means

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:15.040
of providing a nutritional
prescriptions to their patients.

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:18.740
And she was saying malnutrition in
the pediatric unit is not as high

00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:21.590
of an issue as diabetes
is rising there.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:25.000
And so that was very telling
about what needs to happen

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.280
and shifting our focus in preparing

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.690
for a healthier workforce
tackling NCDs.

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.590
And so that means how are we
preparing the next leaders

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:38.760
to be able to understand nutrition
whether they're in medicine

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:43.960
or pharmacy or whether they
are community health workers.

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.350 position:56%
Everyone needs to be able to embrace
nutrition and little WANDA helps

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.200
to champion that and make
that intersectionality

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.080
to inspire the next generation.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:57.830
And systems changes is with
that from looking at it,

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:03.320
from a healthcare lens we see farm
farmers rating incorporating their

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.290
food products within the hospitals.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:10.580
We also see that with the cultural
lens of meeting to make sure

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.790
that we have the cultural foods
available that it's not enough just

00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:18.160 position:56%
to say that we have farmers' markets

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.480
but how those farmers
markets providing foods

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.980
that are culturally
relevant to that community.

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:30.990
And everyone plays a role as I was
sharing in terms of stakeholders

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:34.550
from those in government to
those who are family and friends

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.630
and sharing resources
among ourselves.

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:41.030
But most of all I find that
is the self-talk that we say

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:46.050
to our ourselves of saying
that well am I able to be

00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:48.150
that food shero in my community?

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.870
And what you say to yourself
matters in making that first step

00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:55.960
to creating the change
that you need.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.350
And so this is the dietician

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:00.720
at the Abuja hospital
that I was referring to.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:04.060
A lot of the hospitals have
about three dieticians,

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:08.400 position:56%
they're busy round-the-clock, they
take calls even on their cell phones

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.570
when they're even at
home and so a lot

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:14.820 position:56%
of the information is not documented
when they provide patient education.

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.970
And so that's another opportunity

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:21.670
of how do we start creating
nutritional educational materials

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.920
that is culturally
relevant, that is factored in.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:28.320
There are local food
ways and also the fact

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:32.730 position:56%
that there is a nutrition transition
happening in the community

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:36.360
with the new soft minerals
which we call soda here

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:40.370
and the Indomie [phonetic] noodles
that we call Ramen noodles here.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.180
All of this is also
changing the food patterns

00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.550
and also the health
outcomes for the community

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:47.560
that has to be factored in.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:52.970
And so I had the opportunity to
visit one of the IDP camps in Abuja

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:56.450 position:56%
and Moringa was growing in the camp.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:28:00.580
Many of the folks where coming from
the north where they were farmers

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.590
but had to flee because
of Boko Haram.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:07.570
And so in providing again
educational materials

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:11.400
that can benefit Africa and
the Diaspora our creative team

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.380
out of Lagos help to create
these informatics materials

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:18.100
such as Mama Moringa.

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:21.440
I provided the content and they
provided the creative design

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.190
about how do we start
talking about the local foods.

00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:28.000
We call them super foods here
once they come to America

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.680
but these are readily
available, low-cost,

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.200
health options available
already in these communities,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.670
but they simply may not
know the nutritional value

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:40.380
of what they have already
within their own community.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.330
And so it becomes really important

00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:47.410 position:56%
of how can we start providing
cultural-based nutrition information

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:53.740
and a character that can help
provide that championship

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:57.850
that these little foods
need, these local food needs.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:02.230
And so these are some of the women,
that Ramatu, our other board member

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:05.090
with WANDA helps to
bring together the...

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:10.480 position:56%
It's a coalition of Muslim women who
assist with the IDP camp in Abuja

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:15.520
and I had seen a child
eating dry Ramen noodles

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:20.540
and it was pretty alarming
as a nutritionist to see that

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:25.490
and I said we cannot leave
without providing a proper meal.

00:29:25.490 --> 00:29:28.180
And so we, you know,
took some of the funds

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:33.840
from the crowd funding campaign
and provided a meal for everyone.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.730
And it was really beautiful down
to the jollof rice to the oranges,

00:29:38.730 --> 00:29:43.150
the bananas, the water with
chicken and vegetables in the meal.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:46.840
And you know it was a hot proper
meal that we also provided

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.630
through a local caterer and so
to me compared to the Plumpy'Nuts

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:56.490
that are provided to address
severe malnutrition I acknowledge

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.090
that that is a different status.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:03.660
But if we can do things in a way
that helps build the local economy

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:08.710
and also introduces the local
foods that is a win-win situation

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:10.770
for everyone in my opinion.

00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:16.150
And so creating healthy
eaters is the other part

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.520
that little WANDA champions.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.320
One of the professors
out of Nigeria said

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.510
that the Nigeria soft drinks have
been shown to be high in sucrose,

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.600
fructose which are much higher
than the brands in South Africa.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.620
And already in South Africa
more than seventy percent

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:33.960
of the population is
either overweight or obese,

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:38.650
and that's really problematic when
we think about the projected number

00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:44.430
of 42 million is to have
diabetes by 2030 on the continent.

00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:46.760
So, what is the intervention
that will happen?

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.960
Who will be that food
shero in the community

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:54.420
to help turn these numbers around,
that's the question that we ask.

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:58.650
And again the Trojan horse is
in the name of job development,

00:30:58.650 --> 00:31:02.180
bringing fast food
into the countries.

00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:07.860
Case in point, when I was in South
Africa last year the local KFC was

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:12.120
open for breakfast and they had
motorbikes to transport your food

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:16.190 position:56%
and they were open around-the-clock.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.870
We don't even have that here.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:22.310
So I was like oh my God
that's like a real issue

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:27.110
and so I thought again how
do we compete again a David

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:28.410
Goliath battle?

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.950
And really little WANDA competing
in the David Goliath battle

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:37.650
between these large multinationals
and...and how can they actually

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:39.580
start directing resources in a way

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.720
that supports the local food
economy in a meaningful way.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.120
And so again the education
in going to the camps,

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:52.220
going to the universities and the
schools, meeting with the parents,

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:56.950
doing teacher training workshops,
providing information on millet.

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:00.800
We have here in Tiger nuts,
they were just very impressed

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.430
and they were like the nutritional
value of their local foods to know

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:10.400
that they can help tackle different
disease states and they're low cost

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:14.310
and available on the street
easily just for a few Naira.

00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:18.650
I think that was very powerful
for them to able to recognize it.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:23.960
In millet, one of the, it's about
Nigeria's one of top producers

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.140
of millet commonly found
in northern Nigeria

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.150
where you can make the
Flo donono [phonetic]

00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:32.590
which is a milk millet
dish available either

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:35.670
in the Ruger [assumed spelling]
which is the village or also

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:40.350
through one of the well-known
chains Habib's yogurt.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:44.530
It's a very nutritious drink and
when we think about, you know,

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:50.110
consuming this particular
product it actually has a lot

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:52.010
of pre and probiotics.

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:55.560
Tiger nut definitely has prebiotics
and so when we're thinking

00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:02.010
about the new frontiers such
as the microflora of the gut.

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:05.400
Having foods that help
provide healthy bacteria

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:10.810 position:56%
in the gut becomes really important
and these two foods help to do that.

00:33:10.810 --> 00:33:15.360
And so in introducing the story,
I have a copy of one of the books

00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.930
that we had prepared in
Nigeria and I just want

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:25.390
to share the opening letter that
we provide to the little WANDAs.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:28.380
We say the Where's WANDA series
is made especially for you,

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:32.850
we need superfood sheroes who
will help our community heal

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:35.580
with our heritage foods and
that's why little WANDA matters

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:38.640
to find the healing and
beauty of African Foods

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:40.260
to nourish our community.

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.800
And through her travels in Africa,

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:46.980
little WANDA meets female farmers
also known as big WANDAs who grow

00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.350
and share African heritage foods
to feed and heal her people

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:51.840
in Africa and the Diaspora.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.340
And as part of the WANDAs wisdom,

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.390
you realize that all we
need is already within us

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.800
and we hope you'll enjoy
the story and share

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.470
with your family and friends.

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:04.560
And most of all being inspired
to celebrate your heritage

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.960
and learn and prepare the foods.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:12.680
And so with every story we actually
highlight a real female farmer

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:18.990
and a little girl and so we took
the journey to Kano Nigeria to meet

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.230
with Salama Togarber who runs WFAN

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:24.930
which is the Women Farmers
Advancement Network.

00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:32.220
She is by far a great example
of what a WANDA woman is.

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:37.070 position:56%
She runs a women's cooperative, they
make their own Made in Nigeria rice.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:40.860
They also produce groundnut
oil; they also produce kulikuli

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.560
which is made of groundnut.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:47.410
Think about peanut butter cookies
before it had white sugar in it,

00:34:47.410 --> 00:34:50.090
that's what the kulikuli is.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:55.250
And so it was just fascinating
and phenomenal to be greeted

00:34:55.250 --> 00:35:04.450
by just a room, outdoor room full
of women bringing, who were happy

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:07.100
to first be graduating
through a training program

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.580
that WFAN was having.

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:13.570
But also unveiling their new rice
product that they've been making

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.770
for Nigeria, and so little WANDA

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:20.200
who in this story I
highlight my daughter Ruby.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:24.530
Part of every story is about how
do we take a different woman story

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:28.080
and turn it into a children's book,
and so this first story really is

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.870
about my journey of finding my
heritage in Nigeria and being able

00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:38.740
to capture my story of my grandma
having diabetes and my curiosity

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:42.770
as a kid wanting to know the
answer on how to help heal her.

00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:46.950
And my father who passed
coming to my dreams

00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:51.040
to tell me what the secret was

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:54.470
which was everything I needed
was already within our heritage.

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.630
And so I turned that into
a storybook and the idea is

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:02.220
that every book hops to a different
country being either Kenya or Benin

00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:06.800
or South Africa and highlight who
are those champions on the ground?

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:08.100
What are their local foods?

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:10.870
And how can the help not
only their communities

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:15.330
but really our communities
everywhere?

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:20.320
And so in the first
opening we have little WANDA

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:23.770
who she's always curious
wanting to know what's going on

00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:28.300
and so she eavesdrops because
that's what she does, nosy,

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:34.970 position:56%
and she wants to know what's grandma
or Nana and her mom talking about.

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:38.510
And so in designing the
characters I went back and forth

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:42.840
with the designer but I wanted
to have relatable characters

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.000
that people can say, hey,
that looks like my Nana.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.380
And it was important for me that
little WANDA had a little Afro

00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:56.120
with the whole big care natural
hair movement and again realizing

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.420
that that wasn't something

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:59.830
that I easily would've
done back in Oklahoma.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:02.710
I would straighten my hair
the moment I got off the plane

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:07.070
but embracing again all
that are ready have within.

00:37:07.070 --> 00:37:11.260
And so the pictures on the back
of her uncles who she later goes

00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:15.720
to visit and she overhears
her mom talking to Nana

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.090
that she had just came
from the hospital

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:21.120
and had learned that
she has diabetes.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:27.490
And so WANDA didn't know what to
do about this and so she thought

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.970
about how did we get to this
place and she started to think

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.040
because she's very cerebral.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:36.870 position:56%
She was thinking about all of the
different foods Nana has been eating

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:41.270
down to the soda and down to
the cakes and the pastries

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:42.670
and it reminded my grandma.

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:46.560
My grandma loves going to
Brahm's dairy store in Oklahoma

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:50.650 position:56%
and every time I knew she always has
some kind of sweet around the house

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:53.430
and she was always
offering that to us as well.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.990
And at that time I didn't
have a clue about nutrition,

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:58.470
I didn't even know it
was a field at the time

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.700
and so I'm enjoying the
sweets just with my Nana

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.010 position:56%
because that's what we did together.

00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:07.930
Not realizing that, you
know, perhaps they contribute

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:13.340
to her complications of
diabetes in her dying later

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:17.320
and for me it was a moment
of being able to share

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.330
that through the magic
apron that WANDA gets

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:24.780
which is her great Nana's apron
that she finds in her trunk

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:29.430
that this becomes her way to
travel and to be on a journey

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:37.000
and explore how can I find
a cure for Nana's diabetes?

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.010
And so the father actually
looks like my dad

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:45.340
and I thought it was really
important to have the visuals

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:50.850 position:56%
that come to mind like Africa in the
backdrop versus the princess theme

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:54.400
that the designer first
one is like, no.

00:38:54.400 --> 00:39:00.010
And I thought about how important
dreams are and how, you know.

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:03.330
There is a beautiful story

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:06.970
over at the American Indian
Museum called the Little Boy

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:12.380 position:56%
and Seven Grandfathers and the
power of dreams become opportunities

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.300
of where you actually
find the answer,

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.380
that's when spirit speaks to you.

00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:20.060
And so it was so important for
me to capture that in the story

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:24.420
about the power of spirit as
another form of communication

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:26.520
and as a way to unlock the answer.

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.200
It wasn't something
that could happen

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.130
in the daytime only unless
she's in a meditative state

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:35.870
and so dreaming it's kind of
like that same meditative state

00:39:35.870 --> 00:39:40.240
that I was capturing through
the story with the communication

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.970
that was happening between
her late father who died

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:48.860
and talking to her in her dream.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:56.750
And so when she puts on her
apron she is able to travel

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:00.420
to different countries and so
she travels to Northern Nigeria

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:06.180
where she is greeted by two
gentlemen Ashru and Yussif

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:10.040
who are real friends of mine who've
helped me to travel to Nigeria.

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:19.080
And I asked them how do I get
the secret for Nana and we go

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:23.460
on this journey exploring parts
of Africa, parts of Nigeria

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.740
and they were like I know
who you need to meet,

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.960
big WANDA who is also known as Mrs.
Garba who I later met this summer.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.560
And so through that conversation
of being with big WANDA,

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:41.510
little WANDA learns about
different foods such as millets

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:48.640
and in the book we actually have
characters for all the foods.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.550
So in this case, she needs
Mamadou Millet and she learns

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:57.030
about the power of millet and
how to prepare the dish in order

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.600
to feed that to her family.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:05.330
And it was so important that
the farmer looked as gorgeous

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:10.750
as Mrs. Garba did when I met
her and contrast the imagery

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.980
that I showed you when you Google.

00:41:12.980 --> 00:41:16.300
Because again, we want
to show empowering images

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:21.060
of women embracing their foods
and becoming stewards of healing

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:24.150
and health and unity
that our community needs.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:28.890
And so for me I would want
to be like a big WANDA

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:32.940
like Mrs. Garba after meeting her.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:40.040
So, I just wanted to just end
and share how important it is

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:42.920
that we have positive
narratives for our children.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:46.990
When I think about the
characters that we have now

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:55.180
like Ronald McDonald who
promotes, yeah, another choice

00:41:55.180 --> 00:42:00.240
of foods I wanted little
WANDA to be in that dynamic

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:02.480
of David and Goliath battle.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.380
You can give with this or
you can't give with that

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:06.140
but little WANDA's where it's at.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.430
And it's really important
that we have characters

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:12.670
that represent our children who are

00:42:12.670 --> 00:42:16.770
to be the future food
sheroes of our communities.

00:42:16.770 --> 00:42:20.830
And so I just want to thank
everyone who's come out for those

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:25.970
who are interested in that Where's
WANDA book series we will be having

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:31.630
those books available
online and also for November

00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:33.410
which is diabetes month is

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:36.660
when we'll have another
book signing opportunity.

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.870
So I just want to thank
the Library of Congress

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:44.190
for having WANDA here today
and I'm open for any questions

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:46.510
that you may have as well.

00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:50.360
[ Audience Clapping ]

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.960
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: So now you
all kind of see what I mean

00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:58.070
about being dynamic but I'm going
to jump in front of everybody

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.550
and then we'll take couple of
questions to ask a question

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:05.480
about I hear little WANDA is going
Sweden where she would be talking

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.850
to the Somali community there
about some of the Somali things

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:12.510
that make your some [inaudible].

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:15.860
&gt;&gt; Tambra Raye Stevenson:
So the beauty of WANDA,

00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:19.200
we're building this really
first-ever pan-African women's

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:23.600
network from farm to fork so we
have WANDA board members in Sweden

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.090
and in Ghana, here in
America and other countries.

00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:31.600
And so we were invited once
learning about WANDA to come there

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.660
to recognize world childhood
obesity day is October 10th.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.870
And so it was an opportunity for
us to help facilitate a workshop

00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:44.480
on the migration and the
food environment and how does

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.580
that impact childhood obesity.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:52.120 position:56%
And so we will be at Upsala Health
Summit being able to share the story

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:57.190
of WANDA and how do we connect
African Diasporan women in Europe

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:59.830
to this movement and
become the champions

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:02.490
that our communities
need there as well.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:06.580
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Okay, so
can we take some questions

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.010
to the front, okay.

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.310
Janet.

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:12.480
&gt;&gt; Great. Personally I'll
just sail through all.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:21.630
Food is a global issue, on mind,
body, spirit, everything is related

00:44:21.630 --> 00:44:37.880
to what is within our bodies so I'm
really proud of what you're doing.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:47.150
I have worked in the health
food industry and very much want

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:53.560
to support your cause as well.

00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:58.560
I work in media and I will
definitely be getting work

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.250
out on this.

00:45:00.250 --> 00:45:04.820
&gt;&gt; Whatever I mention is my son,

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:11.360
I'm so proud of him,
seventeen years old.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:16.980
He wants to go into
the food industry,

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:21.010
he can't go [inaudible]
he is also concerned

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.300
about nutrition and
I think he would be.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:27.450
He actually works at KFC currently,
he's probably not [inaudible].

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.450
He's also looking for
[inaudible] family business,

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:33.910
an African food business.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:36.910
Regarding the multinational
business is likely KFC,

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.250
I know they can vary their menu.

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:40.550
&gt;&gt; Tambra Raye Stevenson: Yes.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:46.760
&gt;&gt; I think it's important to be
advocates and suggesting some meal,

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.060
you know, selection [inaudible].

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:51.480
It's just, you know, for
[inaudible] that work you're doing.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.270
We got do in it another way or.

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:58.700
Tambra Raye Stevenson: Yeah,
it definitely can happen

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:05.200 position:56%
in both directions, you know, having
worked for commerce department,

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:11.120
recognizing that we want to support
local small businesses and I'm now

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:17.870 position:56%
on the DC food policy Council where
we're supporting local food economy.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:20.720
It's definitely coming
in at both angles

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:27.350
on how do we support the small
businesses in the community

00:46:27.350 --> 00:46:30.370
that makes up majority of
the business in America

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:37.910
and really across the world.

00:46:39.050 --> 00:46:49.250
And at the same time how do
multinationals do a better job

00:46:49.250 --> 00:47:09.630
of providing a range of healthier
options and many of them are having

00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:24.810
to do that just on
a competitive edge.

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:33.880
We see what's happening
with McDonalds right now,

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.540
many of their shops are being
closed and I formally worked there.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:44.360
That was my first job actually
in high school and so because of

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:50.400
that I've been able to recognize
that we all have to play a role

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.280
in supporting little WANDA.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:57.540
Because along her journey she
may get tired and she wants

00:47:57.540 --> 00:48:01.480 position:56%
to grab something what are healthier
options for her along the way.

00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.820
And so that's everything for
big WANDA to big corporation.

00:48:05.820 --> 00:48:10.960
They all play a part in her
nutritional status for sure.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.260
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:13.560
&gt;&gt; Tambra Raye Stevenson: Yes.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.860
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: [Inaudible]
want to learn the [inaudible].

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:18.480
I want to ask you about the
individual items; so for example,

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:22.690
I could not pay what
farmers are doing nobody

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:26.420
because for example here may not be

00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:29.320
so easily available
like say DC or Oklahoma.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.790
But they may have other
[inaudible] maybe,

00:48:30.790 --> 00:48:32.260
it could be [inaudible],
it could be [inaudible].

00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:34.900
So are you suggesting that
certain foods be incorporated

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.560
in a general diet or I think

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.840 position:56%
that locally grown foods [inaudible]
should be the dominant for any diet.

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.780
&gt;&gt; Tambra Raye Stevenson:
So for instance millet,

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:47.480
sorghum they actually are
being grown in the Midwest

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.820
and there are more ethnic
crops like African Western,

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:53.800
African vegetables being
grown locally as well.

00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.250
So part of it is, yes, number one
how do we cultivate those ethnic

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:00.480
crops, USD runs the ethnic
crop block rate program

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.030
and those foods are being grown
here locally in the DMV area.

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:07.580
And at the same time those
foods are being exported

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:11.440
out of the continent here as well
just packaged as superfoods and so

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.860
for me the conversation
about ethnic foods.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:18.160
I think taking a visit to Ellis
Island is a very fascinating

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:22.770
because it just shows how
foods it seemed very exotic

00:49:22.770 --> 00:49:25.310
at one point are so
normalized now on.

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:27.410
And I think that's kind of
the frontier we're heading

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:28.710
when it comes to African foods.

00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:30.010
It really is when we
think about just

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:31.310
from the economic development lens,

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:32.610
what is happening globally we've
gone from Latin America to Asia

00:49:32.610 --> 00:49:33.910
and so really Africa
now is the next frontier

00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:35.210
over the next 50 years
even documented

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:36.510
by the World Economic Forum.

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:37.810
So you're going to see
that that transition happen

00:49:37.810 --> 00:49:39.110
in more investments in
the gastronomic landscape

00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:40.410
of African foods and
that will be reflected

00:49:40.410 --> 00:49:41.710
in the speciality food
markets space.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:43.010
When I go on food show visits
and hopefully, you know,

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:44.310
when I see these shows, you know,

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:45.610
it's like Italy looks
like a food mafia.

00:49:45.610 --> 00:49:46.910
And hopefully over time Africa
is not the size of Gambian,

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:48.210
in these food shows in
that it does explode

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:49.510 position:56%
and there are more local food
entrepreneurs in that space as well.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:50.810
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: I
did want to just add

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:52.110
that I actually met Tambra walking
across the field with a basket full

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:53.410
of African vegetables
grown in the United States.

00:49:53.410 --> 00:49:54.710
And she gave me a couple and
said go home and try them

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:56.010
like it was gardner [phonetic].

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:57.310
&gt;&gt; Tamba Raye Stevenson: Yes.

00:49:57.310 --> 00:49:58.610
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Gardner
[phonetic] and some little.

00:49:58.610 --> 00:49:59.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Tamba Raye Stevenson: Cheap leaf.

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.210
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Yeah and I
went home and cooked them all.

00:50:01.210 --> 00:50:02.510
They were delicious, you can get
millet and yes Whole Foods go

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:03.810 position:56%
to the bulk things, you can get your
own millet, I grew up eating millet

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:05.110
in East Africa and I
like to eat it now.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:06.410
So you don't have to wait
for it to come and sell you,

00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:07.710
you just have to seek it out.

00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:09.010
And previously Tambra has given us
some information about the programs

00:50:09.010 --> 00:50:10.310
that seek to grow African
vegetables.

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:11.610
I know they have amaranth; amaranth
is a grain I think they're trying

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:12.910
to go grow teff in the
United States now too.

00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:14.680
&gt;&gt; Tamba Raye Stevenson: Yes,
so there's local farmers here

00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.980
and that's part of WANDA.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:19.460
We try to...I operate kind of
like a talent scout at this point.

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:23.220 position:56%
Identifying what WANDA women are out
there who are doing dynamic things

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.500
that really most people
don't even know about.

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:29.200
We have Gail Taylor who
has a CSA right here in DC,

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.930
where she's growing ethnic crops.

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:32.370
We have Yall Gidisi
[assumed spelling]

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:36.810
who is growing ethnic crops and
they're expanding what the work

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:39.770
that they're doing as well you.

00:50:39.770 --> 00:51:01.810
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] production of
foods that someone wants to grow

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:13.360
and grow here in the United
States and you also talk

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:17.240
about Monsanto and [inaudible].

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.020
&gt;&gt; The GMO food?

00:51:21.020 --> 00:51:29.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; No, [inaudible] I'm not talking
[inaudible] the genetically modified

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:31.400
food [inaudible].

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:38.410
&gt;&gt; You sure that.

00:51:38.410 --> 00:51:47.940
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] and so they're
introducing other seeds

00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:57.290
from other parts of the world.

00:51:57.290 --> 00:52:07.140
Just be aware of that danger,
that, we could be [inaudible].

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.270
And there's some recent
[inaudible] plans to bring

00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.310
and destruct [inaudible] Monsanto.

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:13.540
And they continue to
grow [inaudible]

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.840
that their seeds [inaudible].

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.140
The argument that [inaudible].

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:20.440
So you have to be aware and
everyone has to be aware

00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:21.740
of that danger, the dangerous.

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:23.750
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: You know I want
to add one thing and that is

00:52:23.750 --> 00:52:28.260
that when you reference the
drug companies, the companies is

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:31.470
like Pfizer and Lilly
are all over Madagascar

00:52:31.470 --> 00:52:37.110
in the rain forest taking the
natural medicines that you can find

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:42.280 position:56%
in the rainforest and pulling,
identifying their chemical compounds

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.360
and creating the chemical compound.

00:52:45.360 --> 00:52:50.220
They are not only clearing out
the rain forest in Madagascar

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:55.420 position:56%
which is a problem for the people
who've lived there and depend on it,

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:56.720
but they are creating
synthetic versions

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:01.060
of what you can get naturally.

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:05.580 position:56%
So, people need to do their
research about what they are eating.

00:53:05.580 --> 00:53:08.760
Some people think tofu
food is great,

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:13.730
tofu was genetically
modified and highly processed.

00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:16.620
You really have to do your
research on your food.

00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:21.020
I know, I see a big WANDA here,
there's a big WANDA back...

00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:23.250
How many big WANDAs are here?

00:53:23.250 --> 00:53:24.550
That's great.

00:53:24.550 --> 00:53:31.250
I'm going to call myself a big
WANDA now because I grow food

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:34.850
in my backyard and I eat it.

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:39.030
So last night I made something with
turmeric roots, ginger, lemongrass

00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:40.650
and the peppers out of mine and
tomatoes are out of my garden.

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:42.300 position:56%
Those are some of the things you
can do to know where your food comes

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.600
from because you grow it.

00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:44.900
&gt;&gt; Tambra Raye Stevenson:
So I do want to give a shout

00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:46.200
out to Lolo [assumed
spelling] who is on our board.

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.500
She's in the back from
Acts Accountability

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:48.800
which has been behind the US
movement of bring back our girls

00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.100
and also Miss Africa USA,
Francis Aduko is here as well

00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:51.400
who also is a new founder of an
NGO empowering girls in Nigeria.

00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.700
And so I just want to
thank them for being there.

00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:54.000
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Can you stand up?

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.300
&gt;&gt; Tambra Raye Stevenson: Yes.

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:56.600
Can you please stand
to be acknowledged,

00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:57.900
so now [inaudible] is in the house.

00:53:57.900 --> 00:53:59.200
[ Audience Clapping ]

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.980
And so we were all just last week

00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:06.530
at the United Nations General
Assembly meetings and so it's

00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:12.800
so important to have our generation
be a part of the leadership

00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:15.160
that our community needs
and being able to speak out

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:17.350
and be a voice to the issues.

00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:21.810 position:56%
Because when we look at the issue of
intersectionality of not just women

00:54:21.810 --> 00:54:26.100
in America but black
women, African women,

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:30.500
the numbers change drastically
about health and economic outcomes.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.230
And so having the voice of
those women who are tend

00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:36.370
to be marginalized in the media

00:54:36.370 --> 00:54:40.970
and in these larger conversations
becomes really important.

00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:47.330
And for me even down to little
black girls having a voice

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:50.700
as well becomes really
important of what are their needs

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:54.320
and so that's why little
WANDA is so vitally important

00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:58.670
to give a positive image
for our girls to say, hey,

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:03.560
I can be a change maker in my
community, food can be a healing

00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:05.820
and an empowering way to do so.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:10.490 position:56%
And I'm going to do that with little
WANDA because I am little WANDA.

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:14.410 position:56%
So thank you so much and I hope that
you join us in the conference room

00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:16.670
for more conversations and snacks.

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:17.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: And healthy snacks.

00:55:17.970 --> 00:55:19.270
&gt;&gt; Tambra Raye Stevenson.

00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:20.570
Yes.

00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:21.870
&gt;&gt; Eve Ferguson: Healthy snacks.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.170
Thank you very much for coming.

00:55:23.170 --> 00:55:24.720
And you can just make your
way to the conference room.

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:30.270
I will go round open up the side
door and enjoy some healthy snacks.

00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:33.930

of the Library of Congress.
