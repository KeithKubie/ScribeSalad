a manifesto of what I think about
 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.800
a manifesto of what I think about
education and also what duolingo thinks

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810
education and also what duolingo thinks
 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.450
education and also what duolingo thinks
about education so some of these things

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460
about education so some of these things

about education so some of these things
are just things that probably I'm not

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380
are just things that probably I'm not
 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.900
are just things that probably I'm not
saying that they're correct I'm just

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910
saying that they're correct I'm just
 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.070
saying that they're correct I'm just
saying you probably should just think

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080
saying you probably should just think
 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.870
saying you probably should just think
about them and and that that's that

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880
about them and and that that's that
 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.050
about them and and that that's that
that's what I'm saying okay so now my

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060
that's what I'm saying okay so now my
 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.490
that's what I'm saying okay so now my
thinking on education started from the

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500
thinking on education started from the
 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.230
thinking on education started from the
fact of where I'm from I'm from

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240

Guatemala and one of the few things

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160
Guatemala and one of the few things
 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.500
Guatemala and one of the few things
about what I'm out of that you should

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510
about what I'm out of that you should
 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.270
about what I'm out of that you should
know at least this is a very poor

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280
know at least this is a very poor
 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.960
know at least this is a very poor
country and I always a lot of people

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970
country and I always a lot of people
 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:16.640
country and I always a lot of people
always talked about how education was an

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650
always talked about how education was an
 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.710
always talked about how education was an
equalizer it would bring equality to the

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720
equalizer it would bring equality to the
 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.240
equalizer it would bring equality to the
whole world but actually I always saw

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250
whole world but actually I always saw
 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.640
whole world but actually I always saw
education as a huge divider because what

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:22.650
education as a huge divider because what
 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.930
education as a huge divider because what
happens is the people that have money

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940
happens is the people that have money
 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.029
happens is the people that have money
are able to afford the best education in

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039
are able to afford the best education in
 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.350
are able to afford the best education in
the world they can pay for themselves to

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360
the world they can pay for themselves to
 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.150
the world they can pay for themselves to
go to Harvard and then therefore they

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160
go to Harvard and then therefore they
 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.710
go to Harvard and then therefore they
continue having money because they will

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720
continue having money because they will
 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.420
continue having money because they will
they get a really good education the

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430
they get a really good education the
 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:33.469
they get a really good education the
people who don't have very much money

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479
people who don't have very much money
 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:34.850
people who don't have very much money
can barely learn how to read and write

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860
can barely learn how to read and write
 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.740
can barely learn how to read and write
because the educational system in

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750
because the educational system in
 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.909
because the educational system in
countries like Guatemala completely

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919
countries like Guatemala completely
 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:39.860
countries like Guatemala completely
sucks so they can barely learn how to

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870
sucks so they can barely learn how to
 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.020
sucks so they can barely learn how to
read and write and therefore continue

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.030
read and write and therefore continue
 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.640
read and write and therefore continue
being poor because they kind of don't

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650
being poor because they kind of don't
 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.439
being poor because they kind of don't
really know how to read and write okay

so I always saw education as this big
 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.060
so I always saw education as this big
divider and I wanted to do something to

divider and I wanted to do something to
 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:51.830
divider and I wanted to do something to
equalize this so this is something that

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840
equalize this so this is something that
 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.420
equalize this so this is something that
I wanted to do and so I started working

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430

education is very general so I decided
 

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.320
education is very general so I decided
to work on just one aspect of Education

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330
to work on just one aspect of Education
 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.159

these different units that we call
 

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.420

skill we also have this strength bar

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:00.380
skill we also have this strength bar
 

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.590
skill we also have this strength bar
that shows how well you know each skill

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:02.600
that shows how well you know each skill
 

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.480

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880
student here at Carnegie Mellon severn
 

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.680
student here at Carnegie Mellon severn
neither was Newton knew anything about

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:09.690
neither was Newton knew anything about
 

00:16:09.690 --> 00:16:11.150
neither was Newton knew anything about
how to learn languages or how to teach

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160
how to learn languages or how to teach
 

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:12.889
how to learn languages or how to teach
languages so what we did is we went to

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:12.899
languages so what we did is we went to
 

00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:14.240
languages so what we did is we went to
read a lot of books about how to best

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:14.250
read a lot of books about how to best
 

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:15.590
read a lot of books about how to best
teach languages we just read a bunch of

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600
teach languages we just read a bunch of
 

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.600
teach languages we just read a bunch of
books but very quickly we realized

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:17.610
books but very quickly we realized
 

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:19.430
books but very quickly we realized
something funny about this it really

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440
something funny about this it really
 

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.280
something funny about this it really
reminded us of books about diets they

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:22.290
reminded us of books about diets they
 

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.530
reminded us of books about diets they
all contradicted each other so you know

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:24.540
all contradicted each other so you know
 

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:27.110
all contradicted each other so you know
with diets some of them say oh you

00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120
with diets some of them say oh you
 

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.910
with diets some of them say oh you
should only eat meat other ones say you

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920
should only eat meat other ones say you
 

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.769
should only eat meat other ones say you
should never eat meat it really was like

00:16:30.769 --> 00:16:30.779
should never eat meat it really was like
 

00:16:30.779 --> 00:16:32.600
should never eat meat it really was like
that with how to best teach a language

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:32.610
that with how to best teach a language
 

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.190
that with how to best teach a language
some others said one thing somebody said

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:34.200
some others said one thing somebody said
 

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.030
some others said one thing somebody said
the other thing and it really were

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040
the other thing and it really were
 

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:36.590
the other thing and it really were
directly contradictory with each other

00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600
directly contradictory with each other
 

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.480
directly contradictory with each other
so we had no idea what to do so what we

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:38.490
so we had no idea what to do so what we
 

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:39.740
so we had no idea what to do so what we
did is we kind of listened to some of

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:39.750
did is we kind of listened to some of
 

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:41.060
did is we kind of listened to some of
what the book said and we started with

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:41.070
what the book said and we started with
 

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:44.329
what the book said and we started with
its own curriculum our own curriculum

00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339
its own curriculum our own curriculum
 

00:16:44.339 --> 00:16:45.710
its own curriculum our own curriculum
but then we realized we were in our

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720
but then we realized we were in our
 

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.960
but then we realized we were in our
unique opportunity to do something which

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:47.970
unique opportunity to do something which
 

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.519
unique opportunity to do something which
was to actually figure out what really

00:16:49.519 --> 00:16:49.529
was to actually figure out what really
 

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:50.750
was to actually figure out what really
was the best way to teach a language

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:50.760
was the best way to teach a language
 

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.850
was the best way to teach a language
because we had so much data from people

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860
because we had so much data from people
 

00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:55.519
because we had so much data from people
learning so this is yet another of our

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:55.529
learning so this is yet another of our
 

00:16:55.529 --> 00:16:57.949
learning so this is yet another of our
tenants that education we based on data

00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959
tenants that education we based on data
 

00:16:57.959 --> 00:16:59.510
tenants that education we based on data
in our opinion a lot of these books were

00:16:59.510 --> 00:16:59.520
in our opinion a lot of these books were
 

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.010
in our opinion a lot of these books were
about philosophies of different things

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:01.020
about philosophies of different things
 

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.990
about philosophies of different things
and when we were in a position and we

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000
and when we were in a position and we
 

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.309
and when we were in a position and we
really were in a unique position when we

00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319
really were in a unique position when we
 

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.480
really were in a unique position when we
had millions of uses that we could

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:05.490
had millions of uses that we could
 

00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:06.949
had millions of uses that we could
really figure out the best way to teach

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959
really figure out the best way to teach
 

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.659
really figure out the best way to teach
a language so what we started doing is

00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:08.669
a language so what we started doing is
 

00:17:08.669 --> 00:17:10.610
a language so what we started doing is
we started doing a lot of a B tests to

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620
we started doing a lot of a B tests to
 

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.199
we started doing a lot of a B tests to
really figure things out so for example

00:17:12.199 --> 00:17:12.209
really figure things out so for example
 

00:17:12.209 --> 00:17:13.490
really figure things out so for example
we wanted to know whether we should

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.500
we wanted to know whether we should
 

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.990
we wanted to know whether we should
teach plurals a little earlier or

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000
teach plurals a little earlier or
 

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.490
teach plurals a little earlier or
littler later we wanted to know that

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500
littler later we wanted to know that
 

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.570
littler later we wanted to know that
none of these books could tell us

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:18.580
none of these books could tell us
 

00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.880
none of these books could tell us
so what we did is we just did an

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:20.890
so what we did is we just did an
 

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:23.490
so what we did is we just did an
experiment with the next 50,000 people

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:23.500
experiment with the next 50,000 people
 

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.950
experiment with the next 50,000 people
that signed up but it takes about 12

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:25.960
that signed up but it takes about 12
 

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.450
that signed up but it takes about 12
hours for 50,000 people to sign up to

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:27.460
hours for 50,000 people to sign up to
 

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.610
hours for 50,000 people to sign up to
duolingo so for the next 50,000 people

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:29.620
duolingo so for the next 50,000 people
 

00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.200
duolingo so for the next 50,000 people
to sign up what for half of them at

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.210
to sign up what for half of them at
 

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:32.880
to sign up what for half of them at
random we gave them plurals a little

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:32.890
random we gave them plurals a little
 

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.860
random we gave them plurals a little
earlier than for the other half and then

00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:34.870
earlier than for the other half and then
 

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.540
earlier than for the other half and then
we measured which ones make less

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:36.550
we measured which ones make less
 

00:17:36.550 --> 00:17:38.250
we measured which ones make less
mistakes which ones come back more often

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:38.260
mistakes which ones come back more often
 

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.290
mistakes which ones come back more often
which ones have better learning outcomes

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:40.300
which ones have better learning outcomes
 

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:43.260
which ones have better learning outcomes
etc and we just figured out that one of

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:43.270
etc and we just figured out that one of
 

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:44.400
etc and we just figured out that one of
those was actually better than the other

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:44.410
those was actually better than the other
 

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:45.570
those was actually better than the other
one and then we started teaching it to

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:45.580
one and then we started teaching it to
 

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.400
one and then we started teaching it to
everybody that way and then we do that

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:47.410
everybody that way and then we do that
 

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.070
everybody that way and then we do that
every single week we do multiple a B

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:50.080
every single week we do multiple a B
 

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.480
every single week we do multiple a B
test every single week to try to figure

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:51.490
test every single week to try to figure
 

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:52.680
test every single week to try to figure
out what is the best way to teach

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:52.690
out what is the best way to teach
 

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.020
out what is the best way to teach
languages okay and so this is this is

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:55.030
languages okay and so this is this is
 

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:58.200
languages okay and so this is this is
what we're doing and because of that we

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:58.210
what we're doing and because of that we
 

00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.550
what we're doing and because of that we
just well it was about a year ago

00:17:59.550 --> 00:17:59.560
just well it was about a year ago
 

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.500
just well it was about a year ago
somebody did a study of how well you can

00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:01.510
somebody did a study of how well you can
 

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:02.580
somebody did a study of how well you can
learn with duelling when they found that

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:02.590

semester of college education so so
we're very proud of this but I actually

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320
we're very proud of this but I actually
 

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.260
we're very proud of this but I actually
think we can do a lot better this is

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:16.270
think we can do a lot better this is
 

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:17.970
think we can do a lot better this is

00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.430
percentile okay so people who have a
one-on-one tutor so we know that

00:19:02.430 --> 00:19:02.440
one-on-one tutor so we know that
 

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.780
one-on-one tutor so we know that
one-on-one tutors are actually better

one-on-one tutors are actually better
 

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:05.220

you have to spend to certify that and
for example I was just talking to

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:43.270
for example I was just talking to
 

00:21:43.270 --> 00:21:44.730
for example I was just talking to
president Suresh who said that he

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:44.740
president Suresh who said that he
 

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.169
president Suresh who said that he
actually had to take the twelve

00:21:46.169 --> 00:21:46.179
actually had to take the twelve
 

00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:49.200
actually had to take the twelve
and he back then in India the test cost

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:49.210
and he back then in India the test cost
 

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:50.760
and he back then in India the test cost
fifteen dollars that was that was it

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:50.770
fifteen dollars that was that was it
 

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:52.020
fifteen dollars that was that was it
right fifteen uh but he actually

00:21:52.020 --> 00:21:52.030
right fifteen uh but he actually
 

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.130
right fifteen uh but he actually
couldn't afford the fifteen dollars

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:53.140
couldn't afford the fifteen dollars
 

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:55.320
couldn't afford the fifteen dollars
because it was just so expensive so this

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:55.330
because it was just so expensive so this
 

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.250
because it was just so expensive so this
is this is a huge problem that

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:56.260
is this is a huge problem that
 

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.810
is this is a huge problem that
international students have to have have

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:57.820
international students have to have have
 

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:00.000
international students have to have have
to pass through all the time but it's

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.010
to pass through all the time but it's
 

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:01.950
to pass through all the time but it's
not just the cost it's also the case

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:01.960
not just the cost it's also the case
 

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:03.810
not just the cost it's also the case
that the way you take these tests is you

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:03.820
that the way you take these tests is you
 

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.700
that the way you take these tests is you
have to go to it's like taking the SAT

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:05.710
have to go to it's like taking the SAT
 

00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:07.529
have to go to it's like taking the SAT
you have to go to a testing facility to

00:22:07.529 --> 00:22:07.539
you have to go to a testing facility to
 

00:22:07.539 --> 00:22:11.100
you have to go to a testing facility to
take the thing to take the test and and

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:11.110
take the thing to take the test and and
 

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.779
take the thing to take the test and and
so you got to go to a testing center now

00:22:12.779 --> 00:22:12.789
so you got to go to a testing center now
 

00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:14.220
so you got to go to a testing center now
the problem is these testing centers

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:14.230
the problem is these testing centers
 

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.360
the problem is these testing centers
first of all you have to make an

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:15.370
first of all you have to make an
 

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.220
first of all you have to make an
appointment weeks in advance which is a

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:17.230
appointment weeks in advance which is a
 

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.200
appointment weeks in advance which is a
problem and second they're not in every

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:19.210
problem and second they're not in every
 

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.029
problem and second they're not in every
city so if you don't live in one of

00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039
city so if you don't live in one of
 

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:23.310
city so if you don't live in one of
those city you have to travel and this

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:23.320
those city you have to travel and this
 

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.620
those city you have to travel and this
is a huge problem so what we did is we

00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:25.630
is a huge problem so what we did is we
 

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:29.279
is a huge problem so what we did is we
decided to make our own tests to certify

00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:29.289
decided to make our own tests to certify
 

00:22:29.289 --> 00:22:31.260
decided to make our own tests to certify
that people know English the way it

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:31.270
that people know English the way it
 

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.320
that people know English the way it

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:34.330
works this it uses you you take the test
 

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:36.899
works this it uses you you take the test

from an app as opposed to having to go
 

00:22:36.909 --> 00:22:39.419
from an app as opposed to having to go
to a certification center and it costs

00:22:39.419 --> 00:22:39.429
to a certification center and it costs
 

00:22:39.429 --> 00:22:41.100
to a certification center and it costs
20 dollars not two hundred and fifty

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:41.110
20 dollars not two hundred and fifty
 

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:42.840
20 dollars not two hundred and fifty
dollars there's a reason why cost only

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:42.850
dollars there's a reason why cost only
 

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.010

free but there's a reason why it cost
 

00:22:45.159 --> 00:22:46.289
free but there's a reason why it cost
twenty dollars and the reason is because

00:22:46.289 --> 00:22:46.299
twenty dollars and the reason is because
 

00:22:46.299 --> 00:22:48.149

things that we're working with with
 

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:59.850
things that we're working with with
Carnegie Mellon here trying to really do

00:24:59.850 --> 00:24:59.860
Carnegie Mellon here trying to really do
 

00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.440
Carnegie Mellon here trying to really do
it and what we have to do with the

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:01.450
it and what we have to do with the
 

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:03.300
it and what we have to do with the
burden of proof is on us we have to show

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:03.310
burden of proof is on us we have to show
 

00:25:03.310 --> 00:25:05.760
burden of proof is on us we have to show
that our test is as good as the TOEFL at

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:05.770
that our test is as good as the TOEFL at

and so what we're gonna do is in

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:10.480
and so what we're gonna do is in
 

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.730
and so what we're gonna do is in
conjunction with CMU we're gonna do a

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:11.740
conjunction with CMU we're gonna do a
 

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.400
conjunction with CMU we're gonna do a
relatively large scale study that shows

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:14.410
relatively large scale study that shows
 

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.950
relatively large scale study that shows
that our test is as good as the TOEFL so

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960
that our test is as good as the TOEFL so
 

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.450
that our test is as good as the TOEFL so
that's that's that's what we're working

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:18.460
that's that's that's what we're working
 

00:25:18.460 --> 00:25:21.360
that's that's that's what we're working
on and this brings me to the last tenant

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:21.370
on and this brings me to the last tenant
 

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:24.030
on and this brings me to the last tenant
and this is something that I think this

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:24.040
and this is something that I think this
 

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.050
and this is something that I think this
is one of the things that I think is

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:25.060
is one of the things that I think is
 

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.550
is one of the things that I think is
probably the most controversial and most

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:26.560
probably the most controversial and most
 

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.050
probably the most controversial and most
people probably won't agree with this

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:28.060
people probably won't agree with this
 

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:29.730
people probably won't agree with this
but I really do believe it and we do

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:29.740
but I really do believe it and we do
 

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.380
but I really do believe it and we do
this I do it with everything we do at

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:31.390
this I do it with everything we do at
 

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:33.450
this I do it with everything we do at
duolingo we really do try to do this and

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:33.460
duolingo we really do try to do this and
 

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:36.660
duolingo we really do try to do this and
it is we design for the student and not

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:36.670
it is we design for the student and not
 

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.730
it is we design for the student and not
for the system and this is important so

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:38.740
for the system and this is important so
 

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.530
for the system and this is important so
if you look at most educational

actually going to spend all of their
 

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.910
actually going to spend all of their
time designing designing for the system

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:47.920
time designing designing for the system
 

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.100
time designing designing for the system
so they're designing for schools they're

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:50.110
so they're designing for schools they're
 

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.480
so they're designing for schools they're
designing for whoever because that's

we don't do that at Wingo at all we

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:04.330
we don't do that at Wingo at all we
 

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.659
we don't do that at Wingo at all we
always design for the end user not the

always design for the end user not the
 

00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:08.610
always design for the end user not the
middleman so this is exactly what we're

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:08.620
middleman so this is exactly what we're
 

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:09.990
middleman so this is exactly what we're
doing with a test center for example we

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000
doing with a test center for example we

point of view and then we try to fix
 

00:26:14.289 --> 00:26:16.650
point of view and then we try to fix
that problem same with duolingo we look

00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:16.660
that problem same with duolingo we look
 

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.350
that problem same with duolingo we look
we don't care about how the you know

we don't care about how different school
systems teach anything because we don't

00:26:25.289 --> 00:26:25.299
systems teach anything because we don't

want to be bound to how it is however it

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:28.330
want to be bound to how it is however it
 

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:30.270
want to be bound to how it is however it
is they teach their own thing we decided

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:30.280
is they teach their own thing we decided
 

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.310
is they teach their own thing we decided
that we want to teach the way we want to

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320
that we want to teach the way we want to
 

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.080
that we want to teach the way we want to
because we think we can actually do a

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:34.090
because we think we can actually do a
 

00:26:34.090 --> 00:26:35.430
because we think we can actually do a
better job because of the big data that

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440
better job because of the big data that
 

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.669
better job because of the big data that
we have and then maybe people will adopt

00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679
we have and then maybe people will adopt
 

00:26:38.679 --> 00:26:40.380
we have and then maybe people will adopt
our system so we we do that I don't know

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:40.390
our system so we we do that I don't know
 

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.630
our system so we we do that I don't know
if I don't know if anybody else agrees

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640
if I don't know if anybody else agrees
 

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.340
if I don't know if anybody else agrees
with this but we do this we don't design

00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:44.350
with this but we do this we don't design
 

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.529
with this but we do this we don't design
for the system and so that is that is

00:26:46.529 --> 00:26:46.539
for the system and so that is that is
 

00:26:46.539 --> 00:26:48.390
for the system and so that is that is
actually all that I wanted to say thank

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:48.400
actually all that I wanted to say thank
 

00:26:48.400 --> 00:27:04.690
actually all that I wanted to say thank
you

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:04.700
 
 

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.790
 
could you could you please Dan Adkins

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:07.800
could you could you please Dan Adkins
 

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.650
could you could you please Dan Adkins
University of Michigan can you say more

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:09.660
University of Michigan can you say more
 

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:12.860
University of Michigan can you say more
about the the peer evaluation of the

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:12.870
about the the peer evaluation of the
 

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:14.540
about the the peer evaluation of the
quality of the translation and the

00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:14.550
quality of the translation and the
 

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.360
quality of the translation and the
process by which these multi

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:17.370
process by which these multi
 

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.580
process by which these multi
translations converge to something that

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:19.590
translations converge to something that
 

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:22.490
translations converge to something that
you for example send to CNN yeah the way

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:22.500
you for example send to CNN yeah the way
 

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.700
you for example send to CNN yeah the way
that works is so a single student

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:24.710
that works is so a single student
 

00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:26.720
that works is so a single student
usually is pretty crappy at doing the

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:26.730
usually is pretty crappy at doing the
 

00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.130
usually is pretty crappy at doing the
translation so if we just send it to a

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.140
translation so if we just send it to a
 

00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.270
translation so if we just send it to a
single person they're not very good at

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:29.280
single person they're not very good at
 

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.560
single person they're not very good at
it but what we do is we send it to

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:30.570
it but what we do is we send it to
 

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:32.570
it but what we do is we send it to
multiple people and they actually can

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:32.580
multiple people and they actually can
 

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.010
multiple people and they actually can
see each other's translations and it's a

00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020
see each other's translations and it's a
 

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.930
see each other's translations and it's a
bit like a wiki where they can edit each

00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940
bit like a wiki where they can edit each
 

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.100
bit like a wiki where they can edit each
other's translations but it has one

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:37.110
other's translations but it has one
 

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:39.200
other's translations but it has one
extra item which is that you can also

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:39.210
extra item which is that you can also
 

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.180
extra item which is that you can also
vote on somebody else's translation so

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:41.190
vote on somebody else's translation so
 

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:42.380
vote on somebody else's translation so
if you see somebody else's translation

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:42.390
if you see somebody else's translation
 

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:43.430
if you see somebody else's translation
and you think this is really good you

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:43.440
and you think this is really good you
 

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.270
and you think this is really good you
could you up you vote it and when when

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:47.280
could you up you vote it and when when
 

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.920
could you up you vote it and when when
that the way it works is that whenever a

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:48.930
that the way it works is that whenever a
 

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:50.540
that the way it works is that whenever a
given translation has been there for a

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:50.550
given translation has been there for a
 

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:52.640
given translation has been there for a
while and has enough up votes then we

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:52.650
while and has enough up votes then we
 

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:54.110
while and has enough up votes then we
say okay that translation is good and

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120
say okay that translation is good and
 

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.300
say okay that translation is good and
then that's kind of how it converges and

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:56.310
then that's kind of how it converges and
 

00:27:56.310 --> 00:28:01.880
then that's kind of how it converges and
I sentence one sentence one sentence so

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:01.890
I sentence one sentence one sentence so
 

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:06.380
I sentence one sentence one sentence so
that's the quantum ah yes but the thing

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:06.390
that's the quantum ah yes but the thing
 

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:07.820
that's the quantum ah yes but the thing

to change the place where you teach

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:26.230
to change the place where you teach
 

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:28.410
to change the place where you teach
plurals yeah that you've made a decision

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:28.420
plurals yeah that you've made a decision
 

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.510
plurals yeah that you've made a decision
that a singular learning progression

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:30.520
that a singular learning progression
 

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.750
that a singular learning progression
should be applied to all the students as

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760
should be applied to all the students as
 

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.700
should be applied to all the students as
opposed to potentially bearing it yep

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:35.710
opposed to potentially bearing it yep
 

00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:37.230
opposed to potentially bearing it yep
can you talk about that decision because

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:37.240
can you talk about that decision because
 

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.220
can you talk about that decision because
I'm sure you didn't come to it lightly

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:38.230
I'm sure you didn't come to it lightly
 

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:40.470
I'm sure you didn't come to it lightly
yes so this is where we are in the

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480
yes so this is where we are in the
 

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.660
yes so this is where we are in the
development of duolingo right now every

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:42.670
development of duolingo right now every
 

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.130
development of duolingo right now every
student gets the same progression I

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:44.140
student gets the same progression I
 

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.750
student gets the same progression I
don't like that we know that's not the

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760
don't like that we know that's not the
 

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:47.070
don't like that we know that's not the
best not just progression there's all

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080
best not just progression there's all
 

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.970
best not just progression there's all
kinds of things that we need to

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:47.980
kinds of things that we need to
 

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:49.680
kinds of things that we need to
personalize we're not personalizing it

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:49.690
personalize we're not personalizing it
 

00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.660
personalize we're not personalizing it
yet we're working this is the main thing

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:51.670
yet we're working this is the main thing
 

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.100
yet we're working this is the main thing
we're developing our personalization

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.110
we're developing our personalization
 

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.750
we're developing our personalization
right now what we think we have is we

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760
right now what we think we have is we
 

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.120
right now what we think we have is we
have a single curriculum that we think

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.130
have a single curriculum that we think
 

00:31:57.130 --> 00:31:59.850
have a single curriculum that we think
is good for the aggregate that's much

00:31:59.850 --> 00:31:59.860
is good for the aggregate that's much
 

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.890
is good for the aggregate that's much
better than I think for example the

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:01.900
better than I think for example the
 

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.540
better than I think for example the
single curriculum that is used in most

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:03.550
single curriculum that is used in most
 

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:06.419
single curriculum that is used in most
say educational systems throughout the

00:32:06.419 --> 00:32:06.429
say educational systems throughout the
 

00:32:06.429 --> 00:32:08.520
say educational systems throughout the
world with that which is also a single

world with that which is also a single
 

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.680
world with that which is also a single
system that's what we have what we think

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:10.690
system that's what we have what we think
 

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.930
system that's what we have what we think
we know in fact we can do better for

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:12.940
we know in fact we can do better for
 

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:14.580

then we're gonna we're going to spend
 

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.250
then we're gonna we're going to spend
some computing power and then we're

00:32:47.250 --> 00:32:47.260
some computing power and then we're
 

00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:51.150
some computing power and then we're
gonna design a curriculum basically that

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:51.160
gonna design a curriculum basically that
 

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.790
gonna design a curriculum basically that
it's just for you based on that so that

a domain you know me the results you're

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:07.620
a domain you know me the results you're
 

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:10.320
a domain you know me the results you're
showing it just amazing my question was

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:10.330
showing it just amazing my question was
 

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.919
showing it just amazing my question was
more about this problem in itself is

00:33:13.919 --> 00:33:13.929
more about this problem in itself is
 

00:33:13.929 --> 00:33:15.900
more about this problem in itself is
really really important to solve but as

00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:15.910
really really important to solve but as
 

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:17.310
really really important to solve but as
you go to other domains you know you

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320
you go to other domains you know you
 

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:19.140
you go to other domains you know you
would you say you know learn calculus

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:19.150
would you say you know learn calculus
 

00:33:19.150 --> 00:33:21.990
would you say you know learn calculus
this way or physics this way what do you

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000
this way or physics this way what do you
 

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.180
this way or physics this way what do you
think where would you say this approach

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:24.190
think where would you say this approach
 

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:26.130
think where would you say this approach
is appropriate and where would you say

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:26.140
is appropriate and where would you say
 

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.200
is appropriate and where would you say
you know something totally different is

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:28.210
you know something totally different is
 

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.550
you know something totally different is
needed as we look at the problem

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:30.560
needed as we look at the problem
 

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.350
needed as we look at the problem
yeah that's a really good question and

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360
yeah that's a really good question and
 

00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:33.580
yeah that's a really good question and
something that we grapple with all the

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:33.590
something that we grapple with all the
 

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:34.840
something that we grapple with all the
time because what I actually wanted to

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:34.850
time because what I actually wanted to
 

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.100
time because what I actually wanted to
do when I started was I wanted to do

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:36.110
do when I started was I wanted to do
 

00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:37.780
do when I started was I wanted to do
education not just language education

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:37.790
education not just language education
 

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.550
education not just language education
but we started by just with one vertical

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:39.560
but we started by just with one vertical
 

00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.080
but we started by just with one vertical
and and I think it was the right call I

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:41.090
and and I think it was the right call I
 

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.310
and and I think it was the right call I
mean if you look at it for an app for

mean if you look at it for an app for
 

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.440
mean if you look at it for an app for
example now we have more active users

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:44.450

so I think and they teach everything

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:49.280
so I think and they teach everything
 

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.650
so I think and they teach everything
whereas we only teach one thing so I

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:50.660
whereas we only teach one thing so I
 

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:51.730

think it was the right call

00:33:51.730 --> 00:33:51.740
think it was the right call
 

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.860
think it was the right call
to really do just concentrate on one and

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:53.870
to really do just concentrate on one and

to really do just concentrate on one and
really try to get it right and we're

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:54.890
really try to get it right and we're
 

00:33:54.890 --> 00:33:56.170
really try to get it right and we're
nowhere near getting it right I think

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:56.180
nowhere near getting it right I think
 

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.090
nowhere near getting it right I think
we're I don't know 5% of getting it

00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:58.100
we're I don't know 5% of getting it
 

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.450
we're I don't know 5% of getting it
right but we're gonna start going into

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:01.460
right but we're gonna start going into
 

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.670
right but we're gonna start going into

00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720
literacy these are two that we like a
 

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:15.640
literacy these are two that we like a
lot I don't know which one we're

00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:15.650
lot I don't know which one we're
 

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.020
lot I don't know which one we're
actually gonna go for but we are gonna

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:17.030
actually gonna go for but we are gonna
 

00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:18.280
actually gonna go for but we are gonna
do order for the verticals so I think

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:18.290
do order for the verticals so I think
 

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:19.870
do order for the verticals so I think
this approach applies for a lot of

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:19.880
this approach applies for a lot of
 

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.940
this approach applies for a lot of
things I don't know if it'll apply for

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:21.950
things I don't know if it'll apply for
 

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:23.080
things I don't know if it'll apply for
everything but I think most of these

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:23.090
everything but I think most of these
 

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.700
everything but I think most of these
tenants they're general enough that I

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:24.710
tenants they're general enough that I
 

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:26.020
tenants they're general enough that I
think they definitely I mean it should

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:26.030
think they definitely I mean it should
 

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.970
think they definitely I mean it should
be mobile for example this is one of

00:34:27.970 --> 00:34:27.980
be mobile for example this is one of
 

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:29.230
be mobile for example this is one of
those things they whatever you do it

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:29.240
those things they whatever you do it
 

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.240
those things they whatever you do it
should be mobile so all of these things

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:31.250
should be mobile so all of these things
 

00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:32.830
should be mobile so all of these things
I think it applies but I think there may

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:32.840
I think it applies but I think there may
 

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.390
I think it applies but I think there may
be we may have to do a lot of changes

00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:34.400
be we may have to do a lot of changes
 

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.100
be we may have to do a lot of changes
for that I mean right now we're

00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:36.110
for that I mean right now we're
 

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.860
for that I mean right now we're
extremely fine-tuning language and I

00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:38.870
extremely fine-tuning language and I
 

00:34:38.870 --> 00:34:40.210
extremely fine-tuning language and I
think when we start with anything else

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:40.220
think when we start with anything else
 

00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.340
think when we start with anything else
we're gonna be because of all the

00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:42.350
we're gonna be because of all the
 

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:43.659
we're gonna be because of all the
technologies that we've built we may be

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:43.669
technologies that we've built we may be
 

00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:44.320
technologies that we've built we may be
I don't know

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:44.330
I don't know
 

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.419
I don't know
20% of the way there for something else

00:34:46.419 --> 00:34:46.429
20% of the way there for something else
 

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:47.950
20% of the way there for something else
but we'll have to the other 80% because

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960
but we'll have to the other 80% because
 

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.880
but we'll have to the other 80% because
there's a lot of fine-tuning for that

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:50.890
there's a lot of fine-tuning for that
 

00:34:50.890 --> 00:34:54.310
there's a lot of fine-tuning for that
okay thank you
