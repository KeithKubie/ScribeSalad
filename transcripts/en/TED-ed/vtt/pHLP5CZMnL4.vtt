00:00:06.949 --> 00:00:09.244
As we walk through our daily environments,

00:00:09.244 --> 00:00:11.478
we're surrounded by exotic creatures

00:00:11.478 --> 00:00:14.431
that are too small to see 
with the naked eye.

00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:18.237
We usually imagine these 
microscopic organisms, or microbes,

00:00:18.237 --> 00:00:22.329
as asocial cells that float around
by themselves.

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.470
But in reality, 
microbes gather by the millions

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.114
to form vast communities 
known as biofilms.

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:33.109
Natural biofilms are like 
miniature jungles

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:37.582
filled with many kinds of microbes
from across the web of life.

00:00:37.582 --> 00:00:40.702
Bacteria and archaea mingle with
other microbes

00:00:40.702 --> 00:00:43.438
like algae, fungi, and protozoa,

00:00:43.438 --> 00:00:48.915
forming dense, organized structures
that grow on almost any surface.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:50.677
When you pad across a river bottom,

00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:52.939
touch the rind of an aged cheese,

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:54.483
tend your garden soil,

00:00:54.483 --> 00:00:56.255
or brush your teeth,

00:00:56.255 --> 00:01:00.561
you're coming into contact with these
invisible ecosystems.

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:03.043
To see how biofilms come about,

00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:07.190
let's watch one as it develops
on a submerged river rock.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.799
This type of biofilm might begin
with a few bacteria

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.147
swimming through their liquid environment.

00:01:13.147 --> 00:01:18.076
The cells use rotating flagella
to propel towards the surface of the rock,

00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:22.165
which they attach to with the help
of sticky appendages.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:25.703
Then, they start producing an
extracellular matrix

00:01:25.703 --> 00:01:29.474
that holds them together as they divide
and reproduce.

00:01:29.474 --> 00:01:32.495
Before long, microcolonies arise,

00:01:32.495 --> 00:01:36.939
clusters of cells sheathed in this slimy,
glue-like material.

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.055
Microcolonies grow to become towers,

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:42.632
while water channels flow around them,

00:01:42.632 --> 00:01:45.207
functioning like a basic 
circulatory system.

00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:49.143
But why do microbes build 
such complex communities

00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:51.129
when they could live alone?

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:53.739
For one thing, microbes 
living in a biofilm

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:57.026
are rooted in a relatively 
stable microenvironment

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:59.793
where they may have access 
to a nutrient source.

00:01:59.793 --> 00:02:02.303
There's also safety in numbers.

00:02:02.303 --> 00:02:05.745
Out in the deep, dark wilderness
of the microbial world,

00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:08.644
isolated microbes face serious risks.

00:02:08.644 --> 00:02:10.191
Predators want to eat them,

00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:12.509
immune systems seek to destroy them,

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:14.697
and there are physical dangers, too,

00:02:14.697 --> 00:02:17.110
like running out of water
and drying up.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.682
However, in a biofilm, 
the extracellular matrix

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:23.328
shields microbes from external threats.

00:02:23.328 --> 00:02:27.926
Biofilms also enable interactions
between individual cells.

00:02:27.926 --> 00:02:31.600
When microbes are packed against 
each other in close proximity,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.653
they can communicate,

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:34.521
exchange genetic information,

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:38.714
and engage in cooperative
and competitive social behaviors.

00:02:38.714 --> 00:02:40.640
Take the soil in your garden,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.283
home to thousands of bacterial species.

00:02:43.283 --> 00:02:45.855
As one species colonizes a plant root,

00:02:45.855 --> 00:02:50.647
its individual cells might differentiate
into various subpopulations,

00:02:50.647 --> 00:02:53.350
each carrying out a specific task.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.445
Matrix producers pump out 
the extracellular goo,

00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:02.082
swimmers assemble flagella
and are free to move about or migrate,

00:03:02.082 --> 00:03:06.708
and spore-formers produce dormant,
tough endospores

00:03:06.708 --> 00:03:08.187
that survive starvation,

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:09.607
temperature extremes,

00:03:09.607 --> 00:03:12.057
and harmful radiation.

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:14.380
This phenomenon is called 
division of labor.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.300
Ultimately, it gives rise to 
a sophisticated system of cooperation

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.932
that's somewhat like 
a multicellular organism in itself.

00:03:23.932 --> 00:03:28.253
But because biofilms often contain
many different microbes

00:03:28.253 --> 00:03:30.365
that aren't closely related to each other,

00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:33.490
interactions can also be competitive.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.908
Bacteria launch vicious attacks 
on their competitors

00:03:36.908 --> 00:03:39.775
by secreting chemicals 
into the environment,

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:45.176
or by deploying molecular spears
to inject nearby cells with toxins

00:03:45.176 --> 00:03:47.981
that literally blow them up.

00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:51.201
In the end, competition 
is all about resources.

00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:53.354
If one species eliminates another,

00:03:53.354 --> 00:03:57.120
it keeps more space and food for itself.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.850
Although this dramatic life cycle
occurs beyond the limits of our vision,

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.743
microbial communities provide humans
and other species with tangible,

00:04:05.743 --> 00:04:08.646
and sometimes even delicious, benefits.

00:04:08.646 --> 00:04:12.442
Microbes make up a major fraction
of the biomass on Earth

00:04:12.442 --> 00:04:15.881
and play a critical role 
within the global ecosystem

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.555
that supports all larger organisms,

00:04:18.555 --> 00:04:19.945
including us.

00:04:19.945 --> 00:04:22.167
They produce much of the oxygen we breath,

00:04:22.167 --> 00:04:26.765
and are recruited to clean up
environmental pollution, like oil spills,

00:04:26.765 --> 00:04:28.796
or to treat our waste water.

00:04:28.796 --> 00:04:32.814
Not to mention, biofilms are normal
and flavor enhancing parts

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.945
of many of the foods we enjoy,

00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:36.232
including cheese,

00:04:36.232 --> 00:04:37.286
salami,

00:04:37.286 --> 00:04:39.257
and kombucha.

00:04:39.257 --> 00:04:41.116
So the next time you brush your teeth,

00:04:41.116 --> 00:04:42.798
bite into that cheese rind,

00:04:42.798 --> 00:04:44.442
sift through garden soil,

00:04:44.442 --> 00:04:46.471
or skip a river stone,

00:04:46.471 --> 00:04:48.269
look as close as you can.

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:51.680
Imagine the microbial jungles 
all around you

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.409
waiting to be discovered and explored.
