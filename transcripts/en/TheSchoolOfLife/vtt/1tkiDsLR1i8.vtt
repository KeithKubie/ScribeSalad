00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:05.740
It might be normal to imagine that a good
society would be one in which a majority of

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.190
people held optimistic views about themselves,
their fellow citizens and their prospects

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.160
for their collective futures. But, in fact,
quite the opposite appears to be true: deep

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.880
pessimism seems a key ingredient for the maintenance
of any good society. At the core of pessimism

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:30.100
is the idea that everyone, however outwardly
normal, is severely flawed: short-term, blinkered,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.140
vengeful, sentimental and prone to reckless
anger, fear, delusion and passion. We’re

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.380
mad monkeys, with a few extra neurones. From
a brutal acceptance of this dark starting-point,

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.040
there can flow a range of measures that together
will make for exceptionally wise, calm and

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.270
reasonable societies. Let’s consider a few:
In an ideally pessimistic society, rather

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.079
boring and extremely steady politicians are
the norm. No one believes the wilder utopian

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.310
promises of firebrand leaders. The electorate
is simply far too pessimistic to trust in

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.350
easy, rapid solutions to any of the nation’s
substantial problems. Dramatic promises at

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.590
the stump are immediately discounted with
a wry, dismissive shrug. Because pessimists

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.549
know just how flawed any one individual can
be, the ideal pessimistic society invests

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.380
heavily in strong, slow-moving, independent
institutions that prevent too much power from

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.950
ever falling into the hands of a single person.
Furthermore, these institutions are insulated

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.330
from the fluctuations of public opinion – which,
pessimistically, are seen as being hugely

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.341
prone to hysteria and overreaction. In the
ideal pessimistic society, there won’t be

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:54.610
much appetite for singling out any particular
group or class of people for blame. Our troubles,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.149
the electorate sadly admit, are caused mainly
by big impersonal, historical forces – rather

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:07.560
than by a few people who are easy to target
and cathartically hate. Because they assume

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.829
that it’s natural to have rather dangerous
appetites and desires, the citizens of a pessimistic

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:18.620
society willingly put quite a lot of restraints
on themselves, defining freedom not as the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.299
ability to do whatever they want at any point,
but as the liberty to act in accordance with

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.299
their wisest, most reasonable selves (which
only appear every now and then). They therefore

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.719
don’t see it as any particular loss of freedom
to be gently nudged away from blowing their

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:41.680
savings, overeating, doing no exercise, ruining
their relationships or developing addictions.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.159
They accept a paternalistic society as the
natural price for limiting their own self-destructive

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:54.140
tendencies. Pessimistic societies don’t
have much time for celebrity culture, for

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.031
they are dubious about whether anyone much
deserves to be idolised: they know that from

00:02:59.031 --> 00:03:04.329
close up, we’re all a bit of a mess. And
they’re not shocked by revelations of chaotic

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:10.499
private lives, since this is assumed to be
the norm. Spare energy is directed more towards

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:16.870
forgiveness rather than adulation followed
by denigration. In pessimistic societies,

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.480
the education system is elaborate, broad,
ambitious and very well resourced; citizens

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.109
assume that the raw human mind needs a huge
amount of structured, targeted help in order

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.200
to cope with life’s challenges. The curriculum
isn’t merely focused on technical skills

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.299
though; there is a lot of help around emotional
issues too – which, it’s acknowledged,

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.670
are at the root of so many of our tragedies.
Because they acknowledge that we’re all

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.639
fragile, easily irked creatures, pessimistic
societies place great emphasis on creating

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:55.519
quietly uplifting and beautiful communal environments.
Cities are marked by elegance, simplicity,

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:01.379
rationality and harmony. A stridently ugly
tower block, a depressingly chaotic airport,

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:06.119
a squalid railway station – they darkly
admit – could be enough to drive someone

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:11.699
to despair. The rich have always recognized
this for themselves; a pessimistic society

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:17.989
merely differs in regarding this as a universal
truth. In optimistic societies, there are

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.129
constant claims that everyone can be exceptional
and, one day, awe-inspiringly successful.

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.949
The charms and rewards of life are therefore
fundamentally geared towards those who make

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.350
it to the top. The best restaurants are superb,
the private hospitals are outstanding, the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:40.169
most expensive schools magnificent, the richest
residential areas delightful, the taxes for

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:47.470
the rich very low. But, naively, such societies
forget that, by statistical inevitability,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.620
most people are actually not going to be successful
at all. So in the pessimistic society, mediocrity

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.960
and relative failure are assumed to be the
norm and the goal of government is understood

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.479
to be that of rendering an average life (that
is, the life most people will actually lead)

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:11.669
as attractive as possible. Public housing,
state schools, public hospitals and transportation

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.349
are all superb, because it’s assumed (with
extreme realism) that we’re almost all going

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:24.509
to be relying on them. By following such pessimistic
dictates, the profound consequence will be

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.669
a society where – paradoxically – there
will be rather a lot to be cheerful about

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.870
– though, of course, the wary, gloomy and
wise citizenry would never quite dare to put

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.080
it like that.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.560
At The School of Life we believe in developing emotional intelligence.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.360
To that end we've also created a whole range of products to support that growth.
