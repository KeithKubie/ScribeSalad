00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.241
While browsing the latest dating app, have
you ever stopped and wondered “Why are so

00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:08.310
many of the good looking people jerks?”
Well, it turns out that there’s a simple

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.470
explanation for this phenomenon.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.200
If we make a little graph of Niceness v.s.
Good Looks, we can start to get an answer.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.970
First, we have to assume that people are equally
spread across this chart; meaning some people

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.869
are mean and ugly, some are ugly and nice,
some are good looking and mean, and some are

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.750
good looking and nice! Of course, this is
based on your subjective taste, and what you

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.440
find beautiful and nice.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.039
Now if you think about it, you probably have
zero interest in people who you find mean

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:43.149
and ugly, meaning you’re pool of potential
mates gets a bit smaller. And truthfully you

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.079
probably prefer a certain combination of niceness
in good looks. Ultimately, we’re left with

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.690
a triangle of people you find acceptable and
give attention to in the first place.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.319
But now, 100% of the people left in your pool
who aren’t that attractive to you are nice

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:01.640
- they have to be otherwise you wouldn’t
pay them any attention. After all, if somebody

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.830
is nice, you’re less likely to be critical
of their appearance, which brings down the

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.730
average of nice peoples looks. To the same
token almost half of the people that are beautiful

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.350
to you, are mean. Again, if somebody is mean,
you likely require that they be really attractive

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.770
for you to give them any attention, which
makes it seem like more attractive people

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.770
are jerks.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.960
If we take this a step further we can assume
that people who are both hot and nice are

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.690
the best catches, and get swept off the market
quickly, further increasing your perception

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.700
and bias.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.710
We can see a similar thing happen with food
- do you ever wonder why it seems that healthy

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.990
foods just don’t taste as good? Well let’s
use our chart - Yumminess vs Healthiness.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.930
Of course, in reality this chart probably
isn’t evenly distributed, because food is

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.270
often created to specifically taste good,
so the right hand side of the graph is likely

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.380
more dense. Regardless, we can take out all
the foods that don’t taste good and aren’t

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.040
even good for you, because why would you bother
eating them? But of the foods left over that

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.340
you do eat, now 100% of the foods that don’t
taste good are good for you!

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.040
Just like the dating graph, it’s because
of the people or foods that you don’t pay

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.859
attention to, that your perception becomes
skewed.

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:16.099
Back to dating, and it’s true. From your
perspective, good looking people are more

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.219
likely to be jerks - but it’s because of
who you’re paying attention to in the first

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.530
place. You simply ignore the ugly jerks!

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.781
