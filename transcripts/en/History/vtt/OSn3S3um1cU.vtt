00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.880
- Welcome to my man cave.
Come on in.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.880
As you can see, we like to hunt
not just alligators.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.540
Our line of work,
the wintertime we have off,

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.170
so we get to spend a lot of time
in the woods.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.380
Dad’s always brought me up

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.580
deer hunting
in the swamps and whatnot,

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.620
and now that I’m older,
we do a lot of traveling

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.290
all over the United States

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.290
and even in Canada.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.830
As you can see,

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.330
we’ve had some pretty good hunts
over the years.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.790
Growing up, I always was
intrigued by taxidermy work,

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.670
and my local taxidermist
took me in under his wings

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.710
and taught me, you know,
the ins and outs of it.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.040
I do love doing it.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.080
I’ve done
some of the animals in here.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.540
These deer right here on
this wall were all done by me.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.960
We got a little mixture
of everything.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.540
These at the top up here are
some elk that I shot in Montana.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.080
I shot ’em
in back to back years.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.790
It was pretty neat trying
to get them things up there,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.000
to say the least.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.540
Well, that duck
is up there by himself

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.000
because most of the time,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.040
basically, all I’ll hunt
is white-tail deer.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.670
I’ll go on a couple of duck
hunts at the end of the year.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.540
I have a picture here
on my wall that I love,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.670
and so I’m trying to mimic
that picture right there.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.040
Hopefully, this year I’ll go
and shoot a few more ducks,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.420
and then I’ll start placing ’em
in that corner

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.460
the same way that
they look in this picture.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.710
But I’ve traveled up to Canada
and shot this real big bear.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.380
He was just a big old bear,
first bear hunt I ever went on.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.420
You know, deer are scored
by the inches of antlers,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.460
and bears are scored
by the width of the skull.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.880
Once it dries out,

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.080
it’s the width and the length
of the skull.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.380
You definitely don’t want
this guy clamping down on you.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.210
And, of course, our
prized possession right here

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.960
is a giant alligator
that we caught one day.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.460
He was 12-foot-4.
He broke the line.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.040
We had to chase him down
the river for several miles

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.170
and caught up to him.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.170
And as I was pulling
the trigger,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.920
the gator bumped
the end of my barrel,

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.620
and right when I pulled
the trigger, it split my barrel.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.080
So a conversation piece,
to say the least.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.620
As you can see right here,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.710
I still have that tooth
from that alligator last year

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.210
that bit the other alligator
in the head and broke his tooth.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.120
This is the old
snaggle-tooth tooth.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.670
- Look at this.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.750
- Oh, my God.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.500
Oh, my God, look at that tooth!

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.960
- Just the thickness
of that tooth

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.830
just shows you the power
he must have put in

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.540
to biting that alligator
and just snap it off like that.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.380
And, I mean, it just fit
right back in there,

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.000
so we know absolutely

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.210
that was the alligator
that killed that other one.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.830
You know, my love for hunting

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.920
comes from my dad
and my grandpa.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.170
It’s been passed down
for years and years.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.670
I remember not even being able
to walk through the swamp.

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.250
My dad would carry me
on his back

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.500
and bring me rabbit hunting
with him and deer hunting.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.040
I have my very first deer.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.620
When I shot it,
my dad mounted it for me,

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.170
and I have it up top up there.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.750
And then
this is my little boy’s

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.960
very first buck that he shot,

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.920
he shot last year
at six years old.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.880
And I got to experience that
with him,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.330
so that was pretty special
and something I’ll never forget.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.500
We do our part
to try to help out.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.830
We do some hunts
throughout the year

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.290
where we take kids out

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.380
that they don’t get the chance
to go out there.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.250
We take some out
and do some hunts with ’em

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.830
just to get the experience,
you know.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.880
We get to do it all the time
and we take it for granted.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.790
But we’ve learned a lot
over the years

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.750
that, you know, you don’t
have to look very far

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.040
to see somebody less fortunate.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.920
You know,
I keep a little tally

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.330
of how many deer I’ve shot
over the years,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.290
and I’m a little over 100
right now.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.790
You know, people say,
yeah, you shot so many,

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.380
you don’t remember anything,

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.040
and I can tell you the story
of every single deer I shot.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.500
Dad might be
the King of the Swamp,

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.250
but they call me old
Buck Master Junior right here.
