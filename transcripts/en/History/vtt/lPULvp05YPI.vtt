00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.980
NARRATOR: On the rocky cliffs
of Montana's Tobacco Root

00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:08.274
Mountains, lion hunter
Jake Herak and his pack

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:12.144
are chasing their fifth lion in
just three weeks of the season.

00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:14.848
JAKE: I think the
dogs are on the trail.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.716
Looks like they're cooking
out of here pretty dang fast.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.652
Up here, you put your
foot in the wrong spot

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:23.088
and you're one slip
away from death.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.859
I'm not too sure what's
going on right now.

00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.695
I've got dogs circling
around all these trees here.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.163
Looks like they've
lost the track,

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:33.299
and they're not sure
where this cat went.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.701
You never can be too careful
with a predator like this

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:36.736
when the dogs don't have them.

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:41.741
Ah, [bleep]!
There's blood.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.981
There's quite a bit,
actually, spread

00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:50.049
out here in the dog tracks.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:51.451
This isn't good.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.286
I got to gather up my dogs here
and see if one of them's hurt.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:55.722
Come here.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.490
Lefty, come here.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.162
Ooh, looks like I found the
source of the blood here.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:08.401
Um, Lefty looks like he's
pretty cut up on his hind foot.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.303
I can't tell if
that's from the lion

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.273
or from a rock file or what.

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.442
But right now I don't care
where that cat is, I need to get

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:20.113
Lefty to the vet right away.

00:01:20.213 --> 00:01:23.249
A cut like this can compound
into a big infection,

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:25.918
and it could be a
season-ender and possibly

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:28.421
be an ender to that leg period.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:31.290
Man, if I lost a dog at
this point in the season,

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.626
it would be a bad, bad thing.

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.829
Lefty, I call Mr. Consistent.

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.998
It's time to get the hell out
of here and get him to a vet.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:43.002
[ominous music playing]

00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.905
I got about seven miles to
travel out of the mountains,

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.207
and then I've got about
another 10 miles of highway

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:52.612
to get down and out
to the vet clinic.

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.881
And the snow conditions
right now is just awful.

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.649
We got about a
foot of fresh snow.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.285
And it's really icy and
these traveling conditions

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.654
right now are just bad.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:02.989
NARRATOR: The mountain
roads are covered

00:02:03.089 --> 00:02:06.793
in 12 inches of fresh snow,
and the surface is slick.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.534
JAKE: Oh, here we go.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:15.502
Oh, [bleep].

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.141
I've managed to slide
us off the road here.

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.310
Not the best timing.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.181
[car tires whirring]

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:48.001
I've got my truck shrunk
down to the axle here.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.806
I'm going to winch through
that tree over there.

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:56.342
So I'm just clearing
this tire here.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.711
I definitely need this winch.

00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:00.012
NARRATOR: Jake's
pickup is equipped

00:03:00.112 --> 00:03:03.582
with a winch that has a pull
capacity of 6,000 pounds.

00:03:03.682 --> 00:03:09.355
This thing's gotten me out of
a lot of bad, bad situations.

00:03:09.455 --> 00:03:13.693
Hopefully, my cable here is
long enough to reach that tree.

00:03:13.793 --> 00:03:15.128
Looks like a pretty
long stretch.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:19.699
Ooh, there we go.

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.300
I'm out of cable.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.303
I'm about three feet short
of touching the tree.

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:25.705
[bleep]

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.808
If I can't fix the problem,
it's going to be a long night

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:30.976
and a long walk out here.

00:03:31.076 --> 00:03:33.412
It's always important
to be prepared.

00:03:33.512 --> 00:03:34.947
It's why I brought
my lucky cord.

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:36.115
NARRATOR: Mountaineering
cord isn't

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:38.151
designed for heavy
hauling, but could

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:40.252
be a life saver in a pinch.

00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:43.222
Six millimeters of woven nylon
should be able to withstand

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:45.124
nearly a ton of force.

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:47.025
The breaking
strength of this cord

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:49.028
isn't enough to handle
it with just one thread,

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:51.130
so I wrapped it
around multiple times.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.135
And now it's going to be pulling
on three, instead of just one.

00:03:56.235 --> 00:04:00.539
Test it, just to make sure
it ain't going to bust.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.743
Ooh, that's about
as close as it gets.

00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:10.616
I hope this rope holds.

00:04:10.717 --> 00:04:12.351
This is usually trial
and error, but I ain't

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:13.853
got time for that right now.

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:17.890
I've got to get
this dog to the vet.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.359
[suspenseful music playing]

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.361
It's working.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:30.536
All right, I'm back
in business here.

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.238
Need to gather up my
winch, and get out of here.

00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:37.577
This was a time consuming
deal, and I've got a hurt dog.

00:04:37.677 --> 00:04:38.678
I just need to be real
careful the rest of the way.
