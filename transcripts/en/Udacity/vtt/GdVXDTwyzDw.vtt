00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.548
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; The answer is that the graph would become a straight line if the coefficient

00:00:04.548 --> 00:00:09.277
a equaled zero. If we substitute zero in the place of a, then this entire first

00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:14.073
term becomes zero since zero times anything is zero. Then we would just be left

00:00:14.073 --> 00:00:18.754
with y equals Bx plus c. We can recognize this as the slope intercept form. Of

00:00:18.754 --> 00:00:23.952
the equation of the line. Where B here is serving as the slope, and C is serving

00:00:23.952 --> 00:00:26.557
as the Y coordinate of the Y intercept.
