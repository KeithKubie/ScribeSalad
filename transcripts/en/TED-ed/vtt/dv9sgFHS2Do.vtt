00:00:02.416 --> 00:00:05.156
First Kiss

00:00:05.156 --> 00:00:06.616
Her mouth

00:00:06.616 --> 00:00:08.766
fell into my mouth

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:14.486
like a summer snow, like a
5th season, like a fresh Eden,

00:00:14.486 --> 00:00:17.306
like Eden when Eve made God

00:00:17.306 --> 00:00:21.486
whimper with the liquid
tilt of her hips—

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:23.927
her kiss hurt like that—

00:00:23.927 --> 00:00:28.157
I mean, it was as if she’d mixed
the sweat of an angel

00:00:28.157 --> 00:00:31.251
with the taste of a tangerine,

00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:35.641
I swear. My mouth
had been a helmet forever

00:00:35.641 --> 00:00:37.981
greased with secrets, my mouth

00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:43.681
a dead-end street a little bit
lit by teeth—my heart, a clam

00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:46.851
slammed shut at the bottom of a dark,

00:00:46.851 --> 00:00:50.221
but her mouth pulled up
like a baby-blue Cadillac

00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:54.581
packed with canaries driven
by a toucan—I swear

00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:59.031
those lips said bright
wings when we kissed, wild

00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:03.411
and precise—as if she were
teaching a seahorse to speak—

00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:08.714
her mouth so careful, chumming
the first vowel from my throat

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:14.464
until my brain was a piano
banged loud, hammered like that—

00:01:14.464 --> 00:01:19.144
it was like, I swear her tongue
was Saturn’s 7th moon—

00:01:19.144 --> 00:01:23.714
hot like that, hot
and cold and circling,

00:01:23.714 --> 00:01:27.569
circling, turning me
into a glad planet—

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:30.379
sun on one side, night pouring

00:01:30.379 --> 00:01:36.759
her slow hand over the other: one fire
flying the kite of another.

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.694
Her kiss, I swear—if the Great
Mother rushed open the moon

00:01:42.694 --> 00:01:47.244
like a gift and you were there
to feel your shadow finally

00:01:47.244 --> 00:01:49.214
unhooked from your wrist.

00:01:49.214 --> 00:01:51.074
That’d be it, but even sweeter—

00:01:51.074 --> 00:01:56.544
like a riot of peg-legged priests
on pogo-sticks, up and up,

00:01:56.544 --> 00:02:00.734
this way and this, not
falling but on and on

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.964
like that, badly behaved

00:02:02.964 --> 00:02:09.674
but holy—I swear! That
kiss: both lips utterly committed

00:02:09.674 --> 00:02:12.484
to the world like a Peace Corps,

00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:16.244
like a free store, forever and always

00:02:16.244 --> 00:02:24.234
a new city—no locks, no walls, just
doors—like that, I swear,

00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:26.004
like that.
