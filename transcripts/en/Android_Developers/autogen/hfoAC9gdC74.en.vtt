expresso it's a testing framework so let

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
expresso it's a testing framework so let
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.960
expresso it's a testing framework so let
me just back up a little bit and asked

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970
me just back up a little bit and asked
 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.599
me just back up a little bit and asked
all of you how many of you do Android

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609
all of you how many of you do Android
 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.720
all of you how many of you do Android
testing oh okay

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
testing oh okay
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.210
testing oh okay
more than half that's excellent and how

more than half that's excellent and how
 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.170
more than half that's excellent and how
many of you have written

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
many of you have written
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.859
many of you have written
expresso tests little bit less than a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460
Android expresso so I'll be going
 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.799
Android expresso so I'll be going
through the beginning stuff pretty

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809
through the beginning stuff pretty
 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.709
through the beginning stuff pretty
quickly but hopefully for those of you

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719

good enough overview so that when I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510
good enough overview so that when I
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.389
good enough overview so that when I
explain more advanced techniques you can

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399
explain more advanced techniques you can
 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.299
explain more advanced techniques you can
follow along well first what is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309

automated UI testing framework meaning

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190
automated UI testing framework meaning
 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.959
automated UI testing framework meaning
that you write some code and then you

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969
that you write some code and then you
 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.569
that you write some code and then you
can let go of your hand because expresso

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
can let go of your hand because expresso
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.639
can let go of your hand because expresso
will click buttons and type tests and do

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649
will click buttons and type tests and do
 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.740
will click buttons and type tests and do
all these user actions for you and then

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
all these user actions for you and then
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.329
all these user actions for you and then
you can verify the stay out of app to

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
you can verify the stay out of app to
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.010
you can verify the stay out of app to
make sure that it's behaving the way you

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
make sure that it's behaving the way you
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.690
make sure that it's behaving the way you
expect it to behave and what's nice

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700
expect it to behave and what's nice
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.460
expect it to behave and what's nice
about expresso is that well first of all

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
about expresso is that well first of all

way but the most interesting thing about

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850
way but the most interesting thing about
 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.780
way but the most interesting thing about
expresso is that it does automatic

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790
expresso is that it does automatic
 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.600
expresso is that it does automatic
synchronization that sounds really fancy

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
synchronization that sounds really fancy
 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.020
synchronization that sounds really fancy
and whatever that means so I can tell

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030
and whatever that means so I can tell
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.730
and whatever that means so I can tell
you what happens before expresso came

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740
you what happens before expresso came
 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.160
you what happens before expresso came
along before expresso came along there

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170
along before expresso came along there
 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.980
along before expresso came along there
is already a way to do all these things

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
is already a way to do all these things
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.710
is already a way to do all these things
and click on buttons and verify but the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
and click on buttons and verify but the
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.399
and click on buttons and verify but the
problem is that the click action that

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
problem is that the click action that
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.260
problem is that the click action that
comes from your test app it's not

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
comes from your test app it's not
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.240
comes from your test app it's not
synchronized with your main app meaning

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
synchronized with your main app meaning
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.440
synchronized with your main app meaning
that your app may or may not be ready so

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
that your app may or may not be ready so
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.789
that your app may or may not be ready so
for us human is instantaneous right now

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
for us human is instantaneous right now
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.169
for us human is instantaneous right now
you open the app and the buttons are

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179
you open the app and the buttons are
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.600
you open the app and the buttons are
there but it actually takes a few

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
there but it actually takes a few
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.190
there but it actually takes a few
hundred milliseconds for the rendering

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
hundred milliseconds for the rendering
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.699
hundred milliseconds for the rendering
to have

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709
to have
 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.949
to have
and your test threat is super fast so

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959
and your test threat is super fast so
 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.030
and your test threat is super fast so
when I was writing tests before I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
when I was writing tests before I
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.229
when I was writing tests before I
expressed though well what happened is

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239
expressed though well what happened is
 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.660
expressed though well what happened is
that I would say go click the button and

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670
that I would say go click the button and
 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.459
that I would say go click the button and
my test code be like that's no button to

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:22.469
my test code be like that's no button to
 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.289
my test code be like that's no button to
click and that's not because there's no

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299
click and that's not because there's no
 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.059
click and that's not because there's no
button it's because I was too fast so

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069
button it's because I was too fast so
 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.709
button it's because I was too fast so
that's what I mean by synchronization is

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719
that's what I mean by synchronization is
 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.959
that's what I mean by synchronization is
that expresso actually have watches it

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969
that expresso actually have watches it
 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.729
that expresso actually have watches it
will watch over the UI thread and make

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739
will watch over the UI thread and make
 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.379
will watch over the UI thread and make
sure that is I know it's not it's done

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389
sure that is I know it's not it's done
 

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.750
sure that is I know it's not it's done
rendering before it goes try to click a

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760
rendering before it goes try to click a
 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.970
rendering before it goes try to click a
button and me also watches the async

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980
button and me also watches the async
 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.520
button and me also watches the async
task thread pool so if you are doing

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
task thread pool so if you are doing
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:41.839
task thread pool so if you are doing
something in the background with async

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849
something in the background with async
 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.129
something in the background with async
tasks and wait for that as well

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:43.139
tasks and wait for that as well
 

00:02:43.139 --> 00:02:45.470
tasks and wait for that as well
so that's what's nice about automatic

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480
so that's what's nice about automatic
 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.770
so that's what's nice about automatic
synchronization another way to put it is

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780
synchronization another way to put it is
 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.000
synchronization another way to put it is
I don't know if you've written test

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010
I don't know if you've written test
 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.220
I don't know if you've written test
before and you have to make it sleep to

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
before and you have to make it sleep to
 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.610
before and you have to make it sleep to
make it past to do the synchronization I

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620
make it past to do the synchronization I
 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.440
make it past to do the synchronization I
mean I make it sound like magic but

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450
mean I make it sound like magic but
 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.520
mean I make it sound like magic but
actually behind the scene that's why

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530
actually behind the scene that's why
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.470
actually behind the scene that's why
Express with us but it sleeps for you

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480
Express with us but it sleeps for you
 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.110
Express with us but it sleeps for you
it's not just blindly sleep for like 500

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
it's not just blindly sleep for like 500
 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.360
it's not just blindly sleep for like 500
milliseconds it's like sleep and wake up

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370
milliseconds it's like sleep and wake up
 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.179
milliseconds it's like sleep and wake up
say hey UI thread are you done

00:03:08.179 --> 00:03:08.189
say hey UI thread are you done
 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:10.069
say hey UI thread are you done
oh yeah nothing ok I'll sleep again so

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079
oh yeah nothing ok I'll sleep again so
 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:10.879
oh yeah nothing ok I'll sleep again so
it makes it a little bit more

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:10.889
it makes it a little bit more
 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.319
it makes it a little bit more
intelligent sleeping so that you don't

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329
intelligent sleeping so that you don't
 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.089
intelligent sleeping so that you don't
have to worry about it so behind the

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099
have to worry about it so behind the
 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.229
have to worry about it so behind the
scene that still some sleep here going

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239
scene that still some sleep here going
 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.729
scene that still some sleep here going
on but at least you are not the one

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
on but at least you are not the one
 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.409
on but at least you are not the one
that's randomly guessing some random

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:18.419
that's randomly guessing some random
 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.530
that's randomly guessing some random
number of milliseconds to sleep so I'm

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540
number of milliseconds to sleep so I'm
 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.300
number of milliseconds to sleep so I'm
gonna go through hello well for those of

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310
gonna go through hello well for those of
 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.210
gonna go through hello well for those of
you have not done this before

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220
you have not done this before
 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.379
you have not done this before
expresso will kind of have a formula

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389
expresso will kind of have a formula
 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.449
expresso will kind of have a formula
that is I think what people call a

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459
that is I think what people call a
 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.670
that is I think what people call a
fluent API so there are three parts to

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680
fluent API so there are three parts to
 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.539
fluent API so there are three parts to
this on view perform and check on view

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549
this on view perform and check on view
 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:38.869
this on view perform and check on view
is the way to find a view on your app so

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879
is the way to find a view on your app so
 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:40.729
is the way to find a view on your app so
for instance while we have this hello

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739
for instance while we have this hello
 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.559
for instance while we have this hello
world app we'll have this button called

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569
world app we'll have this button called
 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.890
world app we'll have this button called
greet to look for this button we can use

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900
greet to look for this button we can use
 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.949
greet to look for this button we can use
the with ID function and we can give it

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959
the with ID function and we can give it
 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.259
the with ID function and we can give it
the ID that says look for the greet

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269
the ID that says look for the greet
 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.330
the ID that says look for the greet
button ok so now at this point we have

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340
button ok so now at this point we have
 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.249
button ok so now at this point we have
located the button now we need to do

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:55.259
located the button now we need to do
 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:58.550
located the button now we need to do
something to it with that if view action

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560
something to it with that if view action
 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.479
something to it with that if view action
we can ask

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489
we can ask
 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.490
we can ask
expresso to then click on this button

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500
expresso to then click on this button
 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.539
expresso to then click on this button
and afterwards we'll verify something in

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549
and afterwards we'll verify something in
 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.069
and afterwards we'll verify something in
our case for some reason you can only

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079
our case for some reason you can only
 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.800
our case for some reason you can only
greet once once you greet the button

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810
greet once once you greet the button
 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.629
greet once once you greet the button
will be disabled so once I click on the

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639
will be disabled so once I click on the
 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.849
will be disabled so once I click on the
grid button I want to check that they

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859
grid button I want to check that they
 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.599
grid button I want to check that they
stays check matches not enabled so in

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609
stays check matches not enabled so in
 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.409
stays check matches not enabled so in
expresso you can also combine different

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419
expresso you can also combine different
 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.490
expresso you can also combine different
reactions and reassertion so in this

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500
reactions and reassertion so in this
 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.260
reactions and reassertion so in this
case there's a built-in function call

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270
case there's a built-in function call
 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.300
case there's a built-in function call
it's an able that I can use to verify

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310
it's an able that I can use to verify
 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.350
it's an able that I can use to verify
that the button is

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360
that the button is
 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.869
that the button is
labeled there's no function cut is not

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879
labeled there's no function cut is not
 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.760
labeled there's no function cut is not
enabled what you do is you negate that

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770
enabled what you do is you negate that
 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.869
enabled what you do is you negate that

of it and then you can also do other

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270
of it and then you can also do other
 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.149
of it and then you can also do other
things that is an instance of so

basically Java level matching rather

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680
basically Java level matching rather

basically Java level matching rather
than enjoy matching so with this you can

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139
than enjoy matching so with this you can
 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:06.230
than enjoy matching so with this you can
actually combine them and it's going to

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240
actually combine them and it's going to
 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.760
actually combine them and it's going to
become much more powerful instead of

example suppose I have an app that uses
 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.339
example suppose I have an app that uses
the toolbar I mean you have an app that

00:06:16.339 --> 00:06:16.349
the toolbar I mean you have an app that
 

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:19.100
the toolbar I mean you have an app that
uses the poodle toolbar right did you

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110
uses the poodle toolbar right did you
 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.029
uses the poodle toolbar right did you
supply the layout to the toolbar

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:22.039
supply the layout to the toolbar
 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:24.980

with ID to find the toolbar to verify
 

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.499
with ID to find the toolbar to verify
what the title is so what are we going

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509
what the title is so what are we going
 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:32.689
what the title is so what are we going
to do if we want to verify that I set

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699
to do if we want to verify that I set
 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:35.629
to do if we want to verify that I set
the title properly well we're going to

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:35.639
the title properly well we're going to
 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:37.879
the title properly well we're going to
bust our hierarchy viewer how many of

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:37.889
bust our hierarchy viewer how many of
 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:41.030
bust our hierarchy viewer how many of
you have used hierarchy viewer great

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040
you have used hierarchy viewer great
 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.460
you have used hierarchy viewer great
what this is is you can take a look at

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:43.470
what this is is you can take a look at
 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:45.800
what this is is you can take a look at
not just the part of the UI that you've

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810
not just the part of the UI that you've
 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:46.970
not just the part of the UI that you've
set so by summer when you run an

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:46.980
set so by summer when you run an
 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.100
set so by summer when you run an
activity you do set content view and

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110
activity you do set content view and
 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.530
activity you do set content view and
then your given layout and that's the

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540
then your given layout and that's the
 

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:53.540
then your given layout and that's the
puppet you define it actually showed the

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550
puppet you define it actually showed the
 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.880
puppet you define it actually showed the
whole UI that's being rendered so you

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890
whole UI that's being rendered so you
 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:57.740
whole UI that's being rendered so you
can see things that can't be on your

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750
can see things that can't be on your
 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.890
can see things that can't be on your
control in our case we can see that

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900
control in our case we can see that
 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:03.530
control in our case we can see that
there is this textview which has my

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540
there is this textview which has my
 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:05.270
there is this textview which has my
awesome title in it and that's the view

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280
awesome title in it and that's the view
 

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.220
awesome title in it and that's the view
that we want to verify but the problem

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:07.230
that we want to verify but the problem
 

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.250
that we want to verify but the problem
is doesn't have an ID so how we can

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260
is doesn't have an ID so how we can
 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.680
is doesn't have an ID so how we can
don't look for it well fortunately we

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690
don't look for it well fortunately we
 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.770
don't look for it well fortunately we
can see that this is a child of a class

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:15.780
can see that this is a child of a class
 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:19.280
can see that this is a child of a class
that is of the type tool bar so we can

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290
that is of the type tool bar so we can
 

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.390
that is of the type tool bar so we can
combine matches to pinpoint this view

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400
combine matches to pinpoint this view
 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.530
combine matches to pinpoint this view
let's see how we're going to do this

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:24.540
let's see how we're going to do this
 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.300
let's see how we're going to do this
well first of all I have a helper

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.310
well first of all I have a helper
 

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.510
well first of all I have a helper
function that help me find the toolbar

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520
function that help me find the toolbar
 

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.360
function that help me find the toolbar
title and the reason why I have this

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:32.370
title and the reason why I have this
 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:34.880
title and the reason why I have this
helper function does match toolbar title

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:34.890
helper function does match toolbar title
 

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.040
helper function does match toolbar title
is because that way I can reuse it right

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050
is because that way I can reuse it right
 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:39.130
is because that way I can reuse it right
if I have multiple tests that I want to

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:39.140
if I have multiple tests that I want to
 

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.600
if I have multiple tests that I want to
find the toolbar title match it I just

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:41.610
find the toolbar title match it I just
 

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.940
find the toolbar title match it I just
need to write at once

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:42.950
need to write at once
 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:46.280
need to write at once
so here is kind of the magic where all

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.290
so here is kind of the magic where all
 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:48.890
so here is kind of the magic where all
of that's the hamcrest matcher and then

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900
of that's the hamcrest matcher and then
 

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.330
of that's the hamcrest matcher and then
I will look for something that is

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:50.340
I will look for something that is
 

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.160
I will look for something that is
assignable from textview meaning I'm

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:52.170
assignable from textview meaning I'm
 

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.650
assignable from textview meaning I'm
looking for a class that is a textview

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.660
looking for a class that is a textview
 

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.870
looking for a class that is a textview
or a child of textview like maybe it's a

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:56.880
or a child of textview like maybe it's a
 

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:58.160
or a child of textview like maybe it's a
button but in our case it's a textview

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:58.170
button but in our case it's a textview
 

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:02.510
button but in our case it's a textview
and then oh so we have you have to

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520
and then oh so we have you have to
 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.340
and then oh so we have you have to
satisfy two conditions the first

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:04.350
satisfy two conditions the first
 

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.350
satisfy two conditions the first
condition is the view itself is a

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360
condition is the view itself is a
 

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.720
condition is the view itself is a
textview the second condition is that

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:08.730
textview the second condition is that
 

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:12.320
textview the second condition is that
that view also has the parent that is of

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:12.330
that view also has the parent that is of
 

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.660
that view also has the parent that is of
type to be' so we are trying to

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:14.670
type to be' so we are trying to
 

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.290
type to be' so we are trying to
translate what we see in hard to viewer

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:17.300
translate what we see in hard to viewer
 

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.420
translate what we see in hard to viewer
into the matches so with all that we

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:20.430
into the matches so with all that we
 

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.610
into the matches so with all that we
will find that particular text view and

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:22.620
will find that particular text view and
 

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.880
will find that particular text view and
then we can go ahead and do the match

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:24.890
then we can go ahead and do the match
 

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.680
then we can go ahead and do the match
with text so that we can verify that the

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:27.690
with text so that we can verify that the
 

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.210
with text so that we can verify that the
toolbar is displaying what we expect you

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:29.220
toolbar is displaying what we expect you
 

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.100
toolbar is displaying what we expect you
to display so far so good

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.110
to display so far so good
 

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.750
to display so far so good
okay good exercise this much of your

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760
okay good exercise this much of your
 

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.219
okay good exercise this much of your
body

00:08:37.219 --> 00:08:37.229
body
 

00:08:37.229 --> 00:08:40.260
body
but even though there's a lot of matches

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:40.270
but even though there's a lot of matches
 

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.909
but even though there's a lot of matches
and can combine them there are times

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919
and can combine them there are times
 

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.550
and can combine them there are times
that we want to write a custom matcher

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:43.560
that we want to write a custom matcher
 

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.930
that we want to write a custom matcher
in fact we're going to change this code

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:45.940
in fact we're going to change this code
 

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.480
in fact we're going to change this code
to use a custom matcher and it's not

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:48.490
to use a custom matcher and it's not
 

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.730
to use a custom matcher and it's not
just for demoing purposes the reason why

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:50.740
just for demoing purposes the reason why
 

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.680
just for demoing purposes the reason why
I want to change it is because when you

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:52.690
I want to change it is because when you
 

00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:54.000
I want to change it is because when you
are doing that trick that I showed you

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.010
are doing that trick that I showed you
 

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.190
are doing that trick that I showed you
that you use the hierarchy viewer to

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.200
that you use the hierarchy viewer to
 

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.370
that you use the hierarchy viewer to
look deep into a view it may change

00:08:59.370 --> 00:08:59.380
look deep into a view it may change
 

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.530
look deep into a view it may change
right this is not your code this is

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:01.540
right this is not your code this is
 

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.630
right this is not your code this is
probably the support library if you're

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.640
probably the support library if you're
 

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.690
probably the support library if you're
using app compat right today the toolbar

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:06.700
using app compat right today the toolbar
 

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.080
using app compat right today the toolbar
display it by having one single layer so

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.090
display it by having one single layer so
 

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.570
display it by having one single layer so
you can use with parent to to pinpoint

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:12.580
you can use with parent to to pinpoint
 

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.910
you can use with parent to to pinpoint
your view tomorrow things may change you

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920
your view tomorrow things may change you
 

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.500
your view tomorrow things may change you
may get nested inside a linear layout

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:16.510
may get nested inside a linear layout
 

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.870
may get nested inside a linear layout
because what did not explain to you why

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880
because what did not explain to you why
 

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.180
because what did not explain to you why
I just want to do it right so to protect

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.190
I just want to do it right so to protect
 

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:23.280
I just want to do it right so to protect
yourself from those changes it's much

00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:23.290
yourself from those changes it's much
 

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:25.770
yourself from those changes it's much
better to use and published API right

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:25.780
better to use and published API right
 

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.690
better to use and published API right
because when you are sneaking into that

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:27.700
because when you are sneaking into that
 

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.760
because when you are sneaking into that
view hierarchy that's not a part of the

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:29.770
view hierarchy that's not a part of the
 

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.470
view hierarchy that's not a part of the
public API and they are allowed to

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480
public API and they are allowed to
 

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.350
public API and they are allowed to
change it whereas for example here we

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.360
change it whereas for example here we
 

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.730
change it whereas for example here we
are actually going to use the toolbar

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:35.740
are actually going to use the toolbar
 

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.980
are actually going to use the toolbar
get title function that is a part of

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:37.990
get title function that is a part of
 

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:40.950
get title function that is a part of
public API of the tuba object so instead

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:40.960
public API of the tuba object so instead
 

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.260
public API of the tuba object so instead
of using all those match parents and all

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:43.270
of using all those match parents and all
 

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.300
of using all those match parents and all
of and whatnot what we're going to do is

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:45.310
of and whatnot what we're going to do is
 

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.570
of and whatnot what we're going to do is
this play is very similar on well this

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:48.580
this play is very similar on well this
 

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.210
this play is very similar on well this
is actually just a function with you

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.220
is actually just a function with you
 

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.920
is actually just a function with you
toolbar title but what we have is that I

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:52.930
toolbar title but what we have is that I
 

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.350
toolbar title but what we have is that I
have written a custom thing called

00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360
have written a custom thing called
 

00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:00.150
have written a custom thing called
with toolbar title now this is the dance

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160
with toolbar title now this is the dance
 

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.920
with toolbar title now this is the dance
code coming can everybody see it

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:01.930
code coming can everybody see it
 

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:05.520
code coming can everybody see it
okay that's good so what we have here is

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:05.530
okay that's good so what we have here is
 

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.890
okay that's good so what we have here is
something called bounded matcher this is

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:07.900
something called bounded matcher this is
 

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.250
something called bounded matcher this is
again I think is actually hamcrest what

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:11.260
again I think is actually hamcrest what
 

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.800
again I think is actually hamcrest what
happened here is that I'm saying that I

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:13.810
happened here is that I'm saying that I
 

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.660
happened here is that I'm saying that I
want a view matcher

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:15.670
want a view matcher
 

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:18.720
want a view matcher
that is specific to a toolbar which is

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:18.730
that is specific to a toolbar which is
 

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.190
that is specific to a toolbar which is
why there's a generic that I passed in

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200
why there's a generic that I passed in
 

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.740
why there's a generic that I passed in
the Tupac class and when I want to see

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:25.750
the Tupac class and when I want to see
 

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.040
the Tupac class and when I want to see
whether this matches safely I will go

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.050
whether this matches safely I will go
 

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.230
whether this matches safely I will go
ahead and call the toolbar which is

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:31.240
ahead and call the toolbar which is
 

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.240
ahead and call the toolbar which is
passed in to me in this function because

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:33.250
passed in to me in this function because
 

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:35.130
passed in to me in this function because
of this generic and I'll call the

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:35.140
of this generic and I'll call the
 

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.040
of this generic and I'll call the
function get title and then I will match

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.050
function get title and then I will match
 

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.050
function get title and then I will match
it with the test measure so test measure

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:40.060
it with the test measure so test measure
 

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.350
it with the test measure so test measure
if you can see here is of mature class

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360
if you can see here is of mature class
 

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.570
if you can see here is of mature class
so the the previous line the if

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:48.580
so the the previous line the if
 

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.949
so the the previous line the if
that's the problem confusing if that's

00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959
that's the problem confusing if that's
 

00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:54.329
that's the problem confusing if that's
the matcher

00:10:54.329 --> 00:10:54.339
the matcher
 

00:10:54.339 --> 00:10:55.980
the matcher
so we're passing out a semester and the

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:55.990
so we're passing out a semester and the
 

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:57.540
so we're passing out a semester and the
reason why I did it this way it's

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:57.550
reason why I did it this way it's
 

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.160
reason why I did it this way it's
because you can also pass in a different

00:10:59.160 --> 00:10:59.170
because you can also pass in a different
 

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.720
because you can also pass in a different
mattress so you can also do something

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:00.730
mattress so you can also do something
 

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.079
mattress so you can also do something
like starts with and with contain so

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:04.089
like starts with and with contain so
 

00:11:04.089 --> 00:11:05.400
like starts with and with contain so
it's much more powerful than if you're

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:05.410
it's much more powerful than if you're
 

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:08.160
it's much more powerful than if you're
just passing a string so those are all

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:08.170
just passing a string so those are all
 

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:10.319
just passing a string so those are all
again hem crass bachelor you don't even

00:11:10.319 --> 00:11:10.329
again hem crass bachelor you don't even
 

00:11:10.329 --> 00:11:11.850
again hem crass bachelor you don't even
do right the function starts with you

00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:11.860
do right the function starts with you
 

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:15.360
do right the function starts with you
can just pass it in so with this since I

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:15.370
can just pass it in so with this since I
 

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:17.759
can just pass it in so with this since I
just swap it in to my helper function

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:17.769
just swap it in to my helper function
 

00:11:17.769 --> 00:11:20.220
just swap it in to my helper function
then I'm done right although all the

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:20.230
then I'm done right although all the
 

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.560
then I'm done right although all the
code I'm trying to verify the toolbar

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:22.570
code I'm trying to verify the toolbar
 

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.310
code I'm trying to verify the toolbar
title will now use the get title

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320
title will now use the get title
 

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.500
title will now use the get title
function so this is how you write a

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:28.510
function so this is how you write a
 

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.290
function so this is how you write a
custom matcher what well is in this

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:31.300
custom matcher what well is in this
 

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.759
custom matcher what well is in this
particular case because what I want to

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:32.769
particular case because what I want to
 

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:34.410
particular case because what I want to
do is I want to verify the to power

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:34.420
do is I want to verify the to power
 

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.509
do is I want to verify the to power
objects so by giving it as a generic I

00:11:36.509 --> 00:11:36.519
objects so by giving it as a generic I
 

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:38.670
objects so by giving it as a generic I
can have access to the functions so I

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:38.680
can have access to the functions so I
 

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:42.750
can have access to the functions so I
can verify so I've also written matches

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760
can verify so I've also written matches
 

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.019
can verify so I've also written matches
for example that I can verify the text

00:11:46.019 --> 00:11:46.029
for example that I can verify the text
 

00:11:46.029 --> 00:11:48.329
for example that I can verify the text
color of a text field so for example

00:11:48.329 --> 00:11:48.339
color of a text field so for example
 

00:11:48.339 --> 00:11:50.009
color of a text field so for example
expresso you can do the with text to

00:11:50.009 --> 00:11:50.019
expresso you can do the with text to
 

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:52.290
expresso you can do the with text to
find out what is printed out but I want

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:52.300
find out what is printed out but I want
 

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.240
find out what is printed out but I want
to know what color is textview provides

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:54.250
to know what color is textview provides
 

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.579
to know what color is textview provides
that you can use that you can ask you to

00:11:56.579 --> 00:11:56.589
that you can use that you can ask you to
 

00:11:56.589 --> 00:11:58.260
that you can use that you can ask you to
get you the current color right so can

00:11:58.260 --> 00:11:58.270
get you the current color right so can
 

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.150
get you the current color right so can
unwrap it inside a bounded matcher and

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160
unwrap it inside a bounded matcher and
 

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160
unwrap it inside a bounded matcher and
then in the match safely function called

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.170
then in the match safely function called
 

00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:08.819
then in the match safely function called
the get current color function yes I

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:08.829
the get current color function yes I
 

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:11.850
the get current color function yes I
already covered that again there's a

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:11.860
already covered that again there's a
 

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.440
already covered that again there's a
full example that's even the blog post

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:13.450

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240
if you want to read again what is
 

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.880
if you want to read again what is
actually what I just said but if you

that now something more interesting on

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:24.040
that now something more interesting on
 

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:27.150
that now something more interesting on
data has anyone used this matter what

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160
data has anyone used this matter what
 

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.820
data has anyone used this matter what
does this do

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:31.830
 

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:35.010
you are half right it checks the list

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:35.020
you are half right it checks the list
 

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.400
you are half right it checks the list
view but not recyclable so we'll get to

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:38.410
view but not recyclable so we'll get to
 

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:38.700
view but not recyclable so we'll get to
that

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:38.710
that
 

00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:40.620
that
so yes the on data allows you to check

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:40.630
so yes the on data allows you to check
 

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.840
so yes the on data allows you to check
on the list view so for those of you

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:42.850
on the list view so for those of you
 

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.160
on the list view so for those of you
have not written it before you may be

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:44.170
have not written it before you may be
 

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:45.540
have not written it before you may be
wondering why do you need a different

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:45.550
wondering why do you need a different
 

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.510
wondering why do you need a different
thing so the problem with what the

00:12:48.510 --> 00:12:48.520
thing so the problem with what the
 

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.790
thing so the problem with what the
problem is the way listener is done is

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800
problem is the way listener is done is
 

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.760
problem is the way listener is done is
that the views comes in and out as you

00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:53.770
that the views comes in and out as you
 

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:56.730
that the views comes in and out as you
scroll because it's using the same view

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:56.740
scroll because it's using the same view
 

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.580
scroll because it's using the same view
but just swapping into new data to the

00:12:59.580 --> 00:12:59.590
but just swapping into new data to the
 

00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:01.170
but just swapping into new data to the
supply so you cannot just say oh I'm

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:01.180
supply so you cannot just say oh I'm
 

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.730
supply so you cannot just say oh I'm
going to look for the view with ID list

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:02.740
going to look for the view with ID list
 

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:05.010
going to look for the view with ID list
item that doesn't not go into work so

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:05.020
item that doesn't not go into work so
 

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:09.360
item that doesn't not go into work so
the formula for using on data is similar

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:09.370
the formula for using on data is similar
 

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:10.860
the formula for using on data is similar
to the on view if you compare it

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:10.870
to the on view if you compare it
 

00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:14.190
to the on view if you compare it
side-by-side except you have some extra

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:14.200
side-by-side except you have some extra
 

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.260
side-by-side except you have some extra
things like COD data option we kind of

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:16.270
things like COD data option we kind of
 

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.240
things like COD data option we kind of
get through an example and it's much

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:18.250
get through an example and it's much
 

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:20.550
get through an example and it's much
easier to understand so one big thing is

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560
easier to understand so one big thing is
 

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.110
easier to understand so one big thing is
instead of a view matcher you have an

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120
instead of a view matcher you have an
 

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.870
instead of a view matcher you have an
object matcher so the way on data work

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880
object matcher so the way on data work
 

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.720
object matcher so the way on data work
is that it will instead of look for a

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:27.730
is that it will instead of look for a
 

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:30.060
is that it will instead of look for a
view it will look into the data

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:30.070
view it will look into the data
 

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.740
view it will look into the data
essentially your array for example if

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:31.750
essentially your array for example if
 

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:33.600
essentially your array for example if
you're displaying an array of strings

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:33.610
you're displaying an array of strings
 

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.790
you're displaying an array of strings
you'll look for strings rather than

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800
you'll look for strings rather than
 

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.090
you'll look for strings rather than
views like tech news and the data

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:39.100
views like tech news and the data
 

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.970
views like tech news and the data
options hope you can see it is things

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:41.980
options hope you can see it is things
 

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:44.070
options hope you can see it is things
like in adaptive view so for example

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:44.080
like in adaptive view so for example
 

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.080
like in adaptive view so for example
even if you're just if you just define a

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.090
even if you're just if you just define a
 

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:47.760
even if you're just if you just define a
look for the data but you have multiple

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:47.770
look for the data but you have multiple
 

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.350
look for the data but you have multiple
adapt of your multiple list views in

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360
adapt of your multiple list views in
 

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.320
adapt of your multiple list views in
your app then it doesn't know which one

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:52.330
your app then it doesn't know which one
 

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.730
your app then it doesn't know which one
you're trying to match so you can give

00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:53.740
you're trying to match so you can give
 

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.130
you're trying to match so you can give
it a matcher so this time you can do for

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:56.140
it a matcher so this time you can do for
 

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.900
it a matcher so this time you can do for
example in a depth of the view with ID

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:57.910
example in a depth of the view with ID
 

00:13:57.910 --> 00:14:01.860
example in a depth of the view with ID
list in outer ID list and you can also

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:01.870
list in outer ID list and you can also
 

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.290
list in outer ID list and you can also
do things like on child view so maybe

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:04.300
do things like on child view so maybe
 

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.710
do things like on child view so maybe
you pinpoint that particular list item

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720
you pinpoint that particular list item
 

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.100
you pinpoint that particular list item
but then it has two text views and an

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:11.110
but then it has two text views and an
 

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.710
but then it has two text views and an
image view inside so you can use on

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720
image view inside so you can use on
 

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.950
image view inside so you can use on
child view with ID or the ID the image

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:16.960
child view with ID or the ID the image
 

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.870
child view with ID or the ID the image
or something like that to do further

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880
or something like that to do further
 

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.260
or something like that to do further
matching here's an example I have a

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:22.270
matching here's an example I have a
 

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.320
matching here's an example I have a
pretty benign looking ListView and what

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:25.330
pretty benign looking ListView and what
 

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.480
pretty benign looking ListView and what
I'm gonna do is that I'm going to look

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:27.490
I'm gonna do is that I'm going to look
 

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:32.220
I'm gonna do is that I'm going to look
for item 27 and verify that is age 27 so

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:32.230
for item 27 and verify that is age 27 so
 

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:33.900
for item 27 and verify that is age 27 so
why not the bad that's a problem right I

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:33.910
why not the bad that's a problem right I
 

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:38.310
why not the bad that's a problem right I
can't see item 27 but the beauty of on

data is that it will scroll for you yet
another reason why you want to use on

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:42.910
another reason why you want to use on

just a very quick kind of like how the

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:47.300
just a very quick kind of like how the
 

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.370
just a very quick kind of like how the
app is set up I have a array that is the

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:51.380
app is set up I have a array that is the
 

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:55.750
app is set up I have a array that is the
data that is a type item side I made 30

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760
data that is a type item side I made 30
 

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.850
data that is a type item side I made 30
of them and iteration filled it in and I

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:57.860
of them and iteration filled it in and I
 

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.970
of them and iteration filled it in and I
used to initialize my list adapter and

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:00.980
used to initialize my list adapter and
 

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.000
used to initialize my list adapter and
the item is pretty simple it has an

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:04.010
the item is pretty simple it has an
 

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:05.920
the item is pretty simple it has an
integer and then when it needs to be

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:05.930
integer and then when it needs to be
 

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.420
integer and then when it needs to be
display it displayed the value of the

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:07.430
display it displayed the value of the
 

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:12.880
display it displayed the value of the
integer so now when I guess more

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:12.890
integer so now when I guess more
 

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.260
integer so now when I guess more
complicated than I initially said

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:14.270
complicated than I initially said
 

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.090
complicated than I initially said
there's also an onclicklistener so when

00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:16.100
there's also an onclicklistener so when
 

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:18.040
there's also an onclicklistener so when
I click on an item it's going to display

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:18.050
I click on an item it's going to display
 

00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:21.700
I click on an item it's going to display
in the footer just because writing a

in the footer just because writing a
 

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:24.790
in the footer just because writing a
demo app so now we go back to the test

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800
demo app so now we go back to the test
 

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.730
demo app so now we go back to the test
and say let's run a test to verify that

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:27.740
and say let's run a test to verify that
 

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.700
and say let's run a test to verify that
before I click on any list item the

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:30.710
before I click on any list item the
 

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.100
before I click on any list item the
footer is not displayed I click on one

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:33.110
footer is not displayed I click on one
 

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.320
footer is not displayed I click on one
of them and then it will display with a

00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:35.330
of them and then it will display with a
 

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.690
of them and then it will display with a
matching number so this English and

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:37.700
matching number so this English and
 

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.340
matching number so this English and
translate it into expresso I said before

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:42.350
translate it into expresso I said before
 

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.050
translate it into expresso I said before
I click anything so in the beginning of

then we'll move on click on it once we
 

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.199
then we'll move on click on it once we
are there we repeat what we did earlier

make sure that it has the proper tax and
it is displayed so so far everything

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:23.510
it is displayed so so far everything
 

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.690
it is displayed so so far everything
looks pretty good just one tiny thing

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:25.700
looks pretty good just one tiny thing

with value is not an expresso function

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:28.630
with value is not an expresso function
 

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.550
with value is not an expresso function
you have to write it

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560
you have to write it
 

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:33.280
you have to write it

again this time when still founding it

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.170
again this time when still founding it
 

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:40.380
again this time when still founding it
to a toolbar we're binding it to a item

00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:40.390
to a toolbar we're binding it to a item
 

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.740
to a toolbar we're binding it to a item
so I pass it in at value of 27 that I'm

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:44.750
so I pass it in at value of 27 that I'm
 

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.990
so I pass it in at value of 27 that I'm
looking for and then in mesh safely I'm

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000
looking for and then in mesh safely I'm
 

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.520
looking for and then in mesh safely I'm
going to see that it matches to the item

00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:51.530
going to see that it matches to the item
 

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:52.990
going to see that it matches to the item
so that's what Express will go through

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:53.000
so that's what Express will go through
 

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.730
so that's what Express will go through
it looks for an item as a a are you 27

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.740
it looks for an item as a a are you 27
 

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.500
it looks for an item as a a are you 27
27 and if it's not it just keeps growing

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:57.510
27 and if it's not it just keeps growing
 

00:16:57.510 --> 00:17:01.600
27 and if it's not it just keeps growing
and keep looking good all right

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:01.610
and keep looking good all right
 

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:05.660
and keep looking good all right
recyclerview so yeah i've a gentleman

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:05.670
recyclerview so yeah i've a gentleman
 

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:07.970
recyclerview so yeah i've a gentleman
here already mentioned it so this

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980
here already mentioned it so this
 

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.740
here already mentioned it so this
recycling will look pretty much the same

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:09.750
recycling will look pretty much the same
 

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:14.090
recycling will look pretty much the same
as our ListView however you cannot use

00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:14.100
as our ListView however you cannot use
 

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:18.790
as our ListView however you cannot use
on data with it does anybody know why

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:18.800
on data with it does anybody know why
 

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.610
on data with it does anybody know why
good I'm gonna teach you something the

00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620
good I'm gonna teach you something the
 

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:25.160
good I'm gonna teach you something the
reason why you cannot do it is that

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:25.170
reason why you cannot do it is that
 

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.490
reason why you cannot do it is that
recyclerview actually a viewgroup not an

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500
recyclerview actually a viewgroup not an
 

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.190
recyclerview actually a viewgroup not an
adapter view and even though it looks

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200
adapter view and even though it looks
 

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.380
adapter view and even though it looks
surprisingly similar under the hood they

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:33.390
surprisingly similar under the hood they
 

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.780
surprisingly similar under the hood they
are actually very very different so when

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:35.790
are actually very very different so when
 

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.460
are actually very very different so when
you're working with recycle view you're

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:37.470
you're working with recycle view you're
 

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.430
you're working with recycle view you're
actually going to go back to use on view

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440
actually going to go back to use on view
 

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.840
actually going to go back to use on view
ends up on data so let's go through an

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:44.850
ends up on data so let's go through an
 

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.720
ends up on data so let's go through an
example here is the same test car

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:47.730
example here is the same test car
 

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.790
example here is the same test car
functionally Ram we've verified that the

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:49.800
functionally Ram we've verified that the
 

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.590
functionally Ram we've verified that the
food is not displayed and then we are

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600
food is not displayed and then we are
 

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.210
food is not displayed and then we are
going to click on the item and then

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:53.220
going to click on the item and then
 

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:55.310
going to click on the item and then
verify that it's display however the

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320
verify that it's display however the
 

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:56.090
verify that it's display however the
meat of it

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.100
meat of it
 

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.430
meat of it
it's completely different we start with

00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440
it's completely different we start with
 

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:01.880
it's completely different we start with
on view with ID recycle of you to

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:01.890
on view with ID recycle of you to
 

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.800
on view with ID recycle of you to
actually find the parent and then we go

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:03.810
actually find the parent and then we go
 

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.210
actually find the parent and then we go
ahead and perform this really really

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:05.220
ahead and perform this really really
 

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.180
ahead and perform this really really
long function which is available to your

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:08.190
long function which is available to your
 

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.230
long function which is available to your
expresso

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240
expresso
 

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.780
expresso
so in in the recycler view actions you

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:11.790
so in in the recycler view actions you
 

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.240
so in in the recycler view actions you
can use these to pinpoint items so in

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:14.250
can use these to pinpoint items so in
 

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.850
can use these to pinpoint items so in
our case we are calling the one at

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860
our case we are calling the one at
 

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:20.510
our case we are calling the one at
position so we say at position 27 click

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:20.520
position so we say at position 27 click
 

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.130
position so we say at position 27 click
on it so that's already different

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140
on it so that's already different
 

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:23.150
on it so that's already different
records before we actually looking

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:23.160
records before we actually looking
 

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.060
records before we actually looking
inside and looking at the item I'm there

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:26.070
inside and looking at the item I'm there
 

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:29.000
inside and looking at the item I'm there
other things that you can use so instead

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:29.010
other things that you can use so instead
 

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:33.920
other things that you can use so instead
of using the position one no ok I'm

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:33.930
of using the position one no ok I'm
 

00:18:33.930 --> 00:18:34.580
of using the position one no ok I'm
going to slide ahead

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:34.590
going to slide ahead
 

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.800
going to slide ahead
so anyway this is the this is the

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:36.810
so anyway this is the this is the
 

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:40.070
so anyway this is the this is the
equivalent of the other of the on data

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080
equivalent of the other of the on data
 

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.570
equivalent of the other of the on data
case when you use it in the ListView

case when you use it in the ListView
ah here I hope it's not too long so

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:45.030
ah here I hope it's not too long so
 

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.030
ah here I hope it's not too long so
besides using this function there are

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:47.040
besides using this function there are
 

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:50.240
besides using this function there are
other matches that are the view actions

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:50.250
other matches that are the view actions
 

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.550
other matches that are the view actions
that's provided for you in the

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:52.560
that's provided for you in the
 

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.560
that's provided for you in the
recyclerview actions so instead of

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:54.570
recyclerview actions so instead of
 

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.690
recyclerview actions so instead of
matching the position you can also match

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:56.700
matching the position you can also match
 

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:03.380
matching the position you can also match
it in the holder position or in the and

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:03.390
it in the holder position or in the and
 

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.840
it in the holder position or in the and
the item itself with a mattre so this

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:05.850
the item itself with a mattre so this
 

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:07.960
the item itself with a mattre so this
this get a little bit confusing because

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:07.970
this get a little bit confusing because
 

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.690
this get a little bit confusing because
here we're looking

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:09.700
here we're looking
 

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:11.009
here we're looking
the position but here what we're doing

00:19:11.009 --> 00:19:11.019
the position but here what we're doing
 

00:19:11.019 --> 00:19:13.169
the position but here what we're doing
is it's still going through other views

00:19:13.169 --> 00:19:13.179
is it's still going through other views
 

00:19:13.179 --> 00:19:15.960
is it's still going through other views
and then trying to mesh the view so

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:15.970
and then trying to mesh the view so
 

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.090
and then trying to mesh the view so
you'll probably want to cap go through

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:18.100
you'll probably want to cap go through
 

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:20.210
you'll probably want to cap go through
the recyclerview

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:20.220
the recyclerview
 

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:22.759
the recyclerview
documentation and just see what it does

00:19:22.759 --> 00:19:22.769
documentation and just see what it does
 

00:19:22.769 --> 00:19:26.190
documentation and just see what it does
again examples I love putting on

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:26.200
again examples I love putting on
 

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.139
again examples I love putting on
examples because I want you to go home

00:19:28.139 --> 00:19:28.149
examples because I want you to go home
 

00:19:28.149 --> 00:19:29.610
examples because I want you to go home
and actually download this and muck with

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:29.620
and actually download this and muck with
 

00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.470
and actually download this and muck with
it and change it a little bit I try a

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:31.480
it and change it a little bit I try a
 

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.879
it and change it a little bit I try a
different view action and see what

00:19:32.879 --> 00:19:32.889
different view action and see what
 

00:19:32.889 --> 00:19:36.870
different view action and see what
happens so this is available idling

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880
happens so this is available idling
 

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.029
happens so this is available idling

before three hands okay so this we are

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:43.750
before three hands okay so this we are
 

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.000
before three hands okay so this we are
really getting the point where I'm

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:45.010
really getting the point where I'm
 

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:46.769
really getting the point where I'm
showing you something new that's cool

00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:46.779
showing you something new that's cool
 

00:19:46.779 --> 00:19:48.779
showing you something new that's cool
I'm so I didn't resource if you remember

00:19:48.779 --> 00:19:48.789
I'm so I didn't resource if you remember
 

00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:50.940
I'm so I didn't resource if you remember
very very early in the talk when I was

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:50.950
very very early in the talk when I was
 

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.519
very very early in the talk when I was
telling you that expresso knows to wait

00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:53.529
telling you that expresso knows to wait
 

00:19:53.529 --> 00:19:57.000
telling you that expresso knows to wait
for the UI thread to be idle before it

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.010
for the UI thread to be idle before it
 

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:58.980
for the UI thread to be idle before it
goes and click buttons but the other

00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:58.990
goes and click buttons but the other
 

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.330
goes and click buttons but the other
thing that's happening in their app that

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:00.340
thing that's happening in their app that
 

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.789
thing that's happening in their app that
you may want it to wait as well how do

00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799
you may want it to wait as well how do
 

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:05.310
you may want it to wait as well how do
you tell expresso right the resource is

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320
you tell expresso right the resource is
 

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.570
you tell expresso right the resource is
the interface that you need to implement

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:06.580
the interface that you need to implement
 

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:08.549
the interface that you need to implement
and for some reason is really confusing

00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559
and for some reason is really confusing
 

00:20:08.559 --> 00:20:11.700
and for some reason is really confusing
to people so I have done multiple blog

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:11.710
to people so I have done multiple blog
 

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.769
to people so I have done multiple blog
post on it so we're gonna go through one

00:20:13.769 --> 00:20:13.779
post on it so we're gonna go through one
 

00:20:13.779 --> 00:20:16.200
post on it so we're gonna go through one
example in this particular case again

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:16.210
example in this particular case again
 

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.299
example in this particular case again
that's what I said expresso has a notion

00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:18.309
that's what I said expresso has a notion
 

00:20:18.309 --> 00:20:20.190
that's what I said expresso has a notion
of idling and these two things are the

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200
of idling and these two things are the
 

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.789
of idling and these two things are the
things that express was watching for we

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:23.799
things that express was watching for we
 

00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:25.980
things that express was watching for we
are going to go for an example where say

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:25.990
are going to go for an example where say
 

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.169
are going to go for an example where say
you have an intense surface and you want

00:20:28.169 --> 00:20:28.179
you have an intense surface and you want
 

00:20:28.179 --> 00:20:30.620
you have an intense surface and you want
to express her to wait until it's done

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:30.630
to express her to wait until it's done
 

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:35.519
to express her to wait until it's done
so what happens is this in your app you

00:20:35.519 --> 00:20:35.529
so what happens is this in your app you
 

00:20:35.529 --> 00:20:37.620
so what happens is this in your app you
have a button that stays do something

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:37.630
have a button that stays do something
 

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:39.990
have a button that stays do something
and instead of doing it in the activity

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000
and instead of doing it in the activity
 

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.190
and instead of doing it in the activity
because it's long-running

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200
because it's long-running
 

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.340
because it's long-running
it goes off to after in terms of us do

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:44.350
it goes off to after in terms of us do
 

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.049
it goes off to after in terms of us do
it and then in turn service and back and

00:20:46.049 --> 00:20:46.059
it and then in turn service and back and
 

00:20:46.059 --> 00:20:49.289
it and then in turn service and back and
say yeah I'm done and can update the the

00:20:49.289 --> 00:20:49.299
say yeah I'm done and can update the the
 

00:20:49.299 --> 00:20:51.509
say yeah I'm done and can update the the
you I don't setup and this is the code

00:20:51.509 --> 00:20:51.519
you I don't setup and this is the code
 

00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:54.570
you I don't setup and this is the code
for the actual idling resource so it's

00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:54.580
for the actual idling resource so it's
 

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:55.740
for the actual idling resource so it's
an interface and there are three

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:55.750
an interface and there are three
 

00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:58.019
an interface and there are three
functions that you need to override the

00:20:58.019 --> 00:20:58.029
functions that you need to override the
 

00:20:58.029 --> 00:20:59.909
functions that you need to override the
first two are kind of boilerplate it

00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919
first two are kind of boilerplate it
 

00:20:59.919 --> 00:21:01.889
first two are kind of boilerplate it
needs to get a name because when you're

00:21:01.889 --> 00:21:01.899
needs to get a name because when you're
 

00:21:01.899 --> 00:21:03.810
needs to get a name because when you're
registering your resource it need a key

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:03.820
registering your resource it need a key
 

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.909
registering your resource it need a key
basically so that it can keep track of

00:21:05.909 --> 00:21:05.919
basically so that it can keep track of
 

00:21:05.919 --> 00:21:08.759
basically so that it can keep track of
them so usually I just give it the class

00:21:08.759 --> 00:21:08.769
them so usually I just give it the class
 

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:12.810
them so usually I just give it the class
name and then there's this callback you

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:12.820
name and then there's this callback you
 

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.279
name and then there's this callback you
are just stashing away the callback that

00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:14.289
are just stashing away the callback that
 

00:21:14.289 --> 00:21:15.779
are just stashing away the callback that
at some point expresso will give you a

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:15.789
at some point expresso will give you a
 

00:21:15.789 --> 00:21:17.399
at some point expresso will give you a
call back so that you can use in this

00:21:17.399 --> 00:21:17.409
call back so that you can use in this
 

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:19.950
call back so that you can use in this
function so is I don't know now it's the

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:19.960
function so is I don't know now it's the
 

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.990
function so is I don't know now it's the
meat of your idling resource you're

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:22.000
meat of your idling resource you're
 

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.830
meat of your idling resource you're
going to basically expressions

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840
going to basically expressions
 

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.260
going to basically expressions
one after you register the item resource

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:26.270
one after you register the item resource
 

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.360
one after you register the item resource
express one's going to come along and

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:28.370
express one's going to come along and
 

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:32.110
express one's going to come along and
say hey are you idle by calling the item

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120
say hey are you idle by calling the item
 

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:33.880
say hey are you idle by calling the item
malfunction and you return true or false

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:33.890
malfunction and you return true or false
 

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.120
malfunction and you return true or false
in our particular case we are trying to

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:37.130
in our particular case we are trying to
 

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:40.000
in our particular case we are trying to
make sure that the intent service is not

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:40.010
make sure that the intent service is not
 

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.620
make sure that the intent service is not
running so in the next slide that's

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:41.630
running so in the next slide that's
 

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.120
running so in the next slide that's
going to be actually implementation of

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:43.130
going to be actually implementation of
 

00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:44.769
going to be actually implementation of
this but let's say we have this magic

00:21:44.769 --> 00:21:44.779
this but let's say we have this magic
 

00:21:44.779 --> 00:21:45.909
this but let's say we have this magic
helper functions that will tell us

00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919
helper functions that will tell us
 

00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:47.919
helper functions that will tell us
whether my intent surface is running or

00:21:47.919 --> 00:21:47.929
whether my intent surface is running or
 

00:21:47.929 --> 00:21:48.100
whether my intent surface is running or
not

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:48.110
not
 

00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:50.529
not
and I say if it's not running then is

00:21:50.529 --> 00:21:50.539
and I say if it's not running then is
 

00:21:50.539 --> 00:21:54.399
and I say if it's not running then is
idle when is idle I can go ahead and

00:21:54.399 --> 00:21:54.409
idle when is idle I can go ahead and
 

00:21:54.409 --> 00:21:56.200
idle when is idle I can go ahead and
call this callback that I special way

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:56.210
call this callback that I special way
 

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.510
call this callback that I special way
here so that I can notify and expresso

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:58.520
here so that I can notify and expresso
 

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.880
here so that I can notify and expresso
and say is idle go ahead and do your

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:00.890
and say is idle go ahead and do your
 

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:03.940
and say is idle go ahead and do your
things so that's how idle resource is

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:03.950
things so that's how idle resource is
 

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.480
things so that's how idle resource is
structured so like I said this is the

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:07.490
structured so like I said this is the
 

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.299
structured so like I said this is the
magic helper function basically what

00:22:10.299 --> 00:22:10.309
magic helper function basically what
 

00:22:10.309 --> 00:22:11.769
magic helper function basically what
we're doing is we're querying the

00:22:11.769 --> 00:22:11.779
we're doing is we're querying the
 

00:22:11.779 --> 00:22:14.200
we're doing is we're querying the
activity manager for the particular name

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:14.210
activity manager for the particular name
 

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:17.710
activity manager for the particular name
and make sure that the one that we are

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.720
and make sure that the one that we are
 

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.190
and make sure that the one that we are
looking for well it's there then it's

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200
looking for well it's there then it's
 

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.389
looking for well it's there then it's
running right if it's not there then

00:22:22.389 --> 00:22:22.399
running right if it's not there then
 

00:22:22.399 --> 00:22:23.380
running right if it's not there then
it's not running it'll be confusing

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:23.390
it's not running it'll be confusing
 

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.450
it's not running it'll be confusing
records then one level later with negate

00:22:25.450 --> 00:22:25.460
records then one level later with negate
 

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.610
records then one level later with negate
so this is if it's running if I can find

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:27.620
so this is if it's running if I can find
 

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:31.810
so this is if it's running if I can find
it then it's running so once you have

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:31.820
it then it's running so once you have
 

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:34.899
it then it's running so once you have
define your idling resource then you

00:22:34.899 --> 00:22:34.909
define your idling resource then you
 

00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:36.399
define your idling resource then you
need to register it so that Express will

00:22:36.399 --> 00:22:36.409
need to register it so that Express will
 

00:22:36.409 --> 00:22:38.740
need to register it so that Express will
know to actually ask this particular

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:38.750
know to actually ask this particular
 

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:40.450
know to actually ask this particular
item resource like hey are you idle now

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:40.460
item resource like hey are you idle now
 

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:44.409
item resource like hey are you idle now
before it moves on like I said very

00:22:44.409 --> 00:22:44.419
before it moves on like I said very
 

00:22:44.419 --> 00:22:46.000
before it moves on like I said very
confusing topic so I've written a lot

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.010
confusing topic so I've written a lot
 

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.860
confusing topic so I've written a lot
about it and one other thing that I want

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:47.870
about it and one other thing that I want
 

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:50.639
about it and one other thing that I want
to mention because even I forgot is that

00:22:50.639 --> 00:22:50.649
to mention because even I forgot is that
 

00:22:50.649 --> 00:22:53.289
to mention because even I forgot is that
Express or only check the idling

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:53.299
Express or only check the idling
 

00:22:53.299 --> 00:22:55.299
Express or only check the idling

things where I am like oh I registered

00:23:01.149 --> 00:23:01.159
things where I am like oh I registered
 

00:23:01.159 --> 00:23:03.220
things where I am like oh I registered
an island resource and then I'm going to

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:03.230
an island resource and then I'm going to
 

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:07.090
an island resource and then I'm going to
go check some Java level thing and then

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:07.100
go check some Java level thing and then
 

00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:09.730
go check some Java level thing and then
it was not actually waiting for stuff to

and click and matches and those are what
I'm talking about so make sure that you

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:25.100
I'm talking about so make sure that you
 

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:28.120
I'm talking about so make sure that you
are waiting at those points if you're if

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:28.130
are waiting at those points if you're if
 

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:29.620
are waiting at those points if you're if
you think Express was waiting and it's

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:29.630
you think Express was waiting and it's
 

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.269
you think Express was waiting and it's
not waiting is it could be because that

00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279
not waiting is it could be because that
 

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:33.820
not waiting is it could be because that
you are not at the point when is acting

okay all right so now this is the point
 

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:44.300
okay all right so now this is the point
where I think things get really

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:44.310
where I think things get really

example we are going to go through an
 

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:03.440
example we are going to go through an
example where your app depends on the

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:03.450
example where your app depends on the

day so dagger and mockito allows you to

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:11.100
day so dagger and mockito allows you to
 

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.560
day so dagger and mockito allows you to
set up a test environment that's

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:12.570
set up a test environment that's
 

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:16.340
set up a test environment that's
predictable and repeatable data that's

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:16.350
predictable and repeatable data that's
 

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.980
predictable and repeatable data that's
dependency injection that's a fancy term

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:18.990
dependency injection that's a fancy term
 

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.260
dependency injection that's a fancy term
all it means is that in your

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:21.270
all it means is that in your
 

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:23.450
all it means is that in your
constructors it's going to have a

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:23.460
constructors it's going to have a
 

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.820
constructors it's going to have a
central repository to grab objects from

00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:25.830
central repository to grab objects from
 

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:29.060
central repository to grab objects from
this way you can have one repository of

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.070
this way you can have one repository of
 

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:31.880
this way you can have one repository of
objects for your app and a different one

00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:31.890
objects for your app and a different one
 

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:35.840
objects for your app and a different one
for your test oh wow I just said what I

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:35.850
for your test oh wow I just said what I
 

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:39.100
for your test oh wow I just said what I
wrote on my slide that's pretty amazing

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:39.110
wrote on my slide that's pretty amazing
 

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:42.440
wrote on my slide that's pretty amazing
and makino is what you can use to

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:42.450
and makino is what you can use to
 

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.420
and makino is what you can use to
provide those objects in your test so

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:44.430
provide those objects in your test so
 

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.160
provide those objects in your test so
that you can control for example today's

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:46.170
that you can control for example today's
 

00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:50.900
that you can control for example today's
date so this is how the basic formula

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:50.910
date so this is how the basic formula
 

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.780
date so this is how the basic formula
for dagger - I'm dagger 1 is different

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:52.790
for dagger - I'm dagger 1 is different
 

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.700
for dagger - I'm dagger 1 is different
what we need to do is when I say our

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:55.710
what we need to do is when I say our
 

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:57.530
what we need to do is when I say our
repository of object what I'm talking

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:57.540
repository of object what I'm talking
 

00:24:57.540 --> 00:24:59.840
repository of object what I'm talking
about is a component so here I have

00:24:59.840 --> 00:24:59.850
about is a component so here I have
 

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:02.480
about is a component so here I have
defined a component and it knows that it

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:02.490
defined a component and it knows that it
 

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.630
defined a component and it knows that it
can inject fields into the main activity

00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640
can inject fields into the main activity
 

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.420
can inject fields into the main activity
and I have two different subclasses

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:08.430
and I have two different subclasses
 

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.550
and I have two different subclasses
the application component which with

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:10.560
the application component which with
 

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.710
the application component which with
empty meaning that it only rejects

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720
empty meaning that it only rejects
 

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.660
empty meaning that it only rejects
igreja only injects into the main

00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:14.670
igreja only injects into the main
 

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:17.450
igreja only injects into the main
activity and there's a test component

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:17.460
activity and there's a test component
 

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.690
activity and there's a test component
that it will inject also into the test

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:20.700
that it will inject also into the test
 

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.650
that it will inject also into the test
and they are Singleton's because we want

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:24.660
and they are Singleton's because we want
 

00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:27.770
and they are Singleton's because we want
the same object to be used in app and

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:27.780
the same object to be used in app and
 

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.440
the same object to be used in app and
test so that when you change it in your

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:30.450
test so that when you change it in your
 

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:32.120
test so that when you change it in your
test your app is actually using that

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:32.130
test your app is actually using that
 

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:36.320
test your app is actually using that
object and here the way the define was

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:36.330
object and here the way the define was
 

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:38.710
object and here the way the define was
inside your component is by these

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720
inside your component is by these
 

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:41.390
inside your component is by these
annotations so for the application we

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400
annotations so for the application we
 

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.800
annotations so for the application we
will have a clock module that will

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:42.810
will have a clock module that will
 

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.680
will have a clock module that will
actually give you today State and in the

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:45.690
actually give you today State and in the
 

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:48.200
actually give you today State and in the
test component will provide a mock clock

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:48.210
test component will provide a mock clock
 

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:50.420
test component will provide a mock clock
module so that I can control what date

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:50.430
module so that I can control what date

module so that I can control what date
gets used

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:52.370
gets used
 

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:55.850
gets used
and I have given you also a beautiful

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860
and I have given you also a beautiful

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:57.810
diagram in case these doesn't make sense
 

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.270
diagram in case these doesn't make sense
and what my explanation is makes sense

00:25:59.270 --> 00:25:59.280
and what my explanation is makes sense
 

00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:01.250
and what my explanation is makes sense
so this is just a graphic representation

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.260
so this is just a graphic representation
 

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.130
so this is just a graphic representation
of what I just said right so here I have

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:04.140
of what I just said right so here I have
 

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:06.560
of what I just said right so here I have
an application component which injects

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:06.570
an application component which injects
 

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:09.800
an application component which injects
into mini activity and it has a clock

into mini activity and it has a clock
 

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.290
into mini activity and it has a clock
module that knows how to provide a clock

00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:12.300
module that knows how to provide a clock
 

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.440
module that knows how to provide a clock
and then in test will have a mock one

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:15.450
and then in test will have a mock one
 

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.300
and then in test will have a mock one
and it will be injecting into both the

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:17.310
and it will be injecting into both the
 

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:22.040
and it will be injecting into both the
test and the app in the application in

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:22.050
test and the app in the application in
 

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.440
test and the app in the application in
your own create function we are going to

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:24.450
your own create function we are going to
 

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:26.770
your own create function we are going to
go ahead and instantiate one of these

00:26:26.770 --> 00:26:26.780
go ahead and instantiate one of these
 

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.300
go ahead and instantiate one of these
application component the reason why it

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:29.310
application component the reason why it
 

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.850
application component the reason why it
has such a funky name is that what you

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:31.860
has such a funky name is that what you
 

00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.920
has such a funky name is that what you
define the application components is

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:33.930
define the application components is
 

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.320
define the application components is
actually just an implementation dagger

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:36.330
actually just an implementation dagger
 

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:39.170
actually just an implementation dagger
we'll go ahead and do some code

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:39.180
we'll go ahead and do some code
 

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.360
we'll go ahead and do some code
generation behind the scene and generate

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:41.370
generation behind the scene and generate
 

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:44.270
generation behind the scene and generate
this class for you then you can go ahead

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:44.280
this class for you then you can go ahead
 

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.520
this class for you then you can go ahead
and use this class and create an

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:46.530
and use this class and create an
 

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.350
and use this class and create an
application component and stash it in

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360
application component and stash it in
 

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.820
application component and stash it in
this variable and then we are actually

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:52.830
this variable and then we are actually
 

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:54.650
this variable and then we are actually
also going to have a set component

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:54.660
also going to have a set component
 

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.360
also going to have a set component
function because we're going to use it

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:56.370
function because we're going to use it
 

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.820
function because we're going to use it
in tests so what happened is that when

00:26:58.820 --> 00:26:58.830
in tests so what happened is that when
 

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.310
in tests so what happened is that when
is tests actually it's probably going to

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320
is tests actually it's probably going to
 

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.110
is tests actually it's probably going to
be in the slide just you know maybe I

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120
be in the slide just you know maybe I
 

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:04.400
be in the slide just you know maybe I
shouldn't get ahead of myself so let me

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:04.410
shouldn't get ahead of myself so let me
 

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:07.790
shouldn't get ahead of myself so let me
just get into the next slide so here

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:07.800
just get into the next slide so here
 

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.010
just get into the next slide so here
what we are going to do is that so

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.020
what we are going to do is that so
 

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.290
what we are going to do is that so
special way what you what I just said

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:12.300
special way what you what I just said
 

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:14.120
special way what you what I just said
the the part that we have an app

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:14.130
the the part that we have an app
 

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:16.340
the the part that we have an app
component and then we also have a set

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:16.350
component and then we also have a set
 

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:18.050
component and then we also have a set
component function which is used in test

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:18.060
component function which is used in test
 

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:21.170
component function which is used in test
so in tests we are going to have

00:27:21.170 --> 00:27:21.180
so in tests we are going to have
 

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.960
so in tests we are going to have
something different for the function get

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:23.970
something different for the function get
 

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:26.300
something different for the function get
now so in the app have you used

00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:26.310
now so in the app have you used
 

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.510
now so in the app have you used
joda-time that's a really nice date and

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520
joda-time that's a really nice date and
 

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.470
joda-time that's a really nice date and
time library for Android and for Java so

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.480
time library for Android and for Java so
 

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.450
time library for Android and for Java so
daytime is what the Jordan I'm will

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460
daytime is what the Jordan I'm will
 

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:37.490
daytime is what the Jordan I'm will
provide you if you just give it with no

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:37.500
provide you if you just give it with no
 

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.360
provide you if you just give it with no
parameters

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:38.370
parameters
 

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:40.520
parameters
it will give you today's date and this

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:40.530
it will give you today's date and this
 

00:27:40.530 --> 00:27:43.550
it will give you today's date and this
exact moment in the test what we're

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:43.560
exact moment in the test what we're
 

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.520
exact moment in the test what we're
going to do is we are going to go to the

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:46.530
going to do is we are going to go to the
 

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:49.070
going to do is we are going to go to the
view that has the ID date this is

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080
view that has the ID date this is
 

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.840
view that has the ID date this is
actually attack view and then we're

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:50.850
actually attack view and then we're
 

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.170
actually attack view and then we're
going to verify that it will display the

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:54.180
going to verify that it will display the
 

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:59.720
going to verify that it will display the
text 2008 - oh 9 - 23 if you don't use

00:27:59.720 --> 00:27:59.730
text 2008 - oh 9 - 23 if you don't use
 

00:27:59.730 --> 00:28:01.670
text 2008 - oh 9 - 23 if you don't use
makino and you don't have control over

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:01.680
makino and you don't have control over
 

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.610
makino and you don't have control over
the clock what an everyday that you run

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620
the clock what an everyday that you run
 

00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.190
the clock what an everyday that you run
this

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:05.200
this
 

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.080
this
it's going to display a different string

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:07.090
it's going to display a different string
 

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.480
it's going to display a different string
so you can't really test that um so

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:09.490
so you can't really test that um so
 

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.190
so you can't really test that um so
that's the power of using Makino and

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200
that's the power of using Makino and
 

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.889
that's the power of using Makino and
dagger dagger allows you to provide

00:28:13.889 --> 00:28:13.899
dagger dagger allows you to provide
 

00:28:13.899 --> 00:28:15.720
dagger dagger allows you to provide
different components to your app and

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:15.730
different components to your app and
 

00:28:15.730 --> 00:28:18.120
different components to your app and
your tests and mockito allows you to

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:18.130
your tests and mockito allows you to
 

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:21.570
your tests and mockito allows you to
mock the behavior of that car so if you

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:21.580
mock the behavior of that car so if you
 

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.789
mock the behavior of that car so if you
look at it again the syntax is like when

00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799
look at it again the syntax is like when
 

00:28:23.799 --> 00:28:25.919
look at it again the syntax is like when
this function is called then return this

00:28:25.919 --> 00:28:25.929
this function is called then return this
 

00:28:25.929 --> 00:28:27.120
this function is called then return this
particular object you don't actually

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.130
particular object you don't actually
 

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:31.139
particular object you don't actually
need to like write a function to define

00:28:31.139 --> 00:28:31.149
need to like write a function to define
 

00:28:31.149 --> 00:28:33.480
need to like write a function to define
things so it's all very fluent and you

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:33.490
things so it's all very fluent and you
 

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.129
things so it's all very fluent and you
can you can divine find a lot of

00:28:35.129 --> 00:28:35.139
can you can divine find a lot of
 

00:28:35.139 --> 00:28:39.000
can you can divine find a lot of
different things in Makino again blog

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.010
different things in Makino again blog
 

00:28:39.010 --> 00:28:41.610
different things in Makino again blog
post repository this one is slightly

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:41.620
post repository this one is slightly
 

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.590
post repository this one is slightly
different because I actually have a

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600
different because I actually have a
 

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:45.149
different because I actually have a
course a video course that's

00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:45.159
course a video course that's
 

00:28:45.159 --> 00:28:47.519
course a video course that's
pre-recorded that I actually stepped

00:28:47.519 --> 00:28:47.529
pre-recorded that I actually stepped
 

00:28:47.529 --> 00:28:49.230
pre-recorded that I actually stepped
through a one particular example the

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:49.240
through a one particular example the
 

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.090
through a one particular example the
example is using shared preferences

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:51.100
example is using shared preferences
 

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.710
example is using shared preferences
because when you think about shared

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:52.720
because when you think about shared
 

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.830
because when you think about shared
preferences it changes the state of your

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840
preferences it changes the state of your
 

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.080
preferences it changes the state of your
application right so maybe the first

00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:58.090
application right so maybe the first
 

00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:59.940
application right so maybe the first
time you open this app someone say that

00:28:59.940 --> 00:28:59.950
time you open this app someone say that
 

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.370
time you open this app someone say that
my favorite animals cat and then the

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:02.380
my favorite animals cat and then the
 

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:03.509
my favorite animals cat and then the
second time you come back and want to

00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519
second time you come back and want to
 

00:29:03.519 --> 00:29:05.970
second time you come back and want to
show that it's a cat but you don't know

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:05.980
show that it's a cat but you don't know
 

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:07.919
show that it's a cat but you don't know
whether it was provided or not and you

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:07.929
whether it was provided or not and you
 

00:29:07.929 --> 00:29:10.230
whether it was provided or not and you
don't want your test to where to modify

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240
don't want your test to where to modify
 

00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:12.930
don't want your test to where to modify
the state of the app right because then

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:12.940
the state of the app right because then
 

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:14.789
the state of the app right because then
it's persisting and the next time you

00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799
it's persisting and the next time you
 

00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:17.519
it's persisting and the next time you
run you don't know whether it's going to

00:29:17.519 --> 00:29:17.529
run you don't know whether it's going to
 

00:29:17.529 --> 00:29:19.440
run you don't know whether it's going to
be having an initial state or not so

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:19.450
be having an initial state or not so
 

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:20.909
be having an initial state or not so
using dagger and mockito

00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919
using dagger and mockito
 

00:29:20.919 --> 00:29:23.340
using dagger and mockito
you can also do things like that you can

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:23.350
you can also do things like that you can
 

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:26.190
you can also do things like that you can
provide an in-memory share preferences

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:26.200
provide an in-memory share preferences
 

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.930
provide an in-memory share preferences
which every time you run it is going to

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:27.940
which every time you run it is going to
 

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:30.330
which every time you run it is going to
start from fresh new stuff go and delete

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:30.340
start from fresh new stuff go and delete
 

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:33.960
start from fresh new stuff go and delete
your database of the app so that is

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:33.970
your database of the app so that is
 

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:36.419
your database of the app so that is
actually a course that you have to pay

00:29:36.419 --> 00:29:36.429
actually a course that you have to pay
 

00:29:36.429 --> 00:29:38.669
actually a course that you have to pay
but since you are all here there's a

00:29:38.669 --> 00:29:38.679
but since you are all here there's a
 

00:29:38.679 --> 00:29:41.340
but since you are all here there's a

view we were using the example of a

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:04.750
view we were using the example of a
 

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.019
view we were using the example of a
toolbar and then we actually use the

00:30:07.019 --> 00:30:07.029
toolbar and then we actually use the
 

00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:08.850
toolbar and then we actually use the
same example but this time draw a custom

00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:08.860
same example but this time draw a custom
 

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.830
same example but this time draw a custom

bridge what I call that instead of

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:30.890
bridge what I call that instead of
 

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:33.880
bridge what I call that instead of
calling the Google API client directly I

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:33.890
calling the Google API client directly I
 

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:36.639
calling the Google API client directly I
call through the bridge so I call on pre

00:31:36.639 --> 00:31:36.649
call through the bridge so I call on pre
 

00:31:36.649 --> 00:31:39.820
call through the bridge so I call on pre
on connect on connect and you cut the

00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:39.830
on connect on connect and you cut the
 

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:44.139
on connect on connect and you cut the
connect function of my function through

00:31:44.139 --> 00:31:44.149
connect function of my function through
 

00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:46.210
connect function of my function through
the bridge and then I can use mojito so

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:46.220
the bridge and then I can use mojito so
 

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:47.740
the bridge and then I can use mojito so
that always someone called the connect

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:47.750
that always someone called the connect
 

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.649
that always someone called the connect
function then I'm going to capture it

00:31:50.649 --> 00:31:50.659
function then I'm going to capture it
 

00:31:50.659 --> 00:31:52.810
function then I'm going to capture it
and then call them on on connected

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:52.820
and then call them on on connected
 

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.090
and then call them on on connected
function and spit it right out back and

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:55.100
function and spit it right out back and
 

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.100
function and spit it right out back and
run the callback for them so it's

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:57.110
run the callback for them so it's
 

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.779
run the callback for them so it's
actually really advanced so much more

00:31:58.779 --> 00:31:58.789
actually really advanced so much more
 

00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:59.980
actually really advanced so much more
advanced than what we have gone through

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:26.150
check it out and see if you'll agree
 

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:28.420
check it out and see if you'll agree
that there's some serious badass testing

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:28.430
that there's some serious badass testing
 

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.050

thing that I didn't have time to ask sly
 

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:11.379
thing that I didn't have time to ask sly
for is that a lot of people tell me that

for is that a lot of people tell me that
 

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:14.290
for is that a lot of people tell me that
there is so much effort in doing testing

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:14.300
there is so much effort in doing testing
 

00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:16.330
there is so much effort in doing testing
like why would you bother so I just want

00:34:16.330 --> 00:34:16.340
like why would you bother so I just want
 

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.580
like why would you bother so I just want
to give you like one reason why I do it

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:18.590
to give you like one reason why I do it
 

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:22.360
to give you like one reason why I do it
myself I work with startups and a lot of

00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:22.370
myself I work with startups and a lot of
 

00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:23.950
myself I work with startups and a lot of
times they will have a server team they

00:34:23.950 --> 00:34:23.960
times they will have a server team they
 

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.149
times they will have a server team they
need to implement some server change

00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159
need to implement some server change
 

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.430
need to implement some server change
before I can implement the Android UI

00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440
before I can implement the Android UI
 

00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.919
before I can implement the Android UI
change and they're slow they're usually

00:34:29.919 --> 00:34:29.929
change and they're slow they're usually
 

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.230
change and they're slow they're usually
slower then like you know we will do a

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240
slower then like you know we will do a
 

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.790
slower then like you know we will do a
sprint and then they'll let's go and

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:33.800
sprint and then they'll let's go and
 

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:35.320
sprint and then they'll let's go and
implement them and I'm supposed to be

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:35.330
implement them and I'm supposed to be
 

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:36.700
implement them and I'm supposed to be
implemented in that sprint and I'm

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:36.710
implemented in that sprint and I'm
 

00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:38.649
implemented in that sprint and I'm
holding my breath and waiting for them

00:34:38.649 --> 00:34:38.659
holding my breath and waiting for them
 

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.629
holding my breath and waiting for them
to implement the server change well no

00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639
to implement the server change well no
 

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:43.419
to implement the server change well no
more because I have mojito I actually

00:34:43.419 --> 00:34:43.429
more because I have mojito I actually
 

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:44.910
more because I have mojito I actually
use mock web server

00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:44.920
use mock web server
 

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.100
use mock web server
so what I do is that I have my test and

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:47.110
so what I do is that I have my test and
 

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.530
so what I do is that I have my test and
all I need to do is agree on the Java

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:49.540
all I need to do is agree on the Java
 

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.050
all I need to do is agree on the Java
and other Java the JSON format with my

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:52.060
and other Java the JSON format with my
 

00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.820
and other Java the JSON format with my
server team and then I would just mark

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:53.830
server team and then I would just mark
 

00:34:53.830 --> 00:34:57.120
server team and then I would just mark
out whatever I expect the response from

00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:57.130
out whatever I expect the response from
 

00:34:57.130 --> 00:34:59.040
out whatever I expect the response from
the server it's going to be and I can go

00:34:59.040 --> 00:34:59.050
the server it's going to be and I can go
 

00:34:59.050 --> 00:35:01.590
the server it's going to be and I can go
ahead and write the UI code before they

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:01.600
ahead and write the UI code before they
 

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.050
ahead and write the UI code before they
are ready and I can even test bad cases

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:04.060
are ready and I can even test bad cases
 

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.930
are ready and I can even test bad cases
right what if I get a 500 error like

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:06.940
right what if I get a 500 error like
 

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:08.310
right what if I get a 500 error like
what would my app behave

00:35:08.310 --> 00:35:08.320
what would my app behave
 

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.990
what would my app behave
you don't usually test the happy path

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000
you don't usually test the happy path
 

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.490
you don't usually test the happy path
and it's really difficult how are you

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:11.500
and it's really difficult how are you
 

00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.560
and it's really difficult how are you
going to do that in a real life scenario

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:13.570
going to do that in a real life scenario
 

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:14.790
going to do that in a real life scenario
you're going to like ask them to shut

00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800
you're going to like ask them to shut
 

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.140
you're going to like ask them to shut
down the server so they can test your

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:16.150
down the server so they can test your
 

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:19.560
down the server so they can test your
500 case no right but in our case if I

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:19.570
500 case no right but in our case if I
 

00:35:19.570 --> 00:35:21.210
500 case no right but in our case if I
have said on my testing infrastructure I

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:21.220
have said on my testing infrastructure I
 

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:23.340
have said on my testing infrastructure I
have complete control of what my mock

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:23.350
have complete control of what my mock
 

00:35:23.350 --> 00:35:25.170
have complete control of what my mock
server is going to do and I can go ahead

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:25.180
server is going to do and I can go ahead
 

00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:27.360
server is going to do and I can go ahead
and write my app without the server

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:27.370
and write my app without the server
 

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:30.360
and write my app without the server
ready by testing so testing so that's

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:30.370
ready by testing so testing so that's
 

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.400
ready by testing so testing so that's
actually how I use testing which of

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:32.410
actually how I use testing which of
 

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:34.410
actually how I use testing which of
course then the side benefit is that it

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:34.420
course then the side benefit is that it
 

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.930
course then the side benefit is that it
is actually automatically running right

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:36.940
is actually automatically running right
 

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.520
is actually automatically running right
so I can also catch regressions so

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:38.530
so I can also catch regressions so
 

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.620
so I can also catch regressions so
sometimes I would change one thing in my

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:40.630
sometimes I would change one thing in my
 

00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:42.570
sometimes I would change one thing in my
style thinking that will be all good but

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:42.580
style thinking that will be all good but
 

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:45.180
style thinking that will be all good but
then Express will be like yeah you said

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:45.190
then Express will be like yeah you said
 

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:46.710
then Express will be like yeah you said
the color supposed to be gray is

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720
the color supposed to be gray is
 

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:49.110
the color supposed to be gray is
actually purple now so I can also catch

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:49.120
actually purple now so I can also catch
 

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.520
actually purple now so I can also catch
regression because I have written my

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:50.530
regression because I have written my
 

00:35:50.530 --> 00:35:52.890
regression because I have written my
test so I almost looked at that as a

00:35:52.890 --> 00:35:52.900
test so I almost looked at that as a
 

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.320
test so I almost looked at that as a
side benefit of like the testing part

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:55.330
side benefit of like the testing part
 

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:56.730
side benefit of like the testing part
like the part I really like is the fact

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:56.740
like the part I really like is the fact
 

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.590
like the part I really like is the fact
that I can mock out the server and then

00:35:58.590 --> 00:35:58.600
that I can mock out the server and then
 

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.660
that I can mock out the server and then
I can go ahead and write my app with all

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:00.670
I can go ahead and write my app with all
 

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.420
I can go ahead and write my app with all
my server team being ready so with that

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:03.430
my server team being ready so with that
 

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.210
my server team being ready so with that
thank you very much thank you for

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:06.220
thank you very much thank you for
 

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:15.940
thank you very much thank you for
tolerating with my kicking of the stand

00:36:15.940 --> 00:36:15.950
 

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:19.040
feel free to leave but I can also take

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:19.050
feel free to leave but I can also take
 

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:28.750
feel free to leave but I can also take
some questions right now yeah

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760
 

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:33.370
okay so the question was because of

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:33.380
okay so the question was because of
 

00:36:33.380 --> 00:36:35.350
okay so the question was because of
technical difficulty we were interrupted

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:35.360
technical difficulty we were interrupted
 

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.880
technical difficulty we were interrupted
right at the dagger point which is kind

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:36.890
right at the dagger point which is kind
 

00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:39.010
right at the dagger point which is kind
of tricky so he wants to know how you

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:39.020
of tricky so he wants to know how you
 

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:42.520
of tricky so he wants to know how you
can set up dagger two if you go to my

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:42.530
can set up dagger two if you go to my
 

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:45.880
can set up dagger two if you go to my
github repository there is a sample

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:45.890
github repository there is a sample
 

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:49.000
github repository there is a sample
project that is called Android - test -

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:49.010
project that is called Android - test -
 

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.690
project that is called Android - test -
demo it uses dagger - mojito and

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:51.700
demo it uses dagger - mojito and
 

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.610
demo it uses dagger - mojito and
expresso - and that's a blog post that's

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:54.620
expresso - and that's a blog post that's
 

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.700
expresso - and that's a blog post that's
linked from there in the readme so I

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:57.710
linked from there in the readme so I
 

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:59.440
linked from there in the readme so I
hope that the blog post will explain

00:36:59.440 --> 00:36:59.450
hope that the blog post will explain
 

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.330
hope that the blog post will explain
pretty well half step by step how you

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:01.340
pretty well half step by step how you
 

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:05.410
pretty well half step by step how you
set it up yeah you can refer to that yes

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:05.420
set it up yeah you can refer to that yes
 

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:37.220
set it up yeah you can refer to that yes
question

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:37.230
 

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:40.220
okay the question was can I improve the

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:40.230
okay the question was can I improve the
 

00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:42.410
okay the question was can I improve the
idling resource for the intense service

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:42.420
idling resource for the intense service
 

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.730
idling resource for the intense service
so instead of checking whether the whole

00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:43.740
so instead of checking whether the whole
 

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.560
so instead of checking whether the whole
intense service is running can I check a

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:45.570
intense service is running can I check a
 

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:49.010
intense service is running can I check a
specific task I don't know off the top

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020
specific task I don't know off the top
 

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:49.940
specific task I don't know off the top
of my head

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:49.950
of my head
 

00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:53.720
of my head
whether intense service is queryable if

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:53.730
whether intense service is queryable if
 

00:37:53.730 --> 00:37:55.220
whether intense service is queryable if
there make any sense that I can ask that

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:55.230
there make any sense that I can ask that
 

00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.190
there make any sense that I can ask that
what is running and it's kind of not

00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200
what is running and it's kind of not
 

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.560
what is running and it's kind of not
really expressive specific right because

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:00.570
really expressive specific right because
 

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:02.990
really expressive specific right because
it's basically intense service specific

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000
it's basically intense service specific
 

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.130
it's basically intense service specific
you're trying to detect whether your

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:04.140
you're trying to detect whether your
 

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.680
you're trying to detect whether your
particular task is running so sorry I

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:06.690
particular task is running so sorry I
 

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:41.400
particular task is running so sorry I
don't know sorry yeah question

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:41.410
 

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.400
so the question was he has a viewpager

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:44.410
so the question was he has a viewpager
 

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.220
so the question was he has a viewpager
that has multiple recyclerview on the

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:47.230
that has multiple recyclerview on the
 

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:50.640
that has multiple recyclerview on the
different pages essentially and he will

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:50.650
different pages essentially and he will
 

00:38:50.650 --> 00:38:52.980
different pages essentially and he will
swipe and said okay this one is the

00:38:52.980 --> 00:38:52.990
swipe and said okay this one is the
 

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.210
swipe and said okay this one is the
visible and I want to test it but

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:54.220
visible and I want to test it but
 

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.510
visible and I want to test it but
secretly the other the either recycle

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520
secretly the other the either recycle
 

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:58.890
secretly the other the either recycle
used to hanging out because that's how

00:38:58.890 --> 00:38:58.900
used to hanging out because that's how
 

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.800
used to hanging out because that's how
he can swipe back in and he's asking how

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:01.810
he can swipe back in and he's asking how
 

00:39:01.810 --> 00:39:03.810
he can swipe back in and he's asking how
can I make sure that I'm verifying the

00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:03.820
can I make sure that I'm verifying the
 

00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:06.420
can I make sure that I'm verifying the
one that I want to verify right that's

00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:06.430
one that I want to verify right that's
 

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:10.760
one that I want to verify right that's
that sound good give them different IDs

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:10.770
that sound good give them different IDs
 

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:18.270
that sound good give them different IDs
does that work oh I see so they're

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:18.280
does that work oh I see so they're
 

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.170
does that work oh I see so they're
dynamically so the the dynamic test show

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:22.180
dynamically so the the dynamic test show
 

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:24.390
dynamically so the the dynamic test show
is not going to be using the IDS that is

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400
is not going to be using the IDS that is
 

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:33.800
is not going to be using the IDS that is
from the XML file okay

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:33.810
from the XML file okay
 

00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:36.870
from the XML file okay
he said he uses dynamic tests I think

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880
he said he uses dynamic tests I think
 

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.310
he said he uses dynamic tests I think
that's reasonable I mean I was going to

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320
that's reasonable I mean I was going to
 

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:40.350
that's reasonable I mean I was going to
suggest something similar right you can

00:39:40.350 --> 00:39:40.360
suggest something similar right you can
 

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.750
suggest something similar right you can
just issue you your IDs essentially to

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:42.760
just issue you your IDs essentially to
 

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.430
just issue you your IDs essentially to
them and then you can verify them but

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440
them and then you can verify them but
 

00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.230
them and then you can verify them but
that's gonna be random though so if you

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240
that's gonna be random though so if you
 

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.490
that's gonna be random though so if you
have something that is predictable then

00:39:47.490 --> 00:39:47.500
have something that is predictable then
 

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.150
have something that is predictable then
you can go look for them so you I think

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:51.160
you can go look for them so you I think
 

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:53.190
you can go look for them so you I think
you are doing something quite very

00:39:53.190 --> 00:39:53.200
you are doing something quite very
 

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.330
you are doing something quite very
reasonable I mean there may be better

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:54.340
reasonable I mean there may be better
 

00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:57.000
reasonable I mean there may be better
ways but I cannot think of it right now

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:57.010
ways but I cannot think of it right now
 

00:39:57.010 --> 00:40:14.259
ways but I cannot think of it right now
yeah

00:40:14.259 --> 00:40:14.269
 

00:40:14.269 --> 00:40:17.450
so the question was get real now how

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:17.460
so the question was get real now how
 

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.309
so the question was get real now how
much time did you spend on writing there

00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319
much time did you spend on writing there
 

00:40:19.319 --> 00:40:22.279
much time did you spend on writing there
are your tests so it's true

00:40:22.279 --> 00:40:22.289
are your tests so it's true
 

00:40:22.289 --> 00:40:24.499
are your tests so it's true
like to set up like you actually add

00:40:24.499 --> 00:40:24.509
like to set up like you actually add
 

00:40:24.509 --> 00:40:26.539
like to set up like you actually add
some complexity by using dagger and

00:40:26.539 --> 00:40:26.549
some complexity by using dagger and
 

00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:28.940
some complexity by using dagger and
making it so that you can mock and

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:28.950
making it so that you can mock and
 

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:29.539
making it so that you can mock and
whatnot

00:40:29.539 --> 00:40:29.549
whatnot
 

00:40:29.549 --> 00:40:33.620
whatnot
I have not clocked the hours that I'm

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:33.630
I have not clocked the hours that I'm
 

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:35.299
I have not clocked the hours that I'm
strictly writing tests versus I'm

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:35.309
strictly writing tests versus I'm
 

00:40:35.309 --> 00:40:36.769
strictly writing tests versus I'm
strictly writing the app because the way

00:40:36.769 --> 00:40:36.779
strictly writing the app because the way
 

00:40:36.779 --> 00:40:38.180
strictly writing the app because the way
I describe my work right

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:38.190
I describe my work right
 

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:40.640
I describe my work right
I used the test to drive my app I will

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:40.650
I used the test to drive my app I will
 

00:40:40.650 --> 00:40:42.799
I used the test to drive my app I will
mock out of the survey response and then

00:40:42.799 --> 00:40:42.809
mock out of the survey response and then
 

00:40:42.809 --> 00:40:44.239
mock out of the survey response and then
go implement something in the test and

00:40:44.239 --> 00:40:44.249
go implement something in the test and
 

00:40:44.249 --> 00:40:47.150
go implement something in the test and
run it so for me it's a very integral

00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160
run it so for me it's a very integral
 

00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:49.969
run it so for me it's a very integral
part of my development habit essentially

00:40:49.969 --> 00:40:49.979
part of my development habit essentially
 

00:40:49.979 --> 00:40:51.950
part of my development habit essentially
so I can't really tell you specifically

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960
so I can't really tell you specifically
 

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.259
so I can't really tell you specifically
how much time but what I can tell you is

00:40:54.259 --> 00:40:54.269
how much time but what I can tell you is
 

00:40:54.269 --> 00:40:58.039
how much time but what I can tell you is
this there are times when it's such

00:40:58.039 --> 00:40:58.049
this there are times when it's such
 

00:40:58.049 --> 00:41:00.680
this there are times when it's such
things that I would not cut on my own

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:00.690
things that I would not cut on my own
 

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:04.370
things that I would not cut on my own
for example what I did was I did a map

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:04.380
for example what I did was I did a map
 

00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.650
for example what I did was I did a map
fragment which I was inflating

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:06.660
fragment which I was inflating
 

00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:08.809
fragment which I was inflating

version it broke and usually I don't go

00:41:19.249 --> 00:41:19.259
version it broke and usually I don't go

to the part of my app that has the map

00:41:21.469 --> 00:41:21.479
to the part of my app that has the map
 

00:41:21.479 --> 00:41:23.509
to the part of my app that has the map

away because I crashed so I feel like

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:28.829
away because I crashed so I feel like
 

00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:31.599

the value it's very hard to quantify

00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:31.609
the value it's very hard to quantify
 

00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:34.940
the value it's very hard to quantify
like what if I when I didn't have the

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:34.950
like what if I when I didn't have the
 

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:36.739
like what if I when I didn't have the
test then it will probably be launched

00:41:36.739 --> 00:41:36.749
test then it will probably be launched
 

00:41:36.749 --> 00:41:39.200
test then it will probably be launched
with that crash and people will yell at

00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:39.210
with that crash and people will yell at
 

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:41.180
with that crash and people will yell at
me from the internet and then I have to

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:41.190
me from the internet and then I have to
 

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.519
me from the internet and then I have to
go find out so I don't really have a

00:41:43.519 --> 00:41:43.529
go find out so I don't really have a
 

00:41:43.529 --> 00:41:45.709
go find out so I don't really have a
hard number for you but I find it very

00:41:45.709 --> 00:41:45.719
hard number for you but I find it very
 

00:41:45.719 --> 00:41:48.259
hard number for you but I find it very
it's worth doing I think that's the

00:41:48.259 --> 00:41:48.269
it's worth doing I think that's the
 

00:41:48.269 --> 00:41:49.579
it's worth doing I think that's the
short answer but and you have to trust

00:41:49.579 --> 00:41:49.589
short answer but and you have to trust
 

00:41:49.589 --> 00:41:50.839
short answer but and you have to trust
me on that because I don't have data for

00:41:50.839 --> 00:41:50.849
me on that because I don't have data for
 

00:41:50.849 --> 00:41:55.279
me on that because I don't have data for
you cool well thank you very much I'm

00:41:55.279 --> 00:41:55.289
you cool well thank you very much I'm
 

00:41:55.289 --> 00:41:57.859
you cool well thank you very much I'm
going to stay around a bit so we can

00:41:57.859 --> 00:41:57.869
going to stay around a bit so we can
 

00:41:57.869 --> 00:42:01.910
going to stay around a bit so we can
chat offstage as well okay thank you
