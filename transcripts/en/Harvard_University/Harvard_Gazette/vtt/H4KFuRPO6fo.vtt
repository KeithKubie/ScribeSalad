00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.560
I am sitting here today because of my
parents and because of my family. We

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.419
really are a story about the importance
of education and what education can do. I

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:25.740
mean, consider for a moment the fact that
my great-grandmother was born into

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.090
slavery and emancipated at age six and
the fact that my grandparents were

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.100
sharecroppers. How do you go from that to
being able to attend some of the best

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.239
institutions in the world and now sit in
this wonderful opportunity?

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.219
Well, my parents left the rural
segregated south looking for opportunity.

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.020
My father went into the Air Force and
when he came out it was the GI Bill and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.739
an opportunity through a management training
program that enabled him to go to

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.219
college and my mother as well, she went
to college a little bit later in life

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.390
She moved out of the south and worked as
a secretary for several years before she

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.649
was able to go to a historically black
college that trained her to be a public

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.210
school teacher. As my parents careers
progressed I was able to see what they

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.869
were able to do with their lives and it
was the greatest example for me and so

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.220
in my life I've seen the importance of
education and how it can take you out of

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.000
poverty, but more importantly how it can
give you the agency to have control over

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.760
your own destiny.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.660
I was drawn to research on education

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.450
because of issues of inequality and
access, but I quickly realized, you know,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.490
education does not end at grade 12.
Students cannot go on and have a

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.789
middle-class standard of living if they
end with just a high school degree and

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.780
so I've done work trying to help
students get the information they need

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.189
and to simplify the processes so that
we're not wasting so much great

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.119
potential of students who are doing the
work that they need to do but are

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.380
getting lost in a system that was not
designed for their needs.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.880
One thing that

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.320
I love about the students at Harvard
Graduate School of Education is each

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:07.110
year the enthusiasm, the hope, and already
the experiences that they bring; I love

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.530
the fact that we know that there are
problems in education but we're not

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.629
satisfied to just let them continue, and
the students come because they are

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:21.750
prepared to create new things to help in
all sorts of ways and that enthusiasm as

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.040
a faculty member is something that I've
always drawn upon and I think the entire

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.780
community draws upon.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.200
The Harvard Graduate School of Education is already

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.620
in a place of strength. We have done so
much but our work absolutely is not done

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.670
When you look and see the continuing
inequities and the opportunities that

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.000
are not available, the fact that we waste
so much of student's potential because

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.769
they don't have access to high-quality
education, you realize there's so much

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.319
more to be done. We are now 50 years
after the war on poverty, we are 50 years

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.239
after Martin Luther King's assassination
and we look around and we wonder why

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.620
haven't we made more progress, what more
could we do? And then just two weeks ago

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.519
the Nation at Risk report that came out
35 years ago, we've realized those

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.380
inequities are still very present. It's all while the Harvard

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.360
Graduate School of Education has made many
contributions, innovations, impacts on the

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.170
field with research, with leaders who are
going out to the world with a strong

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.660
purpose and strong skills, we have to
think about ways that we can do more to

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.740
spread the knowledge that we have, to
engage with the field, to be a place

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.720
where practitioners and leaders and
policymakers can come to learn more and

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.780
to engage with each other.
