00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome back. What's the answer to this? Well, very simple--we go and try this out.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here's a failing assertion: 2+2=5. Let's see, when we run this whole thing what we got?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So here's the anti-traceback: we get the assertion error, we get the assertion that failed.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
At least we get the line and the code, which is the same.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We get the location--line 1 in our function and we get the list of callers.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So we've seen the list of callers, the location of the assertion of the program,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the failing assertion itself.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What we do not get is the location of the defect in the code because the defect would actually

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
causes the infection that later causes the assertion to fail, maybe in a completely different location.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
That's the whole point of debugging, trying to find the defect that causes an assertion to fail.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
However, during this course, you will find techniques that help you a lot in finding out

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
where the defect is that causes an assertion to fail and all of these automatically.
