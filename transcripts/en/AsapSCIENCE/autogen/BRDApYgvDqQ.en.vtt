00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.340
 Working in the lab and me 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.680
 I'm thinking about security 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.160
 Glasses down, and put on a lab coat 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.200
 Open shoes out 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.700
 Are you kidding ? 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.760
 Things could go wrong 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.600
 My gloves 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.940
 Protects me from chemicals 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.620
 Chemicals 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.280
 My dear 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.840
 Tie back your hair and prepare materials 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.380
 Materials 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.100
 First: Don't taste or smell 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.160
 You know you should sniff your hand 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.700
 Second: Don't mix it 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.320
 Until you check the sacks again 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.560
 Third: No food or drink 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.320
 If you don't want us to find you dead in the morning 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.100
 And if you respect it 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.560
 You reduce the risk 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.800
 I have lab rules and count them 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 I have lab rules and count them 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.860
 Tie long hair for yourself 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.880
 I have lab rules and count them 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980
 Now go and tell your friends. 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.000
 First: Don't taste or smell 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.080
 You know you should sniff your hand 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.920
 Second: Don't mix it 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.340
 Until you check the sacks again 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.260
 Third: No food or drink 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.620
 If you don't want us to find you dead in the morning 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.380
 And if you respect it 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.700
 You reduce the risk 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.560
 I have lab rules and count them
