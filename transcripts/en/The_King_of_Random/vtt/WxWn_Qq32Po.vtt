[Captions by Y Translator]
Today, we're going to be using
some 3D printing filament

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.940
for a slightly unusual use.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.700
We're going to try
melting it down in a pot,

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.776
and casting it in silicone.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:16.380
[Music]

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.959
You guys have wanted to see
quite a few different versions

00:00:18.959 --> 00:00:21.599
of our Diamond Play Button cast
in different stuff.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.840
So today, we're going to try
using 3D printing filament.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.980
What are the supplies here
that we're using?

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.722
Well, we have a few
different rolls of filament

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:30.278
and provided by MatterHackers.

00:00:30.278 --> 00:00:32.973
We've got these ones here,
which are glow-in-the-dark,

00:00:32.973 --> 00:00:35.150
and we've got a few
of these over here

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.032
that are black,

00:00:36.032 --> 00:00:36.887
and all of these,

00:00:36.887 --> 00:00:38.750
instead of just being
a rigid plastic,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.602
are kind of a rubbery plastic.

00:00:40.602 --> 00:00:41.543
So we're hoping

00:00:41.543 --> 00:00:44.351
that we'll end up with kind
of a rubbery glowing

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.847
gem Diamond Play Button.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.300
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.287
We've got rolls and rolls of this
filament provided by MatterHackers,

00:00:50.287 --> 00:00:52.937
and we're going to see
if we can melt it on the stove,

00:00:52.937 --> 00:00:55.500
and then pour it into
our Diamond Play Button mold.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.720
First, I think we need
to do a small-scale tests.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.932
We've got our tiny little
Bite Club soap bar mold.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.100
We'll try melting some
down on the stove,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.460
and we'll see
if we can cast it here.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.300
[Music]

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.440
So this is not the
correct way to melt

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.603
3D printing filament, right?

00:01:14.603 --> 00:01:15.760
Right.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:28.480
[Music]

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.116
Oh, that is not nearly as
runny as I thought it would be.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.600
No, it's kind of goopy.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.460
Wow.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.649
Is it too hot to touch?

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:38.450
Yes.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.500
I'm gonna touch it.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.580
I failed.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.454
I failed on everything.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.260
I failed everything
I've ever done in life.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.627
So attempt one,

00:01:47.627 --> 00:01:49.420
we obviously did
not have enough,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.780
and someone may have
accidentally touched it so it...

00:01:53.784 --> 00:01:55.160
Who was that?

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.140
Lift it up.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.560
Who did that?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.500
Be quiet, Nate!

00:01:58.503 --> 00:01:59.542
Who did that?

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:01.900
So we're going to go ahead
and pop this one out.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.120
Yeah.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.200
We're going to try
again with a lot more.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.340
Go go go.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.800
Oh that--
That is...

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.860
That is...

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.700
Has anyone ever seen
the villain of FernGully?

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.602
Smooth.
Smooth.

00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:26.100
[Music]

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.150
This is mostly cooled down.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.461
Well, partially cooled down.

00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:31.480
The outside is
feeling pretty rigid.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.729
But I want to get
it all the way cool

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:34.900
before we take it out
in case it deforms.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.660
So I think we're just going
to use some cool water.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:52.580
[Music]

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.680
Okay, better.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.440
That's not too bad.

00:02:54.447 --> 00:02:57.595
We obviously missed out
on a few of the details spots.

00:02:57.595 --> 00:03:00.150
Now, this is not as liquid
as a lot of stuff

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.008
that we've done
with this mold, so...

00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:02.952
That's very true.

00:03:02.952 --> 00:03:05.250
This stuff going in is
pretty thick and gummy,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.050
and the mold

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.450
that we're going to be using
for the Diamond Play Button

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.860
doesn't have the same
tiny inlaid details.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.840
I think to try and make it melt
a little bit more evenly,

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.710
we're just going to take
a whole bunch of this,

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.377
and we're going to just
cut it into like

00:03:17.377 --> 00:03:18.468
little one inch segments.

00:03:18.468 --> 00:03:19.562
So it's not in that circle,

00:03:19.562 --> 00:03:20.960
where some of its
being held up.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.944
We're just going to try
and fill it with like

00:03:22.944 --> 00:03:24.240
these little chopped up bits.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.180
Good aim.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:50.860
[Music]

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.540
We've got plenty
of our plastic melted here,

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.850
and I'm hoping we have enough
that we can just pour it

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.050
right into the diamond
triangle portion here,

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.650
and not have to worry
about like, oh,

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.343
there's some parts
that didn't pour out.

00:04:00.343 --> 00:04:01.950
I don't want to have
to scrape it out.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.100
I want to be able
to just pour it.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.700
Much nicer.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.980
That's getting melty.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.860
It looks like hot cheese.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.820
[Music]

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.480
Now, I don't know

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.340
what we're going to do
about the bubbles,

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.480
because there's quite
a few bubbles here.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.420
[Music]

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.300
Yes, that.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.080
Do that.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.950
If nothing else, hopefully,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.850
the bubbles will just rise
to the surface here,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.150
and you won't see
them on the the top

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.600
of the Diamond Play itself.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:56.040
[Music]

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.860
At this point,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.140
all of our filament
has been melted down nicely,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.906
and we're ready to start
pouring that in.

00:05:00.906 --> 00:05:02.060
But before we do,

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.191
I think we're actually going
to take a little piece of paper towel,

00:05:04.191 --> 00:05:05.235
and try and apply sort

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.750
of a print coat by almost
using these as a paintbrush.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.520
Just coat the bottom of this.

00:05:09.528 --> 00:05:12.350
I'm hoping that'll give
us a nice smooth layer,

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.362
and maybe a few less bubbles.

00:05:14.362 --> 00:05:18.220
[Music]

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.640
This smells like really
badly burnt coffee.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.280
Okay, we've got
that layer in there,

00:05:25.285 --> 00:05:27.749
and that's already pretty much
cooling down quite a bit.

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:30.100
But we're just going to reheat
what's in the pan

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.750
for a minute just to make sure
it's all nice and even,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.750
and we'll pour that in,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.279
and that won't be
enough to fill this,

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.340
that should only be enough
for probably half of it,

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:38.500
and we've got another batch
that will do.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.100
If Starbucks went on revolt,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.800
this is what it
would smell like.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.596
So you think maybe people
with 3D printing filament

00:05:48.596 --> 00:05:50.180
should just put it
in a 3D printer?

00:05:50.180 --> 00:06:03.360
[Music]

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.420
Don't do this
to your copper pans, kids.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:19.060
[Music]

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.080
This is a 3D printer provided
to us by MatterHackers.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.720
They're the ones
who also provided the filament

00:06:23.724 --> 00:06:26.124
that we're using to make
our plastic play button,

00:06:26.124 --> 00:06:27.550
and this is
a really cool machine.

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:28.327
And guess what?

00:06:28.327 --> 00:06:30.400
We are actually giving
one of these away.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.880
Now, this one is the Lulzbot,

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.640
and my favorite part
is probably the fact

00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:37.702
that a lot of this
is actually 3D printed itself.

00:06:37.702 --> 00:06:40.328
This piece was made by one
of these machines.

00:06:40.328 --> 00:06:41.760
It's the coolest.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.415
Like it does have metal parts,
but it has a lot of...

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.520
Like all the bright
green stuff, 3D printed.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.500
You can see a lot
of this housing,

00:06:48.505 --> 00:06:51.062
like you can see some
of the print lines 3D printed.

00:06:51.062 --> 00:06:53.099
Just goes to show you
how well this works.

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:55.154
Normally, these machines
are about 2,500 bucks,

00:06:55.154 --> 00:06:56.604
but you can win one for free.

00:06:56.604 --> 00:06:58.185
To do so, you need
to be a subscriber,

00:06:58.185 --> 00:07:00.536
and enter the contest using
the link in the description.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.100
Grant has been playing around
with some 3D modeling software,

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.100
and you can see some

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.950
of the things he's already
printed off here.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:07.163
We've got giant Lego piece.

00:07:07.163 --> 00:07:08.218
We've got working gears.

00:07:08.218 --> 00:07:10.413
We've got giant cookie cutter,
or for a sandwich,

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.520
if you want to turn your
sandwich into puzzle pieces.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.273
A ninja star, a Transformer.

00:07:14.273 --> 00:07:16.450
This is the the
little nickel shooter,

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.381
we made out of cards before.

00:07:18.381 --> 00:07:20.450
This one's just
all 3D printed,

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.780
including the coins in it.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.900
All right guys,

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.340
so we've already showed you
what happens when you melt

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.950
3D printing filament.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.260
Now, we're actually going to
show you what it's really for.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:49.340
[Music]

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.914
I think we're ready
to demold this thing.

00:07:50.914 --> 00:07:51.889
We've now poured in...

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:54.002
I think we had to do
three layers just to get enough,

00:07:54.002 --> 00:07:55.796
and it would like go
in all bubbly and full,

00:07:55.796 --> 00:07:58.050
and then as it cooled down,
it would drop a little bit.

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.216
I would say this is probably
not the smartest way to do this.

00:08:01.216 --> 00:08:01.850
We use what?

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:03.241
A spool and a half.

00:08:03.241 --> 00:08:03.840
Probably.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.580
Several pounds of filament.
&gt;&gt; Of filament.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.900
Now, this is
actually fascinating.

00:08:07.906 --> 00:08:09.683
It kind of does
what brownies do it.

00:08:09.683 --> 00:08:12.437
It pulled away from the edges
of the silicone mold so...

00:08:12.437 --> 00:08:13.713
A lot of things you can cast

00:08:13.713 --> 00:08:15.613
with will shrink
a little bit as using.

00:08:15.613 --> 00:08:16.663
This is no different.

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:18.749
Normally, this filament
isn't used this way,

00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:21.349
and I think if you don't have
it full of air bubbles,

00:08:21.349 --> 00:08:23.150
and just boiling
on a pan on the stove,

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.750
you're not really
going to run into this.

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.880
I've never seen anything
3D printed shrink,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.920
but this method definitely
shrunk down a little bit.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.960
But that should at least
make it easy to demold.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.611
This is like
the easiest demolding

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:35.120
of anything I've ever demolded.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.900
Ready?

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.680
Yeah.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.212
That turned better
than I thought.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.212
It turned out pretty nice.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.080
It's so much...

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.703
It's actually...

00:08:46.703 --> 00:08:48.475
So much 3D printing plastic.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.380
That is...

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.360
That's a tough sucker.

00:08:50.366 --> 00:08:53.245
Also, it's a lot lighter
than I thought it would be.

00:08:53.245 --> 00:08:54.071
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.180
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.020
I'm curious.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:56.720
Let's weight this.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:57.480
A lot of bubbles.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.280
We're at 2.6 net.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:08.220
So basically 2.7 pounds,
or 1,225 grams.

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.100
I do want to trim this off
ao the back is nicer.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.520
I want to light it up.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.640
By that you mean,
making it glow in the dark,

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.940
not like lighting
it on fire, right?

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:17.140
Dang it.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:21.780
[Music]

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.360
Yeah.

00:09:24.223 --> 00:09:27.069
That is a glowing
Diamond Play Button.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.900
So something that I'm noticing
here is the glow does not last

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:31.782
nearly as long,

00:09:31.782 --> 00:09:35.065
and is he's not nearly as bright
as the filament is normally.

00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:35.948
I think that's true.

00:09:35.948 --> 00:09:37.120
I think after being

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.440
cooked the way we did,
something has changed,

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.532
and it doesn't glow
quite as well.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.040
Yeah.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:43.160
&gt;&gt; It just so glow.
&gt;&gt; I think it's true.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.980
So when I take this off,
it's glowing pretty bright-ish.

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:49.040
But it fades super fast.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.326
Now, let's try
the actual filament itself.

00:09:51.326 --> 00:09:53.032
Let's do like a side-by-side.

00:09:53.512 --> 00:09:55.616
Okay, yeah, even
the color is different.

00:09:55.616 --> 00:09:58.250
You can see that this
almost has a green glow,

00:09:58.250 --> 00:09:59.150
and this one,

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.260
this yellow glow
is almost out.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:04.960
Wildly different,
but it definitely--

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.440
I do think the filament
still has more glow.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.740
Is that show--
No, that's...

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.460
Yeah, I think that's showing up
on camera pretty well.

00:10:09.473 --> 00:10:09.680
Yeah.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.092
I think the filament
charges faster,

00:10:11.092 --> 00:10:13.512
and stays glowing little bit
longer, but it is still glowing,

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:14.450
and that's still neat.

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:15.250
Very cool.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.158
What do you think we
should do with our 3D

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.452
print filament button?

00:10:18.452 --> 00:10:21.050
It's not 3D printed,
but it is 3D printer filament.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.968
Let's drop it off of something.

00:10:22.968 --> 00:10:25.022
I wonder if it's
like bulletproof.

00:10:25.022 --> 00:10:28.211
There are many things we
can maybe do with the slightly

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:30.750
rubbery 3D print filament
Diamond Play Button.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.412
What do you guys
think we should do?

00:10:32.412 --> 00:10:33.912
That's actually kind of funny.

00:10:33.912 --> 00:10:35.200
It's like purple...

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.280
Green.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.260
Once again, thanks to MatterHackers
for providing the filament.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.960
Check the links
in description for the contest

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:45.000
where we are giving
away Lulzbot 3D printer.

00:10:45.006 --> 00:10:46.481
It's worth 2,500 bucks.

00:10:46.481 --> 00:10:47.892
It's so cool you guys.

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:50.060
Guys, that's it for today,
but the fun doesn't end.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:51.100
We've always got more

you directly to our last video,

00:10:53.374 --> 00:10:54.366
you should go check that out.

00:10:54.366 --> 00:10:55.507
The other box
is going to show you

00:10:55.507 --> 00:10:57.165
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next,

00:10:57.165 --> 00:10:59.119
and this bomb the middle
will subscribe to the channel,

00:10:59.119 --> 00:11:00.279
so you never miss
out on the fun.

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:01.512
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.460
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.380
Talk to you then.
