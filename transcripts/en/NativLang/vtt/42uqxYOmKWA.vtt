Two weeks ago. You and I voted. Wait, you didn't feel my cursor right there.

2
00:00:04.721 --> 00:00:08.980
Next two years. Well, the winter is better than

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.490
[inaudible] could keep them separated.

4
00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.950
This was tricky.

5
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.450
65% of click voters want two separate channels. Well,

6
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.290
80% of commoners want just one. That's common.

7
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.160
Ters ters not commoners.

8
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.000
After re scrutinizing those youtube notes in chatting with poop comes about your

9
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.060
collective happiness, my personal creative pursuits.

10
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.440
We'll have to move off to new channel opening November 7th look for a video

11
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:45.550
invitation then, but enough distractions next Friday.

12
00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:47.340
We're back to language with that.

13
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.550
Excuse me, something in my throat there.

14
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.130
So subscribe if you haven't and send it any good fan art that might fit this

15
00:00:57.131 --> 00:00:58.030
picture frame here.
