00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.390
Before going into how single tape
machines can simulate multi-tape ones,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.760
I want to warm up with a very simple
example to illustrate what we mean

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.860
when I say that one machine
can simulate another.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.420
So let's consider what I'll
call stay-put machines.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.690
These have the capability of not moving
their heads in a computation step.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.380
Which turing machines as we defined
them are not allowed to do.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.610
So the transition function
now includes a S for

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.750
the direction,
which makes the head stay put.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.280
Now this doesn't add any computational
capability to the machine.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.810
Because I can accomplish the same
things with a normal turing machine.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.400
For every transition where the head
stays put, we can introduce a new state.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.220
And just have the head move
one step to the right.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.240
And then one step back to the left.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.610
Gamma here means to match
everything in the tape alphabet.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.600
And this puts the had back
in the spot it started in,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.740
without affecting the tape's contents.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.990
Except for occasionally taking
an extra movement step.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.350
This turning machine will operate in
the same way as the stay put machine.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.200
More precisely, we say that two machines
are equivalent if they accept the same

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.990
inputs, reject the same inputs and
loop on the same inputs.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.790
If we consider the tape to be part of
the output equivalent machines also

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.570
need to halt with
the same tape contents.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.750
Note that other properties
of the machine such as,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.240
the number of states,
the tape alphabet, or

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.560
the number of steps in any given
computation do not need to be the same.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.780
Just the relationship between the input
and the output needs to be the same.
