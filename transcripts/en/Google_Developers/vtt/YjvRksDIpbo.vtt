[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.917
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:11.750
HEATHER CASSANO: Hi.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.790
Can you all hear me?

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.520
OK.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.750
All right.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.490
So before I start,
I just want to do

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.410
a quick survey of the room
to find out how many of you

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.950
are designers, UX people?

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.000
Anybody?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.580
Oh, good.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.080
Oh, good.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.237
I see some hands.

00:00:26.237 --> 00:00:28.320
And I think I know this,
because I saw the coding.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.840
But how many of
you are engineers?

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.440
OK.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.170
Lots of women.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.729
Yay.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:35.770
And then, other things.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.100
Curious as to what they are.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.470
Can you guys throw it out there?

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.770
What else?

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.500
AUDIENCE: Product management.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.250
HEATHER CASSANO:
Product management.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.165
AUDIENCE: Project management.

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:45.557
Data science.

00:00:45.557 --> 00:00:46.890
HEATHER CASSANO: Say that again.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.525
AUDIENCE: Data science.

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:47.850
HEATHER CASSANO: Data science.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:48.975
AUDIENCE: All of the above.

00:00:48.975 --> 00:00:51.340
HEATHER CASSANO:
All of the above.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.840
Awesome.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.525
OK, great.

00:00:52.525 --> 00:00:53.360
Well, welcome.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.410
I'm so excited to be
talking to you all.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.710
This is a special presentation
for me for two reasons.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.020
One is I'm very used to
getting up and talking

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.390
about user experience design.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.209
It's my passion.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:05.550
It's my career and my field.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.552
I'm not going to talk
much about it today.

00:01:07.552 --> 00:01:09.010
But I do want to
say the books that

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.806
are on your seats are basically
the most fabulous user

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.430
experience method
that I think we have,

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.971
which would be-- at Google, we
call it Google Design Sprints.

00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:21.250
Very similar to the lighting
method that I'm used to using.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.870
And they're not
even released yet.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.221
So you guys are getting them
before they hit the press,

00:01:25.221 --> 00:01:26.220
which will be next week.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.810
So read them and enjoy.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.030
Secondly, some of my
family is back here.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.078
They actually came
here to support me.

00:01:37.078 --> 00:01:39.516
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.140
And they told me not
to point them out,

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.681
so now they're going
to be mad at me.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.960
And I also want to
say, I love being

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.260
surrounded by women in tech.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.970
We don't have enough of them.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.159
We need more, so I'm
so excited to see you.

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.450
My husband and I were just
standing back there a little

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.210
while ago and he said,
this is so weird.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.980
I'm like the only guy here.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.680
And I was like,
welcome to my world.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.490
So I'm really excited
to have you all here.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.990
OK.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.470
So today, what I'm going
to talk about-- and again,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.310
I've never really done
a presentation before

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.880
about me and my career.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.830
So bear with me, first time.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.710
I'm going to talk about
something, which I'm calling

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.280
white elephant opportunities.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.390
So I was trying
to think of a way

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.780
to describe a little
bit of the path

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.750
that I've taken in my career--
for good and for bad--

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.910
and hope that it might help you.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.600
So how many of you have heard
of white elephant parties?

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.210
Some of you.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.710
Oh, good.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.419
OK, a good chunk.

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:36.793
Because I've been
asking all week

00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:38.300
with my team and
people are like,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.383
I don't know what that is.

00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:41.150
I'm like, uh-oh.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.290
So a white elephant party,
in case you don't know,

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.664
is a party where
you get invited.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.200
You bring a gift,
and then there's

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.570
like-- it's also called a Yankee
swap for those New Englanders

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.340
in the room.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.030
And there's usually kind of
a gift that nobody wants,

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.520
or some gifts that nobody wants.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.310
And then it's a game where
you kind of like-- you can

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.700
trade the gifts and you barter.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.074
And you try to
get the good ones.

00:03:01.074 --> 00:03:04.724
And the ones that you don't
want are called white elephants.

00:03:04.724 --> 00:03:06.390
In preparation for
this talk, I actually

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:07.889
looked up, where
did that come from?

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:12.090
And it came from the King
of Thailand, back many,

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.840
many centuries ago, used to give
white elephants to the people

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.430
that he did not like.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.380
And the reason that he did
was because they were sacred.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.750
It was a religious symbol.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.420
And so they were very
valuable in a way,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.440
but they were not
allowed to do any work.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.851
So when you received
a white elephant,

00:03:29.851 --> 00:03:31.850
you had to care for it
for the rest of its life,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.400
but it couldn't do
anything for you.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.710
So that's where it came from.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.680
So anyways, I thought I
would use that as an analogy

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.670
to opportunities that come
along that are kind of unique.

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.750
And that maybe you
should not resist.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.750
So I'm going to talk a
little bit about that.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.830
So what is a white
elephant opportunity?

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.120
So for me, it's an
opportunity that

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.630
presents itself to you that
might not be obvious to you.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.770
It might be something
that scares you.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:00.930
That you feel like, I
would never do that.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.790
I can't do that.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.000
That's like way too much for me.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.340
It's something that in
addition to those things

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.910
will attract you for some
maybe mysterious reason.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:09.760
Like, huh.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.900
But it seems kind of cool.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.520
I wish I was one of
those people that

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.650
could do that kind of thing.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.019
And you may fail at a
white elephant opportunity.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.529
And that's actually
a good thing.

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.920
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about how some of those

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.290
came for me.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.230
So some of you may have
seen this drawing before.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.539
So this is kind of what
people think about when

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:32.580
they think about success.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.330
And you may have in
your heads right now--

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.470
and I know I did
many years back,

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.920
and even today-- you have
this kind of line in your head

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:41.295
like, I'm going to do this,
and then this, and then this,

00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:43.040
and then I'm going
to be successful.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.530
Yay.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.450
That's not how it works.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.330
So success really, first
of all, is something

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.010
that you personally define.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.960
It's something that
is very unique to you.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.820
And it's going to only work when
you feel that it works for you.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.750
And it's something that
you find on your own.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.140
Secondly, being successful is
about choosing the right path

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.080
and the right journey.

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.520
And the path of success
usually does look a little bit

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.720
like the squiggly line.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.179
It's funny because
in design-- this

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:13.428
is the same thing with design.

00:05:13.428 --> 00:05:14.867
To get to a good
design, you need

00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:16.450
to go through this
crazy process where

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.660
you might end up
in places you never

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.210
thought you were going to.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.690
And a lot of those
places might actually

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.654
be failures in the
traditional sense,

00:05:24.654 --> 00:05:26.070
but they actually
move you forward

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.184
to get to a successful
design and product.

00:05:30.184 --> 00:05:32.100
OK, so I'm going to talk
a little bit about me

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:36.110
and kind of how I followed my
white elephant opportunities

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.349
over the course of my career.

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:38.640
So this is me when I was a kid.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.890
I'm the one in the very
interesting-looking dress.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:46.550
I was the oldest of four kids
raised in southern California.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:52.920
And my family was very Catholic
and fairly conservative.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.230
And I had my first kind of
white elephant opportunity

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.800
when it comes to
my career happened

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.260
the summer after eighth grade.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.720
So I was 13 years old.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.200
It was around the
time of this picture.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.992
And I went to Catholic
elementary school

00:06:06.992 --> 00:06:08.200
and it ended in eighth grade.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.230
It was K through 8.

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.350
And it was run by nuns.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.410
And my friends and I, we
did not like the nuns.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.940
And especially, we did
not like our principal.

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.340
And so we made a vow that
the day after we graduated,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.590
we were going to do something.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.265
And we were going to make
the world a better place

00:06:24.265 --> 00:06:26.260
and fix all of the problems.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.000
So we came up with this plan.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.830
And it was actually
the night after we

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.040
graduated, we all
snuck out of our houses

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.090
and went to the school.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.410
And we TPed the school.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.180
Meaning that we
threw toilet paper

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.790
rolls all over the
trees and the buildings.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:43.850
And the school also happened to
be a church, which-- because it

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:44.930
was Catholic.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.880
It also happened to
have a rectory, which

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.829
is where the priest slept.

00:06:48.829 --> 00:06:50.870
And somehow, while we were
throwing toilet paper,

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.890
somebody heard us and ran out.

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:55.520
And we saw them and we ran away.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.100
And nobody else could be
identified in the dark

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.500
except for me
because of my hair.

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.622
So I got home.

00:07:03.622 --> 00:07:04.830
And I snuck back in my house.

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.230
And I didn't know what
was going to happen.

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.960
And it was dark.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.580
And I thought I was
like totally safe.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.590
And I went up to my
bed, which I had,

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.040
by the way, set up to look
like a sleeping person.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.130
And I opened the
door to my bedroom

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.360
and there was my mother
sitting on the bed.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.030
And to this day,
she tells me God

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.109
told her that she had to
come up and check on me.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:24.150
So anyways, I was caught.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.880
So the end of the story,
which is the important part,

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.632
is I was grounded for the
entire summer that summer.

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:32.090
And I couldn't leave the house
except for a 10-minute walk.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.612
And I couldn't watch TV.

00:07:33.612 --> 00:07:34.820
And I couldn't use the phone.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.820
So I was just bored
out of my mind.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.550
And my dad was actually
a computer programmer.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.400
I think I have a picture of him.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.230
There he is.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.000
So my dad was a programmer.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.950
And he was brilliant.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:51.570
And he knew how to build
computers and program them.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:54.070
And all over the house, we had
these just parts of computers

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.340
and whole computers.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.510
And that was back in the
day when you could just

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.910
build a computer pretty easily.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.950
So that summer, I
learned about computers.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:05.185
And by the end of the
summer, I could build them.

00:08:05.185 --> 00:08:06.060
I could replace them.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.830
I could fix them.

00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:08.610
I had motherboards
all over my bedroom.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.790
To this day, I still
have my little kit

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.370
with all my different
kinds of screws

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:14.630
because it reminds me of my dad.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.784
But I learned all of that.

00:08:15.784 --> 00:08:17.200
And I also learned
how to program.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.860
So by the end of the
summer, I had written two

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.735
really cool programs.

00:08:19.735 --> 00:08:21.960
One was called
Eliza, which was one

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.530
of the very first sort of
ways to model natural language

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:26.330
processing.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.060
So it was this program that
you'd say like, how are you?

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.570
And it would go, how do you
feel about that question?

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.409
So I wrote one of those.

00:08:34.409 --> 00:08:36.360
And I also wrote a game
called Sneaky Snake.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.250
And it was awesome.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.809
So that was kind of
this unexpected thing.

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.510
And I'd never been interested
in it before that time.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:44.860
So that's my first
white elephant.

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.290
This is me and my dad
when I was in college.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.260
And the next kind of white
elephant came along in college.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:53.920
So I decided to pursue
electrical engineering.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.194
Anyone in here electrical
engineering majors?

00:08:56.194 --> 00:08:56.860
Oh, some of you.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:57.810
Great.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.120
Awesome.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.990
I was lucky enough
to get a scholarship

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.130
to go to a really fabulous
school called Tufts University.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.570
And they have a
school of engineering.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:12.030
I was the only female
in my entire class.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:15.360
And I started taking
electrical engineering.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.950
And a couple things
happened there

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.170
that really kind of formed
my next white elephant

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.210
opportunity, that some
of them were pure luck.

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:28.960
For one thing, I did not
like electrical engineering.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.470
And I didn't like the people
that were doing it, either.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.820
There was all these guys
and they had these groups.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.160
And they didn't want to
invite me into their groups.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.470
And you know, they were sitting
around these [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.050
Anyways.

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.160
I was just like, I don't
think this is for me.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.290
What do I do?

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:49.130
Secondly, Tufts had a new major
then called engineering design.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.481
And so that was interesting.

00:09:50.481 --> 00:09:52.230
And it was part of the
engineering school.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.620
So I started taking
some classes in that.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.980
And I thought it was so cool.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.690
And then, third.

00:09:57.690 --> 00:09:59.580
Tufts required that
every engineering student

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:02.960
took a class called Intro
to Engineering Design 101.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.590
So I took that.

00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:04.885
It was a big class.

00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:08.170
It was like 100 kids
in it, students.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.235
And they assigned
us a design problem.

00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:11.610
It was kind of
our main challenge

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:15.130
for the semester, which
was design an oil change

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.490
kit for a car.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.230
So I don't know
anything about oil.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.160
I've never changed
a tire or oil.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.250
I'm not into that stuff.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.770
Don't like getting
my hands dirty.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:27.765
But I thought, you know,
I'm going to rock this one.

00:10:27.765 --> 00:10:28.640
I'm going to kill it.

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.014
And I was in Boston at Tufts.

00:10:31.014 --> 00:10:32.180
My family was in California.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.388
I didn't have any money to
fly home for Thanksgiving.

00:10:34.388 --> 00:10:37.750
So I found myself alone
on campus for a whole week

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.460
and just walked around, and
crawled underneath cars,

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.290
and did all this research
on, how does this work?

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.072
Well, it turns out
there's this tank.

00:10:46.072 --> 00:10:48.363
There's a little screw on
the bottom and you unscrew it

00:10:48.363 --> 00:10:50.925
and the oil comes out, and then
you pour it back in the top.

00:10:50.925 --> 00:10:52.450
It's pretty simple.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:55.510
So what happened was most
of the students I knew,

00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.800
they came up with a design
that was like, here's a bin.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.300
And there's some
stuff like a funnel

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.060
and some gloves
and things in it.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.640
And we just put
Saran wrap around it

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.520
and here was my design.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.990
So I came up with
a design that was

00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:08.400
like-- do you know
those Pringles

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.190
cans with the little pop up?

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.480
So I thought, well,
those are really cool.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.270
So what if you shrunk one down
to this little size like this

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.240
and you put in it a big plastic
bag that could kind of compress

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.820
down that didn't melt?

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:24.154
And I researched
all the materials.

00:11:24.154 --> 00:11:26.320
And you turned it upside
down and you could actually

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.455
screw it on to the oil tank.

00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:30.080
Then when you wanted
to change the oil,

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.080
it would be super easy.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:33.619
You could just pop the thing
off and the bag would fall down

00:11:33.619 --> 00:11:34.910
and all the oil would go in it.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.230
And you'd just throw it out
and put your new one on.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.750
So I came up with this
design and I presented it.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.221
And my professors just said,
oh my god, I have never

00:11:42.221 --> 00:11:43.220
seen anything like that.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.470
That was awesome.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.010
And I thought, maybe
I'm a designer.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:53.411
So that was really one of
my big white elephants.

00:11:53.411 --> 00:11:53.910
OK.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.660
So this story-- this is
actually a dialog box.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:02.660
It's really old and
it looks really awful.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:07.310
So the next thing I
did after college was I

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:08.970
worked for this
company called CLSI.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:11.157
It was a library
systems company.

00:12:11.157 --> 00:12:12.740
And I really wanted
to be an engineer,

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:15.670
but I couldn't get a job yet
as one, even though I knew how

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:16.334
to program.

00:12:16.334 --> 00:12:18.500
So I got a job as a customer
support representative.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.396
So I was answering the calls.

00:12:20.396 --> 00:12:22.270
And people would call
in with their problems.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:23.090
It was really hard.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:24.480
And a great job, by the way.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:27.300
I loved it because you find out
so much about what's going on.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.040
So one day, a
librarian called in

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.310
and she said to me--
she was actually crying.

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:36.510
And it took me a while to figure
out what the heck is going on.

00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.300
And then eventually,
she told me that she

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.799
was crying because she had an
error message up on her screen

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:41.938
that said a child has died.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:47.660
So for those of you that might
not know what that means,

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.580
our product was written in Unix.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.040
And in Unix, the way it
works is-- you guys all know.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:53.790
You're all coders.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.730
So you create a process
and it's basically

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:59.160
a child process has terminated.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.850
So I knew what that meant
and I knew what that was.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.080
But that really got me
going after that call.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:07.550
And I thought, I'm
really interested in why.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:11.730
Why would we put this
message up to our users?

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:13.669
And in the meantime,
I had been spending

00:13:13.669 --> 00:13:15.460
a lot of time upstairs
with the programmers

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.370
because I really wanted
to be a programmer.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.860
And I was this very
strange person to them

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:23.920
because it was like this little
blonde girl from California.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.530
But I realized
that they actually

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.170
had an opening for somebody
to do front end development.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:32.021
And nobody there wanted to do
that because that wasn't cool.

00:13:32.021 --> 00:13:34.270
That's not the cool kind of
engineering, or it wasn't.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:35.770
By the way, that's
completely a myth

00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.510
because front end
engineering rocks.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.000
It's awesome.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.300
Anyway, so I came up
with this before-- I

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:44.810
wanted to become this thing.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:48.180
So I came up with a whole set
of user interface guidelines.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.000
And also patterns, what
we call today patterns

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.140
about how we should
be presenting

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:54.440
user interface to our users.

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.190
And how we should be
talking to our users.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.840
And people were so
excited about that

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.215
that they actually allowed me
to move upstairs and become

00:14:00.215 --> 00:14:00.800
an engineer.

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.573
And I was the only woman
engineer at that time there,

00:14:03.573 --> 00:14:04.300
too.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:08.820
So that was my first
kind of real awesome job.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.530
So that was my second
white elephant opportunity.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:14.660
Then after that,
I ended up working

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:16.580
at a number of amazing
tech companies.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:21.490
So I worked for Symantec,
and then I went to Google.

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.480
So I actually worked at
Google about 10 years ago.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.425
And that's when I had sort
of my next white elephant

00:14:27.425 --> 00:14:29.800
opportunity, which you might
think was working at Google,

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.870
but it wasn't.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.690
So back then,
about 10 years ago,

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.300
Google was a fabulous company
to work for, as it is today.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.067
And it was already everybody
knew how wonderful it was.

00:14:41.067 --> 00:14:43.400
People would come up to me
and say, oh, you're so lucky.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.800
The problem was Google at
that time didn't really

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.980
care that much about design.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.370
It wasn't really a thing.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.140
I would say the
analogy would be it

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:52.910
was kind of like
having a strange hobby

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.559
that you do at night.

00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:56.600
So people would be like,
oh, that's kind of cool.

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.410
But you know, let's
get back to work now.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.280
So I found it
really challenging.

00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.680
And I felt a little
bit like, I can't.

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:05.860
I don't know how I'm
going to grow here.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.910
And then along came
another opportunity,

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.100
which was another
white elephant for me.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.970
And it was at Yahoo.

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:13.470
And it was this huge role.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.350
It was leading this
very large team of UX.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.030
It was a user experience role.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.750
It was taking a whole slew
of disparate products,

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:23.329
bringing them all together
into one platform,

00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:24.870
redesigning the
whole thing, thinking

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.550
about a whole myriad
of different users.

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.930
It was big and it was hard.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.540
And I initially was
like, I don't even

00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.490
think I can interview
for this thing.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:37.420
But I did.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.410
And I ended up getting
an offer and I took it.

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.342
So this was another one of
those times where part of me

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:44.050
was saying, this is
way too much for you.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.466
And you work at
this amazing place

00:15:45.466 --> 00:15:48.370
and there's amazing food
and people and ideas.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.970
What are you doing?

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:50.760
But I did.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.720
I jumped on it and I took it.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.840
And actually, that job turned
into one of the best things

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.990
that I've ever
done in my career.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:00.400
I met so many amazing people.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.430
We assembled this team, this
user experience team, of I

00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:08.330
think about 80 to 90 people.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.280
And we really rocked it.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.790
We redesigned everything.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.080
We came up with a
fabulous new platform.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.700
It was great.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:18.760
So again, something to jump on
that you might not think about

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.310
or you also might think I can't.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.800
So, sorry, the picture
I just showed you

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.470
was me coming back
to Google today.

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:29.444
But I thought, wearing
my Noogler hat.

00:16:29.444 --> 00:16:31.110
You guys all know
about Nooglers, right?

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.860
You have to wear a hat with
this little thing on the top.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.160
After Yahoo, I ended up
moving for personal reasons

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.880
with my family to New York.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.012
So when that happened--
and sometimes,

00:16:43.012 --> 00:16:44.970
things happen where you're
in this great place,

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.550
but then something happens
out of your control.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.450
We moved to New York.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.840
And we live in a town right
near where my husband grew up

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.050
and it's fabulous.

00:16:53.050 --> 00:16:54.677
But Yahoo doesn't
really do that.

00:16:54.677 --> 00:16:56.260
They have a little
office in New York.

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.960
And it was kind of a
career-limiting move

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.460
to do that.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.725
And I knew it when I did it.

00:16:59.725 --> 00:17:00.600
So I started looking.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.360
What else am I going to do?

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.734
What's my next
thing going to be?

00:17:02.734 --> 00:17:05.069
And again, this
opportunity sort of

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:09.589
arose that really scared me,
which was chief experience

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:12.310
officer for Pearson Education.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.210
So this is a C-level position,
a company with 40,000 employees.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:21.240
A company that was very
traditional and very siloed.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.380
And kind of in the
publishing world.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.930
And they were, for
the very first time,

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.020
creating a role that would
bring people together

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.322
across the company and
bring all of the UXers

00:17:31.322 --> 00:17:32.280
that they had together.

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.470
And also, build out more and
create a centralized team

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:36.870
across the company.

00:17:36.870 --> 00:17:39.530
Again, this was a role
that I initially thought,

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:40.780
there is just no way.

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.065
First of all, yay, it's cool.

00:17:42.065 --> 00:17:46.370
This is really great to have
a C-level position for a user

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:48.270
experience designer.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.430
But I don't think I can do it.

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.000
But I was convinced by the
person that had told me

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.160
about it to interview.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.570
And I showed up at the
interview and it was actually

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:58.960
the strangest and
scariest interview process

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.852
I've ever been to because it was
like being on a reality show.

00:18:02.852 --> 00:18:04.310
And all of the
people interviewing,

00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:05.930
we were all together in a room.

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:08.820
And then each time we'd
show up for the next round,

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:09.855
there'd be less of us.

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:14.390
Somehow, I got through it.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.610
Somehow, I got the job.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.760
And so I took the job.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.280
I worked there for four years.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.592
This is my leadership team.

00:18:22.592 --> 00:18:24.550
So these are all the
folks that reported to me.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:28.530
We had over 100 UXers.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:30.940
And we built out
an amazing team.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.810
And actually, I learned
so much, maybe even more

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:35.880
than I learned at Yahoo,
because I was in a place

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.440
where culturally
UX was not a thing.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.220
Users were not that important.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:46.450
Silos, and budgets, and P&amp;Ls,
and sort of people's scope

00:18:46.450 --> 00:18:48.190
of work was what
people focused on.

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.700
And I had to change that.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.270
And actually, the way I did it
was by using the design sprint

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:56.520
method, with starting to do
these collaborative sprints

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.170
with collaborative
groups of people

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:02.190
from different silos that might
never have known each other

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:03.980
and put the user
front and center.

00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.029
So we would bring students in.

00:19:06.029 --> 00:19:07.820
And we would actually
come up with designs.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:09.880
And we would test them
together, and then we

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.870
would iterate together.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.572
And there is just no better
way to, a, learn about design.

00:19:13.572 --> 00:19:15.280
But b, sort of bring
these teams together

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.900
and start realizing, oh,
that's why we're here.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:20.330
We're here because of
this four-year-old kid

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:21.470
that can't read yet.

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:24.220
And we're trying to teach
them, that's why we're here.

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.770
And that's what our
products are for.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:29.230
So it was a really amazing role.

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:34.320
And so that was, again, one of
my other white opportunities.

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:35.740
When the role
ended-- and it did.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.910
And that was because
of a shift in a new CEO

00:19:37.910 --> 00:19:39.130
and a new shift in focus.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.410
And sometimes, what
happens is companies

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:43.632
decentralize and centralize
and decentralize.

00:19:43.632 --> 00:19:44.590
You may have seen that.

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:46.910
So that's what happened.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.820
I was presented with yet
another opportunity, which

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.860
was to come back to
Google, which I initially

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.400
thought-- I wasn't sure about.

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.750
But what had
happened in the years

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:59.640
before that is that Larry Page
had decided finally that design

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.210
was paramount to success.

00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.430
And Google was doing
these amazing things.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:06.590
Material design, if
you've heard of it,

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:10.274
is a fabulous new design
language that Google created.

00:20:10.274 --> 00:20:11.940
Design sprints were
being used, finally,

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.407
which was so gratifying to me.

00:20:13.407 --> 00:20:15.240
Because when I was at
Google the first time,

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.937
I was like design sprints.

00:20:16.937 --> 00:20:17.520
Let's do them.

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.065
Let's do them.

00:20:18.065 --> 00:20:19.565
And everyone was
like, what is that?

00:20:19.565 --> 00:20:20.770
So now we do them.

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:22.640
And we do them all the time.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.420
Anyways, that all
brought me back

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.900
to being here at Google again.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.600
And it's been just
truly amazing.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:30.600
I've been here a
little over a year.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.860
OK, now I'm going to talk
about my most important

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.580
white elephant opportunity.

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.220
So I have five children.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.600
Four of them are back here,
along with my daughter's

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.270
friend.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.300
My oldest is in college.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:48.710
He's studying wildlife
and conservation.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:52.000
And I never planned--
the back story here

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.620
is that I had never planned
to have kids, period.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.620
When I was growing up--
and I don't know if I've

00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:01.195
told my kids this before.

00:21:01.195 --> 00:21:04.440
When I was growing
up, I was like, nope.

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:04.940
No kids.

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:05.660
No babysitting.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.380
No, no, no, no.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:11.625
So when I got married, my
husband was like, yeah,

00:21:11.625 --> 00:21:13.020
I think I want a couple kids.

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.228
And I was like, I don't know.

00:21:14.228 --> 00:21:15.402
I don't know about this.

00:21:15.402 --> 00:21:16.860
And then eventually,
we decide, OK.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.190
Maybe like one or maybe two.

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.950
And we have five.

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:25.320
So basically, this was a
white elephant opportunity.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.257
It was very scary.

00:21:26.257 --> 00:21:27.840
When I was pregnant
with my first one,

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.540
I thought, I don't
know if I can do this.

00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:31.331
I don't even know if
I'm going to like this

00:21:31.331 --> 00:21:33.110
or if I'm going
to be good at it.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:36.130
And then after
that, it turns out

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.040
that we're extremely fertile.

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.420
More than 99% of people.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.698
And we ended up with five.

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:47.280
But I have to say that
actually having five kids

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:50.470
has been the best experience
of my entire life, as crazy

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.890
that may sound.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.780
It's actually really
helped me in my career.

00:21:53.780 --> 00:21:54.810
It's grounded me.

00:21:54.810 --> 00:21:57.360
When I worked at
Pearson, I've always

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.060
had a passion for education,
partially because I have kids

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:02.580
and I really care
about them learning.

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:04.830
And the way that they learn
is really important to me.

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.290
I was able to bring them into
my work for the first time.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.770
And I actually brought
them in and used them

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:13.930
as subjects in user
experience testing.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:16.927
But it's been really just
such a wonderful thing for me.

00:22:16.927 --> 00:22:18.760
And obviously, it's the
most important thing

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.870
that I do as a mom.

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:23.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:24.370
Thank you.

00:22:27.141 --> 00:22:27.640
OK.

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.720
So I'm going to recap.

00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.877
So white elephant
opportunity, just so

00:22:30.877 --> 00:22:32.960
you can start thinking
about these for yourselves.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.060
So first of all, it's an
opportunity that may arise.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.740
It's not necessarily obvious.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.322
So you need to look for them.

00:22:39.322 --> 00:22:40.780
And it's going to
be unique to you.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.860
It's not going to be
something that everyone's

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.260
going to jump on.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:46.482
It may not align with your
perception of success.

00:22:46.482 --> 00:22:48.190
So you might have this
line in your mind,

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:49.940
like I'm going to do
this, this, and this.

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:50.780
It may not be that.

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.470
It may be something wacky
that's kind of out there.

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:54.560
It may scare you.

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.381
And your initial response
may be, I couldn't do that.

00:22:57.381 --> 00:22:58.380
I just couldn't do that.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.530
There's like these other
people over here that

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.200
maybe could do it, but not me.

00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.490
Don't think that way.

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:04.820
So take a risk.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.970
And sometimes, they might fail.

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:08.470
I've had plenty of those, too.

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.970
And I didn't really talk
too much about them.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.050
But sometimes you jump on
something and it fails.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:12.680
And that's OK.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.500
That's a learning
experience for you.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.950
And that will move you
along to your next one.

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:19.630
And then, one other thing about
white elephant opportunities

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:22.200
is one way to sort
of generate more

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.460
is to find them and give
them to other people.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.293
This is going to sound
a little bit strange,

00:23:26.293 --> 00:23:29.130
but it's something I think
that I'm pretty good at.

00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:31.120
And I didn't really
try to be good,

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.810
but I'm one of those
connector people

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.060
if you've read Malcolm
Gladwell's books.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:37.590
I'm always keeping
my eyes out for stuff

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.340
and then I'll say, oh,
that's really cool.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.160
And you over here
would be great at that.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.780
Bing.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.180
And sometimes, people
are like, go away.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:49.360
But sometimes they say,
I've never thought of that.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:50.920
And it's interesting
because I have

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.980
someone on my team, a woman
who I highly, highly respect.

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.960
She's the smartest person
I think I've ever met.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.324
I was talking to last
week about this talk

00:23:59.324 --> 00:24:00.490
and I mentioned this to her.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.962
And she said, oh, yeah.

00:24:01.962 --> 00:24:03.170
I know exactly what you mean.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.450
It's just like what
you did for me.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:07.500
And I was like, what
did I do for you?

00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:09.240
And she said, well,
you kept pushing

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.050
me to consider this thing.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:14.240
And the back story is
that she is actually

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:19.390
inventing an amazing new set
of research and guidelines

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.330
for Google that we've never
had before around ads.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:25.400
And it's all based on
massive user research

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.290
studies and all kinds
of things that I

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:28.480
don't even fully understand.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.689
And she's created this.

00:24:29.689 --> 00:24:31.480
But she was a little
bit resistant at first

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.780
with the same kinds of things.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.030
I don't know if I can do that.

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:35.426
Never thought about that before.

00:24:35.426 --> 00:24:37.800
But she really is the only
person here who could do that.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.210
So anyway, she saw
it that way and that

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.750
made me feel really good.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.220
But when you do that,
things come back to you.

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:46.257
She's doing something
really incredible now.

00:24:46.257 --> 00:24:47.840
There's all these
people that surround

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.440
that that I've never met and
now are part of my world.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.370
And they're creating new
opportunities for maybe myself,

00:24:53.370 --> 00:24:55.460
but my team members,
and also Google.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:58.450
So it really does
come back to you.

00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.930
So how do you find
these opportunities?

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:01.722
Know your passions.

00:25:01.722 --> 00:25:03.721
Know what you're passionate
about and follow it.

00:25:03.721 --> 00:25:04.670
Even if it's weird.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.777
Even if it's strange and
you think, I don't know.

00:25:07.777 --> 00:25:08.610
Follow those things.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.568
When you start getting
really interested, which

00:25:10.568 --> 00:25:13.560
for me is hard because I'm
interested in lots of things,

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.400
keep pursuing that.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.760
And then, say yes.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:19.550
So it's pretty simple, say yes.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:20.210
Try it.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.900
Do it.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:23.770
And don't hold yourself back.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:24.270
OK.

00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:27.020
So I want to kind of
just close a little bit

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.870
with telling you a
little about today.

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.750
So first of all, you have some
white elephant opportunities

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:34.520
in this room.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.650
You have a great opportunity
to meet some fabulous women,

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:40.890
and also to hear the panels
and the other speakers.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.280
We have some great
people coming.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.440
We have the panel about
creating opportunities

00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:48.230
in tech, which is I
believe right after this.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.690
And then we have the
Tech and Design Workshops

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:51.340
this afternoon.

00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.700
If you're interested in
those, the design side,

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:55.907
you'll hear more about
sprints, which is great.

00:25:55.907 --> 00:25:57.740
I don't know what the
tech people are doing,

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.810
but it will be
great, too, I'm sure.

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.940
And then in the
closing fireside chat,

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:05.880
it's Heather Rivera
and Minerva Tantoco,

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.930
who is the first CTO of
New York City and a woman.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.460
And she's coming to speak to us.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.460
So enjoy your day.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:13.600
Meet people.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.314
I'll be around.

00:26:14.314 --> 00:26:14.980
Come talk to me.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:16.380
Talk to my kids.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.211
Torture them.

00:26:18.211 --> 00:26:20.070
And thank you so
much for listening.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:22.170
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:26.720
[MUSIC PLAYING]
