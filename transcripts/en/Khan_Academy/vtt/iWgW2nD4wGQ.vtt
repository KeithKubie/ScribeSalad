00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:01.653
- [Voiceover] We're told let g be

00:00:01.653 --> 00:00:03.525
a differentiable function defined

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:06.615
over the closed interval
from negative four to four.

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:10.277
The graph of g is given
right over here, given below.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:13.854
How many inflection points
does the graph of g have?

00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:17.506
So let's just remind ourselves,
what are inflection points?

00:00:17.506 --> 00:00:20.715
So inflection points are
where we change concavity.

00:00:20.715 --> 00:00:22.548
So we go from concave,

00:00:23.513 --> 00:00:27.323
concave upwards, upwards,
actually let me just

00:00:27.323 --> 00:00:28.931
draw it graphically.

00:00:28.931 --> 00:00:33.098
We're going from concave
upwards to concave downwards,

00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:37.607
or concave downwards to concave upwards.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.823
Or another way you could think about it,

00:00:42.823 --> 00:00:47.463
you could say we're going
from our slope increasing,

00:00:47.463 --> 00:00:49.380
increasing, increasing,

00:00:50.338 --> 00:00:52.748
to our slope decreasing.

00:00:52.748 --> 00:00:54.748
To our slope decreasing,

00:00:56.228 --> 00:00:57.496
or the other way around.

00:00:57.496 --> 00:01:00.395
Any points where your
slope goes from decreasing,

00:01:00.395 --> 00:01:04.396
our slope goes from
decreasing, to increasing.

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.312
To increasing.

00:01:06.312 --> 00:01:07.824
So let's think about that.

00:01:07.824 --> 00:01:11.297
So as we start off right over here,

00:01:11.297 --> 00:01:13.357
at the extreme left it's seems like

00:01:13.357 --> 00:01:15.048
we have a very high slope.

00:01:15.048 --> 00:01:16.889
It's a very steep curve,

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:20.209
and then it stays increasing
but it's getting less positive.

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:21.861
So it's getting a little bit,

00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:23.258
it's getting a little bit flatter,

00:01:23.258 --> 00:01:26.743
so our slope is at a very high
level but it's decreasing.

00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:29.274
It's decreasing, decreasing, decreasing,

00:01:29.274 --> 00:01:33.304
slope is decreasing, decreasing even more.

00:01:33.304 --> 00:01:36.185
It's even more and then
it's actually going to zero,

00:01:36.185 --> 00:01:38.058
our slope is zero and
then it becomes negative.

00:01:38.058 --> 00:01:40.205
So our slope is still decreasing.

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:45.117
Then it's becoming more
and more and more negative,

00:01:45.117 --> 00:01:49.331
and then right around, and
then right around here,

00:01:49.331 --> 00:01:53.323
it looks like it starts
becoming less negative,

00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:55.200
or starts increasing.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.741
So our slope is increasing increasing,

00:01:57.741 --> 00:01:59.987
it's really just becoming
less and less negative,

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:02.547
and then it's going close to zero,

00:02:02.547 --> 00:02:04.334
approaching zero, it looks like our slope

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:06.489
is zero right over here,

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:07.705
but then it looks like right over there

00:02:07.705 --> 00:02:10.474
our slope begins decreasing again.

00:02:10.474 --> 00:02:14.444
So it looks like our
slope is decreasing again.

00:02:14.444 --> 00:02:16.915
So it looks like our slope is decreasing.

00:02:16.915 --> 00:02:20.800
It's becoming more and more
and more and more negative,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.758
and so it looks like
something interesting happened

00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:24.774
right over there, we
got a transition point,

00:02:24.774 --> 00:02:27.471
and then right around here,
it looks like it starts,

00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:30.096
the slope starts increasing again.

00:02:30.096 --> 00:02:33.720
So it looks like the
slope starts increasing.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.492
It's negative but it's becoming less

00:02:35.492 --> 00:02:38.017
and less and less negative
and then it becomes zero

00:02:38.017 --> 00:02:39.418
and then it becomes positive and then

00:02:39.418 --> 00:02:42.835
more and more and more and more positive.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.153
So inflection points are where we go

00:02:46.153 --> 00:02:49.653
from slope increasing to slope decreasing.

00:02:51.193 --> 00:02:54.087
So concave upwards to concave downwards,

00:02:54.087 --> 00:02:57.377
and so slope increasing was
here to slope decreasing,

00:02:57.377 --> 00:02:59.162
so this was an inflection point,

00:02:59.162 --> 00:03:02.126
and also from slope decreasing
to slope increasing.

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:05.089
So that's slope decreasing
to slope increasing,

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:08.582
and this is also slope
decreasing to slope increasing.

00:03:08.582 --> 00:03:11.810
So how many inflection points
does the graph of g have

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.986
that we can see on this graph?

00:03:13.986 --> 00:03:17.112
Well it has three over the interval

00:03:17.112 --> 00:03:19.195
that at least we can see.
