00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.929
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hi, thank
you for joining us today.

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:12.470
SOPHIA AMORUSO:
Thanks for having me.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: Of course.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.510
So I've scribbled some
notes that I meticulously

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.400
made a while
annotating the book,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.620
but the first
thing I want to ask

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.970
is, so you were the
founder, this was your baby,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.650
Nasty Gal was your
company for years,

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.974
how did the idea of
writing a book come about?

00:00:34.974 --> 00:00:36.640
I mean, was that
something you've always

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.649
wanted to do, is that something
somebody else had the idea for?

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:47.520
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Hi.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.740
OK.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.370
OK.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.637
Let's see, so part of
my stories has a lot

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.470
to do with social media,
a lot of my stories

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.928
have a lot to do
with social media.

00:00:57.928 --> 00:01:01.710
And on my personal social media,
which I didn't really have,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.700
at least publicly, until
Instagram really came around,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.140
I was getting a lot of
comments that were like,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.960
I want to do what you did,
I want to work for you,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.710
how did you do it?

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.200
Like I have an
eBay store, I want

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.330
to learn from what
you've done, whatever.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.360
And so everything I've done
with Nasty Gal, social media,

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.970
a lot of it is about listening,
and it was very serendipitous.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.850
So I moved to LA, I bought
a house, so it was cool,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.380
and I needed an attorney.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.990
And the only attorney
I'd really had

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.290
was someone who worked
on my will, which

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.089
is a kind of depressing
thing to do in your 20s.

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:43.630
And so I needed someone that
was like a general attorney that

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.725
could deal with contractors,
and an architect, or whatever.

00:01:46.725 --> 00:01:48.920
I was going to
remodel this place.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.690
And I got introduced
to someone who

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.590
was like, I didn't
know at the time,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.000
they were an
entertainment attorney.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.680
And so I had a
meeting with him, he

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.460
was like, listen I can
deal with contracts

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.390
for like, your
whatever, plumber,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.760
but what else do you want to do?

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.200
Like do you want
a TV show, do you

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.620
want-- what do you want to do?

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.900
Nasty Gal's amazing, you
could do so much with this,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.660
and I was like, I don't know,
a book seems really cool,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.322
but I don't know.

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:17.030
And then he said, cool
I'll introduce you

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.770
to the head of the
literary department at WME,

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.450
I can't make anything
happen for you,

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.200
but all I can do is
make the introduction

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.500
and if something
happens then great.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.300
And he did, and I had
a meeting with someone

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.270
who works for her, who is
now kind of like my fairy

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.220
godmother at WME.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.987
And we had one
meeting and she said,

00:02:36.987 --> 00:02:38.070
what would you want to do?

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.960
The obvious thing would be to
do a style book, a hardcover

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.940
coffee table book.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.060
And I was like, I don't know,
I mean that's so expected.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.580
And it's not because I wanted
to do something unexpected,

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.390
it's just because a business
book would be really fun.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.540
And there's a lot
of stories that I

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.480
hadn't told about my experience
to reporters in the media,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.610
because what am I going
to do, tell Forbes

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.849
that I was a dumpster diver?

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.390
Like what's the
headline going to be?

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.810
So it was cool to
tell my own story

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.450
and also I really
kind of set out

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.530
to write a book that
was, in some way,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.920
like the gateway
drug to the business

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.250
section of the
bookstore, for someone

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.474
who may not be going there
yet, because I was that girl.

00:03:22.474 --> 00:03:23.890
And I think there's
a lot to learn

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.179
in that part of the bookstore.

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:27.720
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
that's interesting

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.761
that you say that that's
sort of the gateway drug

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:31.700
to like a book about
business or management,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.140
because when you
see the cover it

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.390
doesn't look like a book
about business, right?

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.220
It's "#Girlboss," I mean, yeah,
it has the word boss in it,

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.667
but what made you
pick that title,

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:43.250
at what point did
you pick that title,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.120
what does it mean
for you, and also,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.480
how would you differentiate
a #Girlboss from a Nasty Gal.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.974
Like if both have a
persona, are they the same

00:03:51.974 --> 00:03:52.890
or are they different?

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.190
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Good questions.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.750
So, I named Nasty Gal
after an album and a song

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.590
by a lady named
Bette Davis, and I

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.970
don't know, just
in that same vein,

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.470
really I'm not inventing names.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.750
So there's a film, a
very little known film,

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.960
called "Girl Boss Guerrilla"
from the '70s that's

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.410
like a Japanese
female revenge flick,

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.110
and it's really
stylish, really good.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.215
It's like girl gangs knife
fighting in the streets.

00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:27.900
It's just so cool, and they
have a tattoo over their,

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.719
like, right boob or something.

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:33.260
So it's called "Girl
Boss Guerrilla,"

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.960
and I just loved the name, and
I was just like, "#Girlboss."

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.960
I don't know, it was never
called anything else,

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.470
there were no alternate
names, it was just kind of

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.720
really simple.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.500
And then how do you
differentiate a Girl Boss

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:47.930
from a Nast Gal?

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.230
I think Nasty Gal
dresses girls to feel

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.860
like they can live the
life that they want

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.570
and achieve what they want,
and Girl Boss gives them,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.920
hopefully, the tools to do it.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.750
So I would say, the
ethos is very similar.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.630
Nasty Gal is a fashion
brand, first and foremost,

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.610
and I think Girl Boss right now
is a book, [AUDIO OUT] cast.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.954
This isn't working,
do you wanna switch?

00:05:16.954 --> 00:05:18.370
FEMALE SPEAKER:Yeah,
let's switch.

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.020
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Hello.

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.955
But I think Girl Boss has the
potential to be a lot more.

00:05:24.955 --> 00:05:27.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: You have a
foundation now and everything,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.945
right?

00:05:27.945 --> 00:05:29.130
Let's hear a little
more about that.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.213
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Yeah, so
we launched the Girl Boss

00:05:31.213 --> 00:05:34.990
foundation about a year ago,
and I just really wanted

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.130
to do something to give back
to girls who were starting

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.420
their own businesses,
and specifically

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.220
creative entrepreneurs,
I think, because it

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.920
was my experience
with photography that

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.780
got me kind of like,
oh that was really

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.890
fun about having an online
shop was the photography.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.640
And it still is today,
even though I'm not

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.630
taking the pictures.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:03.270
So to date we've given
away $75,000 in grants

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.290
to girls in like art,
music, fashion, design.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.950
One girl makes these really
beautiful silk scarves,

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.500
and used the grant to like
rent some space in a showroom

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.560
and to make samples
of silk pajamas using

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.280
the same kind of
illustrations that she

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.780
prints onto her
scarves, and they're

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.010
really, really beautiful.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.760
There's another grant recipient
who publishes novellas, so

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.870
short-form books.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.490
Her company is called Novella
and she's really awesome.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.150
So it's the start
to something that I

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.350
think will become a bigger
way that Girl Boss can tell

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.850
other people's stories
other than my own,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.600
because I think even
hearing their stories

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.850
gives other people
perspective and confidence.

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:53.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: I mean I
think that's the biggest

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.220
appeal of your book,
and it was for me.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.803
It certainly was
very inspiring for me

00:06:56.803 --> 00:07:00.920
when I read the hardback
maybe a year ago.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.110
And I think what's
interesting is

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.315
the whole trajectory from
quote unquote "dumpster

00:07:07.315 --> 00:07:10.660
diving free-gan,"
sort of interested

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.570
in anarchy and sort of
going from job to job,

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.000
and then bam you're
a CEO and you

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.720
have this multimillion
dollar company,

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.180
and you're this
big success story.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.790
And everybody thinks it's
an overnight success,

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.080
but that journey was definitely
not an immediate one.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:26.280
SOPHIA AMORUSO: It's been
almost nine years since I

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.170
started selling stuff on eBay.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: And so,
what I'm curious about

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.560
is, was there a
moment that showed

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.770
you, that demonstrated that,
you had sort of, quote unquote,

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:39.410
"made it."

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.034
Was there a moment
where you were like,

00:07:41.034 --> 00:07:43.780
wow this is much bigger than
I ever thought it would be.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.620
SOPHIA AMORUSO:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.120
I don't ever use the
term, I've made it,

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.110
and I get that a lot like,
when did you made it?

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:55.460
Making it, I think, is just,
like that's an everyday thing,

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.440
because if I thought
I'd made it I'd probably

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.260
look like the wrong way and
get hit by a bus or something,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.910
be like, woo-whoo, phew.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.210
You know like, don't turn
your back to the ocean.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.730
But there was a
time, and there's

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:13.910
different moments over
the course of Nasty Gal's

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.550
trajectory, I think,
that were symbols

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.420
of that and other symbols of
like, holy shit this could all

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.160
fall apart, you know?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.590
But I think the first one was
when I was in LA, like shopping

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:29.960
for vintage and
visiting friends,

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.880
drinking canned beer
in someones backyard,

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.250
and my auctions were closing,
which is just so cool.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.258
You get all these
e-mails and the auctions

00:08:37.258 --> 00:08:39.299
go crazy at the last
minute, because people think

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:42.169
they're going to like sneak
in and get a great deal,

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:45.280
but they actually just drive
prices up because all it takes

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.520
is two people that are
willing to spend $100 more.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.320
And you're like,
whoa like it went up

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.150
$100 in the last three seconds.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:57.870
So, I think it was
probably 2007--

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.410
I mean it was only on eBay
for like a year and a half--

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.210
that my auctions were
closing and it was one week's

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.516
worth of auctions and
it was like $2,500

00:09:06.516 --> 00:09:11.340
of stuff, which I probably paid
like, who knows in total, $100

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:11.860
for.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.550
Who knows what my
total cost was.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.030
But it was just like, wow I'm
drinking a beer with friends

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.760
and I just made $2,500.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.250
I don't even know if I'd ever
made that in a month at a job

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.599
at that point in my life,
so that was pretty exciting.

00:09:24.599 --> 00:09:27.140
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's almost like
it's so surreal because it's

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:29.056
an ordinary moment where
you're drinking beer,

00:09:29.056 --> 00:09:31.200
instead of this
big glitzy moment.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.130
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Yeah, I mean
so many exciting moments

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.960
happen on our
phones now, I guess,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.510
and that was the case for me.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: So tell us
more about your current role.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:46.570
So you were the CEO, now you
are the executive chairman.

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:49.220
You are, of course,
always the founder

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:52.900
and you carry and embody
so much of the brand

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.090
to so many people
who admire the brand,

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.020
but what's your current role?

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.700
How has that evolved
and do you still

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:03.890
have as much
creative input as you

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.710
did in the choices and the
direction the brand is moving?

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:07.780
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Yeah.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:11.780
So you know, when you found a
company, you're also the CEO.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.170
I mean I was a CEO of a one
person company at one point,

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:14.890
technically.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.710
I was also, as soon as we
incorporated on LegalZoom,

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:21.420
I guess I was the executive
chair or the president,

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:23.650
and the secretary, and
all of those things.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.987
And, you know, CEO
was never a title

00:10:25.987 --> 00:10:28.070
that I was like, I'm going
to start an eBay store,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.002
I can't wait to
have the CEO title

00:10:30.002 --> 00:10:31.210
and have people call me that.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.750
It just doesn't really matter
to me because what I've built

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:35.610
is what matters.

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.101
What I get to do
everyday matters.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.200
So I've always been
the executive chairman,

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.890
I'm still the
executive chairman.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:44.740
What does that mean?

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:47.440
I mean I own most
of the company,

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.990
technically I
control the company,

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.852
and I have as much
creative input as I want.

00:10:53.852 --> 00:10:55.810
One thing we're spending
a lot of time on right

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.870
now is creating tools
for our creative team,

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.387
for anyone that
touches the brand

00:11:00.387 --> 00:11:02.970
to understand what the brand is,
to know how to use the brand,

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.790
what the parameters
are, where you can play.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.240
But over the course
of the last--

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.290
I mean since I've had a team
that are making decisions

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.270
on Nasty Gal's behalf, whether
it's writing email copy,

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.100
social media copy, taking
a photo for social media,

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.350
or taking a photo that's
going to go on the home page,

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.100
all of those things have to
go through some sort of brand

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:22.900
filter.

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:27.034
And when all you have is
conversations about that, one,

00:11:27.034 --> 00:11:28.950
you find yourself having
the same conversation

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:33.820
over and over, and two, it
feels like a personal thing,

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.770
so it feels like my opinion
versus your opinion,

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.280
or someone's opinion versus
someone else's opinion

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.740
about what's right
for the brand,

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.710
rather than this is what
it is, it lives here,

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:49.390
let me self-reflect before
anyone-- a tool basically.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:53.177
So it makes things
more objective,

00:11:53.177 --> 00:11:55.260
and that's something we're
doing a lot of work on,

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.030
is getting this kind
of like brand bible,

00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:59.880
I guess, to get out of my head
the things that make Nasty

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.120
Gal tick, so that other
people can do a great job

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.340
and aren't getting emails from
me at midnight being like,

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:09.480
what is this insane copy,
like what does this even mean?

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:12.380
I don't send emails that
sound exactly like that,

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:19.310
but you know, there's a lot of,
when a company becomes sizable,

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:22.770
and the brand-- you know, I
think if our brand was more

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:25.530
focused, if we had a singular
product, if we were Blue Bottle

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:30.720
Coffee, keeping the brand
in line would be simpler.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.650
I'm not saying it's easy,
or it's easy for them.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:36.490
We have so many products that
we write so much copy for,

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.360
we take so many pictures and
send out so many e-mail blasts,

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.820
and post on social media
so often that it's almost

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.100
like the volume is
hard, but also Nasty Gal

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:47.860
has a very specific
voice, which isn't

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.709
as easy to nail as the voice
of maybe some other brands.

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:54.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you feel like
there have ever been moments

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:59.520
where you felt pressured?

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.250
It's not working.

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.666
SOPHIA AMORUSO:
Here, let's just--

00:13:01.666 --> 00:13:04.530
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.030
Hello.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.450
OK.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.283
Do you feel like they
have ever been moments

00:13:07.283 --> 00:13:14.990
where you felt that there was
some pressure on Nasty Gal

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:19.330
to conform to whatever was the
sexiest sort of mass market

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:21.720
trend at the time and then
you might have-- have there

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.830
been any moments where you took
a direction that didn't fit

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:28.800
feel like it was faithful
to the actual brand?

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.860
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Yes, but
I would say our intent

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:40.400
and the execution-- so in
intent, no in execution, yes.

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:44.010
So when there's a lot of
different people fulfilling

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.280
the task at hand-- we have
something internally that we

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.760
call "fuxury," which is kind of
like the word fuck and luxury

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:55.900
together, and it's almost like
another word for aspirational

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:58.300
or any word you could
think of, but it's

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.000
kind of like our
product architecture,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.960
we just use it to refer
to something internally.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.320
But, because it sounds like
luxury, at a certain point--

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.510
and we had a fair
amount of turnover

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:11.040
in this period in
merchandising, so there's that.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.035
So there's the
people that did know,

00:14:13.035 --> 00:14:15.160
and there's the people who
are new and still trying

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.830
to figure it out, and
you never really know

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.530
who placed the order
for whatever it is.

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:21.550
But the last year
or so there's been

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:26.090
a fair amount of
pricey stuff coming

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.790
through, beautiful
stuff, but I think,

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.900
we want to have quality product,
and to really stand behind

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:37.740
that, our price should migrate
a teeny bit, like a little bit,

00:14:37.740 --> 00:14:41.780
but I think it migrated faster
than we had anticipated.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.240
And that's something that takes,
I mean, the lead time's long,

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.980
reacting takes time, and
that affects your business.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:53.050
And that's definitely-- I
don't want to turn off the girl

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.340
who's looking for
a $58-$68 dress,

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.192
we have to have
something for her.

00:14:58.192 --> 00:14:59.900
And there's been
moments in the last year

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:04.460
that it looks like we're over
her or something, which is not

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:05.475
the case, you know?

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.259
FEMALE SPEAKER: So let's take
it back to the earlier days,

00:15:13.259 --> 00:15:15.050
around the time you
started the eBay store.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:19.220
Right before that,
you had a lot of jobs

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.350
and you detail
those in the book.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:27.150
You worked at the art
school checking IDs,

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:31.350
and you worked at Subway, and
all these different things,

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:36.260
and then Nasty Gal
happened, and it stuck.

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.650
So one thing I am
curious about is, do you

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:43.660
have sort of like
a system, a way

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:49.650
that you know now, after having
been through all those choices,

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:54.180
of knowing when to quit and
when to keep grinding or keep

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.190
hustling?

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:58.460
How do you make that
decision about anything

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.150
big about Nasty
Gal or otherwise?

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.910
SOPHIA AMORUSO: It's tough
because I worked really hard,

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:10.280
but a lot of what's worked
for me has also been somewhat

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:12.660
of a path-of-least-resistance
model,

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:18.206
and that can work when you're
doing everything or when

00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:20.570
you're young, when the
future's wide open,

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:24.190
or when you don't have a team
that needs a strategy that is

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:25.490
looking to you for leadership.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:29.800
So to operate a company
like Nasty Gal today,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.860
that just doesn't really work.

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.940
There are opportunities
within that pop up,

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.040
but that's a tough one.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.520
I think I'm loyal
to what I've built,

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.600
so I want to see it through.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.440
I'm loyal to the
people who work for me

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.130
and the girl who's been shopping
at Nasty Gal, because that's

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:55.420
the only reason I have a life,
and a home, and some poodles,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:58.270
and whatever.

00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:04.130
So as much as I can I'll do
right by all of those people,

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:07.680
but it's a lot of
different groups,

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.140
and there's a
feeling of, I guess,

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:14.450
social debt that I have kind
of endlessly where I can never

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:17.220
be all the places I wish I
was, or with all the people

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.900
I wish I could spend
time with, because I

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:25.329
know they would like my time
or my feedback or my input.

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:26.710
And that's a challenging thing.

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.310
I think I'm kind
of rambling now.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.601
I want to answer your question.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:42.440
There was a point, and this was
before I chose to step up out

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.580
of the CEO role
where my job became

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.360
just meeting after
meeting after meeting

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:51.780
and there wasn't a
lot of creativity.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.090
And today, you know, I'm
bringing really great

00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:00.080
collaboration's into the
business or spending time

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.430
on things like this brand book
and other things that will give

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.500
the company kind of like
legs for the future,

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.520
but don't make me just kind of
want to bang my head against

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.900
a wall, because there's people
that are a lot more skilled

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.560
and experienced than I am at
getting grown-ups with a ton

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.430
of work experience to do what
they say they're going to do

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.560
and not give you excuses
for why it didn't.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.180
It's just like, I don't
want to tell someone

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.800
that they're lying if they
say that this snafu happened

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.880
and that's why it
didn't get done on time,

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.640
like I'm not going
to-- whatever,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.570
I'm just really
babbling now, but it's

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:43.030
just like, I don't know, it's
like the tough versus nurture.

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:45.920
But like, you need to
nurture people for them

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.527
to be better, for them to
know what the task at hand is.

00:18:48.527 --> 00:18:50.110
There's like such
an art to leadership

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.460
and it's going to take me a
really long time to learn,

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.370
and that was one thing that
I knew the learning curve was

00:18:54.370 --> 00:18:55.790
just way too high
for me on and there

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:57.206
are things that
I'm way better at,

00:18:57.206 --> 00:19:02.450
so I think when you feel like,
when you wake up in the morning

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.370
and you're not having
fun, that's probably

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:06.570
time to change something.

00:19:09.355 --> 00:19:13.182
So I guess, a heuristic.

00:19:13.182 --> 00:19:14.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
don't know if I'm

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:15.806
pronouncing that, heuristic.

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:24.070
So you talk about
exulting the details

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:28.400
and how that was a big part of
the success of the early eBay

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.380
store.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.230
You would take the pictures and
make sure the silhouettes were

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:37.490
right, you would make sure the
descriptions were evocative,

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.780
and it just seems
like you tirelessly

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:45.220
put all this work into making
every single listing fantastic.

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.790
Now when a company grows
to over 400 people,

00:19:48.790 --> 00:19:51.530
to hundreds of
millions in revenue,

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:56.800
and when you're not talking
to the customer directly

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.320
all the time like you used
to, or seeing those orders

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.640
and MySpace comments
come in, how

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.130
do you make sure that those
details are still exalted?

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.280
What do you do to maintain
that kind of a culture

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.300
and that kind of
attention to detail?

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.050
SOPHIA AMORUSO: I think
that's really hard

00:20:12.050 --> 00:20:14.640
and I think that's something
we're still figuring out,

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:17.200
because that has to become
systematic at a certain point.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.200
It starts with hiring
people who care,

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.590
who take pride in what they
do, who are open to feedback

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:28.280
and want to learn, and who
want to tweak out on their work

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.890
rather than show up
and just like, OK

00:20:30.890 --> 00:20:33.200
put the jacket on the
model, what time is it,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.320
I'm leaving now, you know?

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.160
But the brand work
that we're doing,

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.790
like having tools for
people to understand what

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.720
a successful subject
line in an email

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.500
is versus a call
to action, I mean

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.890
it's not as drilled
down as that yet.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:58.570
But I think ultimately
you have to really define

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:00.780
what success looks like
for people for them

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:08.350
to be successful in fulfilling
on the brand's promise.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:12.300
And some companies do
it better than others.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.460
And I would say it's a
work in progress for us.

00:21:17.194 --> 00:21:19.610
FEMALE SPEAKER: So it seems
like, when you've started out,

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:22.640
a lot of things were sort
of based on instinct or gut.

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.760
You kind of just paid
attention to the customer,

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.930
you listened to
what she wanted, you

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:30.371
made sure to pay
attention to every detail.

00:21:30.371 --> 00:21:31.870
There were also,
I'm guessing, a lot

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.590
of things that didn't
come so naturally,

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:38.390
like with learning how to be a
leader of hundreds of people.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:44.140
So, looking back, what would
you tell 22-year-old Sophia

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.040
who's just started
this store and you

00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.510
have no idea that
it's become going

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:50.120
to become what it has become?

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:53.160
What would you tell
her to, sort of-- yeah,

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.800
I mean, what lessons
would you give her?

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.250
SOPHIA AMORUSO: I
would say focus.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:02.140
So I enjoy having
a lot of ideas,

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:06.740
but when you have a business
plan, which I never did,

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:11.120
it forces you to say, OK this
is what we're here to do.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.730
And I'm the kind of person
that's like, oh my god,

00:22:13.730 --> 00:22:16.410
opportunity, cool, the
book was successful?

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:16.910
Now what?

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.140
What am I going to
do with Girl Boss?

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:21.790
There's more people
coming out for a paperback

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.980
than there was when the book
originally was published,

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:25.980
so that means something.

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:27.260
So cool, is it a conference?

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.030
I don't know!

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:34.710
So that's just what I do, but
when you have a team that's

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:36.760
trying to just accomplish
the task at hand,

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:42.210
it's not super helpful,
it's probably distracting.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:49.690
So it's I don't know, it's
something that, I don't know.

00:22:49.690 --> 00:22:52.770
Focus, focus, and
then, yeah, just

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:55.967
have that, what's the
center of the universe?

00:22:55.967 --> 00:22:58.050
For Nasty Gal it's like,
we could become a content

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:02.670
business, we could do all these
things that will probably--

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:05.110
it's like just
getting the job done

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:07.930
that we have today is
a challenge enough.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:19.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: So apparently
it's time for Q and A.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.650
Does anybody in the
audience have a question?

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:23.280
We have a mic to pass around.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.640
Sasha Arijanto.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.000
AUDIENCE: I'll abuse my
power to ask a question.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
I don't know if this even works.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.470
FEMALE SPEAKER:
Did you turn it on?

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:34.590
AUDIENCE: It is working?

00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:35.780
OK cool.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.350
I think you're so cool and I
have worn so many Nasty Gal

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:42.580
outfits to really important
life events, so thank you.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.800
A lot of us are
probably hoping one day

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.950
to start our own companies,
or be in that early stage

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:53.992
process of a company, and when
you were in the early days,

00:23:53.992 --> 00:23:55.700
it seems so important
to make sure you're

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.070
working with the right people.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.420
How do you know who was going
to come to work and be excited,

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.480
or who was going to come
to work and just want

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.670
to look cool and
then peace out early?

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.850
And do you have any advice
for working with friends,

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.842
like yes, or like keep
your friends close,

00:24:09.842 --> 00:24:11.216
but work with just
professionals?

00:24:13.722 --> 00:24:15.680
SOPHIA AMORUSO: I think
you know pretty quickly

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.740
if someone's going to show up
and do more than what the job

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.780
description, or at least
at the bare minimum

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:26.940
the job description, or if
they just want to look cool.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:30.770
I don't know, once you accept
that, the people around them

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.280
will think that
that's the standard,

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:36.060
so you kind of have to cut that
out pretty quickly if that's

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:37.680
the case.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:43.480
But, in terms of assessing
that before you hire someone,

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.310
I mean asking them for ideas,
like if you don't have ideas,

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:49.510
then you're probably not going
to go beyond whatever you're

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:53.950
told to do, and it makes more
work for the people around you

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.330
or for that kind of
person when they're like,

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:59.120
I'm done doing what you
told me to do now what?

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.130
And you're like, oh my god,
there's so many things to do,

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.040
I don't know.

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.700
Does that make sense?

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.506
And then what was
the second question?

00:25:09.506 --> 00:25:11.380
AUDIENCE: Like choosing
to work with friends.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:12.543
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Oh friends.

00:25:12.543 --> 00:25:16.170
AUDIENCE: It should be just
be only a work relationship.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:18.930
SOPHIA AMORUSO: I would
say keep your friends

00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:22.030
your friends and
your team your team.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.870
I mean, maybe-- I don't
have a co-founder,

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.560
it seems really
cool because you can

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.730
have one person doing
PR and the other person

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:34.710
running the company or
whatever, but in terms

00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.710
of hiring your
friends it's tough.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.090
I've told myself
that, for the friends

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:42.560
I have worked at Nasty Gal,
I will work with them--

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:45.132
it's been more successful when
they report to someone who

00:25:45.132 --> 00:25:47.590
reports to me, or reports to
someone who reports to someone

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:50.340
who reports to me, so
that I'm not negotiating

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:52.250
their future with them.

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:55.940
But even when that is the case
there's still awkward moments.

00:25:55.940 --> 00:26:00.410
And when your friend tells
you that they're stressed out,

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:03.042
you take it, I'm
like I'm like, oh no.

00:26:03.042 --> 00:26:04.500
It's just more
personal because you

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.060
care about their
well-- I mean I care

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:08.560
about everyone in my company's
wellbeing-- they're probably

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.370
just not going to be like, oh
my god I've been-- I don't know,

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.800
does that make sense?

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.290
Yeah, just it's a
different conversation when

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.610
you go to dinner with a friend
who doesn't work for you,

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.756
and it's so much nicer, I think,
to keep it that way sometimes.

00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:29.560
Anyone else?

00:26:32.916 --> 00:26:34.832
FEMALE SPEAKER: You can
just ask the question.

00:26:34.832 --> 00:26:35.707
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:45.160
SOPHIA AMORUSO: That doesn't
happen as much anymore.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.040
It used to happen.

00:26:50.571 --> 00:26:52.070
I think a certain
amount of humility

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:55.190
is good it's just like,
OK, I get it, you know?

00:26:55.190 --> 00:27:01.990
But going out your way to prove
that you're smart or belong

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.140
is kind of awkward.

00:27:04.140 --> 00:27:08.100
Often it's just being
like cool and curious,

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:10.930
and if someone doesn't
know why you're

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:14.060
standing in front of them
and you think they should.

00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.390
I mean, the art
of conversation is

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:22.447
kind of like a lubricant for
getting to maybe the more

00:27:22.447 --> 00:27:24.030
important things or
talking about what

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.988
you want to talk about.

00:27:24.988 --> 00:27:33.490
And also, I don't know, people
love to be asked for advice.

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:39.860
So if it's someone who is
in a position of power,

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.330
I don't know, those people
often-- I don't know,

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.160
a lot of people aren't
ballsy enough to just say

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:49.137
like, hey, I know you did
this, I have a question.

00:27:49.137 --> 00:27:50.970
And it's really flattering
for those people,

00:27:50.970 --> 00:27:53.700
and it also gives them
a break from themselves,

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:57.030
which is kind of a gift.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.990
But I would say just act as if.

00:27:58.990 --> 00:28:01.402
It's like, if you don't
belong in the room

00:28:01.402 --> 00:28:03.110
because you're the
only girl in the room,

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:04.400
or someone doesn't
take you seriously

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.700
because they've never
heard of your company,

00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.300
or whatever it is, it doesn't
mean run around acting cocky.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.160
It's just, if you see
yourself as the person that

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.270
is not that thing, that's
probably what you'll project.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:17.940
That's like what the
world will see you as,

00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:22.330
so there's a little
bit of whatever-ness

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:26.965
that you just kind of
have to keep close,

00:28:26.965 --> 00:28:27.965
if that makes any sense.

00:28:31.686 --> 00:28:32.561
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:39.330 --> 00:28:40.455
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Thanks.

00:28:40.455 --> 00:28:41.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:50.811 --> 00:28:51.811
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Totally.

00:28:51.811 --> 00:28:52.686
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.450
SOPHIA AMORUSO: So the
question is, for the video

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:05.070
camera, what's different about
my journey because I'm a woman.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.300
I named the book "#Girlboss."

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:08.175
What's happened, what's
transpired in my life

00:29:08.175 --> 00:29:09.980
because I'm a woman.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.280
AUDIENCE: Like why wasn't
it called Good Entrepreneur?

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.696
SOPHIA AMORUSO:
Good Entrepreneur,

00:29:13.696 --> 00:29:16.500
would that be a good book name?

00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.540
I mean, you know there's a-- OK
I'm going to adjust my skirt,

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.469
because it's way too short to
be sitting and kind of lean.

00:29:23.469 --> 00:29:24.260
There we go, maybe.

00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:27.960
What's different?

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.020
Nothing, really.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:35.540
I think a book called "Boss"
probably would've sold as well.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:38.080
And I think it's a
cool sounding hashtag.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.680
And you know the
book isn't really

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.110
about being a girl at all.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.090
Have you read the book?

00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.080
I really don't talk about being
a girl almost all in the book,

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.790
but I think there's a lot of
girls that need someone that's

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:53.930
familiar to hear their stories.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:58.360
I think it like predigests
the lessons in a way

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:01.289
that, when we style something
on a model, when she looks

00:30:01.289 --> 00:30:03.330
like she's going somewhere
and she has a handbag,

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:06.090
and she has a certain
attitude and she doesn't just

00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.670
look like a stale person,
you can see yourself

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.030
in those clothes.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:15.890
So I think we all learn a
little better when things

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:17.610
are put in context for us.

00:30:17.610 --> 00:30:19.672
And I think that's
what Girl Boss has

00:30:19.672 --> 00:30:21.880
done for a lot of girls who
want to be entrepreneurs,

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.600
or who just want a
voice from someone

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.579
who had no more money
than they probably

00:30:28.579 --> 00:30:30.120
do, if they can
afford the book, when

00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.630
they started their business.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.890
There's a lot of
women talking to women

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:39.770
who have really great educations
and really great platforms,

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.640
but a lot of women
talking to women

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.680
stuff I think is a
really stale looking.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.820
It just feels a little,
just like really serious,

00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.600
and it also can be very
expensive to attend some

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.103
of these conferences and stuff.

00:30:52.103 --> 00:30:56.210
It's like $6,500 to go talk
about being women, which

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.770
is cool, that's great for
a certain kind of woman,

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.590
but there's the
rest of us, and I

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:02.740
think that's why Girl
Boss really resonated.

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.260
But as far as my career becoming
what it is because I'm a woman,

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.020
I think I've been celebrated
more because I'm a woman,

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:10.030
for sure.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.790
I mean I do with that what I
can, because that's what I do.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:20.294
And I think, maybe because
I wore vintage clothing,

00:31:20.294 --> 00:31:22.210
and I wasn't like a
fashion freak or anything,

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.980
but I wore vintage clothing
and the brand is for girls,

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.310
and I think I get them
because maybe I am a girl.

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:30.570
And that would be
the only advantage

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:33.190
other than having a laptop
and a digital camera

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:36.400
and living in California
and all these other things.

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:42.655
Hi.

00:31:42.655 --> 00:31:43.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:58.755 --> 00:32:00.630
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Yeah,
so it's her question is

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:04.930
about personal style and how
do I stay true to my style.

00:32:04.930 --> 00:32:09.850
And I think my style has
changed, along with Nasty Gal,

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:13.220
there's a lot of stuff that
I haven't worn that we've

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:16.140
curated, but I would
say I've always

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:18.020
been wearing leather
jackets, I've always

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.220
been wearing black boots.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.930
My hair got short, then
my hair got kind of long.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:27.060
But it's how you carry
yourself, so someone

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.420
could wear the same
outfit and look--

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.560
and you wouldn't
even really recognize

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.140
that it's the same
outfit sometimes.

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:39.940
I think it's more about who you
show up as than what you wear.

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.580
But, let's see what's changed?

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.820
I like to say that LA gave me
legs in more ways than one.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:47.400
So when I lived in San
Francisco, and in the East Bay,

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.267
it was just like
pants all the time.

00:32:49.267 --> 00:32:51.100
You were a skirt it
blows up over your head.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.460
You have bangs,
they blow back past

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.585
your-- give you a big forehead.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:03.079
And then you move to LA and the
weather's amazing all the time,

00:33:03.079 --> 00:33:04.870
and the sun is beating
through your window,

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:07.420
and you can't go outside in like
polyester high-waisted pants,

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:08.295
it's just disgusting.

00:33:08.295 --> 00:33:11.267
It's like it's like a UTI
waiting to happen or something.

00:33:14.370 --> 00:33:15.970
So that's cool,
but also, if you're

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:19.110
going to wear something short,
it forces you to exercise, too.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:21.900
So then it's like this
kind of domino effect

00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:26.240
of positive benefits to
wearing a skirt instead

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.680
of pants I guess.

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:34.695
OK, yeah.

00:33:34.695 --> 00:33:35.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:50.374 --> 00:33:51.790
SOPHIA AMORUSO:
Oh my god if you--

00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:52.934
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:52.934 --> 00:33:54.850
SOPHIA AMORUSO: No,
that's really interesting.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:59.880
So the questions about like
tracing the #girlboss hashtag

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:03.680
on, mostly on Instagram
is where I look, and it's

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.050
kind of run off with itself.

00:34:06.050 --> 00:34:08.560
It's become a part
of the lexicon.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.780
So there's like
Beachbody, which is

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.054
like a company which has like
girl boss things that they do.

00:34:14.054 --> 00:34:16.179
My dad's like, I know
someone who's-- will you talk

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:16.820
at their thing?

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.060
And I'm like, what is this?

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:20.545
He's like, they
call it girl boss.

00:34:20.545 --> 00:34:23.880
It's like whatever, I need
to get a trademark attorney

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:26.013
on this.

00:34:26.013 --> 00:34:27.179
No, I don't want to do that.

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:28.460
I don't want to turn
people off and be like,

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.969
no you can't make a coffee
mug with Girl Boss on it.

00:34:30.969 --> 00:34:35.540
But, the hashtag #girlboss
has like twice as many

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:41.409
impressions on Instagram as
the #nastygal which is crazy.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:43.260
And the book's, you
know-- Nasty Gal is

00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:46.170
nine years old and a
commercial-- and yeah,

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:48.889
it's not a book, so
it's really interesting.

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:52.100
But there's like--
everyone interprets

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.239
it a little differently.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:57.012
Why can I not find-- OK, sorry.

00:34:57.012 --> 00:34:57.960
You're right there.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.810
Everyone interprets it
a little differently,

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.990
so you'll see stuff,
like a quote from my book

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:09.140
next to a quote that I
really disagree with.

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.290
Like someone took a
picture of me sneaking out

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.450
of like the Instagram,
the like square thing.

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:17.830
It was a photo I posted
because we were in New

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:19.380
York at their headquarters.

00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:20.990
And then they put
copy over that said

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:25.810
like, when you lurk
your man's Instagram

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:28.710
to make sure he's
still miserable,

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.750
or something like that,
and it's just like, whoa.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:34.660
Just like, the whole
empowerment thing, people

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:37.750
just like run away with, and it
just means, like, I'm a bitch.

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:41.300
Just like, no, that's
not the idea here,

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.209
but it's pretty
funny, it's cool.

00:35:43.209 --> 00:35:45.750
And if it makes anyone feel a
little more confident when they

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:48.610
leave the house in the morning,
I am super happy about it,

00:35:48.610 --> 00:35:50.649
so yeah.

00:35:50.649 --> 00:35:51.524
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:08.080
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Yeah, do
you look really familiar?

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:08.920
Britney?

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.890
Oh my god, hi, how are you?

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.010
This is Britney, she was one
of our first interns ever,

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:15.600
in Berkeley.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.980
Yeah, you work here now?

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.004
That's so cool.

00:36:19.004 --> 00:36:19.670
Congratulations.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.610
You.

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:22.710
That' so cool.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.850
You look different,
you look like-- did

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:27.426
you have braces then?

00:36:27.426 --> 00:36:30.090
Sorry, you just look
a little different,

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:34.640
and there's light coming
from behind your head.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.456
What's the podcast?

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.669
You can subscribe to it on
iTunes and other places.

00:36:41.669 --> 00:36:43.460
I'm not really sure
how distribution works,

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.910
but it's in partnership
with Slate and Panoply,

00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:49.520
which is their podcast thing.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:51.990
And it's going to be
a weekly podcast where

00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:53.240
I interview really cool women.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.590
We're recording with-- what?

00:36:55.590 --> 00:36:57.356
Oh, your face, sorry.

00:36:57.356 --> 00:36:58.730
I thought I said
something weird.

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.516
This is Krista.

00:37:02.516 --> 00:37:04.390
I'm just going to
interview really cool women

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:08.110
and hopefully have funny, fun,
inspiring conversations that

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:12.030
aren't super dry
about their life.

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.190
OK motherhood let's talk
about that, OK are you

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.740
an entrepreneur or an
actor or a musician?

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:19.537
How does that work?

00:37:19.537 --> 00:37:21.370
What do you have to
wake up and do every day

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:24.330
that you absolutely hate doing?

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.165
Or I'll ask a celebrity, do
you use public restrooms?

00:37:27.165 --> 00:37:30.669
I'm really excited
about that one.

00:37:30.669 --> 00:37:32.210
Yeah, it's just
going to be hopefully

00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:38.489
fun and educational and,
yeah, Girl Boss Radio.

00:37:38.489 --> 00:37:39.364
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:52.670
SOPHIA AMORUSO:
Brands I look up to.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:56.290
I think Google is
pretty awesome.

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:59.560
I feel like I should
just stand in this skirt.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.580
Google.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:04.400
Blue Bottle is one.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:08.700
I think Luxury does
it really well.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:12.040
I really love Dior.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.430
What else?

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:16.230
I mean, companies
like Red Bull that

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:22.970
have turned their brand
into a symbol of a lifestyle

00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:23.980
beyond a drink.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:26.030
Like, that's amazing,
that's really

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:30.730
kind of transformational to
turn a really simple product

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:36.999
into something that means
something much greater.

00:38:36.999 --> 00:38:38.790
So any brand that's
doing that I would say.

00:38:48.786 --> 00:38:49.286
Hey.

00:38:49.286 --> 00:38:50.161
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:04.010
SOPHIA AMORUSO: Yeah, so
the Girl Boss Foundation.

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:05.760
The question is, the
Girl Boss Foundation,

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.660
what's going to happen?

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:09.030
Are you just giving grants away?

00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:10.880
Are you helping people, too?

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.830
Because you blow through
money and maybe learn nothing.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:15.220
That happens.

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:16.300
Ideally, yes.

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:18.620
Right now no one works for
the Girl Boss Foundation,

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.700
so it's really, it's pretty
kind of bare bones in terms

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.520
of the operation of it.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.510
Long term, absolutely.

00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:29.160
And, even just giving
these girls a platform.

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.040
So we had an event in
Santa Monica at our store

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.560
with one of the grant
recipients, Nouvella,

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.390
Deena Drewis, who does Nouvella
Books, and she was in front

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.470
of like, I don't know,
a couple-hundred girls

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:42.740
being interviewed
by the West Coast

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:44.730
editor of Vanity Fair,
which is just something

00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.820
that wouldn't happen otherwise.

00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.250
So I think exposure,
that part is easy,

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.840
because we can tag
team that in some ways,

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.850
but I do think mentorship
is really important,

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:55.850
and long term I think
that will be a part of it.

00:39:55.850 --> 00:39:59.530
We need to assemble maybe
a board of advisors,

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.810
and who knows, it could
be a venture fund.

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:05.200
Like I have no idea, I just
get excited about ideas.

00:40:09.805 --> 00:40:10.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:14.275 --> 00:40:15.900
SOPHIA AMORUSO: So
what have we learned

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.941
from the physical stores?

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.230
We get real time
feedback on the products,

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:25.630
like this thing's falling
apart, or this zipper is just--

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.992
the factory-- we can't
inspect-- we don't, we

00:40:28.992 --> 00:40:30.700
can-- some people do,
it's very expensive

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:34.170
to inspect every single thing.

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:36.850
So there's things that come out
in the process of people trying

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:39.740
stuff on, or this
runs large or small,

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.150
or people are loving this.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:47.880
I think it allows us to see
opportunities a little sooner.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:52.040
I mean we're learning that our
girl loves to shop in person.

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.300
She loves to shop
online, but there's

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:58.510
a level of service in our
stores that I'm really proud of.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:01.090
That's like a higher level.

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:03.200
I mean you can't go
into an Urban Outfitters

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:06.100
and have someone do much
more than kind of roll

00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.510
their eyes at you.

00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:11.470
So I'm really proud that
we have friendly girls who

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:15.210
engage, who are there.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:16.890
Yeah, they're like,
hi, how are you.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:20.410
They're not hounding
you, but I do

00:41:20.410 --> 00:41:22.130
think that at our
price point it's

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:26.760
hard to find like, I don't
know, a boutique experience.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.000
Melrose especially is like that.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.300
What else are we learning
from retail stores?

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.596
That we want more of
them, that will take time.

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.760
I think that's it for now.

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.752
Cool.

00:41:41.752 --> 00:41:43.960
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sophia,
thank you so much for coming.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:46.680
Let's give her a
round of applause.
