01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.050
squeaky wheel and by the way it's one of
the reasons hospitals run terribly is

01:00:08.050 --> 01:00:08.060
the reasons hospitals run terribly is
 

01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:09.160
the reasons hospitals run terribly is
because there's tons of squeaky wheels

because there have to be and that means
 

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:12.910
because there have to be and that means
poor allocation of resources but that's

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.920
poor allocation of resources but that's
 

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.260
poor allocation of resources but that's
a system we're dealt with as patients
