00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.090
My name is Russ Altman I'm on the faculty at

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.210
Stanford and number of departments

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.080
including bioengineering and genetics. they're paying

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.940
me and I have a, an appointment at medicine and computer

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.180
science and I live nearby at Stanford from New York originally.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.150
&gt;&gt; That's great. And you are on of the creator, the creator, I guess farm GKB?

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.592
&gt;&gt; That's a team, I wrote

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:22.075
[CROSSTALK]

00:00:22.075 --> 00:00:24.600
the original proposal and have continued to be the principal investigaton.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.320
It's now in its 13th year, we started back in 2000.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.230
&gt;&gt; Great, and so for somebody who's just seen

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.030
PharmGKB for the first time, what is it all about?

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.580
&gt;&gt; So we are totally excited about the how genetics

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.470
can influence your drug response. And back in 2000 the NIH

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.360
and others realized that there needed to be a central repository

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.020
to gather all that information together. So the mission of PharmGKB

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.740
simply put, is to understand all human genetic variation that impacts

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.140
drug response. And to catalog it to make it available to researchers

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.570
and eventually practitioners so that they use it in their work. And

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.800
it's a one stop shop for the genetic influences on drug response.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.800
&gt;&gt; It sounds like a mountain of information. We have, we do, we

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.310
do this in two ways. We have human curators who are experts in pharmacogenomics,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.340
and they read the literature, literally every week, as the journals

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.600
come out. They scan them, looking for genes and drugs and

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600
the relationships being discussed. And then put them on a queue

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.560
for human curation. This has become difficult and so the second

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.340
effort in the lab are software tools to do this. So

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.890
we do a lot of natural language processing. Data mining and

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.310
stuff like that. To try to help put good articles in

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.010
front of the curators. So that they can be more efficient.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.725
We do still want humans in the loop because this is a

00:01:41.725 --> 00:01:46.630
sufficiently tricky and the end goal being, it might actually affect patients.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.450
So we're not ready to close the loop and just have computers

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.580
doing it all, so there's always a human in the loop so far.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.480
&gt;&gt; Well, who's the intended audience for this? Is this sort

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.170
of, opened up mainly to clinicians or science people or anyone?

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.360
&gt;&gt; It's a great question. That has evolved. For the

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.190
first five, seven years of the database, it was specifically just

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.220
for pharmacogenetic researchers. To let them know what was known and what

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.229
was not known. Really, so they could pick the problems to work

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.700
on and not reinvent the wheel, or be unaware of some important

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.110
discoveries that have been made. With the success of the field, however,

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.380
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.210
&gt;&gt; It has become increasingly apparent that some

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.000
of this stuff is ready to roll out

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.260
in clinical practice. And so we are now

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.290
involved in consortia where we're actually writing clinical

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.200
practice guidelines for clinicians to actually

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.040
use pharmacogenomics in practice. And, and that's

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.906
probably we'll stop. We'll probably go all the way from the raw data.

00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:39.418
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm.

00:02:39.418 --> 00:02:42.930
&gt;&gt; all the way up to the clinical advice that you

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.192
would give to a physcian who's making a decision about drug prescribing.

00:02:47.192 --> 00:02:47.632
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:02:47.632 --> 00:02:50.040
&gt;&gt; And that's really exciting because that's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.610
how you actually impact patients and that's

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.910
why we do this. We did this because we all believe that the genome

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.600
was going to be important for health. And your response to drugs turns out to be

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.110
one of the key early uses of the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.810
genome that we'll be able to benefit patients with.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.610
&gt;&gt; So, if you were an individual just a lay person

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.520
who had personal genetic information about let's say a gene that

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.590
affects the metabolism of a certain drug. You could take your

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.670
variation and go to PharmGKB, and what would you find out?

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.500
&gt;&gt; You, so at PharmGKB,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.720
you would find a couple of things. You would find

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.940
the entire literature on that drug gene pair. indexed as

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.530
to how good was the, not how good was the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.880
study, but how big was the study. How compelling were the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.910
statistics when they did the analysis And you'll find all

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.690
the individual papers, but what you'll also find is products that

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.620
our team has created to kind of integrate that data.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.910
So these clinical guidelines are one thing that you may find.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.080
These require a lot of evidence so there's not as

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.410
many of them as there are things for weaker evidences,

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.440
about 12 of them where we can really put down

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.720
clinical advice. But our curators also put together pathways of

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.470
drug response to show what's happening in the liver. Or

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.840
what's happening in the effector cells that are affected by

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.510
all of these genetic variations. They also write summaries. This

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.260
gene is important because, and they actually publish these summaries

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.440
so that somebody who wants to learn about a particularly important gene.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.750
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.529
&gt;&gt; So a, a patient, unless they

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.760
have scientific background would not find too much.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.460
A physician would find those clinical guidelines

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.110
and the supporting evidence. And a researcher would

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:32.690
find. Well, a candyland of the raw, the raw published literature, and then what

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.420
we hope are very useful summaries of it to help them think about what the next

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:37.520
research question should be.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It sounds like a great amalgamation of

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.890
the information that exists but in a centralized place.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.580
&gt;&gt; We call it a knowledge pyramid. In fact if

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.418
you look at the site, Pharmgkb dot org, please visit it.

00:04:46.418 --> 00:04:47.556
[LAUGH].

00:04:47.556 --> 00:04:50.240
farmgkb.org has this knowledge pyramid where we

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.960
have the raw data that's published in

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.670
the literature and then we have aggregations of it, and then we have filtering

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:58.370
of it. And then we have the clinical advice that we give to doctors.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.560
And that's really how it works. You

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.140
have all this research that eventually impacts patients.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.160
&gt;&gt; To keep track of how many entries

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.200
you have, like how many drug genetic variation responses.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.000
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, So, I do annual reports for the NIH.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.050
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.990
&gt;&gt; And so, over the late years, we have totally

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.300
instrumented the site. We know how many hits every page gets.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.510
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.900
&gt;&gt; We know the most popular pathways

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.770
that people look at, the most popular genes.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.300
&gt;&gt; Name one.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.042
&gt;&gt; so people love coding. And people

00:05:24.042 --> 00:05:24.640
[CROSSTALK]

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.640
&gt;&gt;

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.090
[LAUGH]

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.470
Don't they? Don't they, though.

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.340
&gt;&gt; Exactly, it's a pain reliever. People

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.230
all are very interested in Warfarin. For

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.850
the pathways, those are the ones they like. For the genes, they like some of

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.020
the genes that are involved. There's a

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.920
gene called CYD2P6. Terrible name. Cytochrome P450 2D6

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.270
which is very important for hundreds of drugs. And that's one of our top hits.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.840
&gt;&gt; Wow, and what are people using when they, when,

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.430
when you say it's a top hit, these are probably

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.810
researchers using this information?

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So we learned a long time ago

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:57.460
that people like the Google-type interface. They don't really want to

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.880
do super duper searches, with lots of bells and whistles,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.120
they want to type free text. So, we've optimized our free

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.920
text search on the site the nice thing about that

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.210
is it's real easy to look at the free searches

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.240
and. Categorize what's the average length how many words are

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.780
include what genes, drugs and diseases are being mentioned and

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.590
we can use that to kind of do market research for

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.020
the site. To improve it, because we see what people are typing

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.570
in and we can type those same things in and say do

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.090
we like the answers that were given when somebody types that in?

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.680
&gt;&gt; So, what would you say are, what kinds of tools would you

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.040
like to see in the farm GKB side that maybe aren't there now?

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.840
&gt;&gt; Great question. And we're thinking about this rapidly. this has been

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.900
a website for 13 years. But guess what, there's

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.940
these things called mobile devices. We haven't engineered the site

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.090
for that. But it is loud and clear from our

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:53.350
users that they are at conferences and somebody mentions a

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.010
gene. And they're going to go on their smartphone or

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.810
their iPad or galaxy whatever and they're going to type

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.090
it in though we're working very hard. At how do

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:06.050
you take all this information and just give the highlights

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.470
in a much more restricted real estate stuff.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.030
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.600
&gt;&gt; People all over the world are worrying about

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.260
this, and we are, too. so there's that, but it's

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.430
funny, the other thing is, we have a very

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.420
textual based site. And it's good if you want to read

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.510
text but it's come to our attention that people,

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:23.922
even when they have a lot of monitor space. They

00:07:23.922 --> 00:07:27.970
want to look at prettier graphics, they want to see networks versus

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.310
text, so we're also thinking of re-factoring the whole site

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.700
to produce a network way of thinking about pharmacogenomics.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.950
Like here's a drug and here's all the genes that

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.390
connect to it. Here's a gene and its drug or

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.130
here's a network that connects genes and drugs. And so

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:45.590
we're also prototyping that kind of stuff. So that's

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:48.230
kind of user interface type things that we're doing. On

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:52.860
the content side, we're very interested in pushing these natural

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.600
language processing because our curators. Are starting to see that

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:01.170
they work very hard and the literature is starting to get them overwhelmed.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.890
&gt;&gt; What other resources would you recommend, I mean, is,

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.940
do you want pharm GKB to be sort of the

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.500
one stop shop. Or are there other useful resources that

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.670
you would recommend to people, sort of in conjunction with it?

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:13.980
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, so a couple things. we

00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.860
have this tab based display format right now.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.070
And one of the tabs is other resources.

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.670
And its very important because what we can

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.990
do is since we know the drug or the gene that

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:27.770
the user is currently looking at, we can have super specific

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:31.700
lengths to other information sources about those drugs, about those genes,

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.559
about the diseases that they treat. And so we have those links

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.110
and we are always looking for more links because this is

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.270
what the, this is the beauty of the World Wide Web that

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.580
you can make these connections. In addition to that, sometimes the

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.710
data source is so valuable that we, with the permission of the

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.600
people who are creating it, bring it in to the form

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.805
GKB so we can more tightly integrate that data with our data.

00:08:52.805 --> 00:08:53.180
&gt;&gt; Um-hm.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.460
&gt;&gt; So there's kind of two phase of the

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.610
relationship, the we'll definitely link to you phase. And

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.710
then the, we love you so much that if it's okay with you, we'd like to bring you

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.350
in and make you part of our interface, part

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:05.500
of our the way we represent information. And these

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.080
include basic biological databases, like Gen bank, which holds

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.960
DNA sequence. There's a very valuable drug resource called

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:16.773
drug bank, which we link to. There are the DB gap, which hold

00:09:16.773 --> 00:09:17.502
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:17.502 --> 00:09:22.120
studies. and, and, and, and a long list

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.810
of other links that you find on this site.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.860
&gt;&gt; Sure. I'm curious is online

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:25.930
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.660
daily inheritance in men part of that?

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.810
&gt;&gt; All men are online and inheritance. Great resource. Kills

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.340
us in some ways, because it's great, but it's text based

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:34.640
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.300
&gt;&gt; And it's not super structured.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:36.500
&gt;&gt; No.

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.130
&gt;&gt; It's hard to write computer programs to, to Parse it.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.510
And so, but we do that because it's, it, it is

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:43.640
[CROSSTALK]

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.740
incredible valuable yeah.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.190
&gt;&gt; you mentioned that one of the most popular hits

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:49.980
of things that people are interested in are the warfarin pathways.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:50.110
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:51.610
&gt;&gt; Now why, why is that?

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:57.430
&gt;&gt; So warfarin is pretty much the most advanced case

00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.660
of pharmacogenetics that has been studied. why do I say that?

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.100
Warfarin has more than one drug that impacts its response and

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:09.210
we actually know what a lot of those, more than one

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.090
gene, I'm sorry. Warfarin has more than one gene that's important

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.760
for understanding its response, and we actually know what a lot of

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.500
those genes are and how to combine the information for more

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.010
than one gene. That's, that's a frontier. There are many gene,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.960
drugs for, which we know there are several genes, but we

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.720
don't know how to combine the information yet. We do for Warfarin.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.690
So that's the first thing. The second thing about Warfarin

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.310
is that we also know some of the environmental variables

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:36.990
that affect Warfarin response. How much green, leafy vegetables you're

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:40.260
eating. What your height and weight is. What other drugs

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:44.050
you're on. That all combines to have Warfarin be the

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.600
single best drug that we have for predicting response, based

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.110
on the combination of genetics and environmental factors. The other

00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.410
thing that I should have actually mentioned right off the bat

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.140
is, there are something between 30 and 50

00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.080
million Americans alone on this drug. And probably

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.350
or obviously, twice that or more internationally. So

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.906
we're talking about 100 million people on this drug.

00:11:06.906 --> 00:11:11.160
there are new drugs coming out that are hoping to knock it off as the leader.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.170
But today Warfarin is still an incredibly important

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:18.910
drug worldwide and so accurate dosing. Especially for a

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:21.330
dangerous drug like Warfarin, as you may know, Warfarin is

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.960
an anticoagulant. It makes it harder to clot your blood. That's

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.790
good if you've had a heart attack. It's good if

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.420
you've had a stroke. It's good if you've had a clot

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:33.140
in your lung or in your legs, but if you

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.850
have too much of it, it can kill you with internal

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:39.150
spontaneous hemorrhage. So there's this very narrow range, we have

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.010
to get it right. And that's where the genetics can help.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:44.030
&gt;&gt; Right it sounds like thud clouding. It's obviously important

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.510
when we cut ourselves and we're bleeding, but you

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.530
know if it's blocking our heart that's not so

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:52.830
good. will, you mentioned that there's so many people

00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:57.100
on Warfarin. the variation in the human genome that

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.080
exists on the PharmGKB site, for example, does it

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.260
sort of separate, is it able to document the

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.990
pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic pathways separately? Does it combine

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.650
them? How do you, how do you present that information?

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:08.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.730
so, we Those are two separates, good for you

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.600
for knowing about this, and good for your class.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.480
in the case of Warfarin, there are both pharmacokinetic

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.690
and pharamcodeterminants to the response. And there are genetic

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.610
variations on the pharmacokinetic side that change the rate

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:27.180
at which it's metabolized, and one of the most

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.190
important genes it's called CYP2C9. there's another one called

00:12:31.190 --> 00:12:34.310
a CYP4F2 but 2C9 to take as an example.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.270
It's well known that if you're going to metabolize

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.340
warfarin more slowly, you're going to need less of

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.020
it. And, and if you take the normal

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:46.170
dose when you're a slow metabolizer you're going to wind

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.630
up with effectively in overdose and too much

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.070
bleeding. There on the pharmacodynamics side there's a gene,

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.900
again with a terrible name. It's called VKORC1

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:59.570
or Vitamin K oxidoreductase component 1. which is actually

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.430
the target. It's, it's the, it's the protein which

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.950
the drug Warfarin binds to, to inhibit clotting, and there

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:09.570
are some variations Both inside this gene but also

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:11.670
in the control region of the gene that it controls

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:15.900
its expression that markedly changed its levels. And there

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.440
are some variations that are very important for determining Warfin

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.470
go in that. So it's a great story because there's

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.730
this one PD gene that seems dominant, there's one PK

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:29.140
gene that seems dominant. Together you can come darn close to

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.150
predicting what the right dose will be for, for an individual patient.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.710
&gt;&gt; Even without needing to see them clinically first?

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.200
&gt;&gt; That's right, you, it does, you do best if you

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.660
have their age, because there are some age effects and gender. There's

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:47.280
some sex effects. the genetics, and then ethnicity You would hope that

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.780
ethnicity would drop out. Because you would hope that once we have

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:53.520
the genetic measurements. Who cares what your ancestor is. But,

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.860
I must say that our ability to predict dose for African

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.060
descent people is still not as good. And, so in

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:03.050
our lab we're working very hard. The hypothesis would be that

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.310
there are additional genetic variations seen in that population that

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:10.030
had not been studied yet. But, with knowledge of those, we'll

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.510
be able to get our level of prediction for African

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:14.970
decent people to be as good as where we are now

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:16.240
for European and Asian decent.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:18.110
&gt;&gt; That's wonderful. I want to ask you one

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:21.770
more question, generically. if somebody is taking this course and

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:26.360
they are super excited about the idea of pharmacogenetics, pharmacogenomics,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.920
what advice did you give them to pursue this interest.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:34.120
&gt;&gt; So, as a patient or as, as a researcher?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.920
&gt;&gt; As a learner, do both separately

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.080
&gt;&gt; As a patient they're increasingly companies

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.520
out there that are not only providing, so I

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.870
know that your class knows about 23andMe. That's not

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.410
meant for clinical purposes, but nonetheless, the quality is

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.310
quite good and you can get at least a suggestion

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:54.690
of what some of your drug responses might be.

00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:59.240
I know there more formal clinically approved testing facilities

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.610
that will check your genetics. And then give our

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.190
report to your physician that would allow them to that

00:15:05.190 --> 00:15:08.060
your physician to make decisions about drug dosing. In

00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:12.270
terms of learning more, there are some conferences there's well

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:15.890
I'm a president of the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology.

00:15:15.890 --> 00:15:18.890
Which has an annual conference where pharmacogenomics is featured. It's

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:21.110
not the only thing but it's one of the things

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:23.980
at this conference. The American Society for Human Genetics has

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.920
a great conference that's going to be in Boston in 2013.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:30.870
That makes this tape dated, sorry, it was in Boston

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:36.000
in 2013. there are also actually there's Twitter

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.540
feeds and there's something called the genetics alliance. Which

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.380
is a bunch of patient grassroots group that

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.370
wants to see more genetics used in medicine. My

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.910
friend Eric Topple in San Diego has a

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.610
great course on genomics and medicine that he teaches

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.060
down in San Diego every year. For clinicians

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.320
and I bet you there are some non-clinicians that

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.770
attend that. and then there are conferences that kind

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.290
of pop up all the time. So I think

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.100
that's one way to do it, it's getting increasingly

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:10.240
played in the media, because people, it resonates with people

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.550
very much, that their genetic background would affect how

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:16.080
the respond to drugs. So it doesn't take long

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.600
to convince somebody that this is not an unreasonable

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.430
thing to think about. And unfortunately, we don't know how

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:26.070
our parents. One of the things that we don't get get from grandma and grandpa is

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:28.680
how they've responded to their drugs in general.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.760
And, you inherit that just as you inherit your

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.460
height and your eye color. But that is

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.780
often lost in the family lore. And so genetics

00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:37.980
now gives us a chance to recapture that

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:40.060
So we can use it for the patient's benefit.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.050
&gt;&gt; So tell me, wave of the future in medicine or not?

00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:46.770
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. So, I would be disappointed

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:50.390
if in the next ten years, I'm already aware of

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.755
local implementations of pharmacogentics in some of the leading places.

00:16:53.755 --> 00:16:57.780
St. Jude's Medical Center, Vanderbilt, University of Maryland We're trying

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.620
to get things going here at Stanford. So, some of

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.370
these places are already giving trials. I'm I think those

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.130
trials will be successful. And then you'll start seeing it

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:08.470
becoming kind of a standard of care. And at that

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.800
point they'll be an expectation that this is part of the

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.630
elementarian, and in medicine, which would be incredibly

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.339
exciting. And then all of this work we've

00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:19.839
been doing. Putting together the data base. Writing

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:23.810
the guidelines. What kind of habits desired ultimate effect.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.470
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for chatting with me.

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:27.030
&gt;&gt; It's my pleasure. Thanks for doing this.

00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:27.930
&gt;&gt; Of course.
