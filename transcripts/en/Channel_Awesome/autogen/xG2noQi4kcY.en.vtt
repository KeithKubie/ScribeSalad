such a great payoff that it carries the
 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.509
such a great payoff that it carries the
rest of the film even though the film

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519
rest of the film even though the film
 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.360

00:18:13.859 --> 00:18:13.869
the cheap eventually comes onboard and
 

00:18:13.869 --> 00:18:15.419
the cheap eventually comes onboard and
then you know they open up this front

00:18:15.419 --> 00:18:15.429
then you know they open up this front
 

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:17.700
then you know they open up this front
basically against the empire and I would

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:17.710
basically against the empire and I would
 

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:20.970
basically against the empire and I would
have way like show basically a map of

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:20.980
have way like show basically a map of
 

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.680
have way like show basically a map of
like Endor like all these Ewoks

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:22.690
like Endor like all these Ewoks
 

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.419

someone's be like there's hundreds of
 

00:18:24.429 --> 00:18:25.830
someone's be like there's hundreds of
these settlements like the M and the

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840
these settlements like the M and the
 

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.239

00:18:27.249 --> 00:18:28.560
Empire is just so arrogant they just
don't give it's like caring about these

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:28.570
don't give it's like caring about these
 

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.720
don't give it's like caring about these
things like because they're not

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:30.730
things like because they're not
 

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:32.009
things like because they're not
expecting an attack and it makes just

00:18:32.009 --> 00:18:32.019
expecting an attack and it makes just
 

00:18:32.019 --> 00:18:34.259
expecting an attack and it makes just
more sense that like okay they could

00:18:34.259 --> 00:18:34.269
more sense that like okay they could
 

00:18:34.269 --> 00:18:35.190
more sense that like okay they could
take them out even though they're

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200
take them out even though they're
 

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.810
take them out even though they're
technologically inferior which is why I

00:18:36.810 --> 00:18:36.820
technologically inferior which is why I
 

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:39.090
technologically inferior which is why I

the Wookiees like I could see that to a
 

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:49.019
the Wookiees like I could see that to a
point where I'm like I don't even think

00:18:49.019 --> 00:18:49.029
point where I'm like I don't even think
 

00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:50.879
point where I'm like I don't even think
it's a fair fight because I'm like

00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:50.889

00:18:57.539 --> 00:18:57.549
point and I really enjoyed it it's like
 

00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:59.190
point and I really enjoyed it it's like
a very Tolkien kind of sentiment of like

00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200
a very Tolkien kind of sentiment of like
 

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.369
