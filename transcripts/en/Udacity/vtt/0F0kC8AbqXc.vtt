00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.620
Lot of people are faced
with this problem of

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.540
how do you evaluate the level of
security that comes with the system.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.970
No one more concerned about this then,
for example, the Defense Department.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.660
They have a lot of sensitive data.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.830
So they actually address this problem
of how do you do security evaluation?

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.820
How do you establish how trustworthy or

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.080
level of assurance, level of trust that
you can associate with a given system?

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.800
And they actually came up with a trusted
computer system evaluation criteria.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.540
This is work that goes
back to actually the 80s.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.890
And this is called the Orange Book or
TCSEC Requirements.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.370
Trusted Computer System
Evaluation Criteria.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.780
What you see here is,
actually it doesn't the color.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.090
Actually it is orange.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.880
Copy the color page of that report.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.780
Now one of the people who were involved
in designing that, Roger Shell,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.510
who signed it, my copy.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.750
So I just provided you
a picture of that.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.840
So the question is if you
are sort of tasked with this,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.350
develop a sort of violation
criteria that we can use to

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.840
assess the trustworthiness or
security of the system.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.100
What would be those criteria?

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.020
I think some of the discussions we have
had for example about functionality and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.260
how well it's done and so

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.820
on, should actually factor into these
requirements that we're going to have.

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.450
So the Orange Book that I mentioned sort
of captured the evaluation criteria,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.660
and came up with sort of way to
place a system in a division,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.040
and within a division, a certain class.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.430
So, the four divisions were D,
C, B and A.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.330
The less than really refers
to the least trustworthy and

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.000
we'll see why D was
the least trustworthy.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.690
And A was the highest level of trust.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.260
And within that, for example,
the division C had C1 and C2, so C1

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.080
doesn't do certain things that C2 does
for it to be more trustworthy, okay?

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.150
So this ordering that we have
is going from least trustworthy

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.810
to the highest level of trust.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.250
B1, B2, B3 means three classes
within the duration B.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.450
Well, D really didn't
have to do anything.

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.640
If you didn't do, think about
your old MS Dos, if you didn't

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.720
isolate the trusted computing base
from untrusted code, basically

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.930
untrusted code could hook operating
system functions in whatever way.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.110
There's no protection against tampering,
bypassing, or things like that.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.060
See, one of the things it has to do is
do authentication and access control.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.660
Okay?.
Access control.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.480
It only has to do discretionary
access control but

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.000
of course to do access control it
also has to do authentication and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.390
if it does that then it addresses
a bunch of other things.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.430
Just sort of giving you
quick highlights here but

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.800
of course in a TC isolation and
stuff like that has to be here too.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.920
So that places you in division C.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.510
If you implemented
mandatory access control.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.540
For example, BLP like model, where
that will move you up to division B.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.610
And you can verify,
use formal verification techniques.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.490
Specification in verification.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.990
If you went that far,
then that's what will be needed for

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.620
you to get into division A.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.870
Most systems that we use that
the security features that they provide,

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.540
commercial systems that are widely
deployed, they're basically in

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.350
the C division and C1, C2, or
whether they move up to get B1,

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.610
of course,
they have to do mandatory axis control.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.920
So we said SELinux, for example,
does implement Mac So C1 and

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.690
C2 actually depends on
what functionality.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.680
So here it, shouldn't be confused by
the fact that this we're talking about

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.880
functionality with discretionary and
mandatory access control.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.220
This is actually how well effort you put
into making sure there are no problems.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:58.010
So it's how well you you do,
you testing, testing,

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.970
based on all these auditing support and
audit logs and things like that.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.670
You will have different classes, but the
main idea here is that most systems that

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.320
we use widely these days,
they basically division C some

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.269
implement Mac features and they get
into this division B1 that I have.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.400
If you want to move up to B2 for
example, what you may have to do is,

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.750
you have to, whatever security
model that your system is,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.080
underlies your system, you have to have
a proof of correctness for that model.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.700
Or you also have to have a speck for
the TCB.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.240
It doesn't have to formally done,
but you have to have a narrative

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.480
specification of the TCB and
what it does.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.730
Of course if you want
to move up to B3 or

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.750
A1 beside that's formal verification
that you have to do an,

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.720
that the TCB is implemented
correctly and things like that.
