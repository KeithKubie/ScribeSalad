00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.870
The demonstrations you are about to see are
for educational and entertainment purposes

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.890
only, and are not intended to be duplicated.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.179
Get out your container of liquid nitrogen,
and grab a box of neapolitan ice cream. This

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.460
is the type of ice cream that has 3 flavors
in one, so go ahead and separate the colors

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.130
into different containers, and give them a
couple of minutes to melt. In the meantime,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.340
we'll need to fill a bowl, with liquid nitrogen.
This stuff is -321ºF (-196ºC), which means

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.859
it well below the freezing point, of your
party guests. Now if you try dripping your

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.370
flavors in, one drop at a time, you'll notice
they instantly bead up, and freeze solid.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.170
When you've got all the flavors you need,
simply scoop the tasty pellets into a serving

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.070
bowl, and voila! You've got a futuristic ice
cream, ready to serve, and enjoy.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.949
Load up a bowl with mini marshmallows, and
sprinkle liquid nitrogen over the top. The

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.180
marshmallows should freeze instantly, but
go ahead and let them soak for about 30 seconds

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.780
just to be sure. The end result is a sub-zero
"chill pill", that's perfectly fine to eat,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.960
and lets you see your breath when you crunch
into it. Now, if you flash-freeze a larger

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.920
marshmallow, rather than eating it, try placing
it on a plate and giving it a smack. It'll

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.660
shatter into a thousand pieces.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.560
For this trick you'll need a glass bottle
with a narrow neck, and a party horn with

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.630
a little hot glue, added around the bottom.
When it gets placed in the bottle, it should

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.780
make a nice, snug fit. Now carefully pour
the liquid nitrogen, so the bottle is a quarter

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.170
full, followed by a shot of hot water. You
can see that when the horn is pressed into

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.979
place, it becomes a crazy noisemaker, that
blows all on it's own. If you get a few of

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.239
these going, you can really make some noise.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.759
When there isn't enough pressure to keep the
horns going, try adding more hot water to

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.220
the bottle, and place a balloon over the top.
There will still be enough pressure shooting

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.430
up, to inflate the balloons, all on their
own. It will save you the effort, and the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.650
gas inside is completely harmless.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.300
Cut the top off an empty soda can, and fill
it up with more liquid nitrogen. If you let

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.530
the can sit for a few minutes, the extreme
cold, will pull oxygen out of the air, and

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.470
trap it at the bottom. Now try dipping a super
strong magnet into the liquid, and when you

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.980
pull it out, you'll have liquid oxygen stuck
to the bottom. At least until it warms up,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.140
and boils off.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.860
Blow up a bunch of little party balloons,
and soak them in a container of liquid nitrogen,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.709
so they shrink down to nothing. Then quickly
scoop them all into a bowl, and stand back

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.930
to watch the magic. Rising from a layer of
mysterious flowing fog, your little balloon

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.450
babies, begin to grow right before your eyes,
spilling over and covering the table. They

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.030
grow up so fast, don't they?

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.900
Fill one of your small balloons with helium,
and shrink it down in liquid nitrogen, like

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:45.150
you did the others. Scoop it out and place
it down on a table to see what happens. You'll

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.620
notice that after a few seconds, it suddenly
pops upright, then takes off like a little

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.280
UFO. Your friends should be impressed, to
see your little creation grow up, and begin

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.480
to fly.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.590
Well now you know 7 different party tricks,
with liquid nitrogen. If you liked this project,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.870
perhaps you'll like some of my others. Check
