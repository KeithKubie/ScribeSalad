00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.790
Welcome back.

00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:04.320
I'm now going to actually do a
couple more rates of change

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.480
problems because I think the
first one I did was probably a

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.420
little bit more complicated
than I wanted, and the hard

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.460
part was actually the geometry
and not the calculus.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.660
So let's just say I drop
a rock into a pond

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.140
and it has a ripple.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.250
And the ripple spreads out--
it'll probably have multiple

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.760
ripples, but let's just say
we focus on one ripple.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.450
And the ripple is
spreading out.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.550
So let me draw.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.560
This is where I dropped the
rock, and then this is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.000
a ripple in the pond.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.310
It would be an actual
circle, which isn't what

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:34.780
I drew, but close enough.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.310
So let me say that--
let's call r.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.800
r is not for ripple.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.330
r is the distance that the
ripple is from the center

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.440
from where it started
from the get go.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.320
And it's not by chance that
that's also for radius.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.700
So let's say that the
ripple is moving out at

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.720
2 meters per second.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.400
So the rate at which r is
changing with respect to t

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.660
is 2 meters per second.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.190
And what I want to know is what
is the rate at which the area

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.250
that's kind of included by this
ripple-- this entire area-- how

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.430
fast is that changing
with respect to time.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.840
When the ripple is let's say
3 meters from the center.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.430
When the ripple is
equal to 3 meters.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.530
Well do we know any relation
between the area of the circle

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.690
essentially, and the distance
of the ripple, or the radius?

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.250
Well yes we do.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:57.770
Area is equal to pi r squared.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.290
So we want to figure out the
rate at which area changes

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.220
with respect to time.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.630
So what does a chain
rule tell us?

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.270
The chain rule tells us that
the rate at which a changes

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.890
with respect to t is equal to
the rate at which a changes

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.490
with respect to r times the
rate at which r changes

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.910
with respect to t.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.120
Well we already know
this piece, right?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.990
We already know the rate
at which r is changing

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.270
with respect to time.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.010
That's right here.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.270
All we have to do to figure out
the rate at which a is changing

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:34.320
with respect to time is we have
to figure out the rate at which

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.320
a changes with respect to r.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.410
Well that's just
the derivative.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.230
The derivative with
respect to r.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.260
The derivative with respect to
r-- do it of both sides-- of a

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:58.076
equals the derivative with
respect to r of pi r squared.

00:02:58.076 --> 00:03:04.160
So we get da/dr is equal
to-- what's the derivative

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.250
with respect to r here?

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.850
Well that's easy.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.390
Just 2 times pi r to the 1.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.660
That's pretty interesting by
itself that the rate at which

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.650
the derivative of the area--
formula really-- is what?

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.100
This formula by itself
looks interesting, right?

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.350
That's a formula for the
circumference of a circle.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.590
So the derivative of an area of
a circle with respect to the

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.690
radius is a circumference.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.510
That is mildly fascinating.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.070
Something even more interesting
is to figure out what the

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.270
antiderivative is of the area
and compare that to the

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.740
volume of a sphere.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.700
You can look it up on
Wikipedia or something.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.465
Or even compare that to the
surface area of the sphere, and

00:03:54.465 --> 00:03:57.570
just keep picking derivatives
and integrals and they'll be

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.960
some pretty interesting
relationships.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:59.350
But anyway.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.030
Back to the problem.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.060
Not to go on too
far of a tangent.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.420
So we figured out the
rate at which 8 changes

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.460
with respect to r.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.380
So going back to our original
thing, we now know that the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:15.230
rate at which a changes with
respect to t is equal to the

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.790
rate at which a changes
with respect to r.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.116
Well that's just
right here, right?

00:04:20.116 --> 00:04:22.280
The rate at which a changes
with respect to r.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.760
Well that's just 2 pi r times
the rate at which r is

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.700
changing with respect to t.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:32.720
Well the rate at which r
changes with respect to

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.880
t is just right here.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.400
2 meters per second,
we figured that out.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.970
So 2 pi r times 2-- well I
won't include the units

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.195
because that might
confuse you right now.

00:04:47.195 --> 00:04:49.135
So the rate at at which a
is changing with respect

00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:50.560
to t is 2 pi r times 2.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.840
Well are we done yet?

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.880
Well no, because we haven't
substituted yet for r.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.930
So what is r?

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:03.300
Well we know. r is three
meters, so da/dt is equal to

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.230
2 times pi times 3 times 2.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.090
So what is that?

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.610
2 times 3 is 6 times 2 is 12.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.850
12 pi and it's meters squared
per second, because it's the

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.280
rate at which area-- square
meters-- is changing

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.110
with respect to time.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.320
And if we multiply out the
units we would have gotten

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.490
the same thing right here.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.990
So in the next video i'm going
to do a slightly harder rate of

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.700
change problem just so that you
see that it doesn't only apply

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.730
to kind of purely
geometric things.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.350
It applies to pretty much
anything that you can

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.990
find a relationship
between two values.

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.360
See you in the next module.
