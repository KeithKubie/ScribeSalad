00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.780
I thought we'd talk about the laws of thermodynamics, and maybe the second law in particular.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:09.140
So there are four laws: there are laws one to three, and then there's law zero,

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.200
which I suspect was slotted in after the first three laws,

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.720
and is actually, in some sense, also the most trivial of them.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.300
Which is why it's probably called the zeroth law.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.760
So the zeroth law just basically says:

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.940
If you've got three bodies -- call them A, B and C --

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.660
if A and B are in thermal equilibrium with each other,

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.760
which is just a fancy way of saying they're the same temperature,

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.760
which means if you put them together no heat flows from one to the other.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.500
So if A and B are in thermal equilibrium,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.880
and if A and C are in thermal equilibrium,

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.140
then B and C will be in thermal equilibrium.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.620
It does seem fairly obvious. It's a kind-of a formal way of saying really there is only one definition of temperature.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.240
And that there is no way you can come up with a system where

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.480
temperature is defined in a funny way such that one of these bodies has some peculiar property,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.940
such that its temperature as far as body A is concerned is one thing,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.780
but its temperature as far as body C is concerned is another thing.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.340
And I think because it is stating the obvious I think that's why it is the zeroth law.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.100
So the first law is also fairly obvious,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.280
in that its basically a sort-of restatement of the conservation of energy.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.880
In thermodynamics there's kind-of two sorts of energy:

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.680
There's useful energy, which is work.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.420
So that's when if you push something, or whatever, that's sort-of applying energy to it, and that's useful energy.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.260
And then there's useless energy, which is heat.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.220
And what the first law says, is that if you've got a body,

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.820
and you apply a certain amount of work to it,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.180
so that's one sort of energy,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.160
and then you add a certain amount of heat to it,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.220
the total energy of that body will be whatever it was to start with,

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.700
plus the energy you added from the work, plus the energy you added from the heat.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060
So it's really just the statement of the conservation of energy really.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.840
So they are kind-of obvious laws, but you have to start with the basic building blocks

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.280
in order to build up the entire subject of thermodynamics,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.160
and these are, really, the most fundamental building blocks.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.260
The third is difficult to talk about until we introduce the concept of a thing called entropy.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.500
Which is to do with the disorder of the system.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.980
And the third law is basically saying that, as you cool a system down towards absolute zero,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.440
the degree of disorder, so this quantity entropy, drops towards zero

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.400
or at least drops to a very low value.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.400
So classically it will drop to zero... there are some sorts of systems it'll just drop to a low value...

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.420
but it will decrease until you get to absolute zero and then it will stop.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.560
So the second law has various formulations...

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.760
The first formulations were put together really before this idea of entropy and disorder was invented.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.220
And they were very kind-of operational definitions of it.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.900
So there are two classical statements of the second law of thermodynamics:

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.460
The first is one due to a guy called Clausius,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:48.040
who said that heat wont travel from a cold body to a hot body.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.660
And that's sort-of trivially known if you've just got a hot body and a cold body,

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.140
and you put them in contact with each other, the heat will flow from the hot thing to the cold thing,

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.040
so they'll end up at the same temperature, they'll meet somewhere in the middle.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.780
And so it's kind-of obvious if you're just putting things in contact with each other

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.100
but his statement is stronger than
that, which is there is nothing you can do

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.900
to make heat flow from a cold body to
a hot body, without putting some work in.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.660
So if you're prepared to inject some
energy you can make hot things colder

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.420
and cold things hotter.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.420
And so a fridge is an example where you pump heat out of something which is already cold

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.520
and add it to the air which is warmer.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.220
So fridges, in some sense, they violate the
purist view of this law

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.660
that you can't get heat to travel from
something cold something hot,

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.200
but the get-out is "but you're putting work in, so you're allowed to do it".

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.280
So if you've just got an isolated
system you can't do it.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.120
It's a one-way street, and there's no way around it is the important point,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.420
that no matter how clever a machine you come up with,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.220
you can never make it so it will extract the heat from the colder thing

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.160
and add it to the hotter thing without having to put some work in along the way

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.420
So that was Clausius' statement and then there's the other statement

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.920
and that's, in some sense, that's a sort of physicists statement

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.840
because that's about, you-know, heat flow and observations of what happens

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.620
when you put bodies in contact with each other.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.987
The second version of this is due to
Lord Kelvin,

00:04:03.987 --> 00:04:06.880
and Kelvin's statement is more of an engineer's statement.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.200
This comes back to this fact that there are these two sorts of energy:

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.200
this kind-of useful energy, that you can do work with,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.165
and this useless energy, heat, that you can't really do work with directly.

00:04:16.165 --> 00:04:21.760
And Kelvin's statement basically says that you can't turn heat directly into work.

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.080
You can't just take heat and turn it into into useful energy.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.000
Now of course again, you do this... a steam engine, for example, takes heat and turns it into work...

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.780
But in order to do that, you have to have waste heat left over.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.120
So his statement is that you can't, again, have a kind-of sealed box, where you just put heat in at the top

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.060
and the only thing that comes out is work.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.880
You're always going to have to have: heat going in, work coming out,

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.620
but then some waste heat coming out as well.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.640
There is a fundamental limit as to how little the amount of waste heat there is

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.000
that you can get out of it... And you can figure out what that limit is...

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.040
But it's always a finite amount.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.260
You can never reduce that to some, you-know, completely infinitesimal zero level.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.900
Those two things sound like completely different statements,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.260
like they're talking about completely different things,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.520
but it turns out they're exactly equivalent to one another.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.740
And I can show you, if you like.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.880
So the way we're going to do this is by saying if

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.450
one of these versions of the second law isn't true then the other one isn't true either.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.280
So, let's assume... lets violate Clausius's
statement of the second law

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.600
which basically says "you can't get heat to
flow from the cold body to the hot body".

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.240
So let's assume we have a magic fridge,
which violates that law

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.260
by actually allowing us to suck energy out of the cold body,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.380
put it into the hot body without actually having to plug the fridge into the mains.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.640
Okay?

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.070
And then over here I'm going to just have an engine, like a steam engine or something,

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:45.000
which doesn't violate any of the laws at
all, and I'm going to take an amount of energy out of this hot body.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.100
And because this isn't breaking any laws there has to be some waste heat from it.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.260
So we'll set it up so that amount of weight heat is actually equal to Q1.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:52.860
[Brady] Keeping Lord Kelvin Happy.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.060
[Professor Merrifield] So, yes exactly, that's not violating any of the laws

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.200
and we're going to get some work out of this, which is just the difference between those two.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.500
This is the first law again that says
that you have to conserve energy overall,

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.520
so if we've got Q2 flowing in and then the amount of work we get out of there is the difference between the two.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.000
Now, the neat part here is that what we've managed effectively to do...

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.800
If I just draw a box around this little lot here...

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:25.080
And so I'm going to stick all that in a box and I'm not going to care what's inside that box.

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.260
And what that box is actually doing is it's taking an amount of energy...

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.800
well how much energy is coming in? it's taking heat out of this body...

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.780
and it's taking
an amount... well theres Q2 flowing out and Q1 flowing back in,

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.020
so the amount of
energy that's coming out of this hot body is Q2 minus Q1...

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.400
And this box then, the only thing that's coming out of it is work.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.820
Q2 minus Q1.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:48.760
So this now violates Kelvin's version of the second law,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.560
because actually all we've done in this process

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.640
is we've taken an amount of heat out of the hot body and turned it directly into work,

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.980
and Kelvin's statement of the law says you can't do that.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.400
[Brady] Professor, that shouldn't be a surprise because we built the box by breaking the rules...

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.140
[Brady] we just broke Clausius's wording of the rules.

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.480
[Professor Merrifield] Exactly! But what we're trying to show is that those two statements of the second law

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.680
are the same as each other, they're really stating the same law.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.980
And so, indeed, if they are the same law, you'd expect

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.480
if you broke one version of the law you'd break the other version of the law as well.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.620
But if they're actually different laws, or stating different things, then that wouldn't necessarily be the case.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.240
But that's kind of halfway there...

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:27.280
that shows that if we violate Clausius's version then we're violating Kelvin's version,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.900
but to really show they're equivalent we've also got the show that

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.900
if we violate Kelvin's version we're also violating Clausius's version.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:39.180
Okay, so Kelvin's version of the law says that you can't just turn energy into work.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.920
So you can't just take heat and turn it directly into work: there has to be a by-product.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.500
So let's violate that by coming up with
a magical engine

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.440
which directly turns energy, turns heat, into work.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:57.320
An engine which which does nothing but take this useless energy, heat, and turn it directly is useful energy, work,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.420
An infinitely efficient steam engine... In a
real steam engine there'd be waste heat coming out of the bottom.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.080
But we're violating Kelvin's law here so we don't have to do that.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.940
Okay, and then we're going to take that work,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:11.180
and we're going to use it to power a fridge.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.440
And that fridge will... because this is now a proper fridge, it's not violating Clausius's law or anything...

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:24.360
...we can get it to work.  So we've plugged it into the mains and we can actually use it to suck energy, Q2, out.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.000
So we can figure out how much heat's going to come out the other end.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.820
It's just going to be the two lots of
energy going in. That's Q1 and Q2.

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:37.600
So now, if we just put a box around all this
lot, and say this is this is now my magic machine...

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.100
And I don't really want to
look inside the box I just want to know what it's doing...

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.220
What's happening? It's
sucking an amount of energy, Q2, out of the cold,

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.500
and then, on the hot side, you've
got Q1 coming out and Q1 plus Q2 going in,

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.540
so the net amount of energy flowing into
the hot is Q2.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:58.500
So effectively we've created a machine here where... with nothing, you-know, no external wires or anything...

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:04.580
within that box, it takes in an amount of heat, Q2, from a cold body and adds it to a hot body.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.620
And that violates Clausius's version of the second law.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.940
So what we've shown is that if Kelvin's version of the second law isn't true, then Clausius's version isn't true,

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:17.280
and if Clausius's version of the second law isn't true then Kelvin's version of the second law isn't true.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:21.400
And so, just to kind-of finish it off... So we've got these two laws:

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:23.500
Kelvin's version and Clausius's version.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.260
And there are sort-of four possibilities:

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.600
They might both not be true,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.560
one might be true and the other one might be false,

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.340
or the other way around,

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.920
or they both might be true,

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.620
And what we've ruled out by showing this is

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:43.160
we've shown if Kelvin's law is false then Clausius's has to be false too.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.500
If Clausius's version of the law is false, then Kelvin's can't be true.

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.240
It has to be false as well.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.960
So we ruled out those two in the middle.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.120
So the only two possibilities is they're either both wrong or they're both right.

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.260
And that's just another way of saying that they're saying exactly the same thing.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.200
We haven't been able to prove that they're true, but we've shown that if one of them is true the other's true,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.060
and it's one of them is false, the other one's false.

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.620
In other words, they're kind-of equivalent to each other.
