&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Another cool feature that
I wanted to also highlight was actually taking

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.059
the same principle that Vic already mentioned
earlier today about taking the mobile version

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:13.530
of the Android Market and being able to push
applications directly to your phone.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.700
To, actually, do this demo I would like to
bring up Brittany Bohnet, a member of the

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.720
Google TV team, to help out.
[ Applause ]

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.180
&gt;&gt;Brittany Bohnet: Okay. I am just going to
log in here real quick.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.050
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Okay.
&gt;&gt;Brittany Bohnet: Looks like we are logged

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.140
in.
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: We are logged in? Okay.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.120
&gt;&gt;Brittany Bohnet: Yep.
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Let's go ahead and pull it

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.470
up.
Like Vic showed you earlier today, you can

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.100
take the mobile version of Android Market
and push it to other phones but you can also

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.940
push it to other Android devices. In this
case you will see on the right we have Google

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.220
TV. Actually, just see which box we are on.
Assuming we are on the second box now, Vincent?

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.610
&gt;&gt;Vincent Dureau: Uh-huh.
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: So we might have to switch

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:07.780
that, Brittany, to the other. Try other TV.
Just scroll over it and make sure it's on

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.450
the second one. All right. Let's try this.
We have differing TVs connected so we will

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.070
do this in real time.
Let's go ahead and take a look at the Twitter

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.830
app.
All right.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.840
So here, actually -- why don't we go back.
I think it's the other TV if you go to the

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.400
top right.
&gt;&gt;Brittany Bohnet: Okay.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.820
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: So the second one. Where
it says "other TV."

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.400
That's my code name for box 2.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.970
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Not much -- All right. So
why don't we go ahead and try to download

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.490
that. While we are doing that, Vincent is
actually showing the list of applications

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.150
installed. So go ahead and click it and see.
Give it a few seconds. We are going to have

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:58.590
to check if this is the right box or not.
We might not be -- oh, there it is. All right.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.369
Good.
[ Applause ]

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.939
&gt;&gt;Rishi Chandra: Whew.
And now we can open up the app directly from

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.780
Google TV, and again, it will just work.
