00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.120
So in the last lesson,
you saw this example network.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.230
Hosts A and
B are attached to fast networks, but

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.530
the link between them is slow.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.010
If one of them tried to send to
the other at the speed of the local fast

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.149
network, they'd congest
the link between them.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.570
The router would have to drop traffic
in order to get anything through.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.100
And TCP is smart enough to do slow start

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.210
to avoid congesting
intermediate network links.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.860
But here's a more realistic
example of a network.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.630
Here we have some
servers in a data center

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.500
with an internal network that's
very fast, a 10Gbit ethernet.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.310
And the data center network
is attached to the Internet

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.170
with a link that's pretty fast too,
1 Gbit.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.820
And here are all the users.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.920
There are really a lot of users,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.120
each of whom have internet connections
that are slow by comparison.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.520
Now the capacity of a network link or
of a multilink path to carry data

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.230
in terms of bits per
second is its bandwidth.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.790
And we can talk about the bandwidth of
a link here, but we can also talk about

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:04.459
the bandwidth available from this user
to this server across multiple links.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.070
Now that's generally going to be
the minimum of the bandwidths of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.390
those links.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.060
If your server network is very fast,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.190
that means that your servers can talk
to each other at that high speed.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.880
But if your users' home networks are
very slow, upgrading your server network

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.590
will probably not have any effect
on the speed that your users see.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.500
This may seem obvious but this concept
of a limiting factor turns out to be

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.240
really important in a lot of
server administration situations.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.230
But if you have a large number of
simultaneous users, each of whom was on

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.100
a slow network, all of those slows
may add up to more than a fast.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.320
That's one reason server networks
are typically a lot faster than end

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.590
user networks.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.000
And this has some pretty
significant implications.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.890
If you know how much traffic
a typical user makes and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.030
you know how many
simultaneous users you have,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.100
you can tell how fast this
connection needs to be.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.470
Or on the scary side of things,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.190
if all of these users started hitting
your service as hard as they could,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.980
you could tell how fat this pipe
would have to be in order to hold up.
