CHONGSA KIM: Hi everyone.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:02.558
My name is Chongsa Kim.

00:00:02.558 --> 00:00:04.620
I lead Google Play
Games Partnership

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.280
for the Japanese
market in Tokyo.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.190
As you may know, Japan is
one of the largest markets

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.260
in the space of mobile
gaming, and that is

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.610
true for Google Play as well.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.880
Looking at successful games in
the Japanese market [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.010
is actually playing
a a very big role,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.420
and the developers
are putting it

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.710
at the center of
their growth strategy.

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.160
And more interestingly, what
they're doing for LiveOps

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.130
is sometimes quite unique,
[INAUDIBLE] and [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.410
from those in the
Western regions.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.040
So today I'm going to talk about
the greatest trends of LiveOps

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.380
in Japan, and also
share key insights

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.550
and best practices
learned from there.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.140
So here's today's
agenda for you.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.080
So first of all,
I'm going to talk

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.540
about what LiveOps
is, and explain

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.450
why it's important for
you as game developers.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.090
And then I'm going to explain
a bit about a key market

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.790
difference between Japan
and Western Europe,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.120
and then move onto the
case studies from Japan

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.209
and the lessons
learned from there.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.250
So what is LiveOps?

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.360
I think many of you have already
heard of this definition,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.500
but LiveOps is running
games as a service.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.520
The characteristics
of the smartphone

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.770
as an always connected
device actually

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.320
allow the game developers
to frequently interact

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.560
with the end users by
providing additional content

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.320
and information as a service,
which does not necessarily

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.200
involve traditional APK updates.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.410
So when these services are
provided in the right way,

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.560
it actually drives
user engagement,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.270
stimulates monetization,
and even reduces

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.180
player turn, which has a
significant impact on the life

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.660
cycle of your game.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.330
So what happens when
the service is not

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.380
enough for your end users?

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.810
So this is the typical
revenue trend curve

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.990
that games that deliver content
only via traditional APK

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.190
updates, but not via LiveOps.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.910
For each update, you see
some spikes in revenue,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.180
but it slows down pretty fast,
and you cannot maintain active

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.360
users by the next update, and
the spike size gets smaller

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.350
and smaller each time.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.950
We call this a shark
fin [INAUDIBLE] problem,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.410
and obviously this is
not ideal if you want

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.040
to make your game sustainable.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.460
So in what way does
LiveOps solve this problem?

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.550
So LiveOps is basically
a strategic distribution

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.880
of frequent content updates
in between traditional APK

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.220
updates.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.730
These are basically categorized
into two things, the sales

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.580
and events, and both of them
often contain a new content

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.700
into your game economy.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.600
And typically these are provided
in a limited time basis, which

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.100
is a key for you to motivate
your users to participate

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.430
actively in the activity that
is happening inside our game.

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.780
When these sales and events
are provided in the right way,

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.055
LiveOps can drive a consistent
heartbeat of revenue

00:03:02.055 --> 00:03:04.690
and engagement,
and which helps you

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.210
to avoid shark fin [INAUDIBLE]
problem for your game.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.850
So that is LiveOps.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.750
And from here I like to touch
a bit about the key market

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.430
difference between Japan
and Western Europe,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.250
what's unique about Japan
in the context of LiveOps.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.330
So first of all, Japan is a
really LiveOps heavy market,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.360
compare of the Western
regions, and its daily revenue

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.550
fluctuates a lot due to the
high frequency of LiveOps.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.790
One of the reasons behind
this is the popularity

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.480
of the gacha model.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.930
The gacha is the
in-game lottery system

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.290
which is widely adapted to the
top grossing Japanese games

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.890
as the core
monetization mechanics.

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.640
Because gacha is a really good
fit with our limited time sales

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.700
and events, Japanese
developers run

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.874
a lot of these as a driver for
their revenue and monetization.

00:04:00.874 --> 00:04:03.540
Of course, they are also running
a lot of other types of events,

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.500
like in-game login bonus
and the in-game quests,

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.230
but the gacha is something we
cannot ignore as an important

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.390
part of Japanese
LiveOps culture.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.670
And another reason for
the huge fluctuation

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.070
of daily revenue in
Japan is the first day

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.910
of the month by extradition.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.130
Japan is known as
a country where

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.690
DCB is a really popular form of
payment among the mobile users.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.270
And as you know, DCB
has a monthly cap,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.550
so if you keep the cap in
the middle of the month,

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.120
you have to wait until the
next first day of the month,

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.030
because the cap gets
refreshed on that day.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.000
So knowing that timing,
Japanese developers

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.880
always bring the most
powerful LiveOps event

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.980
on the first day of the month.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.460
And the Japanese users also
know that is the best timing

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.620
to use the money in the game.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.460
So the combination of this
developer strategy and user

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.780
behavior actually comes
together and always causes

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.300
the huge revenue spike on the
first day of the month for most

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.200
of the games altogether, which
is pretty unique for the Japan

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.040
market, I think.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.880
So here's a quick quiz
regarding the uniqueness

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.490
of Japanese LiveOps.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.200
I mentioned that Japan is a
pretty LiveOps heavy market,

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.430
but how many in-game
LiveOps events were actually

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.820
run by a single top
grossing Japanese title

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.010
in the month of March 2017?

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.350
It'd be great if you guys
can participate in the quiz

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.270
by raising your hands.

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.410
Who thinks A, less than 10?

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:37.500
No one.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.070
B, 10 to 50?

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.220
Thank you.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.130
C, 50 to 100, D, 100 to 200--

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.130
looks popular-- and E, over 200.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.960
Seems like D and E are the
most popular options here.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.930
So let's see the answer.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:59.260
The answer is E.
Congratulations for those

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.510
who chose E. Sorry, no
prize for this quiz.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.695
[LAUGHS] No teachers, OK?

00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:08.570
I think, now, you guys
are interested in what

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.820
the exact number is.

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.710
So let's see the exact
number in the next slide.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.180
The answer is 1028.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.040
Thanks for the reaction.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.070
Yeah, over 1,000 events
in the month, which sounds

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.510
like a big number.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.330
And this is just an example,
but now you see how serious

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:29.420
and how committed
Japanese games are,

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.060
regarding the communication
with the users through LiveOps.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.060
So from here I'm
going to talk up

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.330
a bit about case studies from
actual Japanese top grossing

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.550
games, to a bit more deep dive
into their LiveOps strategies.

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.430
The first one is Monster
Strike by Mixi XFLAG Studio,

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:52.390
one of the most popular and
successful Japanese games

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.520
since it's launch
four years ago.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.000
This is a quick overview
of Monster Strike's LiveOps

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.160
seen in the given months.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.340
As you can see, they're
running 1000 LiveOps events

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.530
in the month, which
ranges from the gacha

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:11.130
event for monetization,
and the [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:15.510
of the in-game quest, for the
purpose of engagement uplift.

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:17.190
What's interesting
here to me, is

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.050
that they're running
so many system

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.480
and guerrilla events,
which are basically

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.610
an hour or a few hours long,
super short micro quests,

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.230
operated systematically.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:32.340
You know, if you run 900
events in a month by manual,

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.940
you need a lot of work,
and it's almost impossible.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.210
So Mixi actually design
the game from scratch

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:42.690
to be able to offer these
micro quests effectively

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:45.150
and efficiently by
system and automation,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.380
so that they are able to deploy
such a large number of quests

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.120
in a month.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:57.030
However, if you think about it,
if you have hundreds of LiveOps

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.590
in your game, it is
very easy for your users

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:01.790
to get lost if they
don't understand

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.680
what matters for them.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:07.480
So it is very important for
you to organize the LiveOps

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.300
events to avoid your
users getting swamped

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.700
by the flood of LiveOps.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.410
So from the next
slide, I'm going

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.560
to introduce to you how Mixi
actually designed the LiveOps

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.260
calendar in the yearly,
monthly and daily basis.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.670
The first one is yearly cycle.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:30.850
For a character based
game like Monster Strike,

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:32.500
the best content
for monetization

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.169
is always additional
legendary character

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:40.230
which has significant
skills and parameters.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:45.230
So Mixi basically runs this
type of flagship, heavy LiveOps

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:49.110
gacha events every three months,
considering the seasonality

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:50.820
and so on.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.890
According to Mixi,
the once in three

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.250
months is kind of a magic
number from their four years'

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.620
experience, because if users
are exposed too frequently

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:05.240
to this type of heavy events,
they get tired of catching up,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.960
and they eventually
leave the game.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.930
So rather than increasing the
number of these heavy LiveOps

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:14.922
events, Mixi rather focuses on
maximizing the revenue spike

00:09:14.922 --> 00:09:15.630
for each of them.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.650
And zooming into
the monthly cycle,

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.450
Monster Strike generally
has a consistent beat

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.050
of revenue spike in
a bi-weekly basis.

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.810
This is because
they are following

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.870
the first day of the month spike
tradition in the Japan market,

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:36.260
and also place a mid-size
LiveOps is in between these,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.380
to keep your core users engaged.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:41.560
Precisely speaking, they
are actually running

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.040
a lot of other events in between
these, but that they stick

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:47.830
to this cadence with
a strong gacha event

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.140
to keep the good
rhythm of excitement

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:53.080
for their core users,
which is especially

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.100
for the paying users.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.610
And they also care
a lot about when

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:01.860
to deploy, what kind
of events in a day,

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.200
from the relevancy
point of view.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:08.160
For example, they deploy
the gacha events typically

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.900
around lunchtime, because
they want their users who just

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.550
got a new character
through the gacha,

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:16.580
to show off that to
your real friends

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:18.080
who are eating their
lunch together,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.910
and who hopefully play
the game together.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.510
And on the other hand,
regarding the quests that

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.400
require some level
of concentration,

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.050
they typical deploy these around
commit time, or after dinner,

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:33.390
when users typically
play the game alone

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.770
with a lot of concentration.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:40.170
So in these ways Mixi is
carefully designing the LiveOps

00:10:40.170 --> 00:10:43.140
calendar to help
their users enjoy

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.020
surfing on the various sides
of the webs of the LiveOps.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.530
So now let's do a bit more deep
dive into one of the flagship

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:59.440
LiveOps events, which happens
only once in three months.

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.260
The example here is
a special gacha event

00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.590
which featured the new
legendary character called

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.300
Pandora, this cute girl.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.506
And this event was especially
successful for Mixi

00:11:11.506 --> 00:11:16.390
because it drove 150% year
over year increase in revenue.

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:19.495
So let's take a look at Mixi's
efforts behind this big moment.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.190
The first one is quantity
control of in-game currencies

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:28.190
owned by users.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.989
When you have a
huge monetization

00:11:30.989 --> 00:11:32.655
moment in your game
in terms of LiveOps,

00:11:32.655 --> 00:11:35.595
it is very important
to create an idea

00:11:35.595 --> 00:11:40.010
of the status of the
in-game economy beforehand.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.440
For example, if
users have too many

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.630
unconsumed in-game
currencies already,

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:47.210
they just spend these
when LiveOps come in,

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.130
and they don't really
purchase new IAP,

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:52.612
which could be a problem
for your monetization.

00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:56.320
So Mixi actually tracks the
quantity of in-game currency

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.920
that is owned by users as
one of the key metrics,

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.210
and accumulated a small LiveOps
before the flagship gacha

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:07.350
event, and created an ideal
or state of in-game economy

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:11.440
prior to that big monetization
moment for the game.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:14.740
And also they went
beyond in-game operations

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:18.970
and added out of the
game, media mix activities

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.640
to promote the LiveOps event.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.160
For example, this
character Pandora

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.660
was introduced first in the
YouTube anime of Monster Strike

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:31.120
three days before the
actual in-game event,

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.820
and then the details
of the characters,

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.800
like skills and
the parameters, got

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.600
revealed in their in-house
influencer video on YouTube.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.700
And then every TV
commercial wants

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:46.850
aired to promote this
LiveOps campaign after that.

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.270
I know it sounds like
a lot of investment,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.500
but for Mixi, actually it
was a really natural thing,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.640
because they are
putting it at the center

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.005
of their monetization strategy.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:02.440
And even more, they added
several significant marketing

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:05.140
activities before the
Pandora gacha event,

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:08.200
which includes a massive
giveaway of in-game items,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.630
and even real goods,
like a travel ticket,

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:12.650
to the active users
of Monster Strike

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:14.320
during the holiday seasons.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.140
And also the large scale
fan community event

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.890
in the e-sports
tournament, which

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:23.700
gathered over 20,000
people in Tokyo on site.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.200
These marketing activities
were not directly

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.600
related to this
specific gacha event,

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.210
but were strategically
placed before that,

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:36.320
to maximize to active user
base, to make the big monetizing

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.020
moment of that.

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:43.200
So what's the result
by doing all of these?

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.166
So here's a chart you
would be interested in.

00:13:46.166 --> 00:13:49.530
Actually, Monster Strike had
been facing this steep decline

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:55.760
of the monthly active user base
for the first half of 2016.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.650
However, by providing a good
mix of in-game operations

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:02.790
and out of game
marketing activities,

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:06.390
they could achieve the
beautiful reshaped recovery

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.360
of monthly active
users, and it resulted

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.110
in the great financial success
of the Pandora gacha event

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.270
after that.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:17.700
When talking about
LiveOps, people

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:20.610
tend to focus too much on
just the in-game activities,

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.100
but actually it drives to
more impact on your business

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.420
it's nicely branded with out
of game marketing activities.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:32.460
So this is a very
good example, I think.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.560
So that was the Pandora
gacha event example.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.160
And let me talk about
some other cases as well.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.880
When talking about Japan's
unique LiveOps culture,

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.430
IP collaboration is
something I cannot ignore,

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.370
which is very popular
among Japanese developers.

00:14:48.370 --> 00:14:53.390
For example, collaboration with
popular games' IP, comic IP,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.430
anime IP, is very popular
among Japanese games,

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:01.090
because it is very effective
to bring the new surprise

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:04.420
to your existing
audience base, and also

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.020
reach out to the entirely
new audience space

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.010
through the power
of the different IP.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.810
And this kind of
collaboration can also

00:15:14.810 --> 00:15:18.320
happen with non-game
offline brands as well.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:21.940
This is my favorite example,
but Monster Strike actually

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.680
collaborated with
Baskin-Robbins [INAUDIBLE],,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.610
a popular ice cream franchise
store, and they actually

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.070
created a special
quest in the game,

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:33.950
and the when users
completed the quest,

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:37.190
they could get a free ice
cream coupon inside the game.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:42.010
And if I'm not biased, everyone
loves ice cream, right?

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.150
So actually Monster
Strike could make

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.700
their users happy by
giving away free ice cream,

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.480
and in return, Baskin-Robbins
could drive the actual people

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.080
to the store, and even
enhance their brand awareness

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.700
with this.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.520
This case is quite
interesting to me,

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.500
because it shows me how wide
the scope of LiveOps is.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:03.850
If it makes sense for
you and your partner,

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:07.060
you can even distribute your
ice cream through your users

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:08.410
in the context of LiveOps.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:13.390
So that was the Mixi case.

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.150
And I'd like to introduce
you to another case,

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:18.910
from the other Japanese
developer, KLab,

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:23.010
and the game is
BLEACH: Brave Souls.

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.350
When designing LiveOps,
taking a data driven approach

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:28.810
is really effective
and important.

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.650
So here I'd like to
introduce to you how

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:34.790
sophisticated developers
at KLab are designing

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:38.960
effective LiveOps, based
on the insights gained

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.800
through the in-game
data log analytics.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.320
This slide shows the basic
KPIs that the KLab analytics

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.810
team is looking at, which
includes monetization KPI,

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.280
[INAUDIBLE] revenue, and the
ARPPU, and engagement KPIs,

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.040
like churn rate, and
the new user KPIs,

00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.180
including installs and
seven-day retention.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:05.680
To extract key insights, the
KLab analytics team actually

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.440
look at these KPIs from four
different user segmentation

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.140
angles, which includes
in game status,

00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.460
install timing, login
frequency, and spend range.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.790
Here I'd like to introduce to
you one interesting case, where

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:23.540
a KLab team found very good
insight looking at the in game

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:28.150
status segmentation.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:32.500
So BLEACH: Brave Souls has a
character build-up function,

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.270
called a skill board.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:37.750
And the KLab team found that the
combination of this skill board

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.870
progression and the maximum
rarity of the character

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.050
that the users own is actually
one of the best angles

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:48.970
to look at the health status
of the overall in-game balance.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:52.690
When they look at
key engagement KPIs

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.940
from this user
segmentation angle,

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.650
they found that the users
who own the six-star rarity

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.500
character, but hasn't completed
the skill board yet, actually

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.540
has a significant
churn rate compared

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:08.020
with other groups of users.

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.330
And even worse,
this group of people

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:14.380
represented over 20%
of the total consumer

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:15.620
spend for this game.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.270
So it was a problem.

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:23.270
So to solve this problem,
KLab added new quests

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.000
that helped users to complete
the six-star still board

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.110
easily.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.380
And by doing so, the users
who complete the skill board

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:32.420
and go up to the
next level actually

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:36.890
increased from 4% to
9.7% month over month.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:39.800
And even significantly,
the churn rate

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.520
of this specific group
decreased by 11.8%,

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.640
compared from the
previous months.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.090
As I said, this group
of users represented

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.280
the 20% of the total
consumer spend, so now you

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.700
see how impactful it was for
the BLEACH: Brave Souls team.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.510
So it was quick, but I hope
you enjoyed some fresh case

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:05.850
studies shared from the
Mixi and the KLab teams.

00:19:05.850 --> 00:19:09.950
So now I'd like to summarize
today's key takeaways

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.000
from these case studies.

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.560
So here's four key
pillars I talked today.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.490
The first one is LiveOps design.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:23.300
So if you want to make
the most out of LiveOps,

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.760
you have to design your
game with LiveOps in mind.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.360
I think Mixi's system
event functionality

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.530
is one of the great
examples of doing this.

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:36.030
And also, you have to design
a strategic cycle of LiveOps,

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:38.120
if you would like to
run a lot of LiveOps.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.980
Otherwise your users get
swamped by the flood of LiveOps.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.230
And also the control
of in-game economy,

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:45.680
which is very important.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.300
So you shouldn't
forget about it.

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:51.670
And the third, go
beyond simple LiveOps.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.590
When talking about
LiveOps, people

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:56.930
tend to focus too much on
just in-game activities.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:59.620
But when it's nicely
branded with out of the game

00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.040
marketing activities, you can
actually generate more impact

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.070
on your business.

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:07.920
And the collaboration
with other IPs and brands

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.810
could be an interesting
idea for you,

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:15.000
if you want to reach out to an
entirely new audience space.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.570
And lastly, user
behavior is always

00:20:18.570 --> 00:20:20.160
a great source of insights.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:23.670
So if you want to be really
effective and efficient

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:27.030
in creating new LiveOps
events for your game,

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:29.760
taking a data driven approach
would work pretty well for you.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.180
OK.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:34.710
So thanks for listening.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:36.360
That's all for me today.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.300
So if you have any questions
I would like to take these.
