00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:03.484
What book are you reading right now?

00:00:03.484 --> 00:00:05.678
So, the book that I'm reading right now

00:00:05.678 --> 00:00:06.966
is called "The Giver",

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:09.350
and that is actually, interestingly,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.014
it's a book written for young adults,

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:15.579
and I found that I'm finding it a very profound book

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:17.867
that's discussing, you know, the future

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:19.193
and what different options are.

00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:21.218
And what inspires me the most about this book

00:00:21.218 --> 00:00:23.930
is that you can write your own ending to it

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.704
because the ending is so ambiguous,

00:00:25.704 --> 00:00:27.700
and my son and I have been talking

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.785
about lots of different endings to that story,

00:00:29.785 --> 00:00:32.298
which I think is a very creative process

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.122
of dreaming about the future.
