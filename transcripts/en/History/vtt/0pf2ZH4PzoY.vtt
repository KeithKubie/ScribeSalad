CHUMLEE: What do you got here?

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.380
I have a Roman ancient
bronze duck lamp.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.710
CHUMLEE: I'm almost afraid
to touch it, really, man.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.620
The word ancient just scares me.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.960
I don't want to be
the one who breaks it.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.380
JAD: Yeah, right?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.830
I purchased the duck lamp
from an antiquities gallery

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.120
in Manhattan's upper east
side a couple years back.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.380
I'd like to sell the
duck lamp because I want

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.580
to add some new pieces
to my collection

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.080
with the money I
would get from it.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.920
CHUMLEE: All right, so
what exactly is this?

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.750
This was a lamp used
in ancient times--

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.420
the Roman culture--
to light up a room.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.170
Also, possibly for
ceremonial purposes.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.210
CHUMLEE: Yeah, I was gonna say
it looks a little fancy to just

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.920
be your average household lamp.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.670
I know these lamps
are fairly common.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.580
And every household, you know,
had at least a couple lamps--

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.670
maybe even one per person
because once the sun went down,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.040
this is what you
would use to see.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.880
JAD: This is kind of slidable.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.330
If you move it gently,
it reveals this opening.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.040
You put some olive oil in there.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.000
You just put the wick part into
this little hole right here.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.830
And you just light it up.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.880
All right.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.880
I've seen my fair share
of lamps at the shop,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.290
but nothing as fancy
or ancient as this.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.210
The first century is really old.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.960
So I'm gonna need some
help before I even

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.790
think about making an offer.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.120
When you throw words
out like ancient,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.620
it kind of scares me to ask
you what you want for it.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.040
It is really old, and
it has a frailness to it.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.120
But I'd like to
get $40,000 for it.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.460
Whoa.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.750
If you want to get that
kind of money on it,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:33.920
you're gonna have
to hang out here.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.960
I can call my buddy,
Phineas, down.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.620
He specializes in artifacts.
- Perfect.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.460
Sounds great.
CHUMLEE: All right.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.380
Let me give him a call.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.420
And I'll be back.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.120
JAD: Awesome.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.620
I'm not nervous at all about
the shop calling in an expert.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.420
I'm pretty confident
that the piece

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.290
is as described and authentic.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.920
CHUMLEE: I have no idea if it's
real or even worth that much,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.080
so I called Phineas
in to help me out.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.170
DR. PHINEAS KASTLE: Hey, Chum.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.330
- Hey, Phineas.
- How you doing?

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.620
Good.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.000
It's really good
to see you, brother.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.080
Well, I think you're
gonna be even happier

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.500
when you see what I have here.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.290
DR. PHINEAS KASTLE: Wow.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.830
That's a Roman lamp.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.460
Bear with me a
second here and let

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.250
me put something
on so that I can

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.620
actually pick this thing up.
Wow.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.830
That is something else.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.250
Look at that.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.330
That looks to me like
it might be a swan.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
And, you know, in the
ancient mythology,

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.670
many times Zeus would
take the form of a swan.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.210
These little caricatures that
you have on the side here,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.170
Chum, those are
like little cherubs.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.880
So almost like at
Valentine's Day, you know,

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.620
they have these little
angels walking around--

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.290
they're shooting
people with arrows.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.120
This would symbolize, let's
say, like, a good marriage.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.210
You've got the Gods there
that would encourage love.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.330
And this would be an
object, maybe, you know,

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.540
placed on a bedside table.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.040
CHUMLEE: So how much do
you think it's worth?

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.620
He want $40,000 for it.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.000
DR. PHINEAS KASTLE: Ooh.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.500
It's a hard thing to
gauge on items like this

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.540
because when you
go to the auctions,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.120
somebody could look at this
and just fall in love with it,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.210
and they're going to bid
you right up to $40,000.

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.670
Other people are going to
look at this and they may say,

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.330
well, I really don't like
the caricatures on it.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.000
And they might not
bid on it at all.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.420
I'm going to pitch it right
about $1,000 to $1,500.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.920
CHUMLEE: Well, that's
what I need to know.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.380
DR. PHINEAS KASTLE: OK.
- Thank you.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.580
DR. PHINEAS KASTLE:
You're very welcome, sir.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.670
And take that glove off.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.080
You look like Michael Jackson.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.920
I will do that.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920
Thank you.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.750
This is a really great item.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.000
I would love to have one.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.580
I would definitely
buy it and add

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.380
it to my personal collection.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.080
But at $40,000, that
seemed really steep to me.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.500
So I had to be somewhat
of a dream buster today.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.500
CHUMLEE: You still
want to sell it?

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.420
I mean, based on
what the man just said,

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.540
what would you even offer
for it out of curiosity?

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.790
$400.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.210
JAD: $400?

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.290
CHUMLEE: It's a beautiful piece.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.790
It's nice.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.120
But $400 is what I see
comfortable putting money

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.750
into it.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.460
So I'm gonna have
to pass on your offer.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.620
CHUMLEE: All right.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.880
Well, thanks for
bring it in, man.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.460
Absolutely.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.420
They obviously thought that
this was an ugly duckling,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.460
but I know, to me, that
this is a beautiful swan.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.460
And it will bring me
a lot of cash someday.
