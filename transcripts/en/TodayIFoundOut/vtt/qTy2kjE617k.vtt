00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:14.740
Leo 
Major was a French Canadian man born in 1921.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.359
He probably didn’t think he was going to
be more of a hero than the average soldier

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.019
when he joined up with the Canadian Army at
the start of World War II—supposedly he

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.560
simply joined up because he wanted to show
his father, with whom he had a shaky relationship,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.269
that he could do something to be proud of.

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.520
Major started his overseas tour in 1941, serving
in Le Regiment de la Chaudiere.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.359
On D-Day, he was wounded by a grenade, resulting
in the partial loss of vision in his left

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:41.359
eye.

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.530
Major refused to be sent home, arguing that
he only needed one good eye to sight a rifle.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.820
He was placed in the scout platoon and became
handy with his rifle, earning himself a reputation

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.550
as an excellent sniper.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.519
In April 1945, Major’s regiment was approaching
the city of Zwolle.

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:59.010
His commanding officers asked for two volunteers
to do a reconnaissance run and report on the

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.239
number of German troops patrolling the city.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.650
If possible, the volunteers were also asked
to get in contact with the Dutch resistance

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.240
as the Chaudiere regiment was to start firing
on the city the next day.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.940
At the time, Zwolle had a population of around
50,000 people and it was likely that innocent

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.430
civilians would number among the casualties.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.330
Along with his friend Willy Arseneault, Major
started to creep toward the city.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.130
Willy was killed by German soldiers around
midnight after the pair ran across a roadblock.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.540
Reportedly, Willy was able to kill his attacker
before dying himself.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.670
Understandably angry, Major picked up his
friend’s machine gun and ran at the enemy,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.820
killing two of the remaining German soldiers;
the rest fled in a vehicle.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.310
Major continued on and soon ambushed a staff
vehicle and captured the German driver who

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.460
he had lead him to an officer drinking in
a nearby tavern.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.570
He informed the officer that Canadian forces
would begin firing heavy artillery on the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.370
city, resulting in the deaths of many German
soldiers and Zwolle civilians alike.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.890
He didn’t mention that he was alone.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.770
Afterwards, Major gave the man his gun back
and, with that seed of knowledge soon to be

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.390
spread throughout the German troops, he immediately
began running up and down the streets shooting

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.841
a machine gun and tossing grenades.

00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:06.841
The grenades made a lot of noise, but he made
sure to place them where they wouldn’t cause

00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:07.841
much damage to the town or its citizens.

00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:10.520
In the early hours of the morning, he stumbled
upon a group of eight soldiers.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.150
Though they pulled a gun on him, he killed
four and caused the rest to flee.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.580
Major himself escaped the confrontation without
injury and only one regret: he later stated

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.300
he felt he should have killed all of them.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.930
As he continued his campaign of terror throughout
the night, the German soldiers began to panic,

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.140
thinking a large body of Canadian forces were
attacking them.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.520
By 4 a.m., the Germans had vanished.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.790
An entire garrison—estimated to have been
made up of several hundred soldiers—had

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.950
been made so afraid of nothing more than a
single, one-eyed man that they fled the town.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.750
The city of Zwolle had been liberated without
the need for the death of civilians or many

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.560
of the soldiers on both sides of the lines
that would have taken part in the messy battle.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.040
Rather than fall asleep after running around
the city in the wee hours of morning avoiding

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.920
German gunfire and causing all kinds of mayhem,
Major enlisted the help of several Dutch civilians

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.460
to retrieve the body of his friend Willy.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.030
Only after his friend’s body had been recovered
did Major report to his commanding officer

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.120
that there was “no enemy” in the city.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.350
The Canadian army marched in to the sound
of cheers rather than gun shots.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.720
For his actions at Zwolle, Major received
a Distinguished Conduct Medal.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.770
If this wasn’t all enough, perhaps I should
mention that in 1944, a year before he liberated

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:18.790
Zwolle, at the Battle of Scheldt, Major captured
93 German soldiers by himself and led them

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.319
to waiting Canadian troops.

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.910
He and Willy were teamed up again on a reconnaissance
mission to find out what had happened to a

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.810
company of men that had seemingly disappeared.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.120
Willy was sick, so Major went alone.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.600
He soon found that the company he was looking
for had all managed to get themselves captured.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.910
Rather than go back and report immediately,
Major was cold, so went into a nearby house

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.910
to warm up.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.970
At this point, he saw a couple German soldiers
through a window and decided to capture them,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.970
which he did.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.970
With them presumably helping him lug his balls
of solid steal along the way, he had them

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.860
take him to their commanding officer, who
was among about 100 other German soldiers

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.860
at the time.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.150
His offer was basically- surrender or you
die.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.069
Of course, he’d then die too, but this plan
miraculously worked.

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:59.330
Why?

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.750
Because some nearby SS troops observed the
exchange and misinterpreted, thinking the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.330
commanding officer and his men were surrendering.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.550
Thus, the SS opened fire on both Major and
the German soldiers around him.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.510
The Germans being fired upon decided surrendering
to Major was better than being killed by the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.169
SS, so they went with him, with the SS hot
in pursuit, killing some of them along the

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.169
way.

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.469
All total, 93 Germans soldiers made it back
with him and became POWs.

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:29.940
For this amazing feat, Major was offered a
Distinguished Conduct Medal, but refused it

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.340
because he felt his commanding officer, Field
Marshall Montgomery, was “incompetent”

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.669
and that, “He had made an awful mistake.

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:35.680
I didn’t like him at all.”

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.129
Thus, he didn’t want to receive an award
from the Field Marshall’s hand.

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:40.309
Still not impressed?

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:44.639
How about how he won his second Distinguished
Conduct Medal, besides the one earned liberating

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.699
Zwolle, which would have been his second,
had he accepted the 1944 one.

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.620
The second one he chose to accept didn’t
come in WWII.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.120
Rather, it was achieved during the Korean
War where he managed, in a lot of ways, to

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.319
top the other two, though this time with the
help of just under a couple dozen other people.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.850
But I think you’ll soon agree, it was still
ridiculously amazing.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.849
Around 40,000 Chinese soldiers had successfully
dislodged a large body of U.S. soldiers from

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.599
a key hill (Hill 335 to be exact).

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.729
Unable to retake the hill, Major and a small
group of other snipers were sent in.

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:21.139
There job was to sneak up onto the hill, in
the midst of all those Chinese soldiers, and

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.389
then open fire.

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.850
After doing this and throwing the Chinese
soldiers into a panic, rather than retreat,

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.580
Major had his men continue firing and managed
to do what thousands of U.S. troops had been

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.210
unable to do, re-take the hill.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.030
Of course, the Chinese soon regrouped and
two divisions, totaling over 14,000 soldiers,

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.849
were sent to retake the hill from Major and
his tiny band of snipers (20 men total).

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.810
Again, rather than retreat as ordered, Major
and his band decided to hold the hill.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.349
After three days of repeated attacks from
over ten thousand soldiers using every manner

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:59.879
of weaponry, reinforcements arrived and relieved
Major and his men, who had successfully held

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:01.449
the hill during that span.

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:05.999
I presume after being relieved and having
the relieving commanding officer perhaps tell

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:10.529
him it was madness to try and hold the hill
with so few men, Major most likely responded

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:11.529
with “Madness?

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:40.310
THIS IS SPARTA!!!!”
