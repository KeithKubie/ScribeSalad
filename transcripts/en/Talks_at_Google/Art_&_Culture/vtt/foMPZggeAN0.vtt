00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.730
Thanks for being here with us.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:02.900
It's fun to--

I'm Anais.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.790
We're going to play
a song from the show.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.320
It's the encore song that we do.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.800
It's called, "I Raise My Cup."

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.350
And a little insider info--
we cut this song from the show

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.988
multiple times
because we thought,

00:02:27.988 --> 00:02:29.530
well, the show
already has an ending.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.100
We don't need to do this.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.970
And ultimately, we just
missed it every time.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.870

and just chat with each of you.

00:09:56.752 --> 00:09:59.145
So Anais, we have to
start with you, my dear.

00:09:59.145 --> 00:10:01.835
So you're actually traditionally
a recording artist.

00:10:01.835 --> 00:10:03.490
You're a singer songwriter.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.060
Why Broadway?

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:06.290
What brought you here?

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:10.340
ANAIS MITCHELL: Yeah, I never
expected to end up here.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.425
I come from the music world.

00:10:12.425 --> 00:10:15.320
I write regular old
songs and make records

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:17.030
and tour around sometimes.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:19.640
And I've been doing
that for a long time.

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:23.180
But 12 years ago,
some lyrics came

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.660
into my head that seemed
to be about this story.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:29.810
And I kind of followed
them into the labyrinth

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.220
and then just got really
excited about using songs

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.630
to tell a longer-form story.

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:39.560
And the show started out as a
DIY community theater project

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.110
in Vermont, where
I used to live.

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:44.420
Then I made a studio
record of some of the music

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.330
and toured with the music as
just a concert for a few years.

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.530
And then I started working
with Rachel Chavkin in 2012.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.095
And we put on the
show off-Broadway,

00:10:54.095 --> 00:10:55.550
at New York Theatre Workshop.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:59.473
And then we went to Edmonton,
Canada, as all shows do.

00:10:59.473 --> 00:10:59.973
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:59.973 --> 00:11:04.730
And then we got to do the
National Theater in London.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:08.720
And just never expected it to
keep going, but it has done.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.428
And here we are.

00:11:09.428 --> 00:11:11.470
SPEAKER 1: Were you a
Broadway fan to begin with,

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.993
or is it just something
that you fell into?

00:11:14.993 --> 00:11:16.910
ANAIS MITCHELL: Having
met some Broadway fans,

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.830
I think I'm not quite
at that level of--

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:19.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.670
--intensity.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:25.280
I don't identify with-- but
I love musical storytelling.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.020
I've loved "Les Mis"
since I was young.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.775
SPEAKER 1: That's my favorite.

00:11:27.775 --> 00:11:28.650
ANAIS MITCHELL: Yeah.

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.750
It's so special.

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:32.120
Epic, romantic,
political-- all the things.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.640
And I also love "Hamilton."

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.700
I love "Sweeney Todd."

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.208
I love "The Great
Comet of 1812."

00:11:37.208 --> 00:11:38.750
And I think what
all those shows have

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:40.940
in common is that they're
sung through-- like,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.870
they are operas, essentially.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:45.960
And there's nothing to break
the spell of the music.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.220
So that's what, hopefully, this
show is-- in those footsteps.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.050
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.570
Now, Andre, I want to
meet you, say hi to you.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:58.948
You've been in the business
for a couple of years now.

00:11:58.948 --> 00:12:00.240
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: This is 2019?

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.040
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hmm.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.040
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: I'm
celebrating a half century

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.082
as a performing artist.

00:12:05.082 --> 00:12:07.006
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:11.335 --> 00:12:12.310
Thank you.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.600
SPEAKER 1: You look fantastic.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.340
This guy moves.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.240
If you haven't seen
the show yet, he moves.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:20.965
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: Well,
I'm feeling fantastic.

00:12:20.965 --> 00:12:21.800
SPEAKER 1: Good.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.217
ANDRE DE SHIELDS:
And part of that

00:12:23.217 --> 00:12:25.540
has to do with being
in "Hadestown."

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.780
SPEAKER 1: And I also have read
that besides being a performer,

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.930
you're also a choreographer,
a novelist, a director,

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:33.970
and a professor?

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.000
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: Yeah,
but those are all past.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.500
SPEAKER 1: So you
prefer performing?

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.250
Or anything in particular
you like better?

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.083
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: I
prefer performing, yeah,

00:12:42.083 --> 00:12:45.010
because it answers the three
major questions in my life,

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:51.170
which are, how can I satisfy
that chattering magpie

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:56.510
in my head that we call the
mind, but it's actually an ego?

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.140
How can I satisfy the
yearnings of my heart?

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.280
And how can I answer
to that quiet voice

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.110
that speaks to me
from my viscera

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:08.680
and tells only the truth?

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:11.680
And the only way to
do that is to perform.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.280
And right now, the
best way of doing that

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.250
is to be Hermes in "Hadestown."

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.278
SPEAKER 1: I like it.

00:13:21.278 --> 00:13:22.195
That seems reasonable.

00:13:22.195 --> 00:13:24.490
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: Yeah.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.923
SPEAKER 1: Patrick
Page, Mr. Hades, here.

00:13:27.923 --> 00:13:30.340
So correct me if I'm wrong,
but I believe out of everybody

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.900
on stage besides
Miss Anais here,

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.432
you have been with
"Hadestown" the longest?

00:13:34.432 --> 00:13:35.640
PATRICK PAGE: Yeah, probably.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:36.140
Yeah.

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:36.928
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:36.928 --> 00:13:39.470
SPEAKER 1: You and Amber, but
poor Amber can't be here today.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.520
We miss her very much.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.060
She plays Persephone, your wife.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.570
PATRICK PAGE: Yeah.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.630
SPEAKER 1: What kept you
coming back to the show?

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.110
You followed it through
New York Theatre Workshop

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.068
and been with it
for a long time now.

00:13:50.068 --> 00:13:50.860
PATRICK PAGE: Yeah.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.670
It's a beautiful
piece of theater.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.910
And I fell in love with
the music initially

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:02.505
and with the lyrics,
which to me, are poetry.

00:14:02.505 --> 00:14:04.963
I was getting all-- and now
I'm going to get tearful again.

00:14:04.963 --> 00:14:05.770
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: Oh.

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:08.187
PATRICK PAGE: I was getting
all tearful listening to Anais

00:14:08.187 --> 00:14:12.310
sing the final song in our show.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.810
And I hear it every night.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:14.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.135
Every night, eight
times a week--

00:14:16.135 --> 00:14:16.720
SPEAKER 1: Lucky.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.053
PATRICK PAGE: --for three years.

00:14:18.053 --> 00:14:22.270
But I still get choked up at
what was expressed in the song.

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:26.890
So when you get to be in a
piece like that, you grab on.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.050
And they would have
to shake me off.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:29.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.970
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:14:30.970 --> 00:14:34.600
And then you're singing some
pretty, pretty low notes.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.100
How do you keep
your voice healthy?

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:38.722
Because you've got
quite the range on you.

00:14:38.722 --> 00:14:39.597
PATRICK PAGE: Thanks.

00:14:39.597 --> 00:14:40.471
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:45.714
I think I'm just very
lucky that it's--

00:14:45.714 --> 00:14:46.930
you know, it's funny.

00:14:46.930 --> 00:14:50.590
When I was a kid, I used to
get sore throats all the time.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:52.630
And then that went away.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.876
And now I very rarely-- knock--

[LAUGHTER]

00:14:59.555 --> 00:15:02.950
The healthy part of it
is it's not a huge amount

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:04.812
of maintenance for me.

00:15:04.812 --> 00:15:05.770
I drink a lot of water.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:06.490

here, our superstar.

know Eva Noblezada,

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:18.450
she was chosen to play
Kim in both the West End

00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:20.230
and the Broadway
run of "Miss Saigon"

00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:22.450
and was nominated for a Tony.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:24.630
You started at just 17
years old on that role?

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:25.853
EVA NOBLEZADA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:25.853 --> 00:15:28.020
SPEAKER 1: You know, I
wasn't doing that much at 17.

00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:28.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.300
But you're doing great.

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:34.270
In that case, you took on a
classical, well-known role,

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:37.450
whereas here, you're
originating and bringing

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:39.640
this new character to Broadway.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.350
How has that experience
been different?

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.720
And how is that?

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.550
Do you have a preference
on taking something classic

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.290
and making it your
own or bringing

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.848
someone new to the stage?

00:15:48.848 --> 00:15:50.890
EVA NOBLEZADA: I will say
my preference is always

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:54.872
to be in "Hadestown," because
I am obsessed with the show.

00:15:54.872 --> 00:15:56.830
The second that the
material was brought to me,

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:00.920
I fall in love, like most people
who come across this piece.

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.610
But I will say, I was
lucky, in "Saigon,"

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:07.450
not to have a cookie
cutter thing waiting

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.040
for me in the rehearsal room.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.560
I was very lucky to
have people who wanted

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.770
to help develop a new Kim.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:15.550
And I didn't watch anything.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.710
I didn't have the chance to
watch any of the original.

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.320
And same with this
beautiful piece.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:23.050
There have been many
beautiful Eurydices incarnate

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.790
in the past.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:27.760
But I never got the chance
to watch any of them live.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.640
I did hear a few.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.590
But this piece that Anais has
written, and with development

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.060
of Rachel Chavkin--

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.340
it allows so much
self-expression.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.550
And it's almost encouraged
to be as human as possible.

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.010
So it's just been
an amazing ride.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.140
I'm very, very lucky to
be part of this piece.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.610
SPEAKER 1: Well,
you do it so well.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:46.390
All of you are so great.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:48.220
I'm sorry, I'm just
nerding out right now.

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:48.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.490
I'm not going to lie.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.590
And then Reeve,
our Orpheus, here--

00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:57.230
so during the show,
Orpheus is a lyre player.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:58.620
He's a musician, a poet.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:01.510
But you're actually
playing guitar in the show.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.432
Was that something that
you were like, hey, I

00:17:03.432 --> 00:17:04.599
know how to do this already?

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.770
Or was that something
that was already

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:07.000
written in the character?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.368
Or how did that come about?

00:17:08.368 --> 00:17:09.910
REEVE CARNEY: Well,
originally, Anais

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.280
had been presented with
this magical tenor guitar

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.220
from a fan that said,
I think you need this.

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:18.369
And ultimately, it worked
its way into "Hadestown"

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:19.740
over various incarnations.

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:21.740
And so originally, I was
playing a tenor guitar,

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.782
which I had never played.

00:17:22.782 --> 00:17:26.440
My grandfather actually
played it back in the 1940s.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.220
So I'd learned
that for the show.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.310
But I think that
the guitar really

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:32.870
allows you to be more
expressive, playing the six

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:35.290
string, because there's a
lot of solo accompaniment

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:39.100
where Orpheus is just playing
and singing with no band

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.498
accompaniment whatsoever.

00:17:40.498 --> 00:17:42.040
So having those two
extra low strings

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.747
is really helpful, especially
with all the singing being more

00:17:46.747 --> 00:17:48.455
in the higher register
of the male voice.

00:17:48.455 --> 00:17:49.120
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
you're all the way--

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:49.660
REEVE CARNEY: It's nice
to have a little bit--

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:50.230
SPEAKER 1: Patrick's down here.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.440
You're up here.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.690
REEVE CARNEY: --of a contrast.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:52.780
Yeah.

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.370
SPEAKER 1: That's great.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.380
I was like, oh-- oh,
he's going to play.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:57.290
Oh, that makes sense.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:57.790
That's good.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.650
And then there are
times in the show where

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.000
you carry the whole thing.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.790
The band just kind of
sits and watches you.

00:18:03.790 --> 00:18:05.770
And it's just super
well done and really

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.300
helps inform the
character, I think,

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:11.970
of being able to carry this
melody that ultimately changes

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:13.276
the world.

00:18:13.276 --> 00:18:14.256
So good on you.

00:18:14.256 --> 00:18:14.756
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:14.756 --> 00:18:15.756
REEVE CARNEY: Thank you.

00:18:15.756 --> 00:18:16.420
Thank you.

00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.607
SPEAKER 1: So let's talk
a bit about this show.

00:18:18.607 --> 00:18:20.940
Anais, you've been working
on this for a very long time,

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:22.207
as we said.

00:18:22.207 --> 00:18:23.790
I remember hearing
some of these songs

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:27.840
off of your 2010 original album.

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.090
And we were saying, this
idea, where did it come from?

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:32.820
You said just, something
kind of fell into your head?

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:34.290
Was there some sort
of inspiration?

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:36.297
Or did it just kind
of pop up one day?

00:18:36.297 --> 00:18:38.130
ANAIS MITCHELL: Yeah,
I think a lot of times

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:39.160
if I'm writing a song--

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:41.190
and I know Reeve's a songwriter.

00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:43.460
We have multiple
songwriters on stage here--

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.820
Eva.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.090
Just that usually, there's not
a grand plan at the beginning.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:49.830
Something comes in
your head and it's

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.530
mysterious, sort of a gift.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:53.760
And then to try to follow it.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.760
And so I would say, that's where
this whole piece came from,

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:03.197
was just what felt sort of
like a mysterious inspiration.

00:19:03.197 --> 00:19:05.280
But then, once I got into
it, I got really excited

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.890
about the story because
the hero is a songwriter.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:09.630
So that's fun.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:16.530
And the character of Orpheus
is this impossible optimist,

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.020
this dreamer who believes,
if he could write

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.090
a song beautiful enough,
he could change the way

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.120
that the world is-- change
the rules of the world.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.960
And that world, in
"Hadestown," being

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.670
this land of wealth and
security and industry

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.180
presided over by
Hades, the king.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.260
And the characters
kept unfolding

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.260
in these different ways.

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:43.770
There's just so much richness to
who the king of the underworld

00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.740
is, who the queen of the
seasons and the natural world

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:50.380
is, his wife, and their
troubled marriage.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.990
These young lovers, Eurydice--

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.740
and I think Eva's
portrayal of her

00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.740
has gone into this whole
other stratosphere of who

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.320
that character can be and
what her backstory is,

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:05.880
and how Eurydice as
a sort of a runaway

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.110
and a tough person who's seen
the way that the world is.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.820
And then Hermes,
of course, who has

00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.410
become this incredible guide
and narrator of this story,

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:19.410
literally telling us things
we need to along the way.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.260
So just all of those
mythic characters

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.260
have kept unfolding
in different ways that

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.230
has kept the wind in the
sails of the thing for as long

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:29.767
as it's been getting developed.

00:20:29.767 --> 00:20:31.350
SPEAKER 1: Did you
all read the myths,

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:33.290
or did you just come
in and see the script?

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.350
Or what did you take for the
inspiration of the characters?

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:38.970
ANDRE DE SHIELDS:
I've been familiar

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.410
with the Greek mythology
since my days in college.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.660
But I've never
had an opportunity

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:49.620
to make them manifest
in my life or my art

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:53.280
until Anais Mitchell came along.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.550
And she does it so
beautifully, because it

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:59.328
doesn't feel like there
are cobwebs around them.

00:20:59.328 --> 00:21:00.120
SPEAKER 1: Exactly.

00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.495
ANDRE DE SHIELDS:
They absolutely

00:21:01.495 --> 00:21:05.880
have ramifications for
our contemporary life.

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:13.920
And more important than that,
I think what Anais is doing--

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.570
perhaps not deliberately, but
it's part of the process--

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:24.820
she's blurring the lines
between politics and art.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.200
And that's what keeps me
interested in this character

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.922
of Hermes who--

00:21:29.922 --> 00:21:31.880
you tell me to shut up
if I'm talking too much.

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.200
SPEAKER 1: No.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:32.908
You talk forever.

00:21:32.908 --> 00:21:36.210
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: --who
says, deep in the second act,

00:21:36.210 --> 00:21:39.900
to the characters
Orpheus and Eurydice,

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.970
do you trust each other?

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.650
Do you trust yourselves?

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.610
Which I think is the most
important question in the show,

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:51.300
because everything in the
production is about metaphor,

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.050
is about allegory,
is about parables.

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:59.750
So that means, if you
understand it on one level,

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:02.290
there are other levels to go.

00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:06.360
Everything is at least
a double entendre.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:13.620
So through these two characters,
Hermes is asking the audience,

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.320
individually, are
you ready to be

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.580
responsible to be the change
in the world that you desire?

00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.560
PATRICK PAGE: Yeah.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.674
Very well said, yeah.

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:23.622
ANAIS MITCHELL: Yeah.

00:22:23.622 --> 00:22:25.044
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:25.044 --> 00:22:27.414
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:29.805 --> 00:22:31.680
SPEAKER 1: Anybody have
anything else to add?

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.463
We good?

00:22:32.463 --> 00:22:33.380
I think he covered it.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:36.138 --> 00:22:36.930
We can go home now.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:37.430
It's fine.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:41.300
That's fantastic.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.000
Great.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.900
So for the rest
of you guys, when

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:49.970
you were developing this story,
what were you drawing on?

00:22:49.970 --> 00:22:52.550
How do you take Hades,
this largest than life,

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:55.070
mythic character-- the
god of the underworld--

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:59.630
and how do you turn him
into a person onstage?

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:04.960
How do you make him
accessible, if you will?

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.480
PATRICK PAGE: You give away
your acting secrets, right?

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:10.750
And the secret that
all actors have is--

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:14.200
what defines a character
is what a character wants.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:20.840
And if you would go down
the wrong road with Hades,

00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.780
you might say, well, what
he wants most in the world

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.150
is he wants power, or what
he wants most in the world

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:28.787
is he wants money or influence.

00:23:28.787 --> 00:23:30.620
And I think those would
all be the wrong way

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:32.210
to play the character.

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.600
What Hades wants is Persephone--

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:38.000
all of her, all the time.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.170
He wants all of her love.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.660
And the way the myth is
set up, if you don't know,

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.870
the relationship between
Hades and Persephone--

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:46.550
she is the goddess
of the seasons,

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.540
and she leaves the underworld
for six months every year.

00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:54.670
So I have this
competition for her love.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:59.450
She loves the upper
world as well.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.490
And so it drives Hades mad--

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:11.140
power mad, mad for money, mad
for all of those things that

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:14.230
shore up his image of himself.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.900
But it's all about Persephone.

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:18.670
It's all about
the fact that he's

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:22.330
so madly in love with his wife.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:27.110
And so in terms of the
developing of the character,

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:30.340
it's about finding that,
following it, deepening it

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.950
with your acting
partner, and finding

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:35.500
how it manifests itself
through the lyrics,

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.820
through the melodies.

00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.270
And then all those
other details,

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.020
like what the character
looks like-- we've

00:24:41.020 --> 00:24:42.730
been working on what
the character looks

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.040
like, now, for three years.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.620
And that's a
collaborative process

00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:53.635
with a brilliant costume
designer, Michael, with Anais,

00:24:53.635 --> 00:24:55.270
with Rachel.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:25:00.280
And finding out, how do we
express who this man is just

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.350
in terms of what he looks like?

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:06.260
So that's been a great process.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:07.720
And now we have a thing, right?

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.887
SPEAKER 1: You have a thing.

00:25:08.887 --> 00:25:09.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:09.733 --> 00:25:11.650
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: And
amazingly, the character

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:12.640
looks like Patrick.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:13.890
SPEAKER 1: I know.

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:20.320
Yeah, that's something, as
you're watching the show

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.810
and you're learning
who everybody is,

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:25.180
there is no real bad
guy in this show.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:26.920
Even Hades-- he's not a bad guy.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.700
You just, you have to understand
why and the motivations they

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:31.820
do what they do.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:33.790
And I think that's
something that we

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.350
could talk about Eurydice.

00:25:35.350 --> 00:25:36.910
Eurydice makes a choice.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:39.620
And in the original myth,
she doesn't make this choice

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:43.850
to go to the underworld,
whereas in this one, she does.

00:25:43.850 --> 00:25:47.090
And Eva, I wanted to talk
to you a little bit about--

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.060
she makes this
difficult choice to go

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.130
because she is
impoverished and she

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:52.720
doesn't see another way out.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.833
And Haiti has promised her--

00:25:54.833 --> 00:25:55.750
I'm not spoiling this.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.875
These stories are very old.

00:25:56.875 --> 00:25:58.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:04.903
But promises her a life where
she will never be hungry again.

00:26:04.903 --> 00:26:06.070
And so she decides to leave.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:09.610
And the Fates, who
are these three--

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:10.347
goddesses?

00:26:10.347 --> 00:26:11.680
What are the Fates, technically?

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.005
ANAIS MITCHELL: They're
divine, for sure.

00:26:13.005 --> 00:26:13.505
Yeah.

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:14.960
SPEAKER 1: They're one of--

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.500
they are not of the men.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.870
But they say, there's
no telling what

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.730
you're going to do when
the chips are down.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.270
And she makes this choice.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:26.020
And do you think this
is something that is

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:28.310
a universal human experience?

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.250
We talk about Maslow's
hierarchy of needs,

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.680
and you can't move
on to the next level

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:37.130
until your basic needs of
food and shelter are met.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:42.610
And how did this come into
you building this character?

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.250
And how did that
inform your choices?

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.350
EVA NOBLIZADA: I will
say, in the original myth,

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:49.780
even if there was no
script, or the way

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.290
it was written had no open
dialogue between the characters

00:26:53.290 --> 00:26:55.780
Orpheus and Eurydice,
it made it out to seem

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.748
like Eurydice had
nothing to say.

00:26:58.748 --> 00:27:00.040
Like, she didn't have a choice.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.373
She didn't have anything to say.

00:27:01.373 --> 00:27:04.540
And she fell victim many a
time, in the original myth,

00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:11.103
to the environment and also
at the hands of others.

00:27:11.103 --> 00:27:12.520
And that's one
thing that I wanted

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:18.760
to make very apparent in
this, bringing in humanity,

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:24.180
but also bringing the bad
assery of making a decision--

00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:25.830
a decision that,
even if it's not

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.580
the smartest from the
audience's point of view, who

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.630
have an omnipotent
kind of perspective

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:34.530
of watching everything unfold
on stage, she makes the choice.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.238
Because in the
song "All I've Ever

00:27:37.238 --> 00:27:39.030
Known" that you guys
have just listened to,

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:45.030
she explains to Orpheus, I've
only ever known how to survive.

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.460
Not to live or to
thrive, but to survive.

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:51.400
So I'm a little messed up.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.980
And the choice she
makes-- hopefully,

00:27:52.980 --> 00:27:54.540
people can relate
to that and not

00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:56.890
see it as a stupid decision.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.430
It should be out
of, I need to live.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.700
I'm hungry, I'm
starving, and I'm cold.

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.190
And the love of my
life is not providing

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:08.800
my basic essential
needs as a human being.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:10.410
So I hope that is
relatable, because I

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.605
think all the characters
make a huge choice,

00:28:13.605 --> 00:28:17.040
or they make many choices
that unfold at the end.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.850
But I hope they're
all relatable.

00:28:18.850 --> 00:28:19.560
And I think--

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.090
I actually know for
a fact that they

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:23.640
are, because looking at
the faces of everyone

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:27.240
at the end of the show is kind
of wonderful and beautiful,

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.940
to see that everyone has
been on the journey with us

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.630
since we all step on stage.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.780
SPEAKER 1: It's tough to watch,
but it's like they literally

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.390
say-- what would you do?

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:41.880
And you think, no, I would
never make that choice.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.660
It's like, yes.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.230
You would.

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:44.730
Yes, you would, if
you were starving

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.122
and this was your only option.

00:28:47.122 --> 00:28:48.580
Andre started
talking about, a bit,

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:52.050
some of the political
side of "Hadestown."

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:54.990
There is a song in the
show called "The Wall."

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:56.910
I assume you didn't
know when you wrote it.

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:57.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:01.380
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: I
wrote the song in 2006.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:06.810
SPEAKER 1: So we follow
this world of Hades,

00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:10.200
and Hades has a lot of
followers and a lot of people

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.970
who are listening to him and
repeating what he's saying.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.650
And "The Wall" is a song
that's a call and repeat song.

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.370
This may be a very big question,
but why does that work?

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:27.200
Why do people follow that?

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.830
Why do we think that it's
something that we know, maybe--

00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:36.450
again, from an omnipresent
part, where the audience--

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.010
we know what's going on?

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:39.710
Why is it so easy for
people to fall in?

00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:41.960
And how does this
relate to what we're

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.710
seeing now, in our
current political climate?

00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:48.050
And I don't think they're wrong
in there, because what else are

00:29:48.050 --> 00:29:48.800
they going to do?

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.550
And I don't know who would
want to speak to that--

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:54.200
any of you.

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:57.920
REEVE CARNEY: I think,
if we don't relate

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.560
to the struggle of
becoming a follower,

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.730
then we're not being
honest with ourselves.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:05.810
And so I think if you
think, oh, those people

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.640
are doing this in
"Hadestown," and they're

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.190
making these choices, then
I think we're not really

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.065
being open enough to be
honest with ourselves

00:30:12.065 --> 00:30:13.220
about these struggles.

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.137
And I think that's one
of the beautiful things

00:30:15.137 --> 00:30:18.970
about each character in the show
and the ensemble-- everyone.

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.880
I find each character to be so
relatable in different ways,

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.490
at different stages of life,
and even simultaneously,

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:27.290
in the present time.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:29.900
PATRICK PAGE: Hades understands
what a powerful motivator

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:37.450
fear is, and particularly
fear of scarcity--

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.315
that there won't be
enough of something.

00:30:39.315 --> 00:30:42.170
And that someone from the
other side of the wall

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.960
will come and try to
take what you have.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:53.320
And Anais has often said, the
coincidence is archetypal.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.920
It's this archetype that
goes back for centuries--

00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:58.910
millennia.

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:03.480
And people have always tried
to divide people and said,

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.790
we'll put a wall up.

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:07.640
And you'll be safe on our side.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:12.130
And it was one of the first
things that attracted me

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:17.240
to the show-- was I listened to
the album and heard that song.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:21.280
And I thought, the
song is unbelievably

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.190
simple in its circular logic.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.150
It's perfect.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:26.540
It's perfectly crafted.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:28.790
I think it's one of the great
folk songs ever written.

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:29.290
I really do.

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.510
And I have to sing it
every night-- have to?

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:36.010
I get to.

00:31:36.010 --> 00:31:37.334
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:37.834 --> 00:31:44.750
But it's interesting because
I've sung it since before Trump

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.850
was a candidate.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:48.410
And then he was a candidate.

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:50.270
Then he was a nominee.

00:31:50.270 --> 00:31:51.950
Then I sang it in Canada--

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:53.620
completely different
vibe, coming--

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.000
--from Canadians.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.150
Then I sang it in London,
completely different

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:00.470
vibe coming from them--

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:02.960
they're very aware they're
watching an American cast

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.150
telling this story--

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.130
and now to this audience.

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.420
And if you haven't been in the
Walter Kerr theater recently,

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.600
you may have forgotten how
intimate that space is.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.010
It's like facing a wall of
human beings all stacked

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:20.730
on top of one another.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.610
And that's been
really eye opening,

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:30.600
to sing it over time,
as the image of the wall

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.100
has been more and more ingrained
in public consciousness.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:36.750
SPEAKER 1: How can
we use this art

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.843
and use these words as
a learning experience?

00:32:39.843 --> 00:32:41.760
Because you're stepping
back and watching this

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:44.160
from an outside perspective,
what's happening.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.982
But how can we take that and
bring that out into the world?

00:32:46.982 --> 00:32:48.440
ANAIS MITCHELL:
Can I jump on this?

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.860
SPEAKER 1: Of course.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.200
ANAIS MITCHELL: Just to
continue this conversation

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.650
about that song, I'm a
very, very slow songwriter.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:58.080
It takes a ridiculous
amount of hours

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.630
to ever finish anything for me.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:02.070
But that particular song--

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:04.528
I don't even feel like I can
take credit for it, because it

00:33:04.528 --> 00:33:05.580
just happened so quickly.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.380
And I almost didn't
know what it meant.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:12.450
But at the time, I was
thinking about climate change

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.720
and migration of
people and trends

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.940
that, obviously, have been
around us for a long time

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.710
and are still intensifying.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:23.850
And the thought
was, who among us

00:33:23.850 --> 00:33:26.040
is not going to want
to be behind a wall

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.260
when the masses are
knocking at the door

00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:30.790
and there's not
enough to go around?

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:34.530
And I love what you said,
Reeve, about that song

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:37.320
is not a statement, per se.

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:38.820
It's a series of questions.

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.790
And that's, I think, what
the show is meant to do

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:49.410
and what the song is meant to do
is really provoke the question,

00:33:49.410 --> 00:33:51.690
what are you going to do
when the chips are down?

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.480
And all of the
characters in "Hadestown"

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:56.370
have a different
approach to that.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:05.850
There's Hades and Eurydice are
the more practical and fearful

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:06.420
characters.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.389
And then Orpheus and
Persephone have more faith

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:10.949
in the abundance of the world.

00:34:10.949 --> 00:34:14.489
And they sort of believe
that the world will provide

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:16.050
and there's enough to go around.

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:19.719
And it's not that anyone is
more correct than anyone else.

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:24.040
It's more a question of, how do
we want to live in this world,

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:25.800
in these hard times?

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:35.210
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: The wall in
"Hadestown" is also emotional.

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:38.510
It isn't just brick and mortar.

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:44.159
The question is, why do
we build the walls that's

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:46.710
internal architecture?

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:52.659
Persephone asks Hades,
what are you afraid of?

00:34:52.659 --> 00:34:57.370
Why do you put up these defenses
between yourself and one

00:34:57.370 --> 00:35:00.220
other individual
or between yourself

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.350
and all other individuals?

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.330
What are you trying
to keep inside?

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:06.490
What are you trying to
keep on the outside?

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:13.250
That's what resonates for
me when that song happens,

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:22.740
because that's what's going
to liberate us if we can first

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:26.850
mend the problem that
we are suffering,

00:35:26.850 --> 00:35:30.690
if we can heal the wound
that's festering in us.

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:33.150
Then, we can go about healing
the wound that's festering

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:34.655
in the rest of the world.

00:35:34.655 --> 00:35:36.130
SPEAKER 1: I don't even
know what to say to that.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:36.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:37.400
Right?

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.503
That's amazing.

00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:39.920
REEVE CARNEY:
Because I do believe

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.170
that physical barriers--

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:45.020
they tend to be a
manifestation of these barriers

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:46.760
that Andre is speaking of.

00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:49.640
And so I don't know that they
would exist without forming

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:50.597
on the inside first.

00:35:50.597 --> 00:35:52.430
SPEAKER 1: I want to
shift a little bit over

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:54.080
to building the
world of "Hadestown"

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.230
and putting it on the stage.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.590
So to start--

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.632
Andre, here-- you set
the tone for the show

00:35:59.632 --> 00:36:00.840
the second you step on stage.

00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.215
I'm not going to
tell you what he

00:36:02.215 --> 00:36:05.090
does, because that is something
that you'll want to experience.

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:11.960
But you come out and
you bring us here.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.900
How has the audience
reaction been to that?

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:19.190
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: The audience
reaction has ultimately

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:21.230
been squeals of joy.

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:22.466
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:27.950
However, and
without spoiling it,

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:33.790
it starts off as a
question of mystery,

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:38.740
because the figure you
meet at the top of the show

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:45.015
is monstrously slow,
stern, and shining.

00:36:45.015 --> 00:36:46.150
SPEAKER 1: Very shiny.

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:48.820
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: So the first
thought you might have is,

00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.660
is this the man that my mother
has been warning me about?

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.490
Stay away from him?

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:57.230
That kind of thing?

00:36:57.230 --> 00:37:03.940
And then, of course, the
first wall is broken down.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:08.470
And the response to
the contract that we're

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:14.310
trying to make with the audience
is absolutely affirmative.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:16.620
And the contract is this--

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.015
come with me on this journey.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.880
You might be challenged.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.280
You might be changed.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.500
But you won't be harmed.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.837
And that's when the people lean
forward and say, yeah, take me.

00:37:34.837 --> 00:37:35.631
And we do.

00:37:35.631 --> 00:37:36.300
SPEAKER 1: That is exactly it.

00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:37.630
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: We take them.

00:37:37.630 --> 00:37:39.510
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:42.390
I want to play a quick
clip of "Wait For Me,"

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:44.380
which is my favorite
scene in the show.

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:47.070
Like, I lost it.

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:49.500
So just play a
quick clip of Reeve,

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.438
here, singing "Wait For Me."

00:37:51.438 --> 00:37:53.928
[REEVE CARNEY SINGING "WAIT FOR
 ME"]

00:38:15.746 --> 00:38:17.228
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:18.365 --> 00:38:20.070
So true life,
during this scene, I

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:23.430
forgot there were
other people there.

00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:25.470
And then-- you have to see it.

00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:26.740
It's absolutely incredible.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.157
And then everyone
starts clapping.

00:38:28.157 --> 00:38:31.080
I'm like, oh,
there's people here.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.080
But I wanted to talk about
the logistics of that.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.770
How did you combine the
lighting and the smoke and all

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.570
these different aspects?

00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.670
Was it something that
the individual teams all

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:43.200
did together, as a group?

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.197
Or did they come with their
own different thoughts

00:38:46.197 --> 00:38:46.780
of everything?

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.905
How do you how do you create
this world, especially

00:38:48.905 --> 00:38:52.050
this beautiful scene with
the lighting and just the way

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:52.842
that they built it?

00:38:52.842 --> 00:38:55.217
ANAIS MITCHELL: I wish we had
Rachel here to answer that.

00:38:55.217 --> 00:38:56.280
SPEAKER 1: I know.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.070
ANAIS MITCHELL: But I will say
that the very first meeting

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:03.900
I had with Rachel about this
show-- it was, like, 2012.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:05.460
She had the studio
album, which had

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.020
a version of that song on it.

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:11.670
Not as expansive as it is now,
but a version of that song.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.620
And she was like,
I don't know why,

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.930
but when I listen
to that chorus,

00:39:15.930 --> 00:39:18.950
I just see these
swinging lanterns--

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:23.070
these lanterns that could swing
at the same tempo as the music.

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.150
And I was like, great.

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:25.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:30.840
And I want to say that
at the Walter Kerr,

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:33.120
something magically
came together

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:38.190
with the size of those lanterns,
the size of the space, the way

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.600
that they swing out over
the actual audience.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:42.395
And if you're in
the first few rows,

00:39:42.395 --> 00:39:43.770
it's like you're
going to get hit

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:44.820
in the-- you're not going
get hit in the head,

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.903
but it looks like you are.

00:39:45.903 --> 00:39:46.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.550
It's very visceral.

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:51.540
And I feel like that vision
of hers from six years ago

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:54.000
is finally really hitting.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.750
And there's so
much else going on.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:57.570
I don't know-- is
it OK to give away--

00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:58.240
AUDIENCE: No.

00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.032
ANAIS MITCHELL: No?

00:39:59.032 --> 00:39:59.880
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.335
But I'll just say,
there's some lights.

00:40:03.335 --> 00:40:03.835
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:03.835 --> 00:40:05.462
SPEAKER 1: There's some lights.

00:40:05.462 --> 00:40:07.435
There's a couple lights.

00:40:07.435 --> 00:40:08.310
ANAIS MITCHELL: Yeah.

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:09.400
There's some smoke.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:11.805
SPEAKER 1: Guys,
go see this show.

00:40:11.805 --> 00:40:14.848
You have to see it.

00:40:14.848 --> 00:40:16.390
PATRICK PAGE: When
you were talking--

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.125
I'm so struck with how
many of the things--

00:40:19.125 --> 00:40:25.690
it's a play, a piece about
trust, faith, doubt--

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.710
how doubt poisons the
belief in yourself--

00:40:29.710 --> 00:40:32.230
in what you were talking
about, Andre-- that inner voice

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:35.050
that knows and knows.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:40.420
And to me, the thing I
keep hearing is you saying,

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:45.890
I heard these lyrics,
this song, "Wait For Me."

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:48.790
They came to me and I followed.

00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:54.400
And Rachel-- she says, I don't
know why, but I see an image.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.360
And she followed it.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.460
And what we're talking
about is the moment

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:01.630
in the show, frankly, that
seems to just knock people over.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:06.250
And that it came from
these two women saying,

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:10.060
I'm going to follow this thing,
and I don't know what it is.

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.890
Instead of doubting
and saying, oh, no,

00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:15.430
that doesn't make any
sense-- swinging lights?

00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:17.710
There's no swinging light
imagery in the song.

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.448
There's nothing about
that in the song.

00:41:20.448 --> 00:41:22.990
I should make it about an image
that's in the lyrics somehow.

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:27.160
But instead trusting just this
gut thing and just following.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.530
And then coming up with
something so beautiful.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:33.490
It's a real lesson
for me to just follow

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:37.007
those little things that make no
sense and see where they lead.

00:41:37.007 --> 00:41:38.590
ANDRE DE SHIELDS:
And there's a moment

00:41:38.590 --> 00:41:42.340
like that shared between
Orpheus and Eurydice

00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:45.370
when he produces the
coronation for the first time

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:47.140
and she says, how
do you do that?

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:48.378
And he says, I don't know.

00:41:48.378 --> 00:41:50.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:51.250
And then they follow it.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:51.610
EVA NOBLEZADA: Yeah.

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:52.402
REEVE CARNEY: Yeah.

00:41:52.402 --> 00:41:53.950
PATRICK PAGE: And
that's, frankly,

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:57.010
another little magical
thing, I think,

00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:00.160
in the creation of this show,
is that Peter Nevins made

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.020
this wood cut--

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:04.380
was it a wood cut or a print?

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:04.710
ANAIS MITCHELL:
Yeah, it's linoleum.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:05.710
It's this one.

00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:06.502
PATRICK PAGE: Yeah.

00:42:06.502 --> 00:42:07.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:09.350
And there was this flower.

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.710
And when we first
did the show, there

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:13.270
was no flower in the show.

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:15.580
Lots of flower
imagery in the lyrics.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:19.750
And then slowly, over time,
artwork began to emerge.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:21.160
Flower emerged in the show.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.970
And now it's the central
image in the show.

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:27.340
Just, again,
following something.

00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:28.870
Who knows where it came from?

00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:31.450
Was it you, the other
day, that was saying,

00:42:31.450 --> 00:42:33.220
if you were to ask
any one person, who

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:35.270
had the idea for the
flower, nobody knows?

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.710
ANAIS MITCHELL: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.150
PATRICK PAGE: It just
appeared in the show.

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:38.025
ANAIS MITCHELL: Yeah.

00:42:38.025 --> 00:42:40.960
It feels to me like a
collective unconscious thing.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.960
The image was right,
and everyone knew it.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.850
And at first, Orpheus
produced that flower.

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:49.120
And then I remember maybe
Bradley King, our lighting

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:51.940
designer, saying, hey,
maybe when Eurydice descends

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.090
to the underworld, instead
of dropping her scarf,

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:56.260
what if she drops the flower?

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.760
And then someone
else saying, oh,

00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.580
hey, what about, in "His
Kiss, the Riot," what if Hades

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:01.880
contemplates this flower?

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.222
And it was many,
many different minds

00:43:04.222 --> 00:43:05.680
grabbing onto this
image which felt

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.070
so right as an
expression of hope

00:43:09.070 --> 00:43:11.500
and the potential for
change and transformation

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:12.623
and the springtime.

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:15.040
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: I don't want
to hit the nail of politics

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:17.350
over the head too
much, but that image

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:21.790
relates to so many generations,
not the least of which,

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:23.950
Tiananmen Square, with the--

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:27.070
and I'm an
unreconstructed hippie.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:30.130
And flowers-- if you
go to San Francisco,

00:43:30.130 --> 00:43:32.350
wear flowers in your hair
and that sort of thing.

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:33.280
PATRICK PAGE: And
labor movements.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.180
ANDRE DE SHIELDS:
And labor movements.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.230
Yes, indeed.

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:37.570
So with that image,
you are speaking

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:46.720
to generations of
causes, which, I think,

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:55.520
is going to project this piece
of art way into the future,

00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:59.000
just by looking at the audiences
who are coming to see it.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.790
Not only are they
multicultural, not only

00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:05.720
are they ethnically diverse,
they're intergenerational.

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:09.230
So we have all of these
intellects responding

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:11.880
to that image.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:14.690
So if there are 900 people
who sit in the theater,

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:20.150
we have at least 900
ideas of what that means--

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:23.495
eight times a week for 52 weeks.

00:44:23.495 --> 00:44:25.870
SPEAKER 1: We're going to take
an audience question right

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:26.725
over here.

00:44:26.725 --> 00:44:27.850
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask--

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:29.308
I know you guys
talked a little bit

00:44:29.308 --> 00:44:31.065
about the very
low parts of Hades

00:44:31.065 --> 00:44:33.430
and the very high
part of Orpheus.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:36.790
But it's not just a little
low and a little high.

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:39.850
It's super, super high
and super, super low,

00:44:39.850 --> 00:44:43.830
to the point where
you wonder, is there

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:46.330
a smaller amount of actors that
could even play those parts?

00:44:46.330 --> 00:44:49.510
Or is the talent you had on
hand the reasons why you decided

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:50.920
to option up for
those and option

00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.430
down for those kinds of things?

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:56.050
So I was curious about whether
or not that aspect of it

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:59.170
is essential to the characters
and central to the production,

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:01.660
or maybe just a consequence
of how things unfolded?

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:03.452
ANAIS MITCHELL: I should
maybe answer that.

00:45:03.452 --> 00:45:04.420
Yeah, right.

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.880
It's so funny, because I
was hearing Amber Gray, who

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.130
plays Persephone, talk
about how oftentimes,

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:12.078
in music theater that's written
by men, the parts for women

00:45:12.078 --> 00:45:13.120
are really tough to sing.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.640
Like, they're a little
too high and it's

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:18.340
like, you'd have a very specific
voice to hit that stuff.

00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:21.580
And I have to say,
me as a composer,

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:24.970
I'm just not trained
in music theater.

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:26.790
And the women's parts
I wrote in a place

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.790
where I could sing them.

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:28.748
And I felt like, great.

00:45:28.748 --> 00:45:29.530
This will be easy.

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:31.240
And I just had no idea
with the men's parts.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:31.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.198
I just had no idea.

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:35.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.080
So that's part of why they
ended up where they did.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.277
And lucky enough to find
these two unicorns who

00:45:41.277 --> 00:45:42.730
are able to sing them.

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:45.580
PATRICK PAGE: I wonder if
it has anything to do, also,

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:50.650
with the fact that you may
be unique among Broadway

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:53.980
composers in that you compose
on a guitar as opposed

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:55.360
to on a piano.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.580
Whereas on a piano,
you visually see,

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.080
oh, no, that's a
ridiculous note.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:45:59.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:01.592
I mustn't do that.

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:03.300
But on the guitar,
you're just, whatever.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.630
ANAIS MITCHELL: Yeah,
you can't even see it.

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:05.380
I know.

00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.630
But there is something poetic,
I think, about the fact

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:10.900
that the king of the underworld
has this subterranean singing

00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:13.810
voice and that
Orpheus, who's really

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:20.020
this pure, ethereal
spirit, has a heavenly--

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:22.530
he's up in the
stratosphere, there.

00:46:22.530 --> 00:46:24.950
But to what you're
saying, sure, if someone's

00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:26.740
going to do this in
high school, we'll

00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:27.450
put it in a different key.

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:27.950
No problem.

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:28.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:30.730
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:32.890
And over here?

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:33.997
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:46:33.997 --> 00:46:35.830
Thank you guys so much
for coming to Google.

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:37.630
First of all, I
had the privilege

00:46:37.630 --> 00:46:40.330
of seeing the show on
Saturday, during the matinee,

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:43.652
with 26 friends, which
was pretty amazing.

00:46:43.652 --> 00:46:45.235
Thank you, Kevin,
who got the tickets.

00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:45.872
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.600
During the show, there was a
woman in the orchestra center

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.620
who was sobbing.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:54.130
And actually, Andre, you say
this at one point in the show,

00:46:54.130 --> 00:46:56.080
and that's when
it really hit me.

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.137
You say, it's a sad song,
but we sing it anyway.

00:46:59.137 --> 00:47:00.970
But I was just hoping
you guys could tell me

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:01.928
what that means to you.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.330
ANDRE DE SHIELDS:
I'll start, since I

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:14.080
get to sing that deliciously
layered and mysterious lyric

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:14.820
in this show.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:20.370
It also gives me an
opportunity to say,

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:23.366
I think for the first
time in your presence,

00:47:23.366 --> 00:47:26.045
Anais is an oracle.

00:47:26.045 --> 00:47:26.670
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:28.165
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: She's
a contemporary prophet.

00:47:28.165 --> 00:47:28.665
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:28.665 --> 00:47:29.494
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hmm.

00:47:29.494 --> 00:47:29.994
Yes.

00:47:29.994 --> 00:47:32.434
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:42.010
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: And
traditionally, oracles live

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:45.620
at the naval of the universe--

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.820
the naval.

00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.710
So therefore, you
have to imagine

00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:55.920
there's an umbilical cord
that's attached to Anais

00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:00.720
and then goes to
the highest point--

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.700
Orpheus-- and the lowest point--

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.620
Hades.

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:09.880
That's where we get that
terminology, as above,

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.280
so below.

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:18.080
Hermes is the connection
between the two.

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.700
That's why it has
to be a sad song.

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:26.830
In "Hamlet," Shakespeare calls
us the paragon of animals.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:28.360
But that's because
we are supposed

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:32.110
to connect heaven and hell.

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:35.980
And the connection
is the purpose

00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.110
and the question
of our lives, which

00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:41.470
is, why is it all miserable?

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:44.425
Why is life so hard,
and then we die?

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:55.940
I don't know if we answer
that question in "Hadestown."

00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:01.100
But we certainly give you
many options to consider.

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:06.180
And ultimately,
our friend Orpheus

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:12.480
has to not succeed in his
effort so that each of you

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:17.370
out there gets an opportunity
to test it for yourselves--

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:21.610
to be Orpheus and
to be Eurydice.

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:26.710
Do you know anything about
"The Hero of a Thousand Faces,"

00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:29.500
Joseph Campbell?

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.740
Get that book and put
it by your bed stand

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:34.660
and read it for the
rest of your life.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:35.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:41.740
But what Joseph
Campbell says in this

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:45.800
is that your life is about
following your bliss.

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:51.860
And Orpheus' bliss in this
play is his love for Eurydice,

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.500
just as Hades'
bliss in this play,

00:49:54.500 --> 00:50:01.130
as he so wonderfully explained,
is his love for Persephone.

00:50:01.130 --> 00:50:07.550
Again, none of that is possible
if you don't first establish

00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:09.205
the bliss in yourself.

00:50:12.490 --> 00:50:13.730
Was that helpful at all?

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:15.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:16.047 --> 00:50:16.880
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.193
ANDRE DE SHIELDS: Thank you.

00:50:18.193 --> 00:50:18.901
SPEAKER 1: Great.

00:50:18.901 --> 00:50:20.880
And right over here?

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.630
AUDIENCE: The whole
history of Greek myths

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:25.720
being adapted into the English
canon is totally fascinating.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.840
And you can look towards the
middle of the 20th century

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.580
for O'Neillian kind
of inspiration,

00:50:30.580 --> 00:50:32.433
and even up until
Ellen McLaughlin, who's

00:50:32.433 --> 00:50:34.600
one of my favorite playwrights
in the '90s-- the way

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.360
that she adapted "Iphigenia and
Other Daughters" to "The Trojan

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:39.760
Women" around the story
of the Trojan War.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:43.030
And so I wonder how, in the
development of this production,

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:45.790
you might have thought about
this play and this piece

00:50:45.790 --> 00:50:50.290
of work's place in the canon
of adapting these very, very

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:54.170
old myths into something
that's very American?

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:56.152
And as a little sub
question under that,

00:50:56.152 --> 00:50:58.360
I think when you were
previously answering questions,

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:01.810
you talked a little bit about
this, on the Eurydice. story.

00:51:01.810 --> 00:51:04.720
But were there, as you were
developing the storyline,

00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:08.230
any pain points around
elements of Greek myths

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:10.810
that have some difficulty
working their way

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:13.150
into a modern storytelling?

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:15.957
Mostly because there are lots
of war stories coming out

00:51:15.957 --> 00:51:16.540
of the Greeks.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:17.998
We don't really
tell those anymore.

00:51:17.998 --> 00:51:20.140
The morals don't
quite translate.

00:51:20.140 --> 00:51:22.407
So if there was anything
difficult there to work in.

00:51:22.407 --> 00:51:23.240
ANAIS MITCHELL: Wow.

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:25.090
That was a very
intelligent question.

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:26.311
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:30.280
I don't know that
I've thought as deeply

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:33.250
in what seems like a sort
of academic way about what

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:38.830
this adaptation means in the
broader scheme of adaptation

00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:40.480
of Greek stuff.

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:45.100
But I will say that I love
old songs and stories.

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:47.560
And in my songwriting
career, I also

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:53.110
have done a couple of projects
of adapting really old folk

00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:58.930
ballads and stories, making them
accessible for the modern ear

00:51:58.930 --> 00:52:00.610
and the American
ear-- stuff that comes

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.380
from England and whatever.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:06.190
And in doing that, I
just keep discovering

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:08.620
how the same stories pop
up in different places

00:52:08.620 --> 00:52:09.760
around the world.

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.190
And they may or may not be
traveling from one place

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:13.210
to another.

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:17.140
It's like they have staying
power and they resonate.

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:20.607
And they spontaneously
appear in different places.

00:52:20.607 --> 00:52:22.940
Like, I did this one ballads--
this is kind of an aside.

00:52:22.940 --> 00:52:28.320
But there's one epic folk
ballad about this couple.

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:33.070
There's an evil mother-in-law,
which is an archetype.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:37.000
And the evil mother-in-law
doesn't like the new bride.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.732
And she puts a curse on her
that she'll get pregnant.

00:52:39.732 --> 00:52:41.440
And she just gets more
and more pregnant,

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.800
and she can never have the baby.

00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.760
And this is a real--

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.290
it's an amazing song.

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:49.090
And ultimately, the
husband figures out

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:51.070
how to break the spell.

00:52:51.070 --> 00:52:54.680
And this story has cropped
up all over the world.

00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:58.250
It's like a universal
paranoia situation.

00:52:58.250 --> 00:53:01.210
And I just love that
stories are like that

00:53:01.210 --> 00:53:02.210
and songs are like that.

00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:05.500
And I love that
this story, which

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:09.940
has existed for as far back
as any human can remember,

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:12.710
is still relevant today.

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:15.910
And I would say that, I guess,
as far as your second question

00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:18.790
goes, one of the tough
things is certainly,

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:21.700
the female characters
in those stories often

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:22.960
really have no agency at all.

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.700
In the case of Eurydice,
there's just not

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:27.255
much you can find about,
what does she want?

00:53:27.255 --> 00:53:28.630
What did she think
about the fact

00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:33.420
that she just gets chased
around and ends up dead?

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:34.990
And even in the
case of Persephone,

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:38.560
I think the
traditional myth leans

00:53:38.560 --> 00:53:41.470
into the sort of abduction
of Persephone in a way

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:46.185
that we haven't found useful
for our version of the story.

00:53:46.185 --> 00:53:48.310
And then I think the other
thing that's interesting

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:51.878
is, this thing in the Greek
where people aren't actually

00:53:51.878 --> 00:53:53.170
really making decisions, right?

00:53:53.170 --> 00:53:56.560
Because the Fates are kind
of making them for them.

00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:57.640
Everything is ordained.

00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.710
And they're getting
pushed around.

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.210
And that exists in our show.

00:54:02.210 --> 00:54:03.490
There are these three Fates.

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:07.120
And as far as the characters go,
they don't have an arc the way

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.297
that these guys do.

00:54:08.297 --> 00:54:10.130
They're pretty constant
all the way through.

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:13.590
But they exist as the
voices in people's heads.

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:15.290
And they push people around.

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:17.260
And so that feels
like, in a way,

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:23.940
that was adhering to their role
in the ancient Greek stuff.

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.970
SPEAKER 1: Well, we are
just about out of time.

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:28.480
But before we go, I would be
remiss if I did not mention,

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:31.060
this is the only new
musical this season directed

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.333
by a woman.

00:54:32.333 --> 00:54:33.250
Anais is also one of--

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:33.400
[CHEERING]

00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:33.900
Yes.

00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:42.050
Anais here is one
of the only women

00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:45.380
ever to have written both
the book and music and lyrics

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:47.120
for a musical.

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.760
I believe you are one in five?

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:50.610
Something like that.

00:54:50.610 --> 00:54:51.110
So--

00:54:51.110 --> 00:54:52.287
[CHEERING]

00:54:52.287 --> 00:54:52.787
Yeah.

00:54:56.140 --> 00:55:00.080
But you can follow "Hadestown"
online, @Hadestown.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.487
They are currently playing
at the Walter Kerr Theater.

00:55:02.487 --> 00:55:03.070
Hadestown.com.

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.750
Please go see this show.

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:05.650
It's incredible.

00:55:05.650 --> 00:55:08.260
And please give a hand to this
amazing cast of "Hadestown."

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:11.910
