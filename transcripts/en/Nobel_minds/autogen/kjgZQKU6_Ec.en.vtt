Klein as for instance and based on that

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989
Klein as for instance and based on that
 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.350
Klein as for instance and based on that
he managed to produce a theory that

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360
he managed to produce a theory that
 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.320
he managed to produce a theory that
explains trade much better and so this

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330
explains trade much better and so this
 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.970
explains trade much better and so this
with you that was explaining the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980
with you that was explaining the
 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.070
with you that was explaining the
evolving trade between countries but

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080
evolving trade between countries but
 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.750

what was it was causing a shift in in
 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.539
what was it was causing a shift in in
trade all the factors involved when

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549
trade all the factors involved when
 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.820
trade all the factors involved when
members of clarity well one important

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.699
members of clarity well one important
factor was was the reduction of

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709
factor was was the reduction of
 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.770
factor was was the reduction of
transport costs which also something

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780
transport costs which also something
 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.559

that krugman brought into trade theory

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569
that krugman brought into trade theory
 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.309
that krugman brought into trade theory
that that wasn't wasn't present it

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319
that that wasn't wasn't present it
 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.420
that that wasn't wasn't present it
wasn't at center stage before transport

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430
wasn't at center stage before transport
 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.410
wasn't at center stage before transport
cost the home market matters so if you

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420
cost the home market matters so if you
 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.360
cost the home market matters so if you
have a large home market you can produce

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370
have a large home market you can produce
 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.039
have a large home market you can produce
larger serious and that makes you more

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049
larger serious and that makes you more
 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.430
larger serious and that makes you more
competitive on on the world market and

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440
competitive on on the world market and
 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.770
competitive on on the world market and
so then the part of this theory was that

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780
so then the part of this theory was that
 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.289
so then the part of this theory was that
the disco be called the new economic

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299
the disco be called the new economic
 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.360
the disco be called the new economic
geography which which partially explains

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370
geography which which partially explains
 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.240
geography which which partially explains
why that mean this migration into cities

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250
why that mean this migration into cities
 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.440
why that mean this migration into cities
could you explain more about answers

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450
could you explain more about answers
 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.840
could you explain more about answers
right so if you think the think of it if

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850
right so if you think the think of it if
 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.870
right so if you think the think of it if
you haven't have a large home market

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880
you haven't have a large home market
 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.520
you haven't have a large home market
that allows you to produce large

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530
that allows you to produce large
 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.370
that allows you to produce large
assyrian series and to to sell the goods

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380
assyrian series and to to sell the goods
 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.069
assyrian series and to to sell the goods
at lower prices but that makes that

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079
at lower prices but that makes that
 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:26.500
at lower prices but that makes that
makes a market with a large population

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510
makes a market with a large population
 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.750
makes a market with a large population
more attractive because because living

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760
more attractive because because living
 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.809
more attractive because because living
standards are higher so that that in

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819
standards are higher so that that in
 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.940
standards are higher so that that in
short explains why there that tends to

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950
short explains why there that tends to
 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.640
short explains why there that tends to
be migration towards the large cities

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650
be migration towards the large cities
 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.670
be migration towards the large cities
and based on that krugman developed a

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680
and based on that krugman developed a
 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.980
and based on that krugman developed a
theory of the interplay between between

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990
theory of the interplay between between
 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.140
theory of the interplay between between
the agricultural sector and the gospel

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150
the agricultural sector and the gospel
 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.720
the agricultural sector and the gospel
singers what he calls the periphery and

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730
singers what he calls the periphery and
 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.470
singers what he calls the periphery and
the core of the world Akkad so the call

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480
the core of the world Akkad so the call
 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.050
the core of the world Akkad so the call
being the the cities where people are

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060
being the the cities where people are
 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.360
being the the cities where people are
flocking to the periphery being so the

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370
flocking to the periphery being so the
 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.740
flocking to the periphery being so the
agricultural areas outside of that

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750
agricultural areas outside of that
 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.630
agricultural areas outside of that
precisely and so would have been the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640
precisely and so would have been the
 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.200
precisely and so would have been the
impacts of phasic ruins theories well

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210
impacts of phasic ruins theories well
 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:05.230

is what we call positive theory the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010
is what we call positive theory the
 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.480

exactly so there's a huge amount of work
that builds on Krugman's theory and in
