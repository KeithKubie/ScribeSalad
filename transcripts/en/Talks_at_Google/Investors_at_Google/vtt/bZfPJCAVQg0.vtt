[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.080
SPEAKER: Joel Greenblatt,
our guest for today,

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.940
is the co-founder,
managing principal,

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.850
and co-CIO of Gotham
Asset Management.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.690
We could not be more
thrilled and more grateful

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.130
than to have him accept
our invitation and be here.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.892
Thank you so much,
Joel-- over to you.

00:00:28.892 --> 00:00:30.996
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:32.329
JOEL GREENBLATT: Thanks so much.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.160
Thanks for coming out today.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.357
I really appreciate
it very much.

00:00:40.357 --> 00:00:42.940
I've never been here before, so
I'm looking forward to my tour

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.560
right after, so thank you.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.380
So even Warren Buffett says
the vast majority of people

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.300
should index, and
I agree with him.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.670
So are there any questions,
or do I have any time?

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.250
Then again-- well, I have time,
so then again, Warren Buffett

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.400
doesn't index and neither do I.
So I thought I'd tell you why,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.560
and then maybe you'll
have some more information

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.280
to decide for yourself
what makes sense for you.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.320
And in a sense, it
shouldn't be that hard.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.830
Actually, I had a friend
who's an orthopedic surgeon

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.590
and is in charge of a group
of orthopedic surgeons.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.680
And he asked me to speak
to them at a dinner,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.240
about the stock market.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.490
And I said, OK, these
are smart, educated guys.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.840
They can understand this stuff.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.092
And I spoke for
about 35 minutes,

00:01:38.092 --> 00:01:40.550
explaining how the stock market
worked and everything else.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.850
And then I started getting
questions along the lines of,

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:45.560
oil went down $2 yesterday--

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.370
What should I do?

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.970
Or a market was
up 2% yesterday--

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.830
what do I do about that?

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.830
So my interpretation
of those questions

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.260
was I had just
crashed and burned.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.760
So last year, I was
lucky enough to be

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.800
asked to teach a ninth-grade
class, a bunch of kids,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.330
mostly from Harlem.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.070
And I had just
sort of crashed and

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.380
burned with the
orthopedic surgeons,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.940
and I didn't want to
do that with the kids.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.670
And so I started
to try to think of,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.770
what could I do to
explain the stock

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.470
market a little bit better?

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.190
And so I walked into
class the first day,

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.560
and I handed out a bunch
of three-by-five cards.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.750
And I brought in this jar
of jellybeans right here,

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.180
and I asked--

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.427
the students passed around
the jar of jellybeans.

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:41.010
I asked them to count the rows,
do whatever they wanted to do,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.301
and write down their best
guess for how many jellybeans

00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:45.260
were in the jar.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.760
I collected the
three-by-five cards,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.540
then I went around
the room, one by one,

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.309
to each one of the
kids in the room.

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:53.100
And I said, listen,
you can keep your guess

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.308
or you can change your guess.

00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:55.230
That's up to you.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.240
And I went, one by
one, around the room

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.660
and asked people how many, and
wrote down the various guesses.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.040
So it turned out, the
average of the guesses

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.750
for the three-by-five
cards was 1,771 jellybeans.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.410
There are 1,776
jellybeans in the jar,

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.040
so that was pretty good.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.077
The guess when I went around the
room, that was 850 jellybeans.

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:25.410
And I explained to them that
the stock market's actually

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.680
second-guessed, because
everyone knows what they just

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.140
read in the paper or what
the guy next to them said,

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.080
what they saw in the
news, and are influenced

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.092
by everything around them.

00:03:37.092 --> 00:03:39.550
And that was the second guess,
and that's the stock market.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.930
The cold, calculating
guess, when

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.346
they were counting
rows and trying

00:03:42.346 --> 00:03:45.160
to figure out what
was going on, that

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.350
actually was the better guess--

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.730
that's not the stock market.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.580
But that's where I
see our opportunity.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.880
Once a year in my class
at Columbia, at least

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.270
for the last five, six years,
somebody raises their hand

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.430
and asks a question that
goes something like this--

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.900
hey, Joel, congratulations.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.562
You've been doing
this for 35 years,

00:04:07.562 --> 00:04:08.770
and you've had a nice record.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.630
But now there are more
computers, there's more data,

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.330
there's more ability
to crunch numbers.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.610
And isn't the party over for us?

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.320
Isn't it just more hedge funds?

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.200
It's just a lot
more competition.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.480
Isn't the party over for us?

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.240
So my students are
generally second-year MBAs--

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.000
I'd say average age, 27 or so.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.780
So I just answer it this way.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.070
I tell them, let's go back to
when you learned how to read.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.620
Let's take a look at the most
followed market in the world.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.526
That would be the United States.

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:39.400
Let's take a look at
the most followed stocks

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.470
within the most followed
market in the world.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.720
Those would be the
S&amp;P 500 stocks.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.220
Let's take a look
at what's happened

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.470
since you learned how to read.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.470
So I tell them, from 1997--

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.800
when they were 9 or 10--

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.140
to 2000, the S&amp;P 500 doubled.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.020
From 2000 to 2002, it halved.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.510
From 2002 to 2007, it doubled.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.000
From 2007 to 2009, it halved.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And from 2009 to today,
it's roughly tripled,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.180
which is my way of telling them
that people are still crazy.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.760
That was just the last 17 years.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.090
And I'm way
understating the case,

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.574
because the S&amp;P 500 is
an average of 500 stocks.

00:05:18.574 --> 00:05:20.740
If you lift up the covers
and look underneath what's

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.300
going on, there's
huge dispersion

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.730
of those 500 stocks
between those,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.950
at any particular time,
that are in favor and those

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.240
that are out of favor.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.220
And so there's a wild ride
going on underneath the covers.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.045
If you look under
the covers, there's

00:05:32.045 --> 00:05:34.480
a wild ride of those 500
stocks at any particular time.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.770
And that doubling
and halving, doubling

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.519
and halving with the
average of 500 stocks

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:39.640
is really smoothing the ride.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.720
So there should
be an opportunity.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.810
And if you understand
what stocks are--

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.870
and I guarantee my students,
first day of class--

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:51.250
I make a guarantee every year.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.833
And they walk in,
and I guarantee them

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:57.600
this-- if they do good
valuation work of a company,

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.854
I guarantee them the market
will agree with them.

00:05:59.854 --> 00:06:01.020
I just never tell them when.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.145
It could be a couple weeks.

00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:03.436
It could be two or three years.

00:06:03.436 --> 00:06:05.160
But if they do good
valuation work,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.630
the market will agree with them.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.030
Stocks are not pieces of
paper that bounce up and down,

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.390
and you put
complicated ratios on,

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:14.610
like Sharpe ratios
or Sortino ratios.

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.470
Stocks are ownership
shares of businesses

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.900
that you are valuing
and, if so inclined,

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.560
tried to buy at a discount.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.360
So if you believe
what Ben Graham said,

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.820
that this horizontal
line is fair value,

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.690
and this wavy line around
that horizontal line

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:34.879
are stock prices, and you
have a disciplined process

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.170
to buy, perhaps, more than
your fair share when they're

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:39.900
below the line, and,
if so inclined, sell

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.370
or short more than
your fair share

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.110
when they're above
the line, the market

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:46.842
is throwing us pitches
all of the time.

00:06:46.842 --> 00:06:48.800
The reason people don't
outperform the market--

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800
there are behavioral problem.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.883
There are agency problems.

00:06:50.883 --> 00:06:55.110
But it's not because we're not
getting those opportunities.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.750
I will show you briefly--

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:02.100
let me tell you how
we value stocks.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.120
It's not very tough, and I think
most of you will understand it.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.170
And I think the
best example that

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.880
seems to resonate
with most people

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.389
is thinking about
buying a house.

00:07:16.389 --> 00:07:17.930
And to keep the
numbers simple, let's

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.390
say that someone is asking
$1 million for the house.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.310
They want to sell,
and your job is

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.270
to figure out whether
that's a good deal or not.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.320
So there's certain
questions you would ask.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.790
One of the first
questions I'd ask

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.979
is, well, how much rent could
I get for that thing, OK?

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:36.520
So in other words, if I rented
out that million-dollar house,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.350
how much rent would I collect?

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:41.860
If I were going to
collect $70,000, $80,000,

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.970
$90,000 a year--

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.120
7%, 8%, 9% yield on that house--

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:49.490
that's one way I might
go about valuing it.

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:52.250
And what's the next
question you would ask?

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.019
I'm pretty sure I
know what it would be.

00:07:54.019 --> 00:07:56.060
What are the other houses
on the block going for,

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:57.710
on the block next door
and the town next door?

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:58.626
How does this compare?

00:07:58.626 --> 00:08:00.890
How relatively cheap is
this, relative to all

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.180
my current choices?

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.530
So that's what we do.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.060
We look at, how
relatively cheap is

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.790
this business, relative to
other similar businesses,

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.240
relative to a whole universe
of choices that I have?

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.150
We do that.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.630
We also go back in
history, look at how

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.750
this company or this
house has traditionally

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.720
been valued, versus other
ones in the neighborhood

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.390
or versus other communities.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:24.710
And how is it being valued now?

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.900
So measures of absolute
and relative value--

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:30.860
absolutely cheap
on a rental basis,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.049
relatively cheap on all
different kinds of measures

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:35.248
that make sense to you--

00:08:35.248 --> 00:08:37.039
now, you wouldn't use
any of these measures

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.299
all by themselves.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.599
If you just used relative
cheapness-- if some of you

00:08:40.599 --> 00:08:42.140
remember the internet
bubble, and you

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.150
bought the cheapest internet
stock, that wasn't cheap.

00:08:44.150 --> 00:08:45.524
It was just cheap
relative to all

00:08:45.524 --> 00:08:48.230
the other crazy-priced
stocks at the time.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.702
But we use our measures of
absolute and relative value

00:08:50.702 --> 00:08:52.410
as checks and balances
against each other

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.690
to try to zero in on fair value.

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.030
So when you do this--

00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:02.960
I just want to show
you a simple chart.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.600
This is actually a study we did
of our valuation methodology,

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.920
very similar to the way I
just said we value a house.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.110
This is how we-- we looked
at the 2,000 largest

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.250
companies in the US
over a 20-year period.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:20.150
This was 1992 to 2012, and we
ranked them on a daily basis

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:22.460
from 1 to 2,000, based
on their discount

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:25.800
to our assessment of
value, using these metrics.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.620
The x-axis here-- you
probably can't see it--

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.579
is just a valuation percentile.

00:09:30.579 --> 00:09:33.120
All this means is if you were
in the bottom left-hand corner,

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.350
and you were in the
first percentile,

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.308
you're the 20 companies
at any particular time,

00:09:36.308 --> 00:09:38.100
out of those 2,000,
that measure cheapest,

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.490
according to our measures of
absolute and relative value.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.795
Go to the 99th percentile--

00:09:43.795 --> 00:09:46.170
you would be the 20 companies
that measure most expensive

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:47.610
out of those 2,000.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.480
The y-axis is the year
forward return on average

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.010
during those 20 years.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.980
What this chart simply
says is, on average,

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:59.482
stocks that fell in our first
percentile, the cheapest 20,

00:09:59.482 --> 00:10:01.440
averaged a one-year
forward return during those

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.240
20 years of 38%.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.430
Stocks that ranked in
our second percentile

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:08.211
averaged a one-year forward
return of about 37%.

00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:10.710
And then we drop down to this
best-fit line, which we always

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.450
say we don't mind missing
when we're making extra money.

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:15.450
And then as we measure
something more expensive,

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.240
the year forward return drops.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.270
And if you were sitting in my
class at Columbia and I said,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:23.070
hey, does anyone see
a long-short strategy

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.600
you might pursue if
you could predict ahead

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.520
of time which stocks would
do best, second best, third

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.104
best, in order, and
you did not say,

00:10:28.104 --> 00:10:29.520
I guess I'd buy
these guys up here

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.990
in the upper left-hand
corner and short

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:32.460
these guys in the bottom
right-hand corner--

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:34.230
if you didn't say that,
I'd probably throw you out

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.063
of class, because it's
very straightforward.

00:10:36.063 --> 00:10:37.530
That's what you should do.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.600
And by the way,
that's what we do.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.940
The important
thing to understand

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:46.690
is that stocks are ownership
shares of businesses, OK?

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:48.700
Now, by the way,
that beautiful chart

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:52.320
I showed you with the 90% fit--

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.780
why doesn't everyone do this?

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.280
Well, unfortunately,
it doesn't look

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.390
like that when you're
living through that.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:58.860
That's an average over 20 years.

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.484
If I showed you a snippet
of three or four years,

00:11:01.484 --> 00:11:02.400
the fit would be nice.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.470
It might be 0.55, 0.6,
something like that.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.419
But it's not going to be
very cooperative, right?

00:11:09.419 --> 00:11:11.460
If what we did worked
every day, and every month,

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.470
and every year,
everyone would do it.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:14.820
It would stop working--

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:19.110
but it doesn't, unfortunately.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:22.530
But the reason that we stick
to what we're doing even

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.670
when it's not working
is that chart,

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.129
meaning the way we
value companies,

00:11:26.129 --> 00:11:27.961
our measures of absolute
and relative value,

00:11:27.961 --> 00:11:30.390
are approximately how the
market values them over time.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.770
If we were, for instance,
momentum investors--

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.446
OK, and I will tell you
that for those of you

00:11:36.446 --> 00:11:40.040
who know that
means, momentum has

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.520
been studied across the
globe over the last 30, 40

00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.750
years in the US.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.990
It's worked pretty
much everywhere--

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.750
not all the time, but on average
it's worked very well over 30,

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:56.070
40 years, and not
just in this country.

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.040
But here's the problem.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:02.100
What if it didn't work over
the next two or three years?

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.840
It could be that we
just have to be patient.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.310
It works over time,
and it's cyclical.

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:11.280
And so it's out of favor, and we
just have to stick to our guns

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.274
because it's something
that's worked.

00:12:13.274 --> 00:12:15.690
Or it could be, if it didn't
work in the next two or three

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.549
years, that the
explanation is, hey,

00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:18.840
it's not so hard to figure out.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.589
A stock used to be
down here, and now it's

00:12:20.589 --> 00:12:22.230
up here-- it's
got good momentum.

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.840
And with all the data, and
the ability to crunch numbers,

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.120
and computers, and studies
that have come out,

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.680
it's a crowded trade.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:29.910
It's degraded.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.820
It's not as good
as it used to be.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:36.422
And if that's what happened
over the next two, three years,

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:38.130
I would know the answer
to that question.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.421
I didn't know which one it was.

00:12:39.421 --> 00:12:42.540
Should I just be patient,
or has the trade degraded?

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.450
But if you view stocks as
ownership shares of businesses

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.350
that you value and try
to buy at a discount,

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.270
and that doesn't work
for a couple of years,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.895
I'm not going to
change what I'm doing.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:53.430
I'm not going to buy the
bottom right-hand corner,

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.820
buy all the money-losers
and the companies

00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.570
that don't earn anything
or are trading it

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:58.977
100 times, free cash flow.

00:12:58.977 --> 00:13:00.810
I'm not going to buy
those, even if it works

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:04.260
in one particular year, and then
sell the ones that are cheap,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.967
relative to everything,
get me high rents,

00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:07.800
and everything else.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.650
I'm not going to
change my strategy,

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.460
and I believe that stocks
will eventually-- not

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.452
right now, but eventually
people get it right.

00:13:17.452 --> 00:13:18.660
And I may have to be patient.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.130
That's really what I have to do.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.740
What that chart tells me
is I'm on the right track,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:25.200
meaning that's sort
of our true north,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.680
and we just have to be
patient to get there.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.860
The reason that these simple
metrics don't get arbitraged

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:36.600
away is-- the example I usually
use for arbitrage is, oh, you

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.290
see gold in New York at $1,200,
and it's selling at London

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.450
simultaneously at $1,201.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:44.940
Well, an arbitrageur sitting
on a trading desk someplace

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.370
will see that and buy up
gold in New York at $1,200

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.960
and push the price
up a little bit.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.710
He'll simultaneously sell
gold in London at $1,201,

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.860
push the price down.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.960
And they'll converge
somewhere in the middle,

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.790
and it'll happen so
fast on a trading desk

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.490
that you don't really
even get to see that.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.740
But what if I told you, you
could buy gold in New York

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.060
today at $1,200, and sometime
in the next two, three years

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:04.890
you're going to
make money, but you

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.973
could lose 20% of your
money while you're waiting?

00:14:06.973 --> 00:14:09.180
There's no guy sitting
on a desk anywhere that

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:10.710
really can do that.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:15.130
And frankly, time horizons
are getting shorter.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.832
It used to be,
when I was younger,

00:14:17.832 --> 00:14:19.290
I used to get
quarterly statements,

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:20.830
and most people would
throw them in the garbage.

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:22.996
Now you can check your stock
price 30 times a minute

00:14:22.996 --> 00:14:23.790
on the internet.

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:25.800
Maybe some of you do.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.680
And time horizons are
shrinking, and we're just

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.970
playing time arbitrage.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.880
We're being patient, buying
cheap, good businesses,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:37.550
and waiting for the market to
recognize the value we see.

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:40.670
But it takes some work
to value companies.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.190
And let's say you
don't want to do that.

00:14:43.190 --> 00:14:44.150
You have a day job.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.650
I guess everyone
here has a day job,

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.270
so you don't want to do that.

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:49.730
So one thing you could
do is try to find someone

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.600
good to do it for you, right?

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.360
I'm showing you there's
this opportunity.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:55.760
Maybe someone can do it for you.

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.200
And what you should
probably look

00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.360
for when you're
looking for that person

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:05.220
is someone who has a good
investment process that

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:08.010
makes sense to you.

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:12.626
The problem is, for
most active managers,

00:15:12.626 --> 00:15:14.000
if you think of
their challenge--

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.600
when they're picking
an individual stock,

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.760
they must think that they have
a variant hypothesis as to why

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.170
that stock is priced differently
than the way it should be.

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:29.870
And I can tell you, I've been
doing this over 35 years,

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:31.860
and it's very rare.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.970
Almost never have I
bottom-ticked a stock, bought

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.310
it at the absolute bottom.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.960
So 99.9-plus
percent of the time,

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.460
a stock is down
after I've bought it.

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.940
And there are really
only two reasons why--

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.830
one is I was wrong.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.300
The other is I
just need more time

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.040
for my thesis to play out, OK?

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.550
Now, as an outside
allocator, you

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:02.161
don't really know what the
thesis for the individual stock

00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:02.660
was.

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:09.650
Even the manager himself
sometimes doesn't know.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.390
When things are
going against you,

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:13.220
there are all kinds
of agency problems.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.050
You've got people to answer to.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.570
You have behavioral issues,
just naturally-- you

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.670
start to doubt yourself.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:22.820
It's very unclear
sometimes, even to them,

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.850
what their biases are
and what they're doing.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.610
They did studies that you guys
are familiar with, probably,

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.970
of why the home team
always wins in sports,

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.440
or at least wins
more than it should.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:36.950
And the original thesis
was generally, oh, they're

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:37.700
used to the court.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.620
They slept in their own bed.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:43.670
The fans, they jazz them
up, whatever it might be.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.272
And when they controlled
for all these variables,

00:16:46.272 --> 00:16:48.230
the answer turned out to
be that the refs don't

00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:50.720
like to get booed, OK?

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.670
So they don't think that
they're being biased.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:58.310
I'm sure in 99.9% of
cases, they don't, but they

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:59.310
don't like to get booed.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.800
And so they're being
influenced by--

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.091
and so there's the same
problem with an active manager.

00:17:03.091 --> 00:17:08.762
He's got agency behavioral
issues that he's not sure of.

00:17:08.762 --> 00:17:10.970
So the allocator doesn't
really understand the thesis

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:12.410
behind each pick.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:16.010
It's not clear that the
manager is totally unbiased

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:19.910
when he has a variant thesis
that's going against him.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:22.650
And so since you
don't know the thesis

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.599
as an allocator, most people--

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:29.070
all they have are the returns,
and that's what they used.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:32.090
So in an interesting
study that came out

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.842
the day after Thanksgiving--

00:17:33.842 --> 00:17:36.050
so it was interesting to
me, probably not interesting

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:38.880
to the guys who did the study.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.390
Morningstar put out a
study of their star system.

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:46.470
And their star system is
based on past returns,

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.053
letting you know who's done the
best over the last one, three,

00:17:49.053 --> 00:17:49.770
and five years.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:52.230
Of course, my interpretation
of their study

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.810
was that our star
system doesn't work.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.610
We can't discern.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.650
The last one, three,
five years of returns

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.070
has not much to do with
the next one, three, five.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.920
But that's what everyone uses.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.960
I wrote a book.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.950
I hold it up here.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:09.699
It's called "The Big
Secret," and I always

00:18:09.699 --> 00:18:12.345
say it's still a big secret
because no one read it.

00:18:12.345 --> 00:18:14.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:21.650
And in that book, I talked
about a few studies.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:26.450
Number one, it talked about
the best-performing manager.

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:29.690
I wrote it in 2011, so it
talked about the decade

00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:33.170
2000 to 2010-- looked at the
best-performing mutual fund,

00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:37.100
a study of the best-performing
mutual fund for that decade.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:41.450
That fund was up 18% per year,
100% long in the US equities.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.670
The market was flat
during those 10 years,

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:46.639
so 18% up a year is pretty good.

00:18:46.639 --> 00:18:48.680
Unfortunately, the average
investor in that fund,

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.900
on a dollar-weighted
basis, managed to lose 11%

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.800
a year because every
time the market went up,

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.610
people piled in.

00:18:55.610 --> 00:18:57.020
When the market went
down, they piled out.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.490
When the fund outperformed,
they piled in.

00:18:58.490 --> 00:19:00.365
When the fund underperformed,
they piled out.

00:19:00.365 --> 00:19:03.920
And they took an 18% annual
gain and turned it into an 11%

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.570
annual dollar-weighted loss--

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.070
why?

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.400
Well, to beat the market, if
you're beating by 18 points,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.910
you're doing something
different than the market.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.576
You're going to zig
and zag differently.

00:19:13.576 --> 00:19:15.200
You can't do the
same as the market.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.658
You have to do
something different.

00:19:16.658 --> 00:19:18.560
You're going to zig
and zag differently.

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.480
Institutional managers
are no different.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.900
Here are the stats on the-- if
you just took a look at the top

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.340
institutional managers for
that decade, the ones who--

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.310
2000 to 2010-- the
top-quartile managers,

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.490
the ones who ended up with
the best 10-year record,

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:32.870
here are the stats on them.

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:37.430
97% of those who ended up
with the best 10-year record,

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:40.070
top quartile, spent
at least 3 of the 10

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:41.830
years in the bottom
half of performance--

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.310
not shocking, but
everyone, right?

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:45.030
To beat the market, you have
to do something different.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.696
You're going to zig
and zag differently.

00:19:46.696 --> 00:19:49.299
79% of those who ended up
with the best 10-year record

00:19:49.299 --> 00:19:51.590
spent at least 3 of the 10
years in the bottom quartile

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.700
performance.

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.860
And here's the stunner--

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:58.460
47%, roughly half of those who--
they ended up with the best

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.340
record, but they spent at
least 3 of those 10 years

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:03.680
in the bottom decile, the
bottom 10% of performers.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.480
So you know no one
stayed with them,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.570
but they ended up
with the best record.

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:17.230
So it's very hard to
pick an allocator,

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:18.910
because you don't
know the thesis,

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.717
so you're using past returns.

00:20:20.717 --> 00:20:22.300
But when you do that,
all you're doing

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:26.410
is chasing your tail, going in
and out at all the wrong times,

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:29.140
So it's very hard.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:30.646
What a good allocator--

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:32.520
usually an institutional
allocator, and there

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.804
are a few of them--

00:20:33.804 --> 00:20:35.470
should be looking at
process, and do you

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.977
stay with your process.

00:20:36.977 --> 00:20:38.560
But of course, there's
agency problems

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.200
on the side of those
people allocating,

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.217
because even if you're on a
really good investment board,

00:20:46.217 --> 00:20:48.550
and you're an allocator, and
you're head of US equities,

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:53.560
or you're head of
alternatives or bonds,

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.710
or whatever it might be,
you have a benchmark.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.590
And if you haven't beaten your
benchmark for the last three

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:01.420
years, I'm not saying
at the good places,

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:02.620
they throw you out.

00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:06.010
But I am saying they don't
throw you a parade, OK?

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:09.360
So it's very, very hard on that.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.330
So one thing you could
do is do it yourself.

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:13.080
And I wrote this other
book that you have,

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.850
"The Little Book That
Beats the Market."

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.645
And I just did a
simple formula that

00:21:17.645 --> 00:21:19.770
sort of was like the
jellybeans, counting the rows,

00:21:19.770 --> 00:21:23.850
going across, and just picking
the cheap companies to buy,

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:24.690
very simple.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.930
And I wasn't running
outside money at that time

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.882
that I wrote the book in 2005--

00:21:29.882 --> 00:21:31.590
just wrote up the very
first study we did

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:35.520
of doing something
cheap and good.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.680
Businesses just
made it pretty easy

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.110
for you to buy a
handful of those.

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:43.080
And I kept getting
phone calls-- hey,

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.620
could you just do this for us?

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:47.850
And so what I did was
I set up a website

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:49.500
that listed the top stocks.

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:54.030
It's still going around,
MagicFormulaInvesting.com.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.572
And people said,
yeah, that's fine.

00:21:55.572 --> 00:21:57.030
But could you still
do this for us?

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:59.610
So I set up something
called formula investing.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:01.830
And I gave people two choices.

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:06.670
I said, well--

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:09.190
I sort of viewed it as a
benevolent brokerage firm.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:12.500
I said, listen, we'll
let you do this yourself.

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.960
But you have to choose from this
top list of 30 or 50 stocks,

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.064
and you have to choose
at least 20 of them, OK?

00:22:20.064 --> 00:22:21.730
Stay out of trouble,
and you're supposed

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.980
to invest every quarter,
update your portfolio,

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.825
and just mechanically do this.

00:22:26.825 --> 00:22:28.200
You don't have to
buy everything,

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.140
but you have to buy at least 20.

00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:34.200
And then the person
who was running this

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.910
for me said, you know what?

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:38.580
How about you just add
a check box which said,

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.820
just do this for me, just
automatically buy it.

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.590
So just as an
afterthought, I said fine.

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:45.780
We'll do that too.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.890
So we ran this for
a couple of years,

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.223
and let me tell you the results.

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.120
The people who chose
their own stocks

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.475
from the pre-approved
list of the top stocks,

00:22:57.475 --> 00:22:58.350
they did pretty well.

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.070
For the two years, they
were up 59%, roughly.

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:09.780
Unfortunately, the S&amp;P was up
62% during those two years.

00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.870
The automatic, just do it
for me-- that was up 84%.

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:20.370
So the automatic
had beaten the--

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:22.740
in other words,
just buying the list

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.720
had beaten the
market by 22 points.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.430
But by giving people
any discretion,

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.870
even though the list was
pre-approved, just by picking

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.439
and choosing the ones that
they didn't like-- but they had

00:23:33.439 --> 00:23:34.980
to buy at least 20--
they had managed

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.720
to take a 22% out-performance
in a couple of years,

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:42.090
which is pretty good, and turn
it into a 3% under-performance.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:45.900
So do-it-yourself-- I wrote
a piece for Morningstar

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:48.420
called "Adding Your Two
Cents May Cost You a Lot."

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:54.060
And so I just wanted
to caveat that.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:59.460
So another way-- let's
see, I'll do this fast.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.340
I wrote a book [INAUDIBLE]
mentioned, called "You

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.600
Can Be a Stock Market Genius."

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:09.230
World's worst title of
all time, but in it,

00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:11.450
it said sort of what
Warren Buffett calls,

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:13.970
why don't we look for
one-foot hurdles, OK?

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:17.460
And I opened the book with
a story about my in-laws,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:19.522
who used to spend--

00:24:19.522 --> 00:24:21.230
they had a house in
Connecticut, and they

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.620
used to spend the weekends
going to yard sales and country

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:27.920
auctions looking
for bargains, OK?

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.500
Paintings or sculptures--
they were art collectors.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:37.909
And I described what
they were actually doing.

00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:40.200
And they were not going to
these yard sales and country

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.230
auctions looking for--

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.420
seeing a painting that
was discarded, saying,

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.460
this guy's the next Picasso.

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.110
That's not what they were doing.

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:54.180
What they were looking for
are pieces of art or sculpture

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.900
that they know the artist.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:24:59.550
Some of his similar
work had just

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:02.350
gone for auction for a lot more
than they could buy it for,

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.850
right?

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:04.740
They could buy it
for 30 or 40 cents

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.500
on the dollar for what it
just went to auction for.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.400
That's a lot different question.

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.100
And so what "You Can Be a
Stock Market Genius" was,

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.340
was showing you these
areas that are ignored.

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.920
These are the country
auctions and the yard sales

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.180
of the investment world.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.050
And these were--

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:25.440
I talked about different
areas, spin-offs, bankruptcies,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:30.642
small-cap stocks,
companies going

00:25:30.642 --> 00:25:32.100
through recapitalizations,
anything

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:35.430
weird, complicated situations.

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:38.001
So that's another way, but
you guys have a full-time job.

00:25:38.001 --> 00:25:39.750
That is a full-time
job, let me tell you--

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:42.630
that's a full-time job.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:45.782
So right now we
run mutual funds.

00:25:45.782 --> 00:25:47.490
I can just tell you
some of the struggles

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:49.870
that we have with investors.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:53.670
We do follow that chart,
choose from the 2,000 largest

00:25:53.670 --> 00:25:56.910
companies, and we've
had a nice record.

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:01.140
But there are years
like 2015 where

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:05.070
there's a benchmarking issue,
meaning the S&amp;P 500 in 2015

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.350
was up roughly 1.3%.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:10.680
The equally weighted
Russell 2000 was down 10.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:14.310
The equally weighted
Russell 1000 was down 4.

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:16.440
So if you're picking from
roughly the 2,000 largest

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.650
stocks, an even performance
would be down 6 or 7,

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:21.420
not up 1.3.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:23.850
So there's a benchmarking
issue, but to beat the market,

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:25.030
you have to do
something different.

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:26.196
You're going to zig and zag.

00:26:26.196 --> 00:26:28.380
Everyone knows that.

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:30.271
We're now working
on something-- we've

00:26:30.271 --> 00:26:31.770
had something open
a couple of years

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.690
where we sort of say, OK,
we'll start with the benchmark,

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:36.060
and then we'll value-add.

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.680
And we'll make some
compromises so that we don't--

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.020
it's called Index Plus--

00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:43.500
and so that we don't vary
too much from the index.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.110
So you can stay with us, and
the thesis was basically--

00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:47.670
the best strategy
for you, which is

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.380
how I'll end before
I take questions,

00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.000
is not only one
that makes sense,

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.200
but one you can stick with, OK?

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.692
So you have to understand
what you're doing, number one.

00:26:56.692 --> 00:26:58.150
If you give it to
someone else, you

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.930
have to understand
what they're doing.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:02.190
And you have to be
able to stick with it,

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.090
so you have to understand it
well enough to stick with it.

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:06.980
So that's, I guess,
before I take questions

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.920
what I will leave you at.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.410
And maybe [INAUDIBLE]--

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:12.860
SPEAKER: Yeah,
thank you so much.

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:13.878
That was great.

00:27:13.878 --> 00:27:15.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:19.090
So let me set up the chairs.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.860
So thanks again.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:23.170
In reading your
magic formula book,

00:27:23.170 --> 00:27:26.410
"The Little Book That
Still Beats the Market,"

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:28.900
I noticed that you mentioned
that there were questions

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:32.050
about whether one should short
stocks, the most expensive

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:34.930
ones, through the same metrics.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:37.880
And you had, I guess,
not explicitly said

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.730
that that's the way
you'd want to go.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.460
And correct me if I'm mistaken.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.160
And then you started the formula
investing funds as well, which

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.890
you alluded to in your talk.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:49.940
However, what has
happened to them?

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.030
Are they still
continuing, and what's

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.280
your vision for
that going forward?

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.530
JOEL GREENBLATT: Sure, we
opened long-only funds,

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:57.609
called formula investing.

00:27:57.609 --> 00:27:59.650
And we just merge them
with our long-short funds.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.890
So we have long-short funds
that run 100% net long.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.570
But when we looked
at their performance,

00:28:04.570 --> 00:28:07.330
we did better in up
markets with the 100%

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:08.920
long, long-short funds.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.340
We had a long-short overlay in
up markets and down markets.

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.290
Pretty much, we never
did better the other way.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:18.040
And so we just merged
our simple 100% long

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.100
into the 100% long that
also did long-short.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.810
So it was just a
matter of trying

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:27.850
to put our best foot forward
and managing the things.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:33.740
We actually-- we had just been
rated the number-one fund,

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.930
had gotten five stars
from Morningstar

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.440
for our formula investing
fund, and we closed it.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.280
And we merged it with
our long-short funds.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.080
It wasn't really a
business decision.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.420
It was really a
decision that we want

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.890
to put our best foot forward.

00:28:47.890 --> 00:28:50.890
And so that's why we did that.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:52.810
SPEAKER: So when you
talk of long-short,

00:28:52.810 --> 00:28:58.330
how do you decide between
1/70/70 distribution or 1/40/40

00:28:58.330 --> 00:28:59.140
distribution.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:00.910
When you're saying
you're net 100% long,

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:04.591
how do you come at what
the ratios should be?

00:29:04.591 --> 00:29:06.340
JOEL GREENBLATT: Sure,
so what [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.649
is mentioning is that--
well, what he means is,

00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:10.690
let's say you give us $1.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.910
We'll go buy $1 of
our favorite stocks.

00:29:12.910 --> 00:29:16.104
Then we'll go out and buy $0.70
more of our favorite stocks,

00:29:16.104 --> 00:29:17.770
but this time we'll
pair them with $0.70

00:29:17.770 --> 00:29:18.978
of our least-favorite stocks.

00:29:18.978 --> 00:29:22.410
We'll short them, so we'll
be 70 long and 70 short,

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:29.110
and so another
bucket to add return.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:31.150
And why isn't that 40/40?

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:34.090
We picked ratios for
most of our funds

00:29:34.090 --> 00:29:38.350
that we thought made sense,
given how much volatility you

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:40.990
added by the amount of
leverage you're adding

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.300
and the amount that
you're shorting.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.550
There's not a big magic to it.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.690
Something that worked well at
$1 long with 70/70 or 40/40--

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.150
they both work well.

00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:55.587
In our large-cap universe,
we give people choices.

00:29:55.587 --> 00:29:57.220
SPEAKER: Mm-hmm--
so Joel, there are

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.245
a bunch of questions
around the same theme.

00:29:59.245 --> 00:30:01.120
I guess we can sort of
package them into one.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.210
People are curious to know, what
do you think of the market's

00:30:04.210 --> 00:30:05.640
valuation today?

00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.304
Where do you see
value areas today?

00:30:07.304 --> 00:30:09.220
JOEL GREENBLATT: Well,
the benefit of having--

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:12.550
we have a big research team, and
we have a lot of history on--

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:15.350
if you want to think of the
S&amp;P 500, those 500 companies.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.440
So we actually go
back 25 years and look

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:23.530
at each individual company
every day for the last 25 years

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:26.450
and aggregate them in the
weights of the S&amp;P 500.

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:29.500
So what that allows us to
do is go look at today--

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.510
where's the valuation of the
S&amp;P 500 today, contextualized,

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:34.497
versus the last 25 years?

00:30:34.497 --> 00:30:36.580
And so what I can tell you
is, we're in the 17th--

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.496
it's not a prediction.

00:30:37.496 --> 00:30:40.426
I'm just giving you some facts.

00:30:40.426 --> 00:30:41.800
The way we value
companies, we're

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.990
in the 17th percentile
towards expensive

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.160
over the last 25 years.

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.860
That means the market's been
cheaper 83% of the time,

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:50.110
more expensive 17% of the time.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.050
When it's been here in the
past, year-forward returns

00:30:53.050 --> 00:30:54.100
haven't been negative.

00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.440
During that 25 years, the
market's been up about 10%

00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:57.290
a year.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:31:01.420
So right now from
these valuation levels,

00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:03.160
what's happened in the past--

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.590
over the next year, up
3% to 5% on average;

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:08.530
over the next two, up 8
to 10, so like I said,

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:09.340
not a prediction.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.740
But if you want to know what
has happened to stock prices

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.460
from similar valuation levels
over the last 25 years,

00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:15.460
that's what's happened--

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:20.170
3% to 5% positive return on
average over the next year,

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.030
and 8 to 10 over the next two.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:25.030
SPEAKER: So there's one
question around what you

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.610
were doing in the first
10 years of investing,

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:33.790
when I think you averaged 40%
to 50% annual gains after fees.

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:35.830
Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:39.340
What was the strategy
that you and Rob Goldstein

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.700
were following in those
days, and what parts of that

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.430
are actionable for the
individual investor,

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.740
compared to the
Index Plus strategy?

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.560
JOEL GREENBLATT: Sure, so
stock investing is figuring out

00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:53.740
what a business is
worth and paying less,

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:54.880
and so that hasn't changed.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.054
What makes a company
worth something

00:31:57.054 --> 00:31:58.720
and what makes it
cheap relative to that

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.346
is pretty straightforward.

00:32:03.999 --> 00:32:06.290
That's sort of Ben Graham--
figure out what it's worth,

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:07.790
pay a lot less,
leave a large margin

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:10.660
of safety between those two.

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.940
Warren Buffett
added a little twist

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.832
that made him one of the
richest people in the world.

00:32:15.832 --> 00:32:18.040
He simply said, if you can
buy a good business cheap,

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.027
even better.

00:32:20.027 --> 00:32:21.610
If you read through
Buffett's letters,

00:32:21.610 --> 00:32:23.309
it's very clear what
he's looking for--

00:32:23.309 --> 00:32:24.850
first thing he's
looking for, anyway,

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:27.100
is businesses that are in
high returns, we call it,

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.595
on tangible capital.

00:32:28.595 --> 00:32:30.970
And that just means every
business needs working capital.

00:32:30.970 --> 00:32:32.590
Every business
needs fixed assets.

00:32:32.590 --> 00:32:34.423
How well does it convert
its working capital

00:32:34.423 --> 00:32:36.264
and fixed assets into earnings?

00:32:36.264 --> 00:32:38.680
So the example I used in "The
Little Book," which I really

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.900
wrote to explain these kind
of concepts to my kids--

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.824
I said, imagine you're
building a store,

00:32:42.824 --> 00:32:44.740
and you have to buy the
land, build the store,

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.690
set up the display,
stock it with inventory.

00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:49.090
And all that cost you $400,000.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.760
And every year, the store
spins out $200,000 in profits.

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.005
That's a 50% return
on tangible capital.

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:55.380
Maybe I should
open more stores--

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.920
not so many places
I can reinvest

00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:58.870
my money at those rates.

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:00.562
Then I compared it
to another store.

00:33:00.562 --> 00:33:02.020
Remember, I wrote
this for my kids.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.030
And I called that
store Just Broccoli.

00:33:04.030 --> 00:33:05.620
It's a store that
just sells broccoli,

00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.935
and it's not a very good idea.

00:33:08.935 --> 00:33:11.560
Unfortunately, you still have to
buy the land, build the store,

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:13.393
set up the display,
stock it with inventory.

00:33:13.393 --> 00:33:16.607
That's still going to
cost you roughly $400,000.

00:33:16.607 --> 00:33:18.190
But because it's
kind of a stupid idea

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:19.689
just to sell broccoli
in your store,

00:33:19.689 --> 00:33:21.250
maybe it only earns
$10,000 a year.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:23.830
That's a 2 and 1/2% return
on tangible capital.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.530
And all I simply
say is, I'd much

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.260
prefer to own the business
that can reinvest its money--

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:30.910
all things being
equal, much prefer

00:33:30.910 --> 00:33:32.451
to own the business
that can reinvest

00:33:32.451 --> 00:33:34.090
its money at high
rates of return

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:36.670
than much lower rates of return.

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.470
And so that's sort
of the Buffett twist

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:42.160
that we incorporate in the
companies that we invest in,

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.260
by being very tough
on the way companies

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.160
earn and spend their money.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:49.360
So we tend to get a
group of companies

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.850
that are not only cheap, but
also deploy capital well.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.420
And that's really what
we're looking for.

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:57.250
So we've always done that.

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.550
"The Little Book" was more
of a way to systematize that.

00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:03.619
But in "You Can Be a Stock
Market Genius," which--

00:34:03.619 --> 00:34:05.160
what did we do in
the first 10 years?

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.160
I wrote a book about it.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.043
It was "You Can Be a
Stock Market Genius."

00:34:08.043 --> 00:34:10.310
It was looking for
off-the-beaten-path,

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:12.889
more complicated things that
other people weren't looking

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:13.389
at.

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:15.424
Something strange or
different was going on.

00:34:15.424 --> 00:34:16.840
I showed people
nooks and crannies

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.909
in the market, where they
could look for those.

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:20.920
The issue there-- and
there is no issue.

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.929
It's a great business.

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:25.650
But our portfolios
were 6 or 8 names,

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.570
were 80% of our portfolio.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:31.457
We returned half our outside
capital after five years.

00:34:31.457 --> 00:34:32.290
SPEAKER: Five years.

00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:33.260
JOEL GREENBLATT: We returned
all our outside capital

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.090
after 10 years--

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:34.840
SPEAKER: 10 Years.

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:36.610
JOEL GREENBLATT:
Between '85 and '94--

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:40.210
we were lucky enough to have
enough money to keep our staff

00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:43.719
and continue to run
our money thereafter.

00:34:43.719 --> 00:34:48.320
Warren Buffett
said a fat wallet's

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.739
the enemy of high
investment returns.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:53.929
And so when you have a very
concentrated portfolio,

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:56.090
and you're looking off the
beaten path, where there

00:34:56.090 --> 00:34:59.054
are smaller situations and
things that are more obscure,

00:34:59.054 --> 00:35:00.470
you're very
liquidity-constrained.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:04.610
That's why we kept
returning money,

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:07.430
but that's not why we're
doing what we're doing now.

00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:09.750
If you're going to run
other people's money,

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.750
this is what I'll tell
you with a portfolio that

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.960
has 6 or 8 names that are
80% of your portfolio.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:20.490
Every two to three years,
usually within two, Rob and I--

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.520
my partner, Rob Goldstein,
and I would wake up,

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:27.560
and we'd find out we just lost
20% or 30% of our net worth.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.020
And that happened like clockwork
every two or three years--

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:30.850
just always happened.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:32.808
It has to happen with a
concentrated portfolio,

00:35:32.808 --> 00:35:37.160
either because we were wrong
on one or two of our picks,

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.620
or market--

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.660
they were out of favor
for some period of time.

00:35:41.660 --> 00:35:43.940
And maybe it bothered us,
maybe it didn't if we just

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.100
had to be patient.

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:48.830
But I would say
for outside, when

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.560
I was talking about people
going in and out of funds

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.530
and losing their turn, that is
not conducive for other people,

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.330
especially if they're
not doing the work.

00:35:56.330 --> 00:36:00.560
It was OK for us, and I
think it was good for us

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:02.250
because we knew what we owned.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:04.640
And so as long as the facts
hadn't changed, and as long

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.090
as we believed in our
thesis, we could take that.

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:11.000
I wouldn't say it was easy,
but we could take that.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.796
Now, our bad days,
we have hundreds

00:36:12.796 --> 00:36:14.420
of stocks on the long
side and hundreds

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.380
of stocks on the short side.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.530
We're trying to be
right on average.

00:36:16.530 --> 00:36:17.988
We're buying cheap,
good companies.

00:36:17.988 --> 00:36:19.880
We're shorting
companies that are

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:21.920
either destroying
capital, or losing money,

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.330
or whatever it is.

00:36:23.330 --> 00:36:25.580
And over time, that pays off.

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.830
But our bad days, with
hundreds of stocks on the side,

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:31.000
are 20 or 30 basis points of
under-performance, not 20%,

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.810
30% of our net worth.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:35.390
And so I think for most
people, it's a smoother ride.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:39.515
And one of the great lessons
that young investors--

00:36:39.515 --> 00:36:42.770
and a lot of you guys
are still very young--

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.740
can learn are the
compound interest tables.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.180
If you can make
mid-teen returns--

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:49.490
wouldn't make 40% or
50% annualized returns,

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:53.180
but in mid-teens returns, if you
know compound interest tables,

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:57.290
you can do very well
with a smoother ride

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:59.550
over a long period of time.

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:03.980
One of the best examples--
and when I taught those

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:05.907
ninth-graders, I actually
put on the outside

00:37:05.907 --> 00:37:06.740
of their notebooks--

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:07.610
I handed them notebooks.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:09.890
And I on the outside, I had
a compound interest table.

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:16.280
And it had the example of
starting investing $2,000

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:22.970
a year when you're 19, in
your IRA, until you're 26--

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:25.400
so seven years of
putting away $2,000--

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.920
and never putting
another nickel in again,

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:31.010
or starting when you're
26 and putting in $2,000

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:35.280
a year for 40 years,
until you're 65.

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:39.380
So the people who put in
$2,000 a year from age 19 to 26

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:42.980
and never put in another
nickel ended up with more money

00:37:42.980 --> 00:37:45.440
if you earn 10% a
year on that money.

00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.870
They ended up with more money
with those seven payments

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.210
than the people who start at
26 and put in 40 payments,

00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:51.290
till they were 65.

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:55.590
You end up with more
money, the 19 to 26--

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:59.540
just a very important lesson
to learn about starting early.

00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.130
I know all of you
are over 19, so I'm

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:02.338
sorry I didn't tell you this.

00:38:02.338 --> 00:38:03.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:08.767
But these kids weren't, and
so compound interest tables

00:38:08.767 --> 00:38:09.350
are important.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:16.790
So you're young-- if you
stay with a very methodical

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.940
investment strategy that
makes sense over time,

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.067
you can all still
do very, very well.

00:38:22.067 --> 00:38:23.150
SPEAKER: So, Joel, thanks.

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:25.070
You've talked about
the size effect, right?

00:38:25.070 --> 00:38:28.610
Going into hidden places
and obscure areas as well--

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:30.560
you also talked about
the temperamental edge

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.920
that you can bring to
the process of investing.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.850
And then there is something
to say about the analytical

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.410
and the informational edge.

00:38:39.410 --> 00:38:44.600
And there used to be a lot of
investing in net nets payback.

00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.420
And do you think
some of these edges

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.910
have become less relevant,
versus more relevant,

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:54.110
over time, with information
becoming almost universally

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.580
accessible?

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.850
JOEL GREENBLATT:
Well, information--

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:02.210
people have information
on the S&amp;P 500 stocks.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:06.189
There's still a lot of
group-think going on.

00:39:06.189 --> 00:39:08.480
What I tell my students is,
some of these smaller cap--

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.150
you know what happens if you're
very good at doing things,

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.280
like you read "You Can
Be a Stock Market Genius"

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:15.830
and buy some of these things
in these obscure places.

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:18.260
And what I would call it
is taking unfair bets,

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:22.220
not because you're so smart, but
because you found it in a place

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.195
that other people
aren't looking.

00:39:25.195 --> 00:39:27.320
What happens to people who
get good at that is they

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.694
get a lot of money,
and then they

00:39:28.694 --> 00:39:31.910
can't do that anymore because
they have too much money.

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:35.420
So it opens a whole new
area for young people

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:37.140
to keep coming into that.

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:39.140
So certainly, some of
the smaller situations

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.015
will always be there.

00:39:42.987 --> 00:39:44.570
Things may be a
little more efficient,

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:45.740
But there have been
plenty studies that--

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:47.810
one of the big chapters
I wrote was on spin-offs,

00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:50.740
which are companies that
are sort of separated from--

00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.250
and those still work very well.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:53.840
But it sort of misses--

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.370
they've studied, if you
bought all of the spin-offs,

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:56.078
how would you do?

00:39:56.078 --> 00:39:57.890
And they continue to outperform.

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:59.630
That's not really the question.

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:04.070
The question is, is this an area
ripe for mispriced securities?

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:06.770
If the average
spin-off did average,

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:08.360
that wouldn't mean
anything to me.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.250
You're looking for
the opportunity

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:11.930
where people are
discarding things

00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:13.599
or are just not
interested in things

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:16.140
for reasons that don't have to
do with the investment merits.

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:17.546
They may be too small.

00:40:17.546 --> 00:40:19.670
It may not be the company
that the people who owned

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:22.850
the original stock invested in.

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.750
Usually, you discard companies
that are out of favor

00:40:26.750 --> 00:40:27.630
at that time.

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:29.120
So even though on
average, they've

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.950
continued to outperform
pretty much as

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:32.405
well as when I wrote the book--

00:40:32.405 --> 00:40:33.530
so that's not discouraging.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:36.260
But even if they did
average, they still

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:39.110
are ripe for mispricing,
really what I'm looking for.

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:42.040
So you're looking in these areas
that are ripe for mispricing.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.330
You don't have to run a
statistical model to decide

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.970
whether, on average, they
do well or they don't.

00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:48.570
If you know what
you're looking for,

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:50.630
you're looking for
opportunities to find

00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:51.810
things that are mispriced.

00:40:51.810 --> 00:40:55.550
And I don't think
those will go away.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:59.390
But as I said, there are
higher and better uses

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:01.490
for most people's time.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:03.040
So I had a ball doing that.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.520
I have a ball doing
what I'm doing.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.680
If you don't want to
do it, fine with me.

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.320
SPEAKER: In one of
your recent interviews,

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.590
I think you mentioned Apple,
one of the big companies.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:15.830
And you think group think and
mispricings can happen even

00:41:15.830 --> 00:41:16.670
in big companies.

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:19.190
So maybe Apple or
some other company--

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:21.290
I was wondering if you
could take our audience

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.810
through an example of,
what are the metrics one

00:41:23.810 --> 00:41:27.440
should be looking at if they
were looking at a company?

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:30.500
JOEL GREENBLATT: Well, I'll pick
Apple as just big, big picture.

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.786
You guys have heard of that?

00:41:31.786 --> 00:41:32.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:41.630
So at least I'm old enough
to have had a BlackBerry.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:46.504
And it used to have
50% of the market.

00:41:46.504 --> 00:41:47.670
Now it doesn't really exist.

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:48.780
It wasn't that long ago.

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:56.636
And the vast majority of Apple's
profits come from their phone.

00:41:56.636 --> 00:41:58.260
So that's the negative
story on Apple--

00:41:58.260 --> 00:41:59.260
it's a hardware company.

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.830
It's going to crash and burn
like all of them do, OK?

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:06.850
On the other hand, some
people might say, oh,

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:10.540
it has an ecosystem of products
that play off one another.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:11.890
They interact with one another.

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:13.000
It has a brand.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.430
I always say, hey, Coca-Cola
doesn't make sugar water,

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:18.730
and they have kept
their brand pretty well.

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:20.950
People tend to like
Apple as a brand.

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:26.040
And so the question
is, which is it?

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.510
Is Apple a hardware
company, or is it

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:32.020
an ecosystem of products
with a great brand name?

00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:34.907
I'd say the answer is probably
gray, somewhere in between.

00:42:34.907 --> 00:42:35.740
It's not either one.

00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:37.660
It's probably somewhere
in between those two.

00:42:41.034 --> 00:42:46.790
But if you took a
look at the market,

00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:48.970
I can look at where
the S&amp;P is trading.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:52.510
I can look where
Apple's trading.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:56.830
And a few months ago--
it's still very cheap,

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.110
but a few months ago, it was
trading at less than half

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:03.970
of the valuation of
the S&amp;P. So at a price,

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:06.490
my answer is, if it's
somewhere in between,

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:08.320
I'd say it's probably
better than average.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.402
And I'm getting
it at half price.

00:43:10.402 --> 00:43:11.860
I don't know if
that's right, but I

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:13.900
have a large margin of safety.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:15.610
I own hundreds of--

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:17.472
what I say is,
what we do now is,

00:43:17.472 --> 00:43:19.180
I don't know the answer
to your question.

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:19.951
It's gray.

00:43:19.951 --> 00:43:20.950
I don't know the answer.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:23.033
I don't know if it's closer
to a hardware company.

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:26.560
I don't know if it's a
ecosystem with a brand attached,

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:29.440
and so it's much, much better.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.510
But interest rates are 2%.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:34.270
It's got a 10% free
cash flow yields,

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:35.710
earns high returns on capital.

00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:37.270
It's got a great niche.

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:41.380
What I would say is, I don't
know if Apple's going to work,

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:42.580
but I don't own just Apple.

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.340
I own a bucket of Apples.

00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.390
I own a bucket of
companies with metrics

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:50.980
like that-- trading really
cheap, with deploys capital

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:54.895
well, with nice
potential prospects.

00:43:54.895 --> 00:43:56.770
And so I don't know if
Apple's going to work.

00:43:56.770 --> 00:43:58.900
I know my bucket of
Apples is going to work.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.470
That was the chart I showed you.

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.890
And so we own the
bucket of Apples.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:04.690
But if you ask my
bet on Apple, I

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:09.980
think it's cheap, relative
to other choices right now.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:12.230
SPEAKER: Fantastic, I just
have a couple of questions,

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.030
Joel, quickly.

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:17.300
You mentioned index fund in
the beginning of your talk.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.960
With all the money flowing
into passive funds, ETFs,

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.060
and index funds, what would
be your contrarian moves

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:25.544
during a period like that?

00:44:25.544 --> 00:44:27.710
Are there things investors
should be cautious about,

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:29.605
for example?

00:44:29.605 --> 00:44:30.980
JOEL GREENBLATT:
Well, I told you

00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.810
where I thought the
market in general--

00:44:32.810 --> 00:44:38.250
it's a market cap weighted
index, S&amp;P 500 was expensive,

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.792
but still expecting positive
returns going forward.

00:44:40.792 --> 00:44:42.000
It's a world of alternatives.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:47.340
So the question is, how
should I invest my money?

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:56.470
The move to passive can, with
all the ETFs and everything

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:59.620
else, can cause dislocations
in the short term,

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:03.220
because people are
not discerning.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:05.785
Remember, I said stocks
are not pieces of paper

00:45:05.785 --> 00:45:08.410
that bounce around, that you put
Sharpe ratios and Sortinos on.

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:12.910
They're ownership shares of
businesses, and businesses--

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:17.410
there's a dispersion in their
fundamentals, how one is doing,

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:18.550
versus another.

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:21.820
When you just take
an ETF and don't

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.330
discern between the differences
in the fundamentals,

00:45:25.330 --> 00:45:28.850
that can cause dislocations
in the short term.

00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:32.140
That just makes me smile more
because those dislocations

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.300
mean, hey, I can find
bargains because people

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:36.070
stopped thinking.

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:38.230
But I don't think they're
at such an extent,

00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:39.470
other than in the short term.

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:41.470
I think you're familiar--
when the market falls,

00:45:41.470 --> 00:45:43.810
and everyone gets
depressed all at once,

00:45:43.810 --> 00:45:45.220
they say correlations go to 1.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.810
That just means everyone
throws the baby out

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:47.601
with the bathwater.

00:45:47.601 --> 00:45:48.980
They make no discernment.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:52.000
But that really just happens
for the first month, maybe two

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:52.524
at the most.

00:45:52.524 --> 00:45:54.190
And then there starts
to be discernment.

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:57.010
That's actually the best
opportunity time for us,

00:45:57.010 --> 00:45:58.480
when people start
discerning again.

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:01.330
And you just had everything move
together, which it shouldn't.

00:46:01.330 --> 00:46:03.820
They all have
different prospects.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.250
And so the same with
ETFs, if there's flows

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:09.130
into them or the indexes--

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:12.790
that could cause
short-term dislocations

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:16.450
over a month or two, but
those get corrected over time.

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:21.100
Like I said, the market
eventually gets it right.

00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:22.442
There's a lot of--

00:46:22.442 --> 00:46:23.650
just think of the jellybeans.

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:24.480
You really get it.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.579
It's the jellybean effect
of when everyone hears

00:46:27.579 --> 00:46:28.870
what everyone else is thinking.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:30.470
That happens most of the time.

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:32.710
That's what the stock market is.

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:36.970
Your job is to be cold and
calculating and unemotional.

00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:39.640
Unfortunately, people are human.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:46.000
It's good news for
us, but people--

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.950
the stats are against you.

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:52.510
That's why I think
the indexers get

00:46:52.510 --> 00:46:54.892
it right for the wrong reasons.

00:46:54.892 --> 00:46:56.350
They mostly are
saying the market's

00:46:56.350 --> 00:46:59.410
efficient and have other
explanations of why

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:00.220
you can't beat it.

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:03.400
I think the market often
gives you opportunities,

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.010
but it's very difficult
to take advantage of them

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:09.300
for behavioral and
agency problems.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.230
And those are much
more powerful than you

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:14.680
would think by just saying, oh,
behavioral and agency problems.

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.644
The people are people, and
it's been happening forever.

00:47:18.644 --> 00:47:20.060
I don't think it's
getting better.

00:47:20.060 --> 00:47:23.950
I think time horizons
are shortening.

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:28.210
There's so much-- all that
data, all that-- look,

00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:30.544
when I started my
first firm in 1985,

00:47:30.544 --> 00:47:31.960
I used to write
quarterly letters.

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:34.930
And they read
something like this--

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:37.330
we were up 3% last
quarter, thanks a lot.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:39.880
That's what it sort of said.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.630
Now we have $10 and $20
billion endowments that

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.961
need to get our results weekly.

00:47:46.961 --> 00:47:48.460
I don't know what
they do with them.

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:50.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:56.654
But we now have to do
that, and most of them

00:47:56.654 --> 00:47:57.570
do a good job with it.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:59.565
But that's just the
way of the world.

00:47:59.565 --> 00:48:01.690
So if you keep measuring
things in shorter periods,

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:03.690
and you can measure them,
and there's more data,

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:05.440
it doesn't make it better.

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.869
It makes you more susceptible
to emotional influence.

00:48:08.869 --> 00:48:10.160
So that world's getting better.

00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:13.270
The last man
standing is patience.

00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:15.130
We call it time arbitrage.

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:17.950
Other people call it time
arbitrage-- just being patient.

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:23.230
That's in really short supply,
and it's not getting better.

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:26.870
Things are moving to
faster and less patience.

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.044
So that's really the secret.

00:48:29.044 --> 00:48:30.460
So now you don't
have to even read

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:32.750
the big secret [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:35.080
SPEAKER: I think one
fantastic gift you've

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.910
given to the value
investing community

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:38.950
is the Value Investors Club.

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:41.590
I'm sure most people here have
already visited the website.

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:43.570
If you have not,
please check it out.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:45.190
It's an amazing resource.

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:46.870
Joel, if you could
maybe just say

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:50.770
a word about the Value
Investors Club, what's

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:52.960
your vision with
it going forward?

00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.180
And how does it
compare or contrast it

00:48:55.180 --> 00:49:00.202
with other investing platforms
that are emerging these days?

00:49:00.202 --> 00:49:02.660
JOEL GREENBLATT: Sure, well,
it originally started in 1999.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.770
And the whole big
thing with the internet

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:08.500
back then was getting
millions of eyeballs to look.

00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:12.190
And I viewed it more as
a, wow, I always wanted

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:13.510
to be in an investment club.

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:16.060
And I thought, hey, I could
form an investment club where

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.860
you can meet any time,
at your convenience,

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.610
wherever you are,
were, and share ideas

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:23.410
and back and forth about it.

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:26.950
And I'm always grading papers
at Columbia for my students.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:30.310
And at the time, there
were Yahoo message boards

00:49:30.310 --> 00:49:33.330
where 99.9% of the stuff
was not worth reading.

00:49:33.330 --> 00:49:39.925
So I sort of said,
hey, why don't we--

00:49:39.925 --> 00:49:41.300
along with my
partner John Petry,

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.860
I said, why don't we vet the
people who can join the Value

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:45.580
Investors Club?

00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:48.040
And if you would have gotten--
maybe two or three people

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.140
in the class each year
would get an A-plus.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.060
And if you could write
up an investment thesis

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.101
that I would have given
an A-plus to in my class,

00:49:54.101 --> 00:49:57.080
you can join the
club, and it's free.

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:01.646
The only thing that you have
to do is share your best ideas.

00:50:01.646 --> 00:50:03.520
You have to share a
couple of your best ideas

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.145
during the course of
the year, and that

00:50:05.145 --> 00:50:07.840
entitles you to see
everybody else's good ideas.

00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.660
And so it's just merit based.

00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.330
And still only 1
out of 20 applicants

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:16.150
get in, so I think it's a
little harder than Harvard.

00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.898
I don't know.

00:50:16.898 --> 00:50:18.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:23.440
But it's been going
now for 16 years.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.160
We do have a--

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.160
I think it's a 45-
or 90-day delay

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.620
that if you're not a member,
but to get the live stuff,

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:30.620
you have to be a member.

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:34.967
So learn how to value a
business and apply, if you like.

00:50:34.967 --> 00:50:36.550
There are instructions
on the website.

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:38.091
It's called the
Value Investors Club.

00:50:38.091 --> 00:50:40.810
But as a learning tool, I
always refer people there

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:43.840
because these are
very smart investors.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.130
They beat each other up.

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.564
There's a Q&amp;A after they
post something, and say,

00:50:47.564 --> 00:50:48.230
what about this?

00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:49.520
What about that?

00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:52.240
A great rating out of 10
is 5, because everyone's

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:55.000
mean and very--

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
they're value investors.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.420
They're very tough and stingy.

00:50:58.420 --> 00:50:59.550
And so they don't--

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:04.450
so if you look at the ratings
and see anything a 5 or above,

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:06.880
that's good, these guys.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.499
And you can look at that.

00:51:08.499 --> 00:51:10.040
It's just a learning
exercise, right?

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.350
It's teach a man to fish.

00:51:11.350 --> 00:51:15.040
That's really how to
be good at investing.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.789
It's not anything else.

00:51:16.789 --> 00:51:18.580
You've got to understand
what you're doing.

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.100
It's a great way to learn.

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:23.330
So I think for the
next generation,

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:25.280
it's a nice way to
teach them to look

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.200
at what smart investors
are doing now--

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.241
doesn't mean I agree with
everything on the site.

00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:33.900
And this is a good point.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:40.480
I'm probably wrong more than I'm
right about passing on things.

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:48.404
But Warren Buffett calls it no
called strikes on Wall Street.

00:51:48.404 --> 00:51:50.070
You could let 100
pitches go by, and you

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:51.320
should've swung at 30 of them.

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.800
But if you only
pick one, and you

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.910
make sure that's a good
one, that's really the way

00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:58.200
that we go about investing.

00:51:58.200 --> 00:51:59.430
I just have to--

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:02.700
my partner Rob Goldstein and I
are very tough on each other.

00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:04.620
So we both have to like it.

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:06.540
We both have to
argue our points.

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:10.930
And if we both like it,
we think it's pretty good.

00:52:10.930 --> 00:52:13.650
So we're really, really
picking our pitches.

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:16.380
It doesn't mean we don't
miss a lot of good ones.

00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.850
It doesn't matter
if we miss them.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:19.890
It just matters the
one we pick are good.

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:21.450
And that's sort of
the way to think

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:25.860
about "You Can Be a Stock Market
Genius" type of investing.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:28.200
What we're doing now in
our long-short portfolios

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:29.910
is more being right on average.

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:31.230
I showed you that chart
where we're pretty

00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:32.354
good at valuing businesses.

00:52:32.354 --> 00:52:34.170
So we buy a group
of businesses where

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:36.480
we have a bucket of Apples.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.270
And we're short a bucket
of high-priced companies.

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:45.970
We're going to be short
some things that lose money,

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:48.550
or the Teslas and Amazons of
the world, who are selling

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:51.150
at 100 times free cash flow.

00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:53.500
And people get confused,
because I call that

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.810
the tyranny of the anecdote.

00:52:54.810 --> 00:52:58.467
It's we will short
some wrong ones.

00:52:58.467 --> 00:53:00.550
We won't short much of
them, but we'll short some,

00:53:00.550 --> 00:53:01.480
and we'll be wrong.

00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.950
And you'll know their names
because those were the winners.

00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:07.630
But if you're short
hundreds, take my word.

00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:09.690
It's not a good idea
to eat through cash,

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:13.650
or lose money, or sell at
100 times free cash flow.

00:53:13.650 --> 00:53:16.260
And usually, if you're
generating lots of cash,

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:17.927
and you can buy that
cheap, and they're

00:53:17.927 --> 00:53:20.260
deploying their capital well,
that's a good thing to do.

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.290
And so we're just trying
to be right on average.

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:24.000
Two different ways to
do it, doesn't make

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.670
one better than the other--

00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:32.760
there are different
ways to make money.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:35.970
I love them both,
would do both again.

00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:37.744
They're just both
full-time jobs.

00:53:37.744 --> 00:53:39.660
SPEAKER: Great-- and,
Joel, our final question

00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:43.050
goes maybe one step
ahead into valuation.

00:53:43.050 --> 00:53:45.390
In your books you've spoken
about different kinds

00:53:45.390 --> 00:53:47.820
of multiples that are
used to value companies.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:50.730
You've spoken about enterprise
value to free cash flow,

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:53.700
for example EV to EBITDA
is one of those multiples.

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:55.680
And lots of such
multiples, you say,

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.290
have been proven effective
for long-term investing,

00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:00.660
as you're buying a
bucket or a basket.

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.930
However, the question is, due
to the lack of a single source

00:54:03.930 --> 00:54:07.080
of accurate benchmark markets--
because there are one-off

00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:09.390
charges and things you
have to clean up for--

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:11.380
there are many sites
on the web claiming

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:15.420
a wide range of numbers,
some good, some not so much.

00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.120
Have you thought of having
a standardized, maybe

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:22.050
open-source, implementation
to benchmark these metrics

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:25.720
over the long term, in the
same spirit of magic formula

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.350
investing, for example?

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:31.250
JOEL GREENBLATT: OK, I think I'm
a nice guy, but not that nice.

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:31.750 --> 00:54:37.955
So we have a team of analysts.

00:54:37.955 --> 00:54:40.330
We go through every balance
sheet, income statement, cash

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:41.590
flow statement in the
companies we look at.

00:54:41.590 --> 00:54:44.110
What's that deferred tax asset,
or pension liability, or off

00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:45.850
balance sheet plant in Taiwan?

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:47.955
How should we handle that?

00:54:47.955 --> 00:54:50.080
How efficient are they at
using and spending money?

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:52.455
We do all that work.

00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:53.830
When I wrote "The
Little Book," I

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:55.663
called that the Not
Trying Very Hard method.

00:54:55.663 --> 00:55:00.500
It worked incredibly well
using rough metrics--

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.910
the type you're talking
about, Rough metrics--

00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:06.300
and it worked incredibly well.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:09.407
My partner Rob and I looked
at each other and said,

00:55:09.407 --> 00:55:10.490
this not only worked well.

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:13.910
It worked much better with
those, not trying very hard,

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.640
than we even thought.

00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.700
Can we improve on that?

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.570
We actually know how
to value businesses.

00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:20.890
Can we just go do that?

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:25.210
And we put together a
research team, and we do that.

00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:27.530
It would be really nice if
I shared that with everyone,

00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:28.600
but it's a lot of work.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.960
And the other way
works incredibly well.

00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.308
SPEAKER: You're a nice guy.

00:55:32.308 --> 00:55:33.645
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:33.645 --> 00:55:35.020
JOEL GREENBLATT:
I am a nice guy,

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:38.116
and so we're trying to treat
our clients really well.

00:55:38.116 --> 00:55:41.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:43.440
SPEAKER: On that happy note,
thank you so much, Joel.

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:43.750
It's been a pleasure.

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:44.890
JOEL GREENBLATT:
Thank you very much.

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:45.390
Thank you.

00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:48.840
[APPLAUSE]
