throw at you it's a lot of information
 

00:07:58.339 --> 00:08:01.179
throw at you it's a lot of information
and you do follow it just enough but

00:08:01.179 --> 00:08:01.189
and you do follow it just enough but
 

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.740
and you do follow it just enough but
it's also just enough to sort of say

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:02.750
it's also just enough to sort of say
 

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.649

of that and this person doesn't get
 

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:11.439
of that and this person doesn't get
better security around this place that's

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:11.449
better security around this place that's
 

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.360
better security around this place that's
probably my biggest problem the security

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:13.370
probably my biggest problem the security
 

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.420
probably my biggest problem the security
for these books and these techniques is

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:16.430
for these books and these techniques is
 

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.540

breaks into this library it actually

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:23.389
breaks into this library it actually
 

00:08:23.389 --> 00:08:25.300
breaks into this library it actually
opens up with the world's worst security

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:25.310
opens up with the world's worst security
 

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.889
opens up with the world's worst security
this guy's in this library and here's

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:26.899
this guy's in this library and here's
 

00:08:26.899 --> 00:08:28.749

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.939
folding buildings and stuff can't quite
do it so now they have to up security

00:08:47.939 --> 00:08:47.949
do it so now they have to up security
 

00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:51.220

00:10:07.389 --> 00:10:07.399
technical stuff that if you really think
 

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:10.449
technical stuff that if you really think
about it doesn't add up at all but I

00:10:10.449 --> 00:10:10.459
about it doesn't add up at all but I
 

00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:12.160
