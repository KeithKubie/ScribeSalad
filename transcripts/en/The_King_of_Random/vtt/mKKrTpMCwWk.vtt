00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.514
Today, we're taking a look
at jaw breakers and gobstoppers,

00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:04.440
and seeing what happens
if we heat them up,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.900
melt them down,
rinse them away,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.090
or just plain smash 'em.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:15.960
[Music]

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.620
Most of you are probably
familiar with jawbreakers.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.200
They're a round candy

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.000
that just has layers
and layers of color and flavor.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.900
They come in a few
different varieties,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.900
and we've got some things

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.800
we want to try out
with these bad boys.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.300
This right here is just
over 2 inches in diameter.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.400
It's pretty standard size
for a jawbreaker.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.500
We've also got
this Mega jawbreaker,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.180
which, oh boy,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.100
feels quite a bit heavier
than our mid sized one.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.800
And I can only imagine

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.900
that it would take months
to eat this whole thing.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.072
Normally, when you're
eating a jawbreaker,

00:00:46.072 --> 00:00:47.483
you're going to lick it,

00:00:47.483 --> 00:00:50.261
and since it's made up almost
entirely sugar, flavor,

00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:53.211
and coloring, it's going
to take a while to get through,

00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:54.800
but you can get through it.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.300
Rather than just sit here,
licking this jawbreaker forever,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.600
I thought we would get
a little time lapse of something

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.449
a little bit faster.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:02.950
We're going to
take this jawbreaker,

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:04.200
put it on a little stand,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.074
and then have running
water flow down over it,

00:01:07.074 --> 00:01:08.800
and just let that water run

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.430
until it just carves
away the jawbreaker.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.600
Hopefully, we should be able
to see the different layers

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.500
as they're exposed,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.600
and then washed away,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.340
and we're a little curious
what shape we're going

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.040
to end up with.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:37.720
[Music]

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.100
We've got our giant jawbreaker,
and you know what?

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.609
I just--

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:43.200
I want to cut it in half.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.540
Now, if you're a big fan
of the channel What's Inside,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.998
you may have seen
a few years ago,

00:01:46.998 --> 00:01:48.500
they did cut one of these in half.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.600
I wanted to try as well,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.400
and then we're really
going to clean it up.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.732
I want some really good shots

00:01:52.732 --> 00:01:54.800
of what the inside of one
of these looks like.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.200
So I've never cut one
of these in half.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.684
They had quite
a hard time with it.

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:58.584
They use a chisel.

00:01:58.584 --> 00:01:59.500
They ended up using

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.000
like a grinder to just cut
all the way around part of it,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.400
and then break it in half.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.000
I'm gonna see

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.200
if I can get through this whole
thing with a hacksaw.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.700
I've never tried
this before though,

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.050
so I may have to improvise
if the hacksaw doesn't work.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.625
Now, this is
our largest Jawbreaker.

00:02:12.625 --> 00:02:13.570
It's pretty dang big.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.440
It's about the size
of a softball,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.551
and it weighs,
I believe, a pound,

00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:19.344
which is a lot of candy.

00:02:19.344 --> 00:02:21.213
I do kind of want to test

00:02:21.213 --> 00:02:25.100
if you can actually break a jaw
with this Jawbreaker.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.180
I have an idea.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.360
Success.

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.029
This is now a verified,

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:35.700
well, Jaws breaker,
if not Jawbreaker.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:56.440
[Music]

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.500
Okay, I think I've cut all the
way through this jawbreaker now.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.931
It's sort of clicked together,
so at least half of it,

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:02.400
I think that means is separated.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.600
I have a ton of this just
jawbreaker dust here,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.100
and flakes just chipped
off the outside,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.780
and I think I owe an apology
to the What's Inside team

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.970
because I thought it
was going to be easier

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:14.581
than it was,

00:03:14.581 --> 00:03:15.803
and it was really weird.

00:03:15.803 --> 00:03:17.150
It kept sticking to the saw.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.500
I ended up having to just
wash the saw blade off

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.960
every like 30 seconds or so.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.920
But that is super cool.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.540
Okay.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.680
I need to clean this up,

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.630
and make it just
really nice and pretty.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.800
'Cause you can see
all of the layers,

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.461
but you can't see
them very well just

00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:33.800
because of all the saw marks,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.863
and the different
cutting angles and stuff.

00:03:36.863 --> 00:03:40.000
So it looks good now,
we can make it better.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:04:48.440
[Music]

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.900
As you can see, we've got lots
of these little ones.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.260
These are called Gobstoppers,
or Everlasting Gobstoppers,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.440
that's what they say on the box.

00:04:54.441 --> 00:04:55.400
The name comes from

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.600
a Roald Dahl book called Charlie
and the Chocolate Factory.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.260
In the book,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.819
Everlasting Gobstoppers were
supposed to last forever.

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:03.000
You could suck on them.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.151
They would change colors.

00:05:04.151 --> 00:05:06.500
They would change flavors,
but they'd never go away.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.711
Well, we haven't quite

00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:10.300
figured out how to make
the Everlasting part.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.020
Each one of these boxes says
it has about 9 servings,

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.725
and each serving is 9 pieces,

00:05:16.725 --> 00:05:19.400
and that gives us about
81 Gobstoppers per box.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.000
And if we're trying
for 1,000 Gobstoppers,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.900
that's 12 and 1/2 boxes,
give or take.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.500
And so, we are going
to load up 13 boxes,

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.000
so we might actually have just
over a thousand Gobstoppers.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.900
Throw them on the barbecue.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.500
Just your standard cookout food.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.800
You know, some
people like chicken,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.200
some people like steaks,
some people like Gobstoppers.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.200
That should be just over
1,000 tiny little Jawbreakers.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.070
We've got a tray full
of a thousand jawbreakers.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.000
Let's go upstairs
where the barbecue is.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.840
[Music]

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.920
We could put
another rack over here,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.300
and put the whole pan
on top of that.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.500
But where's the fun in that?

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.900
Let's go put the rack directly
onto the charcoal.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:14.800
Here we go.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.000
I've always really preferred
my jawbreakers to have

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.290
a good smoky flavor
to 'em, you know.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.600
This is a good way to get that.

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:33.960
[Music]

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.800
Our 1,000 Gobstoppers
in the barbecue

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.560
have now been cooking
for maybe 15-20 minutes,

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.500
and they are mostly melted
away in just this soup

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.200
of molten jawbreaker candy.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.700
Just turned a sort
of chocolatey raspberry color.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.280
It's very thin.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.036
Like I didn't think it
was going to get this thin,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.060
but look how liquid that is.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.760
[Music]

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.780
It's not terrible.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.211
It has a really
interesting texture to it,

00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:07.233
and it's not
something unexpected.

00:07:07.233 --> 00:07:09.300
Even though it's smooth
at this point,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.700
having been all melted down,

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:14.075
it still has a feel
as though it's slightly powdery,

00:07:14.075 --> 00:07:15.400
like other compacted

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.600
powder candies, like Smarties
or something like that.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.340
That would be the American
type of Smarties,

00:07:20.341 --> 00:07:22.700
which are small
fruit flavored things,

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.500
and not the Canadian

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.029
or perhaps other types
of Smarties as well,

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:29.920
which are basically M&amp;M's
under a different name.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.450
So yeah, it tastes
like it doesn't--

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.960
I don't know.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.780
I don't know

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.364
if it taste powdery is
the right way to say,

00:07:35.364 --> 00:07:36.174
but it feels powdery.

00:07:36.174 --> 00:07:37.100
I know I've licked this,

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.700
but I'm the only one
who's going to be eating it.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:40.500
So I'm just gonna put it
right back here in the soup.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:42.220
Keep mixing this up.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.500
We have melted most
of what's in here.

00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:45.865
Just trying to finish

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:50.500
off those last few sticklers
to really get this all liquid.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:58.420
[Music]

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.340
There's just a lot
of burnt boiled

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.100
over sugar on the barbecue
down at the bottom.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.200
I don't see any Gobstoppers
left in here.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.300
So I'm going to say
that is thoroughly toasted

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.300
at this point.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:42.700
[Music]

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:44.300
It's a lot like
a soft Starburst,

00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:45.800
like a slightly warm Starburst.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.100
That's about the texture.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.700
Really sticks to my teeth a lot.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:56.720
[Music]

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.373
It really is kind of just a mix
of all the different flavors,

00:08:59.373 --> 00:09:00.323
like there's grape,

00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:01.900
and orange, and lime,
and raspberry,

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.400
and whatever else is in those.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.100
I think it's better to just

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:08.700
have individual flavors
than all mixed together,

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.500
but it's just sort of
a general fruit-flavored candy.

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.560
So sticky.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.700
As an option
of something to show,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.500
we did have some Gobstoppers
in a slow cooker.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:20.500
However, we decided

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.504
that's pretty similar
to the look of the barbecue,

00:09:22.504 --> 00:09:23.595
it's just on a smaller scale.

00:09:23.595 --> 00:09:24.800
So we were going to turn it off,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.200
but I discovered
something interesting.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.200
The Gobstoppers,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.851
even after sitting here
for like an hour and a half,

00:09:29.851 --> 00:09:31.516
it barely changed shape at all.

00:09:31.516 --> 00:09:32.485
But I did discover

00:09:32.485 --> 00:09:34.919
that they've become soft
as they've heated up.

00:09:34.919 --> 00:09:37.096
So now, we've got
squishy Gobstoppers,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.474
and they are fairly hot,

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.540
but not so hot that it's
really hurting to hold them.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:42.900
And so now, it's just--

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.180
Instead of jawbreakers,
they're just like a soft candy.

00:09:46.189 --> 00:09:47.900
Out of all of
the jawbreaker tests

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.254
that we've tried out today,

00:09:49.254 --> 00:09:51.900
this might be the one that I
recommend actually trying.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.200
You definitely want
to be careful

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.974
that you're not going
to burn yourself on them,

00:09:54.974 --> 00:09:55.900
but they're pretty good.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.400
No broken jaws.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.900
It's not known exactly
when jaw breakers were invented,

00:10:02.904 --> 00:10:05.500
but they became popular
in the late 1800s

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.300
and early 1900s thanks to
the Ferrara Pan Candy Company.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:10.826
Guys, that's not all.

00:10:10.826 --> 00:10:12.162
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:14.511
That box up at the top is going
to take you to our last video,

00:10:14.511 --> 00:10:15.575
you should go check that out.

00:10:15.575 --> 00:10:16.857
The other box
is going to show you

00:10:16.857 --> 00:10:18.710
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.270
If you hit this bomb
here in the middle,

00:10:20.270 --> 00:10:21.710
it will subscribe
you to our channel.

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.500
That way, you never gonna miss
out on a cool video.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.571
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:10:24.571 --> 00:10:25.712
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.740
Talk to you then.
