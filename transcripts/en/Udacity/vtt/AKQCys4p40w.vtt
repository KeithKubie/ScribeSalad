00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.650
This is the last project of the course. We'll be

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.450
putting together everything you've learned

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.585
so far. Affordances, signifiers, conceptual

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:11.730
model, system image, discoverablity, and feedback. For many of you,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.130
this will be the first time you've thought about an

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.260
interface from the design side. You just use it. And

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.700
for others, perhaps you'll be thinking about stuff in new

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.850
ways. In any case, this is the capstone project for

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.700
the course, and we want you to bring it all together.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.090
And you'll be amazed at what you create and learn in the process.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.380
As we do this project, we'll also practice a few new key design methods

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.660
that will help you create new ideas,

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.970
faster prototypes and get feedback from users.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.630
But don't worry about that now, you'll be doing it before you know it.
