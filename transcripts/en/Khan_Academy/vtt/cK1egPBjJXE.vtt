00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.010
So we're told that Mount
Everest is 29,029 feet tall.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.700
Estimate Mount Everest's
height by rewriting it

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.970
as a number in the form x times
10 to the y-th power feet,

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.670
where x and y are
single-digit numbers.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.140
So let's think about
how we would do this.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.080
So x and y have to be
single-digit numbers.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.437
So if we were to write it
in scientific notation,

00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:28.145
we could write something
like, let's see,

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:38.727
it would be 2.9029 times 10.

00:00:38.727 --> 00:00:40.310
And actually, I'm
going to be careful.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.440
Times I should write like that.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.880
I'll use this little caret sign.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.070
I'm pressing shift and
6 to get the caret sign.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.640
Times 10 to the-- and
I moved the decimal.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.340
Let's see, in order to
go from 2 to 20,000,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.079
I have to add 1, 2, 3, 4 zeroes,
so times 10 to the fourth.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.870
So that's what I would
do if they were just

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.750
asking us to write it
in scientific notation.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.805
But they're not
asking us to write it

00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:05.160
in scientific notation.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.136
They're saying estimate
Mount Everest's height

00:01:08.136 --> 00:01:09.510
by writing it in
this form, where

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.620
x and y are
single-digit numbers.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.190
So as I wrote it
right over here,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.150
2.0929 is not a
single-digit number.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.670
4 is a single-digit number.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.160
So at least I got
the y part right.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.910
But I need to write this
part, which, in this form,

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.010
this would be the x.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.926
I need to write that as
a single-digit number.

00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:28.840
And the key is that they
want me to estimate.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.520
So if I were to estimate
2.9029, I would write that as 3.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.330
So I'm going to go with
3 times 10 to the fourth.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.450
And if I were to expand out
3 times 10 to the fourth,

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.800
it would be 30,000 feet.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.380
So my estimate
seems pretty good.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.610
So let's check.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.500
There we go.
