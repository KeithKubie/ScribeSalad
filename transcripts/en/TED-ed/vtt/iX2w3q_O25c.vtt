00:00:14.643 --> 00:00:16.604
There are still lots of things about space

00:00:16.604 --> 00:00:18.381
that we may never be able to answer,

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:20.658
like is time travel possible?

00:00:20.658 --> 00:00:23.755
Or are aliens living somewhere else in the Milky Way?

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:26.885
But there is one thing I believe about space:

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:29.018
Space is trying to kill me.

00:00:29.018 --> 00:00:31.057
Space isn't out to get me personally.

00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:33.993
It's also trying to kill you and everybody else.

00:00:33.993 --> 00:00:35.022
Think about it.

00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:37.941
Space doesn't naturally have what we need to survive

00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:39.235
when we travel there:

00:00:39.235 --> 00:00:40.273
no air,

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:41.421
it's too hot

00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:42.467
or too cold,

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:46.325
no ozone to protect us from those nasty UV rays, either.

00:00:46.325 --> 00:00:47.529
This all sounds bad,

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:49.191
but what can space really do to me

00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:50.890
if I stay on Earth?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.373
What we need to understand is that objects in space

00:00:53.373 --> 00:00:55.503
can cause people to think their days are numbered,

00:00:55.503 --> 00:00:57.709
even when there are events on Earth

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:59.386
that can hurt or kill us

00:00:59.386 --> 00:01:01.799
before something from space does.

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.087
So, what are the odds that one of these objects

00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:05.511
will really affect Earth

00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:06.424
and you

00:01:06.424 --> 00:01:07.374
and me

00:01:07.374 --> 00:01:08.514
in our lifetime?

00:01:08.514 --> 00:01:10.933
Well, we can take what we know about the universe

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:12.907
to try and figure that out.

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:14.192
You might have heard stories

00:01:14.192 --> 00:01:16.110
about asteroids hitting the Earth.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.820
That would be pretty bad.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.136
Scientists think asteroids might have killed off

00:01:20.136 --> 00:01:21.784
most of the dinosaurs.

00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:24.827
Sounds like something we should worry about, right?

00:01:24.827 --> 00:01:27.483
Well, astronomers can now watch asteroids in space

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:30.570
and see them coming using complex computer models

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.842
to predict the deadly rock's path.

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:34.819
For a while, the reported odds

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:38.607
that asteroid Apophis would strike Earth in 2036

00:01:38.607 --> 00:01:40.846
were once 1 in 625.

00:01:40.846 --> 00:01:42.751
But, after updating their data,

00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:46.130
astronomers now say the chances are extremely low.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.175
Okay, what about the sun?

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.635
Hollywood movies like to pick on our sun

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:53.469
by showing Earth destroyed by solar flares

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:54.883
or the sun dying out,

00:01:54.883 --> 00:01:56.844
which would cause Earth to freeze.

00:01:56.844 --> 00:01:59.349
Astronomers predict our sun contains enough gas

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:02.895
to make energy for another 3 to 5 billion years.

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:05.064
So, in 3 to 5 billion years,

00:02:05.064 --> 00:02:06.565
if people still exist on Earth,

00:02:06.565 --> 00:02:08.401
they'll have to deal with that.

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:10.361
But today, well, we're safe.

00:02:10.361 --> 00:02:12.779
Sometimes the sun does shoot flares at Earth,

00:02:12.779 --> 00:02:15.198
but the magnetic fields surrounding our planet

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:17.245
blocks most of that radiation.

00:02:17.245 --> 00:02:18.988
The radiation that does get through

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:21.538
creates things like the Aurora Borealis.

00:02:21.538 --> 00:02:24.093
Gigantic solar flares can mess with our satellites

00:02:24.093 --> 00:02:25.553
and electrical equipment,

00:02:25.553 --> 00:02:28.842
but the chances of it killing you are pretty slim.

00:02:28.842 --> 00:02:31.763
Okay, what about that supermassive black hole

00:02:31.763 --> 00:02:33.637
in the middle of our galaxy?

00:02:33.637 --> 00:02:34.713
What happens to Earth,

00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:35.544
and us,

00:02:35.544 --> 00:02:36.963
when it pulls us in?

00:02:36.963 --> 00:02:39.934
After all, it is supermassive.

00:02:39.934 --> 00:02:41.445
Nope, not going to happen.

00:02:41.445 --> 00:02:44.236
That's one big object that can't bother us.

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:45.986
How can we be so sure?

00:02:45.986 --> 00:02:48.697
Our solar system is on the edge of the Milky Way

00:02:48.697 --> 00:02:51.103
while the nearest supermassive black hole

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:54.325
is about 26,000 light years from Earth.

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:57.398
That means we aren't on that black hole's menu.

00:02:57.398 --> 00:03:00.255
So, you still think space objects are trying to kill you

00:03:00.255 --> 00:03:02.612
even after what I've told you so far?

00:03:02.612 --> 00:03:04.290
I think I've even convinced myself

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.827
that odds are really good

00:03:05.827 --> 00:03:07.550
that space and the objects up there

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.674
won't kill me after all.

00:03:09.674 --> 00:03:11.936
But I'll probably keep looking up

00:03:11.936 --> 00:03:14.665
just to make sure nothing is headed my way.
