00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.880
SPEAKER: I'd like to welcome
Marc Theermann to the stage

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.290
to talk about the next level
of in-game advertising.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.040
This is important for
all of you if you're

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.735
looking to make money.

00:00:13.735 --> 00:00:15.040
And I think it probably is.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.956
So let's welcome Marc.

00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:17.697
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:17.697 --> 00:00:19.030
MARC THEERMANN: My name is Marc.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.320
I'm part of the Publisher
Business Solutions team

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.410
here at Google.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.280
Publisher Business Solutions is
the organization within Google

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.580
that's responsible to help
our publishers make money

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.680
from advertisements.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.490
You already heard from John
about AdMob, our publisher

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.160
business platform for
application developers.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.200
I want to talk a little bit
more general about application

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.450
advertising, the
ecosystem at large,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.250
and what advertising
means at Google.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.370
The great news is that
advertising dollars

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.900
are flowing into the ecosystem
at a rate never seen before.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.640
Just over the last 18
months, the ecosystem

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.960
has grown tremendously,
and in-game advertising

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.950
is now a multibillion
dollar industry.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.140
So that's good news.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.210
And there's a couple
of different ways

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.170
of how you could get your
hands on these dollars.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.150
This slide shows where
this demand is currently

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.510
coming from, and you'll notice
that the biggest chunk still

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.830
comes from media and
entertainment advertisers.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.240
And that's not a surprise.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.890
A lot of that is other
games advertising in games,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.530
and you guys have seen this.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.280
But what I find really
exciting about this

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.660
is that retail advertising is
the fastest growing segment

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.310
for us.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.385
This is a whole
new advertiser that

00:01:38.385 --> 00:01:40.530
is coming to the table
with new dollars.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.950
So this is mobile
commerce retailers

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.980
that are bringing advertising
and trying to bring users back

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.930
to the e-commerce experiences.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.590
So this is something that
we're going to monitor closely,

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.670
and I think you'll notice a
positive ECPM increase because

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.590
of these advertisers coming in.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.440
There's a couple
of different ways

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.040
of how you could reach
these advertisers.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.520
Let's look at those three.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.920
The first one is you could
entrust your impressions

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.360
into an ad network.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.490
That ad network would
go out to advertisers

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.650
and represent your
inventory for you.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.280
Secondly, you can
talk to advertisers

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.670
directly by hiring a
direct sales force.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.040
Or, the newest way, you
could expose your impressions

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.450
into an RTB exchange and
let multiple advertisers

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.480
bid on your impressions.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.250
So let's take a look at each of
those three in more specifics.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.680
Ad networks are often the
first line of defense,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.954
and are the oldest
part of the ecosystem,

00:02:41.954 --> 00:02:44.120
and have been around pretty
much since the beginning

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.510
of the internet.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.970
Google actually runs one of the
larger ad networks on the web,

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.980
it's called the Google
Display Network or GDN.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.750
And it can be accessed through
all of our publisher solutions

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.950
platforms.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.027
So the great way-- Network
make great partners

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:01.610
because they usually
don't cost money,

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.330
and they work on
a by-share basis.

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.980
So other than the
integration cost

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.059
that you have of
integrating a new network,

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:10.600
you don't have to
hire a sales force,

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.170
so most of the money that
you get from an ad network

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.340
is pure profit.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.927
And that's what makes
them so popular.

00:03:17.927 --> 00:03:19.510
Interestingly enough,
despite the fact

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.310
that they have been around
the longest in the ecosystem,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.910
I see a lot of innovation
on that part of the house.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.070
So there's probably half
a dozen of really exciting

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.495
start-up companies
out there right

00:03:28.495 --> 00:03:30.770
now that are innovating
on the demand side.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.640
So that's great news.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.540
Because networks
take a revenue share,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.500
certain publishers decide to
hire their own sales force

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.350
and approach
advertisers directly.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.490
Direct advertising sort
of refers to any ad

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.090
that you solicited
directly, or you

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.030
talk to an advertiser
directly, hence the name.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.972
So let's assume
that you have gotten

00:03:53.972 --> 00:03:55.180
great success with your game.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.400
You are now a company of,
let's say, 30 people or so.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.450
And because of your
game's success,

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.950
a couple of advertisers
have started

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.870
to reach out to you directly.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.030
And maybe you've even taken
in some sponsorship dollars

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.080
and hard-coded a sponsorship
ad into one of your games.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.810
If that is where
you are today, it

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.920
might be time to hire
your first salesperson.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.120
Why would you go to the expense
of hiring that salesperson?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.470
Well, there is no
hard and fast rules,

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.750
but direct
advertisements probably

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.730
monetize at a rate of 10%
to 30% higher than those ads

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.660
that you would get
from a third party.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.460
So you hire your
first salesperson,

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.050
let's call him Mike.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.700
And Mike goes out there, and
after a few short months,

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.990
he brings back his first
advertisement from, let's say,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.075
Procter &amp; Gamble, one of the
largest advertisers in mobile.

00:04:46.075 --> 00:04:48.200
Procter &amp; Gamble would like
to reach your audience,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.640
but they don't want
to reach everybody.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.840
They want to pay premium to
reach only your female audience

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.990
in San Francisco, every
Thursday, from 3:00 to 7:00,

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.000
for a period of seven
months, and at the time,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.610
no other ads are allowed
to be in your game.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.720
So if that sounds
daunting, then you

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.140
know where an ad
server comes in.

00:05:11.994 --> 00:05:15.130
Pub-side ad servers help you
execute advertisements, traffic

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:18.130
your campaigns, and
allocate impression

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.616
into all the different ad
sources that are out there.

00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:22.490
If you have multiple
advertisements running--

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.440
and some of our publishers
have hundreds or thousands

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.760
ads that want to be
delivered at any given time--

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.050
the ad server takes on
one more particular role

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.840
which is called pacing,
meaning it allocates

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.380
specific impression
to the ads that

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.230
need to be delivered
at any given time.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.820
Finally, for games
in particular,

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.390
ad servers could serve
one other important role,

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.970
and that's that of house ads.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.190
House ads are any
notifications that you

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.060
want to send to your audience.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.540
It might be to advertise
a new game that you have.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.020
It might be to advertise a
new level, a new feature.

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.645
It might even be to serve
in-application goods.

00:06:01.645 --> 00:06:03.020
The Google ad
server, by the way,

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.270
is called DoubleClick for
Publishers, or DFP for short.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.682
In its newest iteration, it
was built with mobile in mind.

00:06:09.682 --> 00:06:11.640
And many of the largest
publishers in the world

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.280
rely on it because
of its scalability

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.914
and because of its reliability.

00:06:18.914 --> 00:06:20.830
So at this point it might
be important to note

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.750
that for most of our publishers
this is not a replacement.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.905
So the world's largest
publishers usually do both.

00:06:26.905 --> 00:06:28.700
They have a direct
ad sales force,

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.880
and they also talk to networks.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.000
So let's look at the latest
way to monetize impressions,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.750
something that has
really only been around

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.080
for a few short years, and
it's called real-time bidding.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.070
When mobile traffic
started to explode,

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.330
publishers noticed
that a single ad

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.970
network and their
direct sales force

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.200
was not enough to fill
all their impressions.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.980
So what they often did was
to talk to multiple networks

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.350
in a sequence of events
often called a daisy chain.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.880
Some publishers attempted to
run these daisy chains in-house.

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:03.460
Most publishers would
deploy technology middleware

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.910
called yield management.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.890
Yield management has some
significant advantages,

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:11.640
but it also has a
couple of disadvantages.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.410
On the one hand,
calling networks

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.550
in a sequence of
events costs time.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.300
And time means
discrepancy, and that

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.280
means potential loss of revenue.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.670
But secondly, and
probably more importantly,

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.230
calling ad networks in
a sequence of events

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.860
means that you might not be
choosing the most ideal ad.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.470
Think of it like this.

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.310
You go to a speed dating event,
and the speed dating event

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:39.260
has a couple of special rules.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.680
Rule Number 1, you need
to pick the first girl

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.180
that you're attracted to.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.152
Rule Number 2, you have
to pick a contestant

00:07:47.152 --> 00:07:48.110
at the end of the game.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.580
And Rule Number 3 is
you're not allowed

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:54.310
to see any of the girls that
come after you made a pick.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.900
So you go to the event.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.210
You don't like Girl Number 2.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.260
Girl Number 1, Girl Number
2, but Girl Number 3

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:04.270
is very smart and
cute, so you pick her.

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.242
Unfortunately, Megan Fox
was in Seat Number 4,

00:08:08.242 --> 00:08:10.200
and you didn't get to
meet her, and by the way,

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.970
she really likes gamers.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:13.180
So that's yield management.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.850
It means you make a
decent pick, but you

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:17.320
don't make the perfect pick.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:19.580
And that's where RTB comes in.

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.920
RTB sort of replaces
a sequence of events

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.810
with a simultaneous call.

00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:27.620
A few years ago,
technology providers

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.380
started to experiment with
RTB by building exchanges

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.820
that pretty much work like
the New York Stock Exchange.

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:36.400
You expose your impressions
into an auction.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.179
Multiple parties
raise their hand

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:41.299
with a specific price
and advertiser in mind.

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:43.940
And the highest bidder
wins the auction.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.750
So the sequence of
calls is replaced

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.750
with a simultaneous
call, which is

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.150
much more efficient
and scalable.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.160
So brace for impact,
here comes the sales part

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.530
of my presentation.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.620
Google has a
technology suite that

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.736
allows you to access all
these demand sources.

00:09:06.736 --> 00:09:08.110
With our publisher
platforms, you

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:12.220
can access our own ad networks
as well as other networks.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.940
You can run a
direct sales force.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.880
And, of course, you
can expose impressions

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:22.180
into our RTB platform, which
has about 400 bidders connected,

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:24.475
bidding on behalf of
millions of advertisers.

00:09:28.864 --> 00:09:30.280
If you were to do
that, let's talk

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.200
about integrations for a second.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.440
All of our solutions are now
available in a single SDK,

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.470
which includes AdMob,
it includes DFP,

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:43.340
it includes the DoubleClick
Ad Exchange and now Analytics.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.690
This SDK is also baked into
the core Android services,

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:49.820
into the core Android
Play services.

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.840
So for your Android
traffic, you don't

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.250
need to update the SDK
anymore and relaunch

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.460
your app into the app store.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:10:00.280
It now happens for most of
the updates automatically.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:04.050
We strive very hard to
make updates to our SDKs

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:05.800
and continuously improve it.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.710
The latest SDK, which
includes these auto-update

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.240
functionalities, was
launched in January.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.480
So if any of you are
using an SDK from us that

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.160
is older than that, I'd highly
recommend that you update.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.430
You'll likely make more
money, and it should likely

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.425
be much easier to
manage in the future.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:27.180
So we've done the
hard work for you.

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.940
We've given you the technology
and pipelines to connect you

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.245
into all these demand sources.

00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:33.870
But there's a couple
of things that you

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:37.230
can do to optimize the
monetization of your game.

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:39.520
So let's look at those.

00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.980
The first one is
building audiences.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.690
Yes, mobile advertising
is still in its infancy.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.500
But if desktop advertising
is any indication,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.980
the future winners will be
those publishers and games that

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.520
foster a deep relationship
with their audiences,

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.430
and especially those that
foster a deep relationship

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.480
with their audience
across different screens.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.940
More screens are coming.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.290
But even if your game is just
available on a single screen

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:08.280
today, most likely you will
be on different devices

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.620
in the future.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.120
So think about that
future and think

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.720
about how you can build a
long-lasting relationship

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.680
with your audience
across multiple screens.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.530
One way to do that might
be a registration flow.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.300
A registration flow is one
of the more privacy-safe ways

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.830
to build a long
term relationship

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.450
and engage your audience.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:30.040
So I would highly recommend
that you think about doing that.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.460
Clearly, you can build your own.

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:35.080
You could also use Gmail as a
universal login through Google+

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.174
integration.

00:11:36.174 --> 00:11:37.840
The benefit there is
that lots of people

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.660
have Gmail accounts
already so it

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:41.480
makes signup a
little bit easier.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.290
And we actually share audience
information back with you

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.775
so that you can use that
to target your audiences.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.310
The next big driver is formats.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:57.800
Choosing the right format
and the right placement

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.180
in your game is
absolutely critical.

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.060
You want to provide
advertisers a chance

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.440
to engage with your audience but
without bothering your users.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.400
So while there's many
options to choose from,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.130
I would recommend that you pick
one of the standard IAB units

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.140
because much of
the world's demand

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.109
is flowing into those formats.

00:12:16.109 --> 00:12:17.650
Over the last couple
of months, we've

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.350
seen tremendous success
with interstitials units.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.600
Interstitials are ads that
fill out the entire page,

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:26.440
but give users the
option to skip or opt out

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.230
of the interstitial.

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.020
When we analyze our data, we see
that advertisers and consumers

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.252
alike continue to be very
excited about interstitials.

00:12:36.252 --> 00:12:37.960
So I would recommend
that you take a look

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.418
and see if interstitials are
the right thing for your game.

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:45.950
So that almost concludes what I
wanted to share with you today,

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.250
but I also wanted to
give you a quick look

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.070
into the future of
some of the things

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:56.336
that we are doing with
regards to new formats.

00:12:56.336 --> 00:12:57.710
Our product and
engineering teams

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.864
are working pretty hard to
bring new formats to you.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:02.280
This year alone,
we're going to be

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.940
launching a variety
of new formats.

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.550
Now here are three that
I particularly like.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.920
Clearly, location-based
advertising

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.040
is a very big
promise for a device

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.860
that's always in your pocket.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:18.490
So we are working
hard to figure out

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:22.250
how we could provide a
privacy-friendly environment

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:24.360
in which advertisers can
strive and really push

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.150
the ecosystem
forward with regards

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.860
to location-based advertising.

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:32.380
Location-based advertising
requires consumer opt-in,

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.320
so I would urge you to talk
with your product teams

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.770
and see if there
is features that

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.210
could be built into your
game that would be better

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:42.610
through location, so
that you can collect it.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:46.500
Secondly, video seems
to be the next frontier

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:47.950
for mobile advertising.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.340
We launched video formats
at the end of last year,

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.030
in a skippable
format that you've

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.980
known from YouTube which
is called TrueView.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.980
It gives the
consumer the ability

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.100
to skip the video
if they don't find

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.430
the advertisement
relevant for them.

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:08.180
So a lot more video innovation
coming from us this year, so

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.852
keep your eye out there.

00:14:09.852 --> 00:14:11.310
And then last but
not least, you've

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:15.200
probably noticed that we've
started to include apps

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.690
in the search experience
on Google Search.

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:24.280
So that's a very big
driver for us this year,

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.950
helping you guys so that
games can be easier discovered

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:32.450
through our search experiences.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:37.230
So that almost concludes
my presentation for today.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:38.980
I want to leave you
with a final thought.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.950
I think it's important to note
that not all of our publishers

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.070
make equal amounts of money.

00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:46.790
The spread is
actually fairly large,

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.980
which means that
we can provide you

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.880
with the technology
and the pipelines

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.200
into all the possible
demand sources.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.330
But it really takes dedication,
and it takes a lot of tenacity,

00:14:57.330 --> 00:15:00.170
and it takes attention
to detail to really make

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.830
the most out of your
monetization suite.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:05.510
So we've created lots
of developer pages

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:08.182
online that might help you to
make some of those decisions.

00:15:08.182 --> 00:15:09.890
But, of course, you
should never hesitate

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.670
to reach out to us directly,
and reach out to the Publisher

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:15.740
Business Solutions
organization within Google,

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.350
because we would love
to hear from you.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.240
So thank you so much,
and I'll be around

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.340
if anybody has questions.

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.890
And I hope you have a great day.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.870
[APPLAUSE]
