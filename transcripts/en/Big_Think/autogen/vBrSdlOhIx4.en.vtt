let me try it out one of my recent

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:02.330
let me try it out one of my recent
 

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.789
let me try it out one of my recent
favorites which I devised to jangle the

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799
favorites which I devised to jangle the
 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.589
favorites which I devised to jangle the
nerves of neuroscientists who've been

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599
nerves of neuroscientists who've been
 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.959
nerves of neuroscientists who've been
going around saying that neuroscience

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
going around saying that neuroscience
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.289
going around saying that neuroscience
shows that we don't have free will I

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299
shows that we don't have free will I
 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.140
shows that we don't have free will I
think their reasons for saying that are

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150
think their reasons for saying that are
 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.359
think their reasons for saying that are
ill-considered and moreover that what

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369
ill-considered and moreover that what
 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.220
ill-considered and moreover that what
they're doing is apt to be mischievous

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
they're doing is apt to be mischievous
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.019
they're doing is apt to be mischievous
and doing some real harm

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
and doing some real harm
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.420
and doing some real harm
so I concocted a little thought

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
so I concocted a little thought
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.450
so I concocted a little thought
experiment a little intuition pump to

experiment a little intuition pump to
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.479
experiment a little intuition pump to
suggest that so this is the the case of

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
suggest that so this is the the case of
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.740
suggest that so this is the the case of

obsessive compulsive disorder now there

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
obsessive compulsive disorder now there
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.330
obsessive compulsive disorder now there
is such a chip it's been developed in in

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340
is such a chip it's been developed in in
 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.279
is such a chip it's been developed in in
the Netherlands and it works really

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
the Netherlands and it works really
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.830
the Netherlands and it works really
quite well that's science fact but now

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840
quite well that's science fact but now
 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.410
quite well that's science fact but now
here comes science fiction so the

he's just young I did yeah but I was
 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.720
he's just young I did yeah but I was
just messing with his head that was just

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730
just messing with his head that was just
 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.330
just messing with his head that was just
a joke I didn't think he'd believe me

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340
a joke I didn't think he'd believe me
 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.800

now right there I think we can stop take

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810
now right there I think we can stop take
 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.530
now right there I think we can stop take

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900
accomplished surgically she disabled him
 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.330
accomplished surgically she disabled him
by telling him he didn't have free will

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340
by telling him he didn't have free will
 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.530
by telling him he didn't have free will
she pretty much turned his freewill off

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540
she pretty much turned his freewill off
 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.170
she pretty much turned his freewill off
and turned him into a morally

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180
and turned him into a morally
 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.100
and turned him into a morally
incompetent person now if we agree that

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110
incompetent person now if we agree that
 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.590
incompetent person now if we agree that
she did a bad thing if nobody recommends

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600
she did a bad thing if nobody recommends

she did a bad thing if nobody recommends
people play jokes like this what are we

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450
people play jokes like this what are we
 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.509
people play jokes like this what are we
to say about the neuroscientists who are

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519
to say about the neuroscientists who are
 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.820
to say about the neuroscientists who are
telling the public every day we've shown

telling the public every day we've shown
 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.310
telling the public every day we've shown
in our neuroscience labs that nobody has

in our neuroscience labs that nobody has

in our neuroscience labs that nobody has
free will I think if the neuroscientists

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760
free will I think if the neuroscientists
 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.900
free will I think if the neuroscientists
recognize that what my imaginary

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910
recognize that what my imaginary
 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.160
recognize that what my imaginary
neurosurgeon did was irresponsible they

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170
neurosurgeon did was irresponsible they
 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.660
neurosurgeon did was irresponsible they
should think saris seriously about

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670
should think saris seriously about
 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.170
should think saris seriously about
whether it's irresponsible of them to

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
whether it's irresponsible of them to
 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.470
whether it's irresponsible of them to
make these claims about free will and

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480
make these claims about free will and
 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.380
make these claims about free will and
it's not just a fantasy Vossen schooler

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390
it's not just a fantasy Vossen schooler

both from Francis Crick's book the

both from Francis Crick's book the
astonishing hypothesis and one was not

astonishing hypothesis and one was not
 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.590
astonishing hypothesis and one was not
about free will

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600
about free will
 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.539
about free will
I'm the other was about free will and

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549
I'm the other was about free will and
 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.759
I'm the other was about free will and
basically it said free will is an

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769
basically it said free will is an
 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.530
basically it said free will is an
illusion all your decisions are actually

some money by solving it and the
experimenters cleverly made the puzzle

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210
experimenters cleverly made the puzzle
 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.120
experimenters cleverly made the puzzle
slightly defective so there was a way of

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130
slightly defective so there was a way of
 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.360
slightly defective so there was a way of
cheating on the puzzle that was oops

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370
cheating on the puzzle that was oops
 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.960

reading that passage did have the effect

they became as it were negligent or
 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.480
they became as it were negligent or
worse in their own decision-making I

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490
worse in their own decision-making I
 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.730
worse in their own decision-making I
think that's an important and sobering
