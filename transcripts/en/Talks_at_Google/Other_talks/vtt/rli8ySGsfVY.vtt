PETER READ: Hi.

00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:00.951
RUBY WAX: Hi.

00:00:00.951 --> 00:00:03.594
PETER READ: Could we just get
a sense of who's in the room?

00:00:03.594 --> 00:00:04.260
RUBY WAX: Names.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:04.760
No.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.420
PETER READ: Yeah,
specific names.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.440
Like product versus engineering,
and product versus commercial,

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.650
how many product-y
engineering-y types?

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.840
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.120
We're in CSG, aren't we?

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.300
OK, and then commercial?

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.710
Yeah, almost everybody.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.430
Got it.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.020
And then in terms of
familiarity, how many have

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.820
done Search Inside Yourself?

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.020
Oh, actually quite a few.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.660
Brilliant.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.279
And Headspace or gPause
or any [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.820
What is that?

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.740
About half?

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.100
Something like that?

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.886
All right.

00:00:41.886 --> 00:00:45.610
As Sasha said, we're keen,
very happy to make this

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.760
as interactive as you guys like.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.540
What we thought we might do is I
can talk a little bit about why

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.880
resilience is important.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.320
I'll do the nerdy bit, why
resilience is important.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.410
She'll then do the really
funny bit, all the magic

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.080
about how you actually
build resilience and avoid

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.820
becoming frazzled.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.850
And then what we'd
actually love to do

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.680
is bring it together in Q&amp;A
afterwards to the extent

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.150
that you guys are
interested, is how can we

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.000
work with Google harnessing
your tech, either hardware

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.190
or software, to solve
mental well-being in a way--

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.510
and not just for Googlers, but
for everyone-- and in a way

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.030
to do-- can we do for
mental well-being what

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.850
Deep Mind with their
NHS partnership is doing

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.910
for physical well-being?

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.060
We think that would be a fun
thing to explore with you guys

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.660
if you're up for it.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.600
That makes sense?

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.290
About right?

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:56.430
So if I start with why
resilience is important-- so

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.050
what I do as an angel
investor and now

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.550
as an investor with Vitruvian,
a big growth equity investment

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.570
fund, is we help entrepreneurs.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.360
We embolden entrepreneurs to
understand the risks that they

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.680
are taking and then to help them
build the resilience in order

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.390
to deal with taking those risks.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.720
And just sort of
winding it back,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.820
I think it's always
helpful at these things

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.060
to frame this and
really understand

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.550
what we're talking about.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.660
So whether you're at
Google as an innovator

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.570
or a disrupter
within a big company,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.700
or you're an entrepreneur
like a CityMapper founder,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.250
your job is to take risks.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.460
And I always think
it's really helpful

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.540
to unpick that a little
bit and understand

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.920
what risks you're taking
and then why resilience

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.170
is important.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.000
So in terms of the risks
that people in this room

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.800
are probably taking, we often
start with product risk.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.650
And, actually, Google, I
think, as a company generally,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.486
most people at Google take
quite a bit of product risk.

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:08.860
In other words,
you're inventing.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.570
You're bringing new
products to the world.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.486
And the way you measure
that is product market

00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:14.590
fit and traction.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.620
It's not always the way.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.080
There are other groups, other
entrepreneurs who prefer

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.440
not to take product risks.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.070
So they all take a
fairly familiar product.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.432
But they will take market risks.

00:03:25.432 --> 00:03:26.890
So they'll take a
familiar product,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.600
but then they will build
it in an unfamiliar market.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.940
So just as legitimate
as a strategy,

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.040
but a very, very different
sort of set of risks.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.123
Whether you're taking
product risk or market risk,

00:03:38.123 --> 00:03:41.480
you definitely also
take execution risk.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.150
So getting stuff done.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.640
And in my world, in
the investment world,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.830
we never back ideas.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:48.850
We back teams.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.300
We back people who
get stuff done.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.560
Which is sort of a common
misconception fueled

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.880
by Dragon's Den and others.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.545
So that's what we do.

00:03:57.545 --> 00:03:58.920
And I think it's
really important

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.680
to sort of start
there and ground it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.026
in this is all about people
who take risks-- as I said,

00:04:04.026 --> 00:04:06.150
whether those people are
entrepreneurs in a startup

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.930
or whether they're
innovators disrupters

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.010
within a big
company like Google.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.990
And then just pause
there for a second

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:15.830
and reflect on that
because I think

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.130
most of us in the
real world spend

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.890
most of our time trying
to eliminate risk

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.320
or at least mitigate
it and box it in.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.690
And yet we're now talking
about disrupters and innovators

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.060
within a big company or startup
entrepreneurs who deliberately

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.520
invite more risk into
their lives, which

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.380
is a fairly bonkers thing
to do if you think about it.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.340
And in my experience,
it very rarely

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.510
ends up being contained at
just professional risk, risk

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.280
that I take during work.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.460
It very often-- especially for
the startup entrepreneurs--

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.300
ends up being risk
that in a porous way

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.010
filters into their real life,
so risk to their health,

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.750
risk to their relationships,
risk to their house,

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.730
their mortgage.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.230
So, , again, we start from
a fairly curious place.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.720
These are people who
deliberately invite risk

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.940
into their lives.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.890
So here's the bit
about resilience.

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.270
And I'm often asked,
what is it that I

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.820
look for when I make an
angel investment or any kind

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.550
of investment.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.200
And it is always-- if I had to
pick one characteristic that I

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.710
always look for in
the entrepreneurs

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.440
that I back, it
would be resilience.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.250
And so what do I mean by that?

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.490
There are two ways of thinking
about resilience in my book.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.590
One is around protecting the
downside of entrepreneurship

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.820
or innovation.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.510
And another is
unlocking the upside.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.100
So starting with
protecting the downside,

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.330
I think resilience
for me is the ability

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.920
to manage stress and anxiety.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.201
You will be told,
as an innovator

00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:04.700
in a big company
or an entrepreneur,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.350
you'll be told no 1,000 times.

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:07.336
That's a stupid idea.

00:06:07.336 --> 00:06:08.210
Get out of my office.

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.540
That can't be done.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:11.690
So how do you pick
yourself up from that?

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.530
It tends to be a fairly
anxiety-inducing environment.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.640
So how do you manage your
own stress and anxiety

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.530
within a situation like that?

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.200
The second aspect
of it is the ability

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.900
to make decisions in
highly ambiguous, highly

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.120
uncertain, highly
volatile situations.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.520
That's what all of you
do when you're being

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.280
innovative in a big company.

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.930
It's what entrepreneurs
do when they're

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:40.600
being innovative in
a startup context.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.890
So that's the protecting
the downside bit.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.390
Those are the characteristics
of resilience that we look for.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:49.200
And then in terms of
unlocking the upside,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.460
let me ask a question.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.820
Who can tell me the
opposite of fragile?

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.620
What's the opposite of fragile?

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.312
Any words or phrases
spring to mind?

00:07:00.312 --> 00:07:01.020
AUDIENCE: Robust.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:01.390
PETER READ: Sorry?

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.098
AUDIENCE: Robust.

00:07:02.098 --> 00:07:02.970
PETER READ: Robust.

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:04.215
It's a great one.

00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.673
Sorry, there was
another one there?

00:07:05.673 --> 00:07:06.420
AUDIENCE: Strong.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.211
PETER READ: Strong.

00:07:07.211 --> 00:07:07.942
Yeah.

00:07:07.942 --> 00:07:08.900
And those are all good.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.510
And that's exactly where
I started when asked

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.000
exactly the same question.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.550
And so in a way, though,
robust and strong--

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:21.920
if fragile is falls over when
risk or volatility, uncertainty

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.130
comes along, strong
and robust just means

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:29.730
can withstand uncertainty,
volatility, risk.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.050
And Nassim Taleb, who wrote
"The Black Swan," which I think

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:34.960
is an amazing book,
wrote another book

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.950
called "Antrifragile"
because he said

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.110
there isn't a word for
the opposite of fragile.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:44.640
In the sense that what is it--
and he describes innovators

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.710
and entrepreneurs in
this way-- what is it

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.140
that not just can
withstand risk, volatility,

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:55.010
and uncertainty, but positively
blossoms and flourishes

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:56.350
with more risk?

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.760
And again, that's a
pretty unusual concept.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.187
And he said entrepreneurs,
innovators are such people.

00:08:03.187 --> 00:08:05.520
And the way he describes it,
I think it's really, really

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:09.250
powerful-- very, very
interesting-- is innovators,

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.490
entrepreneurs are--
they open themselves

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.460
up to risk and
uncertainty because risk

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:19.390
is information rich.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.130
It's rich in information
about your competitors,

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.220
about your customers,
about your investors.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.180
So if you open yourself
up to it, yes, it's scary.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.067
But actually, it means
that you're nimble.

00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:32.900
You're on your feet.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.510
You're getting all
the information

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.929
about the marketplace.

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:39.090
So risk is information
rich, I think,

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:40.970
is an incredibly
powerful insight.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:45.576
And for me, it helps explain why
entrepreneurs do what they do,

00:08:45.576 --> 00:08:46.700
innovators do what they do.

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.550
They open themselves up to risk.

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:53.780
So that's how I often
think about resilience.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:58.050
That's what I look for in the
entrepreneurs that I back.

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:02.135
So it's relatively easy to
describe what resilience is.

00:09:02.135 --> 00:09:03.510
There's a neuroscience
definition

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:05.860
of it, actually,
around neuroplasticity.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.610
She knows.

00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:09.990
She'll tell you what that means.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.560
And so I hope that
helps frame it in terms

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.380
of why resilience is important.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.070
And now Ruby is going
to talk about how

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:25.260
to actually build resilience.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:27.010
RUBY WAX: Well, I think
one in a million--

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.740
or maybe those aren't the
statistics-- would get pleasure

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.140
out of not being sure because
the human condition is

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.220
that's terrifying unless
you have Asperger's and you

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:41.054
don't have to
concentrate on emotions.

00:09:41.054 --> 00:09:42.720
I'm not saying those
are the lucky ones,

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.250
but those seem to be the ones
that evolution has thrown up

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:50.240
to succeed in the 21st century.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.270
So sorry, anybody
who has Asperger's,

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.055
but you probably
don't know you do.

00:09:56.905 --> 00:09:58.030
Is this starting off badly?

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:58.695
PETER READ: This is perfect.

00:09:58.695 --> 00:09:59.195
Great.

00:09:59.195 --> 00:10:00.271
Yeah, it's great.

00:10:00.271 --> 00:10:01.020
Yeah.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:04.470
RUBY WAX: So if
risk was natural,

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:07.140
then we would be able
to be in that state.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.380
But as humans, we have
a lot of glitches.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.790
I know we think we're Homo
perfectest, but we aren't.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:17.570
So if I explain a
little bit about to me

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.460
what-- not the
enemy is, but where

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.890
we are so far in my
stand in your way

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.730
for being brave
enough, I suppose,

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.120
to believe in your own ideas
and follow them through.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.170
So the reason I called
the book "Frazzled"

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:32.360
is because we all need stress.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:33.960
Let's get that out of the way.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.570
Otherwise we'd still be
sitting on our porch in Alabama

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.900
playing the banjo.

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:41.180
But the stress is-- that's fine.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.770
And I'll explain why.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:44.660
Otherwise you wouldn't
have the oomph.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:47.910
But the frazzled
bit is when we start

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.140
to think about
stress, when we start

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:53.490
get into these loop
tapes of, oh, my god,

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.490
I shouldn't be stressed.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:56.030
We get caught in those stories.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.790
And there never is an
answer, by the way,

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.070
like why aren't I thinner?

00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:00.350
No answer.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.320
Even Einstein
couldn't answer that.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.280
But getting caught
in those loop tapes

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.570
is what keeps you up
all night and what

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.710
gives you that red mist
so all creativity shuts

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.670
down immediately.

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.020
Want me to explain a little
bit about the history of why

00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.417
we're kind of fucked now?

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:19.250
Would you like that?

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.240
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.230
RUBY WAX: OK, you might know
this, but stress, we need it.

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.340
Otherwise we wouldn't
be sitting here.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.710
First of all, hundreds
of thousands of years

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:32.020
ago, we were stressed, but we
weren't frazzled because we

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.020
didn't have language.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:33.520
Right?

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.110
So you couldn't give
yourself those bad reviews,

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:39.590
like, you know that cave
painting you did yesterday?

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.500
Well, it sucked.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.090
So we couldn't do it.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:46.450
But back then when we
were in the bush-- hunters

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.475
and gatherers, and my
people, the pointers,

00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:54.960
the Jews-- we just pointed
and we became early shoppers--

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.379
but we were perfectly fine,
adjusted to the environment.

00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:00.920
But then when a
predator came along--

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:06.390
please tell me if you know
this-- we weren't in charge.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:09.680
But to save ourselves
from extinction,

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.800
this part in our brain
called the amygdala would

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.560
sound an alarm and
it would shoot out

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.670
this cortisol and adrenaline.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.194
And that's our fight
and flight, by the way.

00:12:18.194 --> 00:12:19.610
We always use these
words, but you

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.360
don't think that
there's actually

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.860
a correspondence in your brain.

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.482
When you learn
piano, it's not just

00:12:25.482 --> 00:12:26.690
because your fingers learned.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.740
Something develops in your
brain to give you that skill.

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.050
So fight and flight is
the gushing of cortisol.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.630
Then if we survived, it would
immediately go down again.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.291
And we'd go back to hunting
and back to the day job.

00:12:40.291 --> 00:12:42.040
Just like when you see
an [INAUDIBLE] film

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.760
and the gazelle gets
away from a lion,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.990
it doesn't suddenly have
to go to crisis workshops

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.320
or take anti-depressants.

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.940
It just goes back to grazing.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.510
I have a whole thing
that these days we're

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:57.870
always stressed because,
A, we're being bombarded

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.900
by bad news day and night.

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.640
The amygdala can't
if there's something

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:04.852
dangerous behind it or something
is happening 20,000 miles away.

00:13:04.852 --> 00:13:06.060
It can't tell the difference.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.880
I'm not saying we
don't need the news,

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.610
but suddenly I'm
wired because there's

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.870
an earthquake in
dung-fung-fung--

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:14.600
like I should know.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.580
Or a whale has been
beached in Malawi.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:17.240
What can I do?

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.819
Get an airplane ticket
and a tow truck?

00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:22.360
And then when you get there, I
don't know what to do with it.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:22.985
You push it in.

00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:24.230
You push it out.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:25.030
You roll it over.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.670
You milk it.

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.070
I don't know.

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:30.530
But the enemy is this
feeling of being overwhelmed,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.010
never shuts down.

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:32.940
I'm not good enough.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.110
I'm not fast enough.

00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:36.876
I'm not rich enough,
enough, enough.

00:13:36.876 --> 00:13:38.750
And by the way, I don't
mean to go off piece,

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.630
but these things
are all invisible.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.632
There is something
visible now and none of us

00:13:43.632 --> 00:13:45.340
are using our fight
and flight-- the fact

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.160
that Donald Trump might be
the leader of the free world.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.740
And what are we doing about it?

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:52.710
This is a guy who used
to have one nose hair

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.190
and wind it around his head.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:57.320
Now he's got an albino
ferret on his head,

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.720
and we're just sitting around.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.650
The president may end up
with roadkill on his head.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:06.020
I'm going off the subject.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:09.130
And people say, is it technology
that's driving us nuts?

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.320
You know I'm sick of this
because we put it there.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.550
It didn't drop from Mars.

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:15.504
And I thank god every
day that at 2 o'clock

00:14:15.504 --> 00:14:17.170
in the morning at the
click of a finger,

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:22.240
I can get a husband
or a chocolate bidet.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:22.910
And I dream.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:24.560
My dream is that
some day a drone

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.380
will be able to come
in and shave my legs.

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:32.140
So the problem is that
it's the speed of it.

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:34.415
And we aren't equipped to
keep up with that speed.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.010
Humans always had
that go-getter thing.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:41.220
We migrated because
we were hungry.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.150
So we got up and
went to Mongolia.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:45.620
Then they ran out of food.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.180
We got this naturally.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:50.150
Then we went to America.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.950
Suddenly there was
a buffalo buffet,

00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.620
and we just ate
till it was extinct.

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:55.230
We kept going.

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.200
The problem is now
it's virtual migration.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.730
And the thing about
humans, again,

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:03.930
is to understand we
never get satiated.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.550
And I think you
probably know this

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.210
that every day-- is this
true-- that every day we

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:14.900
create a quintillion
amounts of information--

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.199
quintillion bytes of
information-- every day.

00:15:18.199 --> 00:15:19.240
Do you know what that is?

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:22.290
It's a one with
18 zeros after it.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:24.640
So no wonder we're wired.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.230
So I'm not saying shut it off.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:28.655
But we have to learn some
way to navigate the noise.

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.015
I was interested
in that because, A,

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:35.580
I wasn't just getting wired,
but I have depression.

00:15:35.580 --> 00:15:37.155
So I wanted to
figure out, is there

00:15:37.155 --> 00:15:38.780
some way I don't have
to run to shrinks

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:40.330
and give them my bank account?

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:42.420
Is there some way I
could self-regulate?

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.750
I happened to find out because
the scientific journals-- maybe

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.450
you have your own
way-- that mindfulness

00:15:47.450 --> 00:15:50.360
and cognitive-based therapy
had the best results.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.880
Otherwise, I would have
been-- if it was tree-hugging,

00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:54.750
I would have taken that up.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.090
But you can actually see
it in a brain scanner.

00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.565
If you do a-- if you
start to practice this,

00:15:59.565 --> 00:16:00.970
the amygdala shrinks.

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:02.470
I don't believe in
anything unless I

00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:06.090
can see it or taste it because
I can't take the fluffy stuff.

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.920
So because I have an
extreme amount of dopamine.

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.920
Well, I've got that
go-getter thing, which

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.700
is good news because
you get great jobs,

00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:16.470
but the bad news is it makes
me crash and burn into a wall.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:18.070
So I hunted down
one of the founders

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.780
of mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.730
He was a professor at Oxford.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:22.720
I'm a driven woman.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.410
So I said, give me what
happens in the brain.

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:27.080
I just don't want
to believe this.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.962
And I don't have time to sit.

00:16:28.962 --> 00:16:31.545
I don't even have time to take
a shower, so sometimes I don't.

00:16:31.545 --> 00:16:33.130
Don't tell anybody.

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.284
Nobody has time.

00:16:34.284 --> 00:16:36.450
I said, so I want to know
what happens in the brain.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.500
He said, you'd have to get into
Oxford and get your master's.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.290
And so I did.

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:43.680
And I graduated three years ago.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.740
I wish my mother knew.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.460
I'd have to dig her up.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.942
Don't say anybody I said that.

00:16:48.942 --> 00:16:52.869
That was awful.

00:16:52.869 --> 00:16:55.470
I don't know what's about
to come out of my mouth

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:57.890
until I hear it.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:02.140
So that's why I
became so fascinated.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.810
At least it's a braking system.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:05.839
I'm sure there's others.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.200
There will be biofeedback.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:10.450
And we'll talk about mindfulness
like it's the dark ages.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:11.630
But it's all I know.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:14.160
So would you like to
know how it works?

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.291
Because it's all I
know at this point.

00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:17.790
All right.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:18.670
Go with me on this.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:22.210
If you don't want to go with
me, get back on your computer

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:24.660
because I know how
tempting that is.

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:26.990
Really, I know the addiction.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.570
Believe me, I'm up at 2
o'clock in the morning.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:31.880
My fingers are having an
orgy on those keyboards.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.180
It's so hard to shut it off.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.310
People write, dear Ruby.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.820
I'm already on it.

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:39.810
And then I hate them because
they don't write me back.

00:17:39.810 --> 00:17:42.070
And then I hate them
even more because then I

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:44.250
have to answer those fuckers.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:48.920
I even start scraping
around to answer spam.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.450
You know what I'm talking about.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.750
So the way mindfulness works--
I'll do the scientific version

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:55.950
because that makes
me look smart-- is,

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.740
I pointed out already, we always
have the racing mind always.

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.590
The racing mind is
the fight and flight

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.410
because we got language now.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:07.570
So where we used to be vigilant
for the enemy, now the voices,

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.410
the thoughts have
replaced, oh, my god, I'm

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:10.030
going to get caught.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.290
Oh, my god, I'm not good enough.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.840
We pretty much-- my
mother was right.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.830
That's a long-playing
album in my head.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:18.350
So you understand
that's the amygdala.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:19.900
So picture it.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.510
If you take your focus to one
of your senses-- you don't have

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:28.100
to buy them on Amazon--
taste, sound, smell,

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:31.770
touch-- immediately the
racing thoughts calm down.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.970
You can't have both.

00:18:32.970 --> 00:18:35.010
Think of it mechanically.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.550
So because there's no words
when you feel something.

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:40.620
So if you want to--
should I stand up--

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.490
if you want to give
a taste for this--

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:44.870
I know this is a little
baby, but just go with me.

00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:47.330
It's either gabbling
or it's a sense.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:48.180
Maybe I'll sit down.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.360
It's too scary.

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:49.860
All right.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:52.140
So put your hands out.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.440
And when I count to three,
clap them really hard.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:58.700
And then just hold
them up and try

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.380
to keep your mind on the sense.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.440
If you're thinking
takes over, that's cool.

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.510
Take it back to the sense,
just focusing on it.

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:11.500
So one, two, three. [CLAP]

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.240
So you'll notice, you're
trying to think is it tingly?

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.525
Just sense that it is.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:23.870
And which finger is tingling
or throbbing or it's warm?

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:32.820
So you go, thumbs, pointing
fingers, third finger,

00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.680
fourth, fifth.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.720
And then gradually-- gradually--
you'll notice it fades away.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.470
Now this isn't mindfulness.

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:49.300
It's like playing the scales
before you play Rachmaninoff.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.910
And the point of
mindfulness isn't

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:54.190
to become a better clapper.

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:58.330
It's the minute you start
focusing on any sense,

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.690
your brain cools down, the
amygdala, the [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.120
And that's the only way you
can watch your thoughts is

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.240
if you're cool, which
is to do with resilience

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:09.550
because until you can
cool your brain down--

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.940
I don't care how you do
it-- get that cortisol down.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.450
And there's probably
Fitbits that

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:15.200
will show you how to
do it, though they're

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.220
in the dark ages, too.

00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.060
But the point isn't just to
notice, oh, it's gone down,

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:22.030
but we need to
watch our thoughts.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.930
Otherwise we're sleepwalking.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:25.430
Because that's when
you're creative.

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.750
You need to be able to focus in
on what you're thinking rather

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:31.720
than just-- because if
you're not watching them,

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:34.090
you won't notice when they
snare you and they get

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.100
caught in that rumination.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.940
So it's as if you're the shrink.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.760
Now you watch when
they start to go.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.750
At least you've got a stopgap
especially if you're about--

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.780
you're trying to-- you know
you're getting a writer's-- I

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:48.030
get a writer's block.

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:49.210
Pull it to a focus.

00:20:49.210 --> 00:20:51.900
And the more you do
it, the easier it gets.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.640
And I start to get a different
relationship with my thoughts.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:58.670
I start to name them rather
than be at the mercy of them.

00:20:58.670 --> 00:21:00.510
So sometimes I go, oh,
that's track number

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:05.350
52, which is everybody
knows I'm a fraud.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:08.280
Or track number 75, which
is, they're looking at me,

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.670
but they're not
really listening.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:14.760
Now this may be true, but
at least the minute you

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.710
become the watcher, the
minute you start watching,

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.525
actually the
cortisol comes down.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:28.120
If you want another scientific
version of why that happens,

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.644
again, if you understand a
little bit about the brain,

00:21:30.644 --> 00:21:32.310
you don't have to
become a neurosurgeon,

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.910
but understand
that when you take

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:37.930
this focus from the
amygdala to the insula,

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.510
there's no muscles
in your brain,

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.200
but you're building
up more gray matter.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.200
Just go with me on this.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.160
Which means more and
more neural connections,

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.310
which is making you resilient

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.170
Let's call it the
scientific version.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.980
Let's just call it gloop.

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:52.780
That's my name.

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.990
So each time you take
the focus, that insula

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.100
is getting more and more gloop.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:01.000
So when the shit
hits the fan, you've

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.850
got that resilience, or
at least my version of it.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:05.760
So it's easier to
pull to a sense.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:07.180
You're not going to stay there.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:10.030
But let me just tell you, if
you're getting that red mist,

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:12.850
and you can't think anymore,
if you learn to pull it back,

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.180
you're not vegging out.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.410
But when you go back
in, just like a car

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.740
or just like rebooting
your computer,

00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:21.080
you've got more resilience
than the next guy.

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.630
So actually it's quite
good for business.

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.170
And if you don't understand
the gloop, everything you learn

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:30.940
is by gray matter.

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:33.620
If you are memorizing
something, the reason you do it

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.090
over and over and
over again, it's

00:22:36.090 --> 00:22:39.150
not because you're getting more
filing cabinets in your head.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.920
It's because that particular
area of the memory

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.420
is building up more
and more gloop.

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.290
That's how you learn the piano.

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:48.340
That's how you learn
how to do a backhand.

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.490
And by the way, you
have to practice it.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:54.000
Everything you learn, if you
think about it-- calculus, how

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.800
to walk, how to talk,
how to pole dance--

00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.670
is because you repeat it
over and over and over again.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.830
It's the practice that does it.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:04.680
So if you want to do a
mindfulness exercise now,

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.361
want to do it?

00:23:05.361 --> 00:23:05.860
All right.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.920
Now this is making more gloop.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.560
Obviously not just
today, but keep it up.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.060
All right.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.070
So, again, this is the exercise.

00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:17.840
Come away from the
back of your chair.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.140
You just do this for a minute.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.710
And by the way, nobody
has time to do this,

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.487
but when you're in a queue,
when you're-- I don't know--

00:23:26.487 --> 00:23:29.070
sitting on the bus, sitting on
the-- you all have waiting time

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.740
when you're walking
down the hallway.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.840
Even a minute of this becoming
aware builds the gloop.

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.340
All right.

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:38.770
So take your focus to a sense.

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:40.670
And let's start with
the sense that's

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.370
as far from your gabbling
brain as you can.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:46.960
So take your focus to
where are your feet.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:52.170
If you can, touch the ground
so you feel the contact

00:23:52.170 --> 00:23:53.330
of your foot on the ground.

00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:56.300
Everybody can do that.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.270
And you're going to want
to think, but that's cool.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:00.910
Just take it back to the sense.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.470
OK, let it go.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.230
And if you didn't register
anything, it doesn't matter.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:16.220
Now focus on where your body is
making contact with the chair.

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:22.530
So you feel the whole
outline and the inside

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:24.550
your skin where
it's making contact,

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:26.346
so you really feel the
effects of gravity.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.840
So just let that focus go.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.450
And now take your focus
to the sense of sound.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:41.930
So all you're
doing is listening.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.470
And your mind's
going to take you.

00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:57.640
Believe me, in a
couple seconds, you're

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.090
going to get snared
by your thoughts.

00:25:01.090 --> 00:25:03.246
Maybe you're thinking
about-- I don't

00:25:03.246 --> 00:25:08.804
know-- the future, the past,
a fantasy, getting angry.

00:25:08.804 --> 00:25:11.220
As soon as you notice it, you
haven't done anything wrong.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.510
You just notice it.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:16.100
And then that without giving
yourself a hard time at all

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:20.064
because everybody's minds
do it, take your focus back

00:25:20.064 --> 00:25:20.605
to listening.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.750
And then your thoughts will
take you at some point.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.280
Again, don't whip
yourself about it.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.670
Just take it back again.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.810
Another sense, if
you want, is just

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:49.180
let the sound go
and take your focus

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:51.960
to where you notice
that you're breathing,

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.510
either whatever your
area's most vivid,

00:25:54.510 --> 00:25:58.390
through the tip of your nose,
your throat, your chest,

00:25:58.390 --> 00:26:00.622
your abdomen.

00:26:00.622 --> 00:26:01.330
And stay with it.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:06.700
Just try to focus on where
your air is going in and out.

00:26:13.826 --> 00:26:15.450
And then your mind's
going to take you.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:17.910
You have to do something.

00:26:17.910 --> 00:26:20.420
You didn't do something.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.300
You should do-- whatever
you're thinking,

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:27.250
you just go, OK, I noticed it.

00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:28.670
Good.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:29.400
No judgment.

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:31.620
Go back to where
you were breathing.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.540
And if you have trouble
tracking your breath,

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:36.130
see if you can count to five.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.050
This isn't a contest.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:42.260
It's easier to be more specific.

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:46.130
So in breath, out breath is one.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:49.190
In breath, out breath, two.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.460
And if you lose your way, you
haven't done anything wrong,

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.860
just go back to one.

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:57.680
And if you don't get to
five, it's not a contest.

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.217
So in breath, out breath, one.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.850
So another thing this
does is it teaches

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:26.810
you to pay attention, which goes
back to resilience and risk,

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.340
is that whatever else is the
racing mind, is that really,

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:32.660
again, there's a
part in your brain--

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.430
I could tell you the
name of it-- that

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.860
is in charge of attention.

00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:38.740
By the way, I'm
making it simplistic.

00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:42.150
But it really is your
anterior cingulate

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:45.630
cortex is getting the gloop
so that you really learn.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.990
You're practicing how to--
you don't do it all day.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:49.580
You don't do sit-ups all day.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:53.530
It's just a short amount
of time, even a minute.

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:56.730
But even that has an effect when
they look in a brain scanner.

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:59.430
So each time you
bring the focus,

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:03.730
you're sharpening the
ability to pay attention.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:05.530
And people go, well,
what's with attention?

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:06.940
I pay it, OK?

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:08.710
Well, you don't.

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:10.950
Actually, as humans, we
can only pay attention

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.220
to something for
1.2 seconds and then

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:17.500
we flit away because our
minds, believe it or not,

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.580
are still caveman.

00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.180
It doesn't understand
that there's

00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:24.450
been some redecoration
for the 21st century.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:27.470
So really all we're geared
for is to see what's dangerous

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:28.230
and what's safe.

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.722
That's it.

00:28:30.722 --> 00:28:34.030
We really aren't equipped
to pick one toothpaste out

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:35.770
of 5,000 choices.

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:38.850
So it's either a
snake or it's a stick.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:40.630
And what also, I
think-- this, I think,

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:43.840
is interesting-- is wherever
you pay attention defines

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.419
who you are in that second.

00:28:45.419 --> 00:28:46.960
So if you're sitting
in the computer,

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.260
but your mind is
off on a holiday,

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.280
you're not actually
at the computer.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.860
Everything in your
brain is somewhere else.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.970
I know that because I
actually experienced it.

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:01.340
I was in the was in
Melbourne two years ago.

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:03.620
And the sun was eclipsing.

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:06.390
And it happens only
once every 200 years.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.830
But my brain is-- I'm shouting
at the White Company in London

00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:14.500
because somebody sent me
a single duvet instead

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.690
of the king size.

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:16.780
That's where my brain is.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:17.940
I'm thinking, right?

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:18.847
The sun is eclipsed.

00:29:18.847 --> 00:29:20.430
The moon is going
in front of the sun.

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.110
It's going to happen
in another 199 years.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.720
And I am tearing somebody's
neck off because he sent me

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.420
the wrong duvet.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:30.770
So you know what I'm thinking?

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.630
If I die in the
next second, do I

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:35.800
want my mind to have been
in the White Company?

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:38.601
Well, if there's a 20%
sale, then I don't mind.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:46.650
Actually-- I don't
know if I have

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:49.450
time-- I could talk a little
bit about-- how much time

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:50.920
have I got?

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.866
Not much.

00:29:51.866 --> 00:29:52.760
PETER READ: Yeah.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.700
RUBY WAX: You want a little
bit about neuroplasticity

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.400
is that they used to think our
brains were locked in stone.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.760
The way you come into the
world is how you go out.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.290
But now they know it's
constantly shapeshifting.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:07.570
Every experience you have,
even your genes, are affected.

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:08.279
We aren't locked.

00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:10.069
I mean, you're never
going to be an-- well,

00:30:10.069 --> 00:30:11.760
you probably are--
you're never going

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:13.676
to be an Einstein if you
don't have the genes,

00:30:13.676 --> 00:30:15.110
but there's a lot of elbow room.

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.110
It's constantly moving around.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:21.020
It's like pass the parcel,
except it's not some crap gift.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:27.710
It's passing chemicals
through electric transmitters.

00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:30.890
So if you're very tense, it's
starting to pass that cortisol.

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:31.800
That's how it goes.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:33.287
And then we freeze.

00:30:33.287 --> 00:30:34.120
That's what happens.

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.730
And we go into that other
thing besides fight and flight.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:37.400
We freeze.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.900
And this is where
you get people who

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:42.370
start to-- because
we hate uncertainty.

00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.680
That really is the
natural condition.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.690
And when we feel
it, we actually--

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:52.540
our version of freezing is we
start to stick to stereotypes.

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:56.990
Like, people will say, oh, I'm
a victim, which you aren't.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.440
I mean, we're everything.

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.030
But it's better,
the devil you know.

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.840
They've actually put
scanners on people's eyes.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:04.420
Are we at zero?

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.660
Man, we didn't have time
for question and answer.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.780
And they will always
look for the perpetrator.

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.900
So, basically, if
those neurons, if you

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.070
start to learn how
to cool your engine,

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:16.500
if you really start to
be able to self-regulate

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.000
your chemicals,
then you can really

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.260
navigate around the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune.

00:31:23.260 --> 00:31:26.840
But literally, the only way to
do it is coming to your senses.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.710
So I'm kind of done,
but we don't have

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.182
time for question and answer.

00:31:31.182 --> 00:31:32.540
PETER READ: No, I think we do.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:33.781
Sasha, I think we do?

00:31:33.781 --> 00:31:34.280
Yeah.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:34.750
RUBY WAX: How much?

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:35.312
20?

00:31:35.312 --> 00:31:36.520
Oh, well, then I could go on.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.386
No, I won't go on.

00:31:37.386 --> 00:31:38.940
PETER READ: Go on.

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.980
RUBY WAX: I won't go on.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.210
PETER READ: Do you
want to ask a question?

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.950
I mean, ask
questions on anything

00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:49.320
we've said and then also maybe,
as we said earlier, bringing it

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.020
back together around
this theme of how can

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.340
we harness technology to
solve mental well-being

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.366
with the hardware or software.

00:31:58.366 --> 00:31:58.990
RUBY WAX: Yeah?

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.531
Oh, I think you have
to get up there,

00:32:00.531 --> 00:32:02.023
but I think we can hear you.

00:32:02.023 --> 00:32:03.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so--

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.627
RUBY WAX: Can you hear him?

00:32:04.627 --> 00:32:05.126
OK.

00:32:05.126 --> 00:32:06.038
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:06.038 --> 00:32:08.774
AUDIENCE: So in your opinion,
how does subconscious

00:32:08.774 --> 00:32:10.601
fit into this context?

00:32:10.601 --> 00:32:13.000
How do you view subconscious?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.100
So I'm saying again--

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.260
RUBY WAX: How do you
view the subconscious?

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:19.020
You mean in a Freudian sense?

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.657
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so do you think
that a subconscious, there's

00:32:22.657 --> 00:32:25.452
something else that even
if we think about it,

00:32:25.452 --> 00:32:28.360
but when we go to sleep,
there's something else that's

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.890
going on beyond our control?

00:32:29.890 --> 00:32:32.110
RUBY WAX: Well,
I think you can--

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.860
I think it's a little
bit old-fashioned

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:35.250
that we have to analyze it.

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:40.430
It's a little bit like looking
at what your body produces

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.296
and trying to figure
out the source of it.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.690
If you start to
delve into what it

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:50.330
is-- sorry for any
Freudian-- you're actually

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.770
embedding it more and more.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:54.340
And then you do come up,
I'm an alcoholic, I'm this.

00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:55.540
You get a story.

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:57.140
But memory doesn't
work like that.

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:59.300
Memory works like photocopies.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:01.790
So eventually, why
hold on to that?

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.690
So the thing about
mindfulness is

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.430
that you're allowing the
thoughts to come and go.

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:08.030
I suppose that's
your unconscious.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:08.990
It's pornographic.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.880
It's adorable.

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:10.840
It's cruel.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:12.490
You're starting
to get a distance.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.990
And again, if you
let it go, you start

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.914
to notice it's never
going to shut off

00:33:17.914 --> 00:33:19.080
even before you go to sleep.

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.120
People think the
point of mindfulness

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:22.970
is that you go blank.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:24.910
Your mind is blank
when you're dead.

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:26.890
That's a big clue
that you're dead.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:28.160
You're blank.

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.380
So you're actually-- and
it's a misconception--

00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.140
you're allowing this hell--
and it's always awful.

00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:38.380
Always I get up in the morning
and believe me it's Armageddon.

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:41.320
But gradually you learn it's
a radio in another room.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.190
Like right now, if I shut up,
boy, would I be getting hell.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.840
Intimidation isn't in it.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.460
But eventually, you
learn to live with it.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.260
You go, oh, yeah, come on in.

00:33:52.260 --> 00:33:52.890
Fine.

00:33:52.890 --> 00:33:56.030
And when you get that
relationship-- actually,

00:33:56.030 --> 00:34:00.970
if you get the distance, the
minute that cortisol is down,

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:03.600
resilience, risk,
everything takes

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:05.940
place because nobody is
frightening you anymore.

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.889
The only thing that's
frightening are our thoughts.

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:10.159
Nobody can hurt you.

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:13.614
It's your thoughts that can
really put you in a bad place.

00:34:13.614 --> 00:34:15.030
PETER READ: Just
to add to that, I

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:19.170
think the Daniel Kahneman
behavioral economics

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:21.290
stuff, which he
explicitly recognizes

00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:23.280
that the role of
subconscious, system

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.691
one in our economic
behavior, is some

00:34:26.691 --> 00:34:28.440
of the most powerful
insights in economics

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.409
over the last couple of decades.

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:32.139
RUBY WAX: Tell them
the name of the book.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:33.710
PETER READ: Daniel Kahneman.

00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:35.209
RUBY WAX: "Thinking,
Fast and Slow."

00:34:35.209 --> 00:34:39.139
PETER READ: "Thinking,
Fast and Slow."

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:40.550
Any others?

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:41.084
[INAUDIBLE]

00:34:41.084 --> 00:34:43.290
AUDIENCE: I had a quick
question about sleep.

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.498
RUBY WAX: Can he come closer?

00:34:44.498 --> 00:34:46.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah, can
you hear me now?

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:48.489
I had a question about
sleep and whether you

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:54.909
could chat a little bit on how,
since obtaining your degree,

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:59.990
you've been able to apply
your new knowledge to becoming

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:01.990
a better sleeper,
assuming that you weren't

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:07.260
a brilliant one before,
and any practical advice

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:09.762
for the insomniacs in the crowd.

00:35:09.762 --> 00:35:11.220
RUBY WAX: Well,
first of all listen

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:13.440
to our Russell
Foster on Ted Talks

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.810
because he's the
expert of experts.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:20.850
And far worse than
any, within limit,

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:23.320
drugs, if you
don't sleep enough,

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.440
that cortisol will
crash you to the ground.

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.400
And by the way, some
people go, oh, yeah, I'm

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.150
a little stressed.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.260
Yeah, I can deal with it.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.090
I can take it on.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:31.070
You can't take it on.

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:35.010
If it keeps going, it won't
just lead to insomnia.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:38.560
Every disease is caused by
that-- diabetes, cancer,

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:43.030
obesity, drug addiction,
mental illness, infertility.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:47.200
So I'm just saying be scared,
stay up a little later.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.982
I think that again, if you do
something like mindfulness,

00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:52.690
and if you don't want
to do-- by the way,

00:35:52.690 --> 00:35:55.770
it isn't for everybody--
is it becomes a habit.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:56.950
And they teach kids now.

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:59.240
It's something
called beditation.

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.770
If you really practice this
thing-- and if it doesn't work,

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.160
find something that does.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:07.150
I don't care if you take
Xanax once in a while.

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:10.680
Or I've learned
mindfulness means you learn

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.930
what it is that works for you.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:15.320
Don't imitate the next guy
who sleeps three hours.

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.290
Most of us really need it.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.970
Maybe you can't take the time,
but this is another thing

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.120
about understanding.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.870
No matter what job you
have, if you're tired,

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.550
you'll notice you
can't be creative.

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.210
So if you practice
this, don't just

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:31.140
pull the ripcord when
you can't go to sleep

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.990
or when I know I'm
getting depressed.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:36.460
If you just do it once, it's
like you can't do one sit-up.

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.140
But if you keep
practicing, there

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:42.420
is a way, again, of lower-- the
racing thoughts won't happen.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:44.667
But the reason you go to
sleep is they continue.

00:36:44.667 --> 00:36:45.250
They continue.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:46.290
You know that thing.

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:50.450
And gradually you go from--
what-- alpha to theta.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:52.890
I mean, it will happen.

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:54.450
But you can't just
do it once, even

00:36:54.450 --> 00:36:56.480
if you grab a minute a day.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.620
But if it doesn't work
for you, experiment.

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.800
Again, try everything.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.040
PETER READ: There's actually
an interesting parallel.

00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.560
So to what Ruby was
describing earlier,

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:11.890
when she went to
Oxford, she learned

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:13.730
mindfulness-based
cognitive therapy.

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:17.910
So a branch of CBT from
Professor Mark Williams.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:21.170
Another professor at
Oxford, Colin Espie,

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:24.170
actually has a
company called Sleepio

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:28.260
in which I'm an investor, so
I'm not objective on this.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:34.127
But it is delivering sleep-based
CBT digitally, and then

00:37:34.127 --> 00:37:35.710
actually a whole
bunch of other stuff.

00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:37.340
So it's actually
a similar branch.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:42.800
It all starts in cognitive
behavioral therapy.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.520
RUBY WAX: See, technology
is going to rule.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.580
PETER READ: So its, in a
way, a perfect example.

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.890
RUBY WAX: And the
results are unbelievable.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:53.400
PETER READ: It's very powerful.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.305
PETER READ: Oh, brilliant.

00:37:57.305 --> 00:37:59.180
For thos of you who
didn't hear, all Googlers

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.804
have access to the Sleepio
thing, which is good.

00:38:02.804 --> 00:38:04.470
AUDIENCE: I was going
to ask a question.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.560
PETER READ: Yeah.

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:06.930
AUDIENCE: You said a few
times that we're in Stone Age

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.070
as far as mental health and
mindfulness is concerned.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:12.447
What do you see
or hope the future

00:38:12.447 --> 00:38:14.030
is with mindfulness
and mental health?

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.052
RUBY WAX: Oh, you
want to go first?

00:38:16.052 --> 00:38:16.760
PETER READ: Yeah.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:23.157
So I think this is the
stuff-- and, actually,

00:38:23.157 --> 00:38:25.240
this is a question that
we would like to ask you--

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:30.270
which is, how do we
harness technology

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.990
to help us solve mental
well-being as we said earlier?

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:37.160
And we've talked
about it before.

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.770
There are two flavors of this.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:42.320
One is, if you like,
a hardware flavor.

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.310
Is there a Fitbit for the mind?

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:46.760
And what does that look like?

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:47.830
Where does it sit?

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.477
Does it sit on your wrist?

00:38:49.477 --> 00:38:51.060
And that would be
something, probably,

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.750
that could measure heart rate
variability very accurately

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:56.740
because that's the best proxy
for the amount of cortisol

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:57.750
in the system.

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:58.910
Come back to that.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:03.030
And then the second is when
Ruby mentioned it earlier,

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.490
when she was talking
about track 17

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:10.850
and track-- is there software,
machine-learning software, that

00:39:10.850 --> 00:39:15.470
can help me objectively
recognize those soundtracks--

00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:18.400
maybe before I'm
recognizing them--

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.420
or maybe before I'm allowing
myself to believe, oh, gosh,

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.050
yeah, it is that
soundtrack again.

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:29.160
So again, that feels to me
more like is there a software

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.410
solution, and AI-based
software solution

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:36.270
that can recognize those
soundtracks before I do?

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:37.300
So those are the two.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:42.070
I don't know-- to go
back to the first,

00:39:42.070 --> 00:39:44.960
if I can take your question
and make it another question,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:50.710
is has anybody seen anything
like that, a piece of hardware

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:54.620
that is going to be able
to accurately measure heart

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.336
rate variability, for example?

00:39:57.336 --> 00:39:58.430
Anybody seen that?

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:03.191
RUBY WAX: Is that your
area, by the way, at all,

00:40:03.191 --> 00:40:08.520
of looking at the hardware
that would maybe say-- see,

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:10.074
it's the wrong--

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:12.240
PETER READ: Yeah, probably
less so, actually, right?

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.948
RUBY WAX: I think it's
an engineer thing.

00:40:13.948 --> 00:40:16.634
PETER READ: Other bits
of Google do-- yeah.

00:40:16.634 --> 00:40:17.800
RUBY WAX: What do you think?

00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:18.140
Yeah.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:18.990
PETER READ: Yeah, probably.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:20.948
RUBY WAX: We're wasting
our breath [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:22.835 --> 00:40:24.460
PETER READ: And then
the software side,

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:28.380
the AI side, again, does
that resonate with you

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:33.340
as something that
enables you to recognize

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.370
those patterns in your own
mind, maybe even before you do?

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:40.410
RUBY WAX: To me, the
problem with all this

00:40:40.410 --> 00:40:43.710
is I understand you can check
how quick you're running,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.690
though to me that--
or how many steps

00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.260
you do-- but to me, that
leads to a nervous breakdown.

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:50.670
Oh, my god, I
didn't do my 2,000.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:53.160
So it raises up the
cortisol even more

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:56.850
though you may
have run whatever.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.830
But what we're
missing here, and I

00:40:58.830 --> 00:41:00.890
think what it
should incorporate,

00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.910
is the practice isn't just
to notice the cortisol.

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.270
The practice is to
give you insight.

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:10.340
And also, I mean,
it's infinite to help

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.900
you get into the present,
though that sounds slushy.

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.270
But if you think it
does, ask yourself

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:20.950
how much money you spend to get
there if you go to a restaurant

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.370
and go to the-- buy
that wine that's

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:26.197
from the
[NONSENSE SOUND] valley.

00:41:26.197 --> 00:41:28.780
If you don't taste it, you might
as well cut out the middleman

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.590
and pour it into the toilet.

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:35.180
Somebody said if you
can ask somebody what's

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.270
the best time in their
lives and they say now,

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:40.370
then they've arrived.

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:43.370
The main thing is to
recognize who you are.

00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:45.490
I mean, that was
always know thyself.

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:46.840
And it still stands.

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.050
If, when you're in the
midst of a situation,

00:41:50.050 --> 00:41:52.890
you don't recognize what's
going on in your head,

00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:55.010
it'll happen over
and over again.

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:58.130
The practice is to
see, to understand.

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:00.800
Sometimes I know
I'm cooking on gas

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:03.250
because I write for "AbFab."

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:08.080
And I'm crash-- if you think
getting brain freeze is bad,

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.400
if you're trying to be
funny the first thing that

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.010
goes, with a little bit of
stress, forget about it.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:14.710
You can't.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:17.210
Because the whole thing is
about getting out of the box.

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.470
But sometimes I use mindfulness.

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.690
I let the bullshit
go by, the crap,

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:24.570
how awful I am, how I've never
written a funny line, who

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:25.900
do I think I am.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.580
And gradually, it's like
something rises out of the mud.

00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.870
They say your most
inspiration comes from when

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:34.210
you're taking a shower.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:36.620
Get in the shower, I suppose,
but you might be at work.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.740
It ain't going to happen.

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:40.200
Oh, no, you have showers here.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.680
But out of the mud suddenly
comes the most creative thing.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.850
The heart's down.

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:47.210
The risk thing is cooking.

00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:49.580
And out of that dirt
suddenly rises up.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.890
So you can use it
for creative thought.

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:52.390
So

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:56.130
Just to use it to get down,
to get that alpha state,

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.220
that's not what
we're aiming for.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:42:59.590
When you run, it doesn't matter.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:00.890
You can run mindlessly.

00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:04.510
And by the way, to me,
that's not the answer.

00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:06.790
You can run mindfully,
but you have

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:08.930
to read my book to do that.

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:13.740
Not pushing it,
but I'm pimping it.

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:18.970
But you can use it
for various things.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:22.360
So, basically, I think
what we were talking about

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:25.070
is that even with
this new hardware,

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.450
somebody has to be very
careful because again we'll

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.080
be chasing the wrong rabbit.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:33.290
The point of this is
to understand yourself.

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:36.120
When you're sitting there and
you can't burn out anymore,

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.390
you can't take any more, look
where your tipping point is.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:41.070
What are you thinking?

00:43:41.070 --> 00:43:44.710
Otherwise, you'll never learn
where your tipping point is.

00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:47.410
There's a moment where
you know that it starts

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:49.740
to curve down and
then learn to go--

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.880
that'll help you go to sleep
if you keep acknowledging

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.240
your tipping point.

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:57.510
I'm sure you won't get fired
because once you recognize it,

00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:58.300
you take a rest.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:43:59.591
This should be in the hardware.

00:43:59.591 --> 00:44:02.360
Your computer starts to
say-- it doesn't say,

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:06.320
but it starts to slow down
and it's replaced by--

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:08.200
I don't care if it's
your cat purring--

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:10.830
I've actually recorded my
cat-- but there's a moment.

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:15.390
You know what I mean, a sound
or a smell, work for you.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:17.080
But I think that's the future.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:20.700
So run with that idea.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.540
I listen to jungle nosies.

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.060
I swear to God.

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:25.112
It cools me right down.

00:44:25.112 --> 00:44:26.653
But don't do it
while you're driving.

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:33.460
AUDIENCE: Advertising tries
to get people's attention.

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.790
So it tries to take you from
what you're doing, what you're

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:38.840
thinking about, and
draw your attention

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:41.670
to whatever the objective
of the advertiser is.

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:44.460
A lot of us work in advertising.

00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:46.730
What do you think about
the effects of advertising

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:48.091
on mindfulness?

00:44:48.091 --> 00:44:50.440
And what is the
responsibility of companies

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:55.044
like Google, Facebook towards
advocating mindfulness?

00:44:55.044 --> 00:44:56.460
RUBY WAX: Do you
want to go first?

00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:00.910
PETER READ: Yeah, so who's
the Nobel economist who talks

00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:02.980
about the attention economy?

00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:04.330
I've totally forgotten now.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.170
I always find that an
incredibly helpful way

00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:09.550
to start thinking about this
because that is advertising's

00:45:09.550 --> 00:45:11.096
job, is to grab my attention.

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:18.090
And the way I've thought about
it for myself is, actually,

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:21.060
if you put yourself through
digital detox, which I don't

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.680
know if-- has anybody tried
that, by the way, just as

00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.980
an exercise with this health?

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:27.485
Yeah, sort of 10% of the room.

00:45:27.485 --> 00:45:29.110
RUBY WAX: What kind
of a risk was that?

00:45:29.110 --> 00:45:29.610
Boy.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.543
I would think that's
the highest risk of all.

00:45:31.543 --> 00:45:34.020
PETER READ: Right.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:37.420
So when you do that, and
you actually deliberately

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:41.920
starve yourself of those
attention distractions

00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.980
from advertising,
then you realize--

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:45.600
and for me, it was
only then that I

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:49.810
realized what a great job
you guys do distracting

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:51.920
me most of the time.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.020
RUBY WAX: Oo, was
that a backhander.

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:58.990
PETER READ: No, it's
entirely a compliment.

00:45:58.990 --> 00:46:01.760
So that, for me,
was the recognition

00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.840
that I am much more
distracted by this,

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.220
that you have done a great
job of drawing my attention.

00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:14.810
And so, in order to fight
that for me, I need to unplug,

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:16.780
which I don't do a
great job of, but I'm

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.520
at least conscious of it and
try to do it from time to time.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.776
That answer it a little bit?

00:46:20.776 --> 00:46:21.692
AUDIENCE: Yeah, great.

00:46:21.692 --> 00:46:24.060
And what is our
responsibility as [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:27.560
RUBY WAX: So I was going to
say, raising kids or being

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:31.230
with your friends or your
relationships at work, is you

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:35.290
have to walk the talk because
we work like neural Wi-Fi.

00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:38.700
So if I can cool myself
down, it has a ripple effect.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:42.290
So I think if you
understood what

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:45.090
it is to not be distracted
and not get nervous,

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:47.630
that it's job's worth,
I think you might

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:49.650
start thinking out of the box.

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.670
Because part of the thing
that distraction does

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:55.780
is it might not even buy your
product or whatever is it

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.330
makes people
nervous, which means

00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:59.240
they're not thinking clearly.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.990
So they really
won't focus on what

00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:05.010
it is you're trying to get over,
you're trying to get across.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:09.460
And believe me, if you
think you're distracted,

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:13.030
it will reflect in what
you're trying to push.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:16.210
I've done things last
week for call centers.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:19.050
And I said, don't
assume what worked

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:22.540
in the past is going to work
now because people can sense it,

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:23.930
even over the thing.

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:27.100
They can sense that
you're doing a quick fix.

00:47:27.100 --> 00:47:29.050
But they can also
sense-- I'm doing it

00:47:29.050 --> 00:47:31.460
more person to person--
is that when you're

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:34.150
really interested in that
person, if you're curious,

00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:36.320
that's the key to their heart.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.800
So I don't know how you do it.

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:39.300
But it's almost
like you know how

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:43.531
we start by asking questions and
sort of letting them figure it

00:47:43.531 --> 00:47:44.030
out.

00:47:44.030 --> 00:47:48.640
It's your humanity and
it's your curiosity.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.130
If you're really curious and
you're trying to get in--

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:54.467
and you're really
learning to pay attention,

00:47:54.467 --> 00:47:56.300
then they'll give you
the keys to their car,

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:57.650
their wife, their money.

00:47:57.650 --> 00:47:59.530
I don't know how you
do that digitally.

00:47:59.530 --> 00:48:01.670
But I think if you
practice something

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:04.070
where your life is a
series of distractions

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:06.520
and you really
learn to listen, it

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.870
might-- maybe you'll
have group meetings--

00:48:09.870 --> 00:48:15.030
inspire you to do something
where you really hook somebody.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.190
I don't know what that is
because it's not my job.

00:48:17.190 --> 00:48:19.419
But it has to start with you.

00:48:19.419 --> 00:48:20.960
PETER READ: And we
all know what that

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:25.830
feels like when
we're in a-- my wife

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:28.920
is one of those people who,
if you ask my children or any

00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.220
of our friends, she is
one of those people who

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:33.890
when she's present
in a conversation,

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:35.650
she's incredibly present.

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:37.999
And she doesn't practice
mindfulness to get there.

00:48:37.999 --> 00:48:39.332
RUBY WAX: Yeah, she's a natural.

00:48:39.332 --> 00:48:40.498
PETER READ: She's a natural.

00:48:40.498 --> 00:48:41.080
You know her.

00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.320
She's a natural.

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:43.560
Some people can do that.

00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:47.810
So it is a very--
it's very precious.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.750
RUBY WAX: Maybe you ask
people what they want.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:55.593
And then you sculpt
what you're giving.

00:48:55.593 --> 00:48:58.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:58.700 --> 00:48:59.662
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:59.662 --> 00:49:02.120
I've been practicing for about,
I think, a year and a half,

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.400
almost every day.

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.104
And something that
I find is, even

00:49:05.104 --> 00:49:07.520
though I think in the long
term it's been very beneficial,

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.390
I sometimes struggle
with increased anxiety

00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:13.446
as a result of this increased
sense of being present.

00:49:13.446 --> 00:49:15.320
Because sometimes you're
so present that when

00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.150
you run into these
cycles of anxiety,

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:19.997
it just perpetrates into
more and more and more.

00:49:19.997 --> 00:49:21.080
How do you deal with that?

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.510
Because it's something
that I have, like I said,

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.259
found very useful over
the course of time,

00:49:24.259 --> 00:49:26.050
but then sometimes
it is very-- yeah,

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:27.450
you're almost too present.

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:29.150
RUBY WAX: Yeah, I got that.

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:31.680
But, again, mindfulness
means that you're

00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:33.920
taking the temperature.

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.110
You're the barometer.

00:49:35.110 --> 00:49:38.115
If it's too much-- I
always say, if you're

00:49:38.115 --> 00:49:40.240
in the midst of burnout or
if you're in depression,

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.990
do not go near this.

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:47.370
So mindfulness is-- the
big thing in bold print

00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:49.090
is be nice to yourself.

00:49:49.090 --> 00:49:49.880
Go in the gym.

00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:51.671
Maybe you can't because
you broke your arm,

00:49:51.671 --> 00:49:53.840
but go in the gym.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:55.990
Distract yourself.

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:57.870
There's moments where
you need distractions,

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.510
just like there's moments
when you need stress.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:03.910
But, again, you
don't want it to be

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:06.740
like you listen to lovely
music or there's nothing.

00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:07.690
I meditate.

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.760
Go on the tube because
you learn to tolerate.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.720
And to tolerate is the
way kids will survive.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.330
It's a muscle.

00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:18.560
But, again, you'll see
your tipping point.

00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:20.860
When it's driving
you nuts, get up.

00:50:20.860 --> 00:50:21.812
AUDIENCE: Fair enough.

00:50:21.812 --> 00:50:23.270
And, I think, a
follow-up question.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:26.670
You were saying before about
how you gauge co-founders

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:29.470
in terms of their resilience and
their ability to manage stress.

00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:31.215
Who else do you see doing that?

00:50:31.215 --> 00:50:33.230
Is that something
you'd say is somewhat

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:34.830
widespread amongst
funds and people

00:50:34.830 --> 00:50:38.510
trying to invest in start-ups,
gauging the ability of founders

00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:41.514
to be resilient to
take on leadership

00:50:41.514 --> 00:50:43.180
through to stress
management, et cetera?

00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:47.130
PETER READ: Yeah, I think
everybody who does what I do

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:51.100
will do their own version
of that because it's

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.500
sort of obvious, isn't it?

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.670
Again, if in my world
it's not so much

00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:59.490
that we cherish the idea, it's
that we cherish the ability

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:00.990
to get something done.

00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:03.990
And so how do people
get something done even

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:06.870
when the doors all
seem to be closed?

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:09.280
Well, then you want
to back founders

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.994
who will climb through the
window if the door's closed.

00:51:11.994 --> 00:51:13.410
On your earlier
point, I was going

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:19.390
to say there is a temptation
for-- well, a couple of points.

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:21.480
One is that
meditation, like yoga,

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:26.430
can sometimes start to become
competitive in some random way.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:27.560
How long do you do it for?

00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:32.870
All this kind of stuff, which
is generally less hopeful.

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:36.670
And a second is a slightly
more philosophical point here,

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:41.170
which is that I think everybody
I know who has been meditating,

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:43.855
practicing mindfulness for
a long time comes to a point

00:51:43.855 --> 00:51:48.000
where-- and I think a
lot of Mark Williams

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.920
and others did an amazing
job of helping bring it

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:55.160
into the scientific
realm out of-- bring it

00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:58.830
into the scientific realm
and wrap it in neuroscience.

00:51:58.830 --> 00:52:01.390
But Mark and others
will also tell you

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:04.740
that there comes a point
where actually it's helpful

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:09.120
if it's slightly pushed
back into an ethical realm

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:13.320
so that you're not just doing
it because it's great to shrink

00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:19.360
your amygdala, that in addition
that it is somehow helping

00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:24.080
you think about what's
good, and that it has

00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.740
some kind of ethical
vector through it

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:32.154
as well as just pure ability
to focus your attention

00:52:32.154 --> 00:52:33.070
on the present moment.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:33.910
See what I mean?

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:35.960
RUBY WAX: I think
that's from-- I

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:38.130
know I put it in small
brackets, but when

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:41.490
you notice that your
mind is flipping,

00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:46.330
part of the habit breaking
is being nice to yourself,

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:48.690
kind, or whatever,
or compassionate.

00:52:48.690 --> 00:52:52.130
It's, again, I always think
of a horrible greeting card.

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:53.540
But that's the training.

00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:58.750
So that when you start to
recognize how cruel you are

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:02.400
to yourself, part of
it is to understand

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.540
when somebody else
is giving you hell,

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.280
they're listening
to a recording, too.

00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:09.040
So you stop taking
it so personally.

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.920
So again, the point isn't to
sit on a gluten-free cushion.

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:16.520
The point is that you're
now recognizing yourself

00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:20.810
in other people, or that we're
all in the same situation.

00:53:20.810 --> 00:53:22.680
That's, again, not
in the small print,

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.320
but I always have
trouble with the C

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:26.652
word, which is compassion.

00:53:26.652 --> 00:53:27.610
AUDIENCE: Great answer.

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:28.110
Thank you.

00:53:28.110 --> 00:53:30.972
RUBY WAX: I think
that's a side project.

00:53:30.972 --> 00:53:32.930
AUDIENCE: I have a slightly
follow-on question.

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:34.821
So can you talk us
through an example

00:53:34.821 --> 00:53:36.320
or give advice or
maybe tell a story

00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.300
of when this happened that
you get to that tipping point,

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.070
you're frazzled,
you're overwhelmed,

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:43.944
but there's still the issue
that it's not fully socially

00:53:43.944 --> 00:53:45.735
acceptable-- or sometimes
it is acceptable,

00:53:45.735 --> 00:53:47.860
but you don't feel it
is-- to put your hand up

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.680
and say, I've got
too much on my plate.

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.730
I can't cope.

00:53:50.730 --> 00:53:53.930
And we still-- obviously, we
work in a very accepting place,

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:56.209
but there's still
commitments to be had.

00:53:56.209 --> 00:53:57.750
There's still meetings
to show up to.

00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:59.600
You still have to turn
up to work tomorrow

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.683
even though sometimes you
don't feel like you can.

00:54:01.683 --> 00:54:04.980
And that bit is sometimes
hard to break through.

00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:08.120
PETER READ: She wrote a book
about this-- two, in fact.

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.270
RUBY WAX: I know you can't.

00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:10.850
I can't stop, either.

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:13.400
But let's say I'm doing a show.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.500
I'm doing a show.

00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.660
So I grab a minute backstage.

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.660
Or you'll grab a minute.

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:18.520
I don't care.

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.670
There is a minute,
especially if you're going

00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:23.977
to have a meeting or something.

00:54:23.977 --> 00:54:25.560
I'm not saying stop
what you're doing.

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.890
As a matter of fact,
there's now books

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:31.650
that show you how to be
present while you're doing

00:54:31.650 --> 00:54:35.650
your work, which is noticing.

00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:37.470
It's always noticing
the state of mind

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:40.310
and going back to maybe
looking at what you're doing.

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:42.540
But the exercise is,
where is your mind?

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:43.289
Bring it back.

00:54:43.289 --> 00:54:44.080
Where is your mind?

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.260
Bring it back.

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:49.740
And as far as work, when
you do go into a meeting

00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.360
and it's getting
tense, if you recognize

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:56.190
when you're locking antlers
and this meeting isn't going

00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:57.830
anywhere, I wish
they would really

00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:00.370
learn to hold up a white
flag and say, we're just

00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:03.440
caught in that animal cycle.

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.640
I think, again, if you
learn while you're there,

00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.530
and because you practiced
to cool it down--

00:55:08.530 --> 00:55:10.820
I'm sure that's why Arabs
use those beads because it's

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:13.110
splitting their attention.

00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:18.630
If you learn to do it in
the situation-- walking,

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:23.150
being in the gym, eating can
be a time to do the exercise.

00:55:23.150 --> 00:55:27.020
So you don't have
to take time off.

00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:30.020
Just that one minute.

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:31.240
You can see the results.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:35.064
If somebody does it 3 and
1/2 hours, it already shows.

00:55:35.064 --> 00:55:36.355
Does that answer your question?

00:55:36.355 --> 00:55:37.130
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:55:37.130 --> 00:55:38.950
PETER READ: It is a
very hard thing to do,

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:41.202
isn't it, to put your
hand up and say, I--

00:55:41.202 --> 00:55:43.410
RUBY WAX: You don't have to
put your hand up, though.

00:55:43.410 --> 00:55:44.159
PETER READ: Right.

00:55:44.159 --> 00:55:45.770
RUBY WAX: It's a personal thing.

00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:47.710
You don't have to
admit to anybody.

00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:49.700
Hopefully, you're
avoiding burnout

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:51.460
by doing this kind of thing.

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.990
And, again, for
technology, I know

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:56.280
there shouldn't be a buzzer
because it'll get people

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.090
into competing going,
I shut off first.

00:55:59.090 --> 00:56:02.750
But, again, if it could
be replaced by whatever

00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:06.062
it is that cools you down--
because you need a reminder.

00:56:06.062 --> 00:56:06.770
That's the thing.

00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:10.720
When we get frazzled,
how do you pull out?

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.066
I think it's practice.

00:56:12.066 --> 00:56:13.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:14.530
SPEAKER 1: Unfortunately, we've
come to the end of our hour

00:56:14.530 --> 00:56:14.720
now.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.270
But Ruby and Peter,
thank you so--

00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.860
RUBY WAX: Thank you.

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:19.193
SPEAKER 1: --so much for
coming today and talking to us.

00:56:19.193 --> 00:56:19.834
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:19.834 --> 00:56:20.750
PETER READ: Thank you.

00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:22.600
RUBY WAX: Thank you.
