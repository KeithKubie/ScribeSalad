hi my name is Lorna growler Dell and I
 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.130
hi my name is Lorna growler Dell and I
was wondering what advice would you give

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140
was wondering what advice would you give
 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.050
was wondering what advice would you give
young scientists and students that are

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060
young scientists and students that are
 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.780
young scientists and students that are
thinking about research how to figure

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790
thinking about research how to figure
 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.690
thinking about research how to figure
out what areas to do research in or what

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700
out what areas to do research in or what
 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.540
out what areas to do research in or what
if I just yeah you our heart is very shy

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550
if I just yeah you our heart is very shy
 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.519
if I just yeah you our heart is very shy
so the subject of research is very

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529
so the subject of research is very
 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.009
so the subject of research is very
important you have is important to go in

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019
important you have is important to go in
 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.080
important you have is important to go in
a direction well armed anything to do

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090
a direction well armed anything to do
 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.790
a direction well armed anything to do
and I think you ought to hit articles to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800
and I think you ought to hit articles to
 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.540
and I think you ought to hit articles to
read books and also a direct contact

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550
read books and also a direct contact
 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.310
read books and also a direct contact
with the research is also important so

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
with the research is also important so
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.260
with the research is also important so
what is very important for young

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270
what is very important for young
 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.560
what is very important for young
students is internships in laboratory

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
students is internships in laboratory
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.110
students is internships in laboratory
with many discussion with researchers

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
with many discussion with researchers
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.900
with many discussion with researchers
and what we are to avoid is the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910
and what we are to avoid is the
 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.270
and what we are to avoid is the
direction in which most of the results

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280
direction in which most of the results
 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.330
direction in which most of the results
have been already obtained you have to

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340
have been already obtained you have to
 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.970
have been already obtained you have to
to find direction where there is many

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980
to find direction where there is many
 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.850
to find direction where there is many
thing to explore
