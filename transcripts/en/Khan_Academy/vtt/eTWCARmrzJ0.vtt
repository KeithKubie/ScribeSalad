00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.770
Let's give ourselves a
little bit more practice

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.290
with logarithms.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.880
So just as a little bit of
review, let's evaluate log base

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.600
2 of 8.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.740
What does this evaluate to?

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.020
Well, it's asking us
or it will evaluate

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.800
to the power or
the exponent that I

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.360
have to raise our base to,
that I have to raise 2 to,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.450
to get to 8.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.810
So 2 to the first power is 2.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.080
2 to the second power is 4.

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.580
2 to the third power is 8.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.430
So this right over here
is going to be equal to 3.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.060
Fair enough.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.640
We did examples like
that in the last video.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.681
Let's do something a little
bit more interesting.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.940
And I'll color-code it.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:51.240
What is log base 8 of 2?

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.460
Now, this is interesting.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.680
I'll give you a few
seconds to think about it.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.380
Well, we're asking ourselves,
or this will evaluate to,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.940
the exponent that I have
to raise 8 to to get to 2.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.140
So let's think about
that in another way.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.540
So we could say 8 to some
power-- and that exponent

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.290
that I'm raising 8 to
is essentially what

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.100
this logarithm
would evaluate to.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.870
8 to some power is
going to be equal to 2.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.470
Well, if 2 to the third power
is 8, 8 to the one-third power

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.030
is equal to 2.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.890
So x is equal to 1/3.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:35.480
8 to the one-third
power is equal to 2,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.760
or you could say the
cube root of 8 is 2.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.610
So in this case, x is 1/3.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:47.260
This logarithm right over
here will evaluate to 1/3.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.980
Fascinating.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.080
Let's mix it up a
little bit more.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.190
Let's say we had the log base 2.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.590
Instead of 8, let's put
a 1/8 right over here.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.270
So I'll give you a few
seconds to think about that.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.850
Well, it's asking us, or
this will evaluate to,

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.610
the exponent that I have to
raise 2 to to get to 1/8.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.940
So if we said that
this is equal to x,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:21.500
we're essentially saying 2 to
the x power is equal to 1/8.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.270
Well, we know 2 to the third
power-- let me write this down.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.470
We already know that 2 to the
third power is equal to 8.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.150
If we want to get to 1/8,
which is the reciprocal of 8,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.580
we just have to raise 2
to the negative 3 power.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.500
2 to the negative
3 power is 1 over 2

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.500
to the third power, which
is the same thing as 1/8.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.885
So if we're asking
ourselves, what exponent

00:02:48.885 --> 00:02:51.390
do we have to raise
2 to to get to 1/8?

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.660
Well, we have to raise it
to the negative 3 power.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.820
So x is equal to negative 3.

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.910
This logarithm
evaluates to negative 3.

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.580
Now let's really,
really mix it up.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:18.160
What would be the
log base 8 of 1/2?

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.910
What does this evaluate to?

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.710
Let me clean this up so that we
have some space to work with.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.075
So as always, we're saying, what
power do I have to raise 8 to

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.560
to get to 1/2?

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.720
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.970
We already know that 8 to the
one-third power is equal to 2.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.080
If we want the reciprocal
of 2 right over here,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.570
we have to just raise 8
to the negative one-third.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.840
So let me write that down.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.460
8 to the negative
one-third power

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.546
is going to be equal to 1
over 8 to the one-third power.

00:03:56.546 --> 00:03:58.170
And we already know
the cube root of 8,

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.100
or 8 to the one-third
power, is equal to 2.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.310
This is equal to 1/2.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.800
So the log base 8 of 1/2 is
equal to-- well, what power

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.770
do I have to raise 8 to to
get to 1/2-- is negative 1/3.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.510
Equal to negative 1/3.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.110
I hope you enjoyed
that as much as I did.
