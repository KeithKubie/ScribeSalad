00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress,
in Washington, DC.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:14.390
[ Silence ]

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:20.810 position:58%
&gt;&gt; I'd like to go ahead and introduce
our presenters this afternoon:

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.580 position:59%
Robin Butterhof is a Digital
Conversions Specialist, in the Serials

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.580 position:56%
and Government Publications
Division of the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.460
She primarily works on the
National Digital Newspaper Program,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.180 position:66%
and its website Chronicling America, which
provides free public access to millions

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.140
of digitized historic US
newspaper pages from 1836 to 1922.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.690
And, Tom Bober serves as
the Library of Congress,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.790
2015-2016 Teacher in Residence
for Audio-Visual Materials.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.830 position:56%
A Librarian at RM Captain Elementary
School in Clayton, Missouri.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:05.740 position:66%
Thomas used a variety of primary sources
from the Library of Congress on historical

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.360
and scientific topics to help
students construct knowledge.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.050
Thanks to both of you for joining.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.900
Take it away.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.440
&gt;&gt; Great. Thanks for that
fantastic introduction, Mike.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.120 position:75%
Just to put names to our faces, my name is Robin
Butterhof, and I work on Chronicling America,

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.560 position:61%
that huge collection of digitized
papers that Mike was telling you about.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.460 position:67%
My co-presenter is the fantastic Tom Bober.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.430 position:64%
He's the Teacher in Residence here at LC.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.650
So, what is Chronicling America?

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.220 position:72%
Chronicling America is a website that provides
free public access to over 10 million pages

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.920 position:69%
of historic US newspapers from 1836 to 1922.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.710
So, in 1923 is when copyrights
start to get a little complicated.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.140 position:70%
That's why our particular site stops at 1922.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.600 position:73%
Too many topics that you'd be interested in for
this period like: The Titanic, or World War I,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.180 position:69%
or the Roller Skating Craze of the 19 teens.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.960 position:73%
Feel free to toss that over into the chat, and
we'll try and talk about it during the session,

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.530
just so you hear about what's
interesting to you.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.690 position:56%
So, the easiest way to get into the
Chronicling America database is just

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.020
to do a simple cure search.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.420 position:61%
As you can see here is I typed in the
word "prohibition", and this is the set

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.420
of search results that popped up.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.470
So, one thing to keep in mind
with historic newspapers is

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.710 position:75%
that you're typically doing key-word searches on
Optical Character Recognition Text, or OCR Text.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.530 position:69%
For those of you who are not very familiar
with OCR, a computer looks at the page image

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.290
and tries to guess at what words
of letters are on the page.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.640 position:58%
It's really good for printed letters.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.820 position:72%
It's not very good for handwritten letters,
or really tiny letters, or scribbling letters.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.780 position:69%
So, if you can't-- it might not pull up
every instance of your key-word on the page.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.070
Now, Tom is going to tell you
about a different way to get

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.820 position:63%
into the Chronicling America newspapers.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.140 position:63%
&gt;&gt; Yes, another way to search is through
"Special Topics" in Chronicling America.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.430 position:59%
Special Topics has over 250
different topics in general categories

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.490 position:69%
from Crimes and Trials to Natural Disasters.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.220 position:58%
From Politics to Sports, Science,
and War, and literally hundreds more.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.390 position:73%
If you notice the screen shot on the right
shows what one of those topics page looks like.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.550 position:73%
The important dates can help with searching,
as well as provide some background information.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.260 position:56%
Suggested search strategies will
give you search terms and other tips

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.720
to conducting your own searches
on specific topics.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.110 position:69%
And, towards the bottom, sample articles are
a good entry point, but not at all the whole

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.240
of what Chronicling America has
to offer on a specific topic.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.870
Well, not in this example.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.340 position:66%
Some topics also contain a special section
of background information on the event,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.810
or in the time period that the
topic's page is focused on.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.570 position:72%
This can be helpful when students are using
Chronicling America to begin exploring a topic

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.830 position:61%
that maybe they know very little about.

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.810
&gt;&gt; So, what's behind the website?

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.020 position:61%
Chronicling America is a product of
the National Digital Newspaper Program.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.240 position:72%
A joint effort by the Library of Congress, and
the National Endowment for the Communities,

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.910 position:64%
and their fantastic local State partners.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.740 position:61%
The States in green are our States that
currently participate in the program.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.780 position:59%
States in gray have not yet applied
for, or received a grant from any Age.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.210 position:63%
Personally I'm from New Jerseyan myself,

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.560
so I'd love to see those States
in gray join the program.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.080 position:75%
And, I'm really glad to hear that some of you
are interested in Suffrage, so I'm going to talk

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.570 position:69%
about that a bit later, and I'll address the
African-American Newspapers question later

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:52.470
in the QA, too.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.280
I have a really long digression
on that one for you guys.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.540 position:72%
So, just to give a quick recap, there are
over 10 million pages that have been digitized

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.040 position:70%
from 40 States and Territories, that includes
Puerto Rico, and this includes content

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.740
in a number of different languages:
French, Italian, German, Spanish,

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.320 position:75%
and we actually have some Finnish in there, too.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.800 position:69%
So, that's enough about Chronicling America.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.970
Let's see we can use some of those
10 million pages in the classroom.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.430 position:73%
This particular add is part of a primary source
set created by the Library of Teaching Team.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.250 position:59%
But, this stuff is really easy to find
by searching for the word "Suffrage".

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.810 position:63%
So, just sort of think about this in the
classroom, let me just to provide this

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:39.460 position:59%
at students, and just observe; what
are some things that you notice first?

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.580
And if you guys want to type in
some responses into the chat,

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.930
that would be a great way to
sort of get things started.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.550
For me, my favorite quote is "Who
would go if women suffrage came"?

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:50.670
Not the mothers.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.540 position:61%
They're too busy to engage in politics.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.520 position:69%
So after you've sort of had some initial
observations going, you might start to delve

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.500 position:56%
into some observing and reflecting,
like who created this particular ad?

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.480
Why did they create it?

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.550 position:58%
Who is sort of the audience for this?

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.410 position:69%
And, I think you can see down at the bottom,

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.190
this Oklahoma Association
opposed to Women Suffrage.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:19.070 position:64%
I was really curious so I just googled
it to see what I could find, if anything,

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.700 position:70%
and happily enough, the Oklahoma Historical
Society had a great article about this group,

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.590 position:61%
and I'm not going to completely digress
into the article, and about this group.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.680 position:70%
But, they're mostly campaigning against the
Suffrage Movement and the Suffrage Amendment,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.880 position:61%
as you can see from this particular ad.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.030 position:63%
And it is relevant that it's an ad, too.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.030
That's really interesting type
of content in the newspapers.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.940
I think it really provides
a different perspective,

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.510
and it really makes your
students start to think about;

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:51.630
why someone paid money to
put their message out there.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:55.980
So, sort of briefing beyond that,
let's look at some of the "when

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.980 position:66%
and where" this particular ad was created,
as you can see, your newspaper is great

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.180 position:56%
for these kinds of analysis, and the
time and location are usually right

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.990
at the top, there, if you can see.

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:14.070 position:67%
It's the Tulsa Daily World; Oklahoma--
Tulsa, Oklahoma, and then November 3, 1918.

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.370 position:56%
This is up in the folio if you want
to get all newspaper nerdy about it.

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.250
And it's great for your students
who are on the same page, as well.

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:27.150
So let's move beyond just
observing things and start thinking

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:29.960 position:58%
about what this time and place means.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.430 position:67%
So, what else is going on in November 1918?

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:39.580 position:70%
So, from this particular page and article, by
just opening up my search to November, 1918,

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:44.580 position:63%
and searching for the word "Suffrage", I
didn't run into Oklahoma, but actually,

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.610
an Oklahoma newspaper is one of
the first things that popped up.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.920 position:59%
And, you can see that Wilber 1 is
coming to a close here, quite clearly;

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:54.620 position:59%
that "Germany is Licked to a Frazzle".

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.240
Love that headline, and I think one
of my favorite quotes from the ad

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.760 position:59%
down at the bottom right-- I think a
little too small for you to read here,

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.990 position:73%
but my favorite quote is: "Women were too busy
with Red Cross work, and other work took place,

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:12.510 position:67%
to devote much time to the Suffrage cause".

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:18.660 position:66%
I think it's a really good exhibition that
doesn't often occur in history textbooks.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.240 position:69%
You'll sort of have the chapter on Suffrage;
the chapter on sort of history progressing.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.590
But this really pulls it all
together into the same page,

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:30.370
and it really provides a rich
context for the students.

00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:36.060 position:67%
So, the "observe with respect" questions on
the last couple of slides where is inspired

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.840
by The Teachers' Guides start
analyzing newspapers.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:43.740 position:67%
This guide is up on the Library of Congress
Teachers' Site, and is a great way to build

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:50.150 position:70%
out an article-- build out a lesson on an
article that you're particularly inspired by.

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:56.360 position:73%
I'd also really recommend the ones on political
cartoons if that's what strikes your fancy,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.560 position:67%
because they're a lot of questions about
visual literacy that are much more relevant

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.690 position:66%
than a political cartoon sort on analysis.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:12.780 position:73%
So, we we're open that this backed up, and see;
what are some of the benefits that you find

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.760
from using these papers in the
classroom, or what are some ways

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.740
that you would use newspapers
in an instructional setting?

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:23.290
Let me hand this over to Tom to
sort of lead off this conversation.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.260
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Robin.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.120 position:75%
So, like Robin said, we'd love for you to put
down into the chat box some ways that you think,

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.870 position:56%
and beyond the topics, how you might
use newspapers in the classroom,

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.020
or some ideas that maybe
you've had about using them.

00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:41.170 position:72%
We're going to talk more specifics about those
later, and while you're actually doing this,

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:44.970 position:61%
I thought I might just go over some
general ideas of ways you can use them,

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:49.280
along with some specifics that I've
used with students over the years.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:58.690 position:69%
So, one way to use Chronicling America is
to take an idea from another primary source,

00:09:58.690 --> 00:10:02.950 position:67%
and use Chronicling America to go in depth.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:07.400
&gt;&gt;There are a multitude of
resources on one specific topic.

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:11.860 position:73%
There could literally be hundreds of
articles, and so you will find an area of depth

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.450 position:72%
within Chronicling America that in many cases,

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.730
you won't find anywhere else
in the Library's collection.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:24.260 position:66%
I love what Jacob said, too; another great
way to demonstrate opposing viewpoints.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.110 position:67%
There's definitely going to be different
ideas; different perspectives when you have

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:32.800 position:59%
that many resources out there, and
that's another great thing to look at.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:38.060 position:61%
For example, my students who were doing
some research on the Statue of Liberty,

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:43.760 position:75%
and looking at the time when it was built, were
reading about people who were vehemently opposed

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:49.990 position:69%
to building the Statue, thinking that it was
anti-religious to build a statue that large,

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:53.800 position:63%
and that grand that represented liberty.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:01.920 position:72%
Also, it allows ways to see changes in
reaction over time; same with that same topic,

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.830 position:61%
there are great articles in Chronicling
America about how upset people were,

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:11.610 position:67%
as the Statue of Liberty began to change in
color from what we think is a copper color,

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:16.650
to that tinted green copper that
we see when we look at it today.

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:20.430
Advertising and news stories
can show what people value.

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:21.990
How much do things cost?

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:24.740
You compare this with a historic
currency calculator,

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:28.520
and that can provide even more
understanding about information.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.790 position:56%
It's also important to look at whose
side was represented in the story.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:38.070 position:56%
But, whose side was not reported on?

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:42.580 position:73%
We've also looked at smaller inquiries such as;

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:47.740 position:69%
the question came up about whether the
children were really sent through the mail--

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.200
based on some stories that
were read out of our library.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.820
And they've looked at huge
topics such as; World War I.

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.830 position:58%
Although, of course, they wanted to
look at the search upon the Great War

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:02.880
in Chronicling America, and with
so much information in there,

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.330
it was overwhelming unless
you modify your searches.

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.150
We'll take a look and talk
more about that later.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:15.120 position:63%
Robin, I'm going to hand it back to you.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:20.070
&gt;&gt; Great. Thanks, Tom.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.460 position:56%
Oh, my goodness, and there's so much
good stuff going on in the chat.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.450
They're definitely going to
get to that in the Q and A. So,

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:31.030 position:64%
I wanted to talk about another reason why
newspapers are a particularly great kind

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:35.470 position:59%
of primary source, and that reason is:
because they're short; they're brief;

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:40.810 position:66%
the content is super short and accessible,
particularly in terms of vocabulary.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:43.920 position:56%
This makes for a really easy
pairing of other newspaper articles,

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.690
or other types of primary sources.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:50.190 position:59%
As you can see right here, there is a
great image from a Philadelphia paper.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:54.880
The image up at the top, this
is a Montana Suffrage paper

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.650
that was published during
the Montana State Fair.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.090 position:63%
I think there are only four issues of
it, and each issue was a fantastic way--

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:05.780
the energy was just so great
in that particular newspaper.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.870 position:73%
And then, at the bottom, we have this newspaper
from Florida, with the representatives talking

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:15.680 position:56%
about how sensitive adversity is
really growing in favor of Suffrage,

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:20.060 position:75%
and it's just really interesting to sort of put
all these things together, and have these things

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.720 position:66%
to read and work with them fairly quickly.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:28.380 position:61%
News clippers are also really great
for another reason, and that reason is;

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.840 position:67%
multiple perspective, which I think someone
was talking about in the chat, actually,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:37.300 position:56%
as you can see here, is that article
from the Oklahoma paper, before.

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:43.470 position:75%
Then we have this great image off to the left
about a headquarters for the Association opposed

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:47.740 position:64%
to Women's Suffrage over in Pennsylvania.

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.680 position:73%
And so this is actually from the same newspaper
paper of the image on the overhead slide.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.040
So, just on the same newspaper page
you'll see opposing viewpoints.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:04.300 position:69%
This makes for some really easy caparisoning
contrast options for your students.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.960
So, the breath of Chronicling
America is also really great

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.680 position:64%
because it makes a local option possible.

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:18.220 position:72%
If you just want to look at the Suffrage fight
in Montana, you can just focus on Montana.

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.670
We have plenty in there.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:26.360 position:75%
I do actually love Montana for Suffrage, all
things considered, and it really brings it home,

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.210
the local aspect for your students.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:32.910 position:61%
You're just not reading about
something big happening in Great Falls;

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.210 position:69%
you're reading about all across the country.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:40.250
Newspapers are also really
great for digging deeper.

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:44.530
This is another item from the
primary source set on Suffrage,

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:47.040 position:61%
and how it's a great option on its own.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:51.010
You can see things about the
information of the image.

00:14:51.010 --> 00:14:56.420
You can tell that it was
captured on May 4th, 1912.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.260
You can see it's a Suffrage
parade in New York City,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:02.550
but you don't get a ton of
information beyond that.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.590 position:66%
So, let's say you take this image, and
after the students have sort of looked at,

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:10.380 position:58%
and explored it, pair it with the New
York Tribune from the Hall on Monday.

00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:13.360
You can see here, there's a
ton of coverage of the parade.

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.860
You've got these great cartoons off
the left, this article on the right

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:24.080 position:64%
about this humanizing effect of Suffrage,
how the parade impressed many Senators,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.280 position:61%
and it's just a really great way to you
can be billed out on a particular image

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.600
that you're inspired by, as well.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.530 position:61%
So, we talked about all the reasons why
newspapers-- well, not all of them--

00:15:38.530 --> 00:15:40.650 position:66%
I could come up with reasons all day long.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:45.820 position:66%
There are a couple of reasons why
newspapers can be tricky in the classroom.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.470
Some of the reasons they can
be tricky is insert language.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:55.900 position:75%
As you can see in this example: Airplanes were
once called "Aeroplanes", and as Tom was talking

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.750 position:58%
about earlier; it was called the
"Great War", rather than World War I.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:04.470
We can figure if students went
searching for the word "Airplane",

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:06.760 position:56%
they wouldn't necessarily find much.

00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:10.660 position:59%
In addition to your unfamiliar signs
or terms, there can often be difficult

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:13.520 position:69%
or fun-fist language in the newspapers, and,

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:19.890
Tom is going to talk a bit more
about both of these things.

00:16:19.890 --> 00:16:25.420 position:73%
&gt;&gt; So, one thing that students should be doing
when reading newspaper articles is always to be

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:28.130 position:58%
on the lookout for historic language.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.410
It will likely not be as obvious
as the newspaper headline, here,

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:37.550 position:61%
which I happened to run across this one
searching "Aeroplane", and " Airplane".

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:43.200 position:72%
The terms we are familiar with today often
accompany terms that have fallen out of favor.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:50.170 position:72%
As example; on reading two articles on
automobiles, I also found the following terms:

00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:56.360 position:72%
Horseless Carriage, Electric Carriage,
Electric Motor Buggy, Motor Wagon, Road Wagon,

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.610 position:58%
Automobile, Auto-car, and Moto cycle.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:07.320 position:67%
That gives me many, many more searches
that I can try, and continue to dig deeper.

00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.810
The danger is not not running
into the information in my mind

00:17:10.810 --> 00:17:16.030 position:66%
when my students are searching; the danger
is not finding that one additional article

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:20.280
that will be a great resource
for them and their learning.

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.690 position:66%
Remember that Recommended Topics and,
Sherry, thank you for that recommendation,

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.630
and Chronicling America, also
contain search terms and tips,

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:34.430 position:75%
that they themselves, are not an exhausted list.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:38.920 position:59%
Students are also likely to run across
unfamiliar words and phrases found

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:45.010 position:75%
in Chronicling America, and they can be searched
right within Chronicling America, itself.

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:49.490 position:56%
Context clues within the article
can often provide great information.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:56.410 position:67%
And, of course, students can do web
searches also to help find that definition.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:59.790
But, when they do find definitions,
check to make sure

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.770
that the definitions are from
that specific time period.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:10.660 position:63%
Because often we have words, excuse me--
that have changing meanings over time.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:16.090 position:66%
Offensive language in sensitive topics are
definitely present in the 10 million pages

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:20.640 position:63%
of Chronicling America, and while you
have some control over what students see

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.160
if you're selecting the articles,
if students are searching,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.850
or if the topic you are searching
lends itself to offensive language,

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:32.710 position:75%
I would really recommend the two blog posts from
the Teaching with the Library of Congress blog,

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.380
that can help you address
these issues with students.

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:41.580 position:73%
Those two blog posts are linked there, and as
Mike mentioned earlier, those will be available

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.110 position:56%
in the archive of the post, as well.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.480 position:61%
&gt;&gt; So, we should present also "tricky",
because it can be really difficult

00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.210 position:56%
to find the really juicy stuff, like
political cartoons or photographs.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:19:00.440 position:66%
So, as I explained earlier, the key-words
here, are the OCR text, and as you can see

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:05.210 position:75%
in this example, political cartoon on the right.

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:10.700 position:59%
You can see that these two fellows are
claiming their summer vacation based

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:15.190 position:69%
on what counties were still serving alcohol,

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:18.210
and which parts of the country were
not serving alcohol at that point,

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:22.380 position:72%
so that's in the dry counties, and you can
see his comment down here; it's all on account

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:26.690 position:64%
of being here, suffragettes, and if you
were searching for the words suffragette,

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:33.100 position:75%
this particular political cartoon wouldn't come
up, because it is sort of a form of a word that,

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:37.000 position:58%
you know, not the proper spelling,
and that's a little handwritten text,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.060
so that the OCR is probably
not going to pick up his word,

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.060 position:72%
and bring it up if you search for suffragette.

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.880 position:59%
So, instead, I found this article
when I was sort of browsing around it,

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.240 position:67%
and I just see to my personal tumbler, see
it because there's so much good stuff going

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.030
on here; you've got prohibition,
and you've got the suffragettes,

00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:00.040
I just knew I would want
to use it at some point.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.570
&gt;&gt; And you may use it on an
interest board or something else.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.040 position:58%
But you see a couple of political
interest boards with stuff like this.

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:12.020
So, it can also be really
hard to find photographs.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:14.480 position:67%
Has anyone ever heard of Dazzle Camouflage?

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.660
It's a kind of camouflage that
came around during World War I,

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.670
to make it difficult to accurately
target a ship.

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:25.340 position:70%
It's really fun to read about, I have to say.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:30.190
And, when I went hunting for dazzle
ships in Chronicling America,

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:34.350 position:70%
searching for the word "dazzle" brought up a
ton of dazzling things, which were not trips,

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:39.330 position:67%
and it didn't bring up as much as I was
thinking would come up, and then I realized

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:43.890 position:58%
when it brought up words with "dazzle
ship" included the word "camouflage".

00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:46.890 position:73%
So, then I started searching all the terms
with camouflage to see if I could get something

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:51.300
to pop up, and as you can see
from this particular image,

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:56.000 position:72%
the caption doesn't include the word "dazzle
ship", it just includes the word "camouflage".

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.320
And, it's really easy to run
into this problem with images.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:05.690 position:69%
They may have no caption at all, or a
really short caption, a handwritten caption.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:12.910 position:69%
So, you really have to be curious when
going through a refined search if you've got

00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:14.960
to pursue images of certain things.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:19.430 position:56%
And Tom is going to talk a little
bit more about both of these topics.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.830
&gt;&gt; So, that search for work
camouflage is going to result

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.480 position:64%
in several images that maybe interesting.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:30.250 position:56%
And so what I like to do when I'm
looking at search results like this,

00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.450 position:63%
is to actually search the visual images.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:37.600 position:66%
Look for those images that catch the eye;
that make you want to investigate further,

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:42.250 position:58%
and then look carefully at the
captions that accompany those images.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.380
Those are going to result,
hopefully, in new search terms.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:52.760 position:69%
Also, I like to look for repeated images,
reading multiple captions of that same image

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:57.800 position:56%
from different newspapers, can yield
more information about that moment.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.720
So, if you look at my first two
search results in the top row,

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:04.730
you'll notice that "dazzle
ship", that Robin shared with us,

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:10.280 position:67%
is found in both of those newspapers, and
actually has two different captions, there.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.180 position:56%
One other thing that Robin mentioned
is the difficulty in looking

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.950 position:63%
and finding information within cartoons.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:26.780 position:72%
Now, some of these cartoons may be searchable,
depending on the clarity of the printed word

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:32.090 position:73%
within them, and their ability to be recognized
by the softwares that they're digitized with.

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:37.000 position:72%
You might want to search with the newspapers
where you've already found a political cartoon

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.140 position:66%
that you like, or that you found engaging.

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:43.980 position:58%
Like Robin mentioned; when you
stumble across those, put them aside.

00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.010 position:59%
You may be using them not immediately,

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:49.230
but maybe later in the year, or
in the following school year.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:55.380 position:73%
And with so many engaging stories on each page,
save links to those pages that contain stories

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.510 position:66%
that you can incorporate, or that maybe
colleagues can incorporate in other units.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:07.920 position:70%
It's also a wonderful way to show the complex
interconnected events of a time period.

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:16.490 position:67%
Now, let's stay with that topic with the
event of the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake,

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:21.750 position:67%
that we saw mentioned in that last cartoon,
to demonstrate another tricky situation.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:24.370
Large numbers of search result.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:30.930 position:66%
Here, a simple search of the San Francisco
Earthquake yields almost 8,000 results.

00:23:30.930 --> 00:23:35.520 position:72%
That's not close to the over 1 million results
for Robin's prohibition search earlier,

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.620
but it's still too many for
me or my students to manage.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:46.570 position:64%
Working with the advanced search can help
narrow results, refining the dates of;

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:50.760
when you want to view the
cultural impact of an event.

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.540
Refining your own ideas of
the specificity of the event.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:59.990 position:70%
Both of those things can be helpful, although
it may require you to make multiple searches

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:04.350
with different specific focuses
within the event, itself.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:08.550 position:66%
You might want to think; do you want to
see newspapers only from a specific State?

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.270
Or, even a specific newspaper.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:15.500
You might want to look at how ideas
manifested in a certain region,

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:21.810 position:66%
or within how they manifested over time
within one region, or State, or newspaper.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:28.340 position:73%
And don't forget, also, that there's a checkbox
where you can only look at the front page

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.200
of a newspaper if you just
want to see those headlines.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:37.900
When looking at the search results,
look at the highlighted text.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:42.760 position:58%
Does the amount of highlighted text
show you how much a story is covered?

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.830
Can you tell if the search
terms are part of a headline?

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.540
Part of an advertisement?

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:50.060 position:66%
Maybe they show up about multiple stories.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.580
If you can, read the headlines.

00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:57.150
Look at dates of publication, as
well as location of publication,

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:01.770
and you may see patterns, or
repeated images for stories

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:05.440 position:64%
that were printed in multiple newspapers.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:09.510
&gt;&gt; Okay. Great, Tom.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:15.000 position:73%
So, what happens if you're really excited about
all these things, but you're not really sure

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.290 position:70%
where to start, or if you run into a problem;

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.930
I'd really recommend using
our "Ask-a-Librarian" feature.

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:30.170 position:75%
This sends a question to our reference veterans,
and they're happy to help get you started

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.700
or find resources that you
didn't even know existed.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.020
We've all seen these questions
coming from teachers

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.180 position:69%
that are always really good and interesting.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:46.510 position:72%
Another helpful thing might be the Recommended
Topics page that Tom was talking about.

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:49.870 position:72%
There's some great ones, like, I think someone
was interested in the early history of radio,

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:54.360 position:61%
some Marconi, and of related, I think
some people were talking about science,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.110
Nicholas Heffler's a fun one,
the invention of the telephone.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:00.380 position:72%
There's some really fun ones like electricity,

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:04.590 position:63%
and how electricity is spread throughout
the country, and all the things

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:08.560
that weren't electrified
before being electrified now.

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.120 position:59%
Great ads on that one, by the way, and
I'll show you one of those at the end.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.940 position:59%
We used to get a ton of questions
from National Day History Students via

00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:22.570 position:73%
"Ask-a-Librarian" service, and we can usually
direct them to an already existing topics page.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:25.880 position:59%
Of course, if we don't have them, we
help out with your specific questions.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:32.250 position:69%
But, it's really surprising how many topics
we've already addressed through these pages.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:37.620 position:69%
Another great page is the Teachers Site,
without Analyzing Newspapers Teachers Guide,

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.270 position:73%
we were talking about earlier, and the Teaching
Blog; with those blog posts about dealing

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:45.220 position:67%
with difficult subjects in primary sources.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:49.110 position:73%
I love those, and it's actually a two-part set.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:52.680
The first one was written, and
then so many people responded.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.890
There's a part of that blog post
on their response to dealing

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.740 position:64%
with difficult subjects in the classroom.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:04.650
This is just sort of a quick
sum-up link of all of those sites,

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.200 position:64%
and then there's some specific things
that you might be interested in, as well.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:14.220 position:56%
On the primary source sets, I
collect the set on Women's Suffrage.

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:20.050 position:59%
These are all different primary source
sets, and what the plans include

00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:21.930 position:59%
from content from Chronicling America.

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:25.580 position:58%
The Spanish-American War is fantastic
to look at, via the newspapers,

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:32.560 position:72%
and those blogs that I was talking about
earlier, with dealing with difficult subjects.

00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:36.320 position:66%
The "Twelve Years a Slave" is a great one.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:44.260 position:70%
I love those blog posts, and I'm just going
to stop here on a side of all different kinds

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:48.480
of Chronicling America, so my
days of things that I've seen.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:55.940 position:75%
Up at the top we have the simple word beginning,
Teddy Roosevelt, forming the Bull Moose Party,

00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:02.190 position:66%
the Titanic sinking, there's a lot of
panic about Hayley's Comet coming so close

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:07.030 position:72%
to the earth, and the atmosphere incinerating,
and all sorts of other dire things happening.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:13.050 position:69%
Lots of sports history, and as I was talking
about earlier, the electric revelation,

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:18.210 position:73%
sort of electricity spreading throughout the
United States, and the electric car, over here.

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:23.820 position:73%
So, I can see there are a ton of questions in
the chat, and I'll just get started with those.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:31.510 position:75%
So, Mike has collected a bunch of fantastic
ones for us, and the first one I will address is

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:37.770 position:69%
from Vanessa Palmer, and: Do you have access
to American owned and operated newspapers?

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:42.520 position:56%
So, yes. We do actually have a
bunch of African-American newspapers

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.550 position:56%
in the Chronicling America database.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:50.530 position:63%
I'd recommend going to the Algebratized
newspapers Chat, which I would show you,

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:54.460
but I can't go to the live-type
via this, with our software, there.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:59.370 position:72%
And, once you're there, click on "Algebratized
Newspapers", and there should be a sort

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:03.670 position:64%
for African-American newspapers, and then
we just actually added a great newspaper

00:29:03.670 --> 00:29:06.640
by Frederick Douglas for
the reconstruction period,

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.750
which I worked on a lot,
and really, really loved.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:15.270 position:75%
And, so that is a fantastic resource to look at.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:19.890 position:64%
And actually, so, I'll read the question,
and then pass this one over to Tom.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:21.490
This is from Shaquilla.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:26.400 position:73%
[Phonetic] What are appropriate topics to teach
to elementary-aged students, using newspapers?

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.810
Do we use current newspapers?

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.230
Tom?

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:33.920
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Robin.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.880
So, I am normally an Elementary
School Librarian, and so, really,

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:46.070 position:69%
the only limits that you really have, as far
as topics are concerned, is your curriculum.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:51.820 position:69%
When I am working with classroom teachers,
and working on incorporating primary sources

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:58.830 position:73%
in a classroom, Chronicling America often comes
up, and as a resource, and finding topics,

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:04.060 position:70%
or if a topic fits with what Chronicling
America has to offer, it's going to be great.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.510
&gt;&gt; No holds barred.

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:09.110
I will say that we have run into
some issues, so, for example;

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:14.730 position:67%
I was trying to find the earliest reference
I could find in Chronicling America

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:18.700 position:58%
to Paul Bunion, because we were
going to be looking at, "Tall Tales",

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.920 position:70%
and that particular story that was printed in
the newspaper, while extremely interesting,

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.970 position:59%
had offensive language that the
teachers and I were not willing to use

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:32.470 position:58%
with that particular age of students.

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:36.330 position:66%
If the students were a little bit older,
we probably would have incorporated it in,

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:42.030 position:64%
and talked about that offensive language,
and how we deal with it as historians.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:45.360 position:56%
But, given the background that
those students had, we chose not to.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.450 position:58%
The other thing that you want to take

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:51.960 position:58%
into consideration is simply how
much text you're giving them, and so,

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:57.770 position:67%
Robin did mention that these
particular-- often, the articles are short.

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:01.820
You will sometimes find articles
that are literally a page long.

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:04.810
They're quite hefty, and so
you want to steer maybe away

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.820 position:64%
from those with certain ages of students.

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.690 position:61%
But, what I've also done sometimes is
when the article, itself, is too hefty,

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:17.950 position:70%
we look at the illustrations, the photos, the
headlines, and those can be analyzed as well,

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:24.710
and are much more available, and
accessible to younger students.

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:25.540
And, Robin?

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:27.260
Do we have another question?

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.120
&gt;&gt; We do, indeed.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.120 position:56%
There's another very good one that--

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:32.620
&gt;&gt; Oh, sorry.

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:32.940
Go ahead.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:33.410
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:34.550
&gt;&gt; Sorry, Robin.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:35.460
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:40.170 position:58%
I'll tackle Art Riches question about
describing technological changes

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:43.630 position:64%
by decade, especially the uses of images.

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:47.630 position:56%
So, I'm not sure if you're referring
to general technological changes,

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:50.930 position:58%
or changes in misprinting technology.

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:55.720 position:73%
I would think a lot of people are surprised
when they start looking at the older newspapers

00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:01.250 position:67%
about what you find in terms of a headline,
or things that we sort of consider common

00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:04.050 position:63%
in newspapers, hadn't been invented yet.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:10.620 position:61%
When we the weather column, I think I
found the first national weather column

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:20.100 position:64%
when they started sending things back and
forth by telegram, and it was very cool.

00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:24.620 position:58%
So, the weather column was
invented, it wasn't really headlines,

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.520 position:70%
earlier in the day, it would be much smaller.

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.360 position:63%
So, if you're looking for a headline
about the Civil War, it's probably going

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.610
to be fairly restrained,
compared to what you would expect.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:40.920
The extra over here is about
as big as it will get.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.770 position:59%
But, there were other things that
they would use in newspapers, as well.

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:49.110 position:64%
They had something called "Morning bars".

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:53.730
So, outside of the column,
there would be a black border

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:58.270 position:67%
around any notification, or funeral notice.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:04.070 position:73%
So, if you look at the newspapers or on the
death of Lincoln, you'll see this black boarder

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:12.570 position:73%
around all the columns on the page, because
that was how they would tip away death notices.

00:33:12.570 --> 00:33:21.790 position:69%
So, a lot of things changed in newspapers,
and images really started to play a role in,

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:26.600
I want to say, after 1900,
there was some before then,

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:31.830
but that's when they really
started to get going.

00:33:31.830 --> 00:33:38.480 position:67%
And, newspapers around World War I would
have these fantastic border group sections.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:45.630 position:59%
So, they would just be for eight pages
of images from visual fun themes,

00:33:45.630 --> 00:33:49.820 position:67%
to other common things happening in the US.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:54.550 position:59%
So, there was a lot of other versions
in what a newspaper is over the period

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.940 position:63%
that you can see in Chronicling America.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.750
So, I'm not sure if that was quite
your question, but there is a lot

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:01.780 position:58%
on interesting stuff packed in there.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.190 position:75%
I'm going to give you over to Mike for a second.

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:11.170 position:72%
I think he said there was some more questions.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:18.010 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Let's reach out another one, will
Chronicling America ever add more recent papers?

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:24.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm assuming he means those, too.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:29.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, with copyright being
what it is, it's very complicated,

00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:34.620 position:64%
and these papers are an even more complex
object in that they're complications

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:39.810
of things pulled from, you know,
the Associated Press, you know,

00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:42.600
images from staff reporters, ads.

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:47.430 position:63%
Different people might own the different
copyright aspects of different parts

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:52.740 position:72%
of the papers, or like a cartoonist might have
kept the copyright to his particular things.

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.420
So, after when came 22 themes
did get complicated.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:04.020 position:59%
That said, there are kind of companies
like; New York Times, Washington Post,

00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:09.140 position:66%
that had digitized their archives, and are
up and available as subscription sources

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.840 position:61%
through your local public or academic
library that you might want to explore.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:19.870 position:56%
I know there are tons of things
happening in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s,

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:22.160 position:58%
and 80s, that people love to look at.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:30.060
That's why we're sticking
to 1922 with our database.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.220
&gt;&gt; So, here's another question, and
they're really pouring in, here.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:37.850
So, Jacob asks why there are tags
associated with all the papers,

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:43.430
or are we just searching the
papers for text, themselves?

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:48.090 position:58%
&gt;&gt; So, you've just been searching the
text with the newspapers, themselves,

00:35:48.090 --> 00:35:51.970
we don't really have tags like you
would see on Flicker or something.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.970
But, we do have pages that
we've pushed to Flicker.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:36:01.250 position:61%
We have pictures forwarded from LC now,
and I think you can tag those with tags

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.510
if you want to save certain things.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:12.510
[ Silence ]

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.890 position:61%
&gt;&gt; From Sarah, she asks: How easy items

00:36:14.890 --> 00:36:23.070
like music reviews could be
found in cataloged newspapers?

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:29.380 position:73%
&gt;&gt; One rule I can say this, and very good, this
is a really good thing if you want to research.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:33.720 position:56%
It depends on what kind of music
reviews you're looking for, but yes,

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:35.830 position:59%
music reviews are definitely in there.

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:41.420 position:70%
I think we have a page or two on, with the
recommended topics page on Sissieretta Jones,

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:45.710
which was a famous opera
singer, and there are a lot

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:49.530
of other very interesting bits
of musical history in there.

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:55.740
A lot of the premiers were in
Europe, for certain kinds of music,

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.750 position:66%
so it will be sort of secondary reporting.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:02.040
But, yes, there's a lot in
terms of music reviews.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:09.210
&gt;&gt; On the list, I'm giving them to
you in order they were received.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:14.330
But, Sherry asks: How the
recommended topics were chosen?

00:37:14.330 --> 00:37:17.770
Because she thinks the articles
are so well chosen.

00:37:17.770 --> 00:37:22.670 position:73%
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a pretty good reason for that.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:27.280
The recommended topics pages
are created by someone thinking

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:30.660 position:59%
that the recommended topics page needs
to exist here at the Library staff,

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:34.150 position:70%
so it's like if someone would be like-- oh,
I can't believe they don't have a topics page

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:37.820
on "X", and then they just
go and write a page on "X".

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:43.200 position:70%
So, the people who are really enthusiastic
about a topic, I really got excited about the

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:49.640 position:69%
"Pure Food and Drug Act", and which is a
great one as Halloween is around the corner.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:55.700 position:70%
But, pretty much Pure Food and Drug Act made
sure that, you know, cyanide wasn't in candy,

00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.640
and lots of other Food and
Health Safety Regulations

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:02.640 position:59%
that I really, really, really enjoyed.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:07.360 position:75%
I'd really recommend you reading it, because I
think it's a lot of fun, and it involves a story

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.710 position:56%
about a doctor and his poison squad.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:12.180 position:58%
So, it's always a great way to start.

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:20.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; From Jason: Does anybody have any
ideas how to incorporate newspapers

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.200
into physical education classroom?

00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:28.360 position:66%
&gt;&gt; I'm going to hand this one over to Tom.

00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:31.160
&gt;&gt; Oh, Robin.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:31.700
I'm chuckling.

00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.110
That is a tough one.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:37.810
I think the place where it might
be interesting would be to look

00:38:37.810 --> 00:38:42.570 position:59%
at kind of exercise crazes of the day.

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:46.930
I'm not really well-versed enough
to know what some of those may be.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.390
I'd probably have to go out
and do some searches,

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:51.640 position:72%
and some other people may be putting some in--

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:55.090
oh, health issues, definitely,
Dana, thank you for that.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.320
But, looking at; what were
the exercises of the day?

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:00.410
What were people doing for
physical activity of the day?

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:01.780
I think can be fascinating.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:06.310 position:58%
Because those things change, and they
morph, and they turn into new things.

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:07.990
&gt;&gt; I'm going to totally chime in.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:09.500
I like where you went with that.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:14.270 position:70%
Yes, there is this great ping pong creativity
of a recommended topics page on that.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:19.070 position:69%
We have one on the Villa Cruiser Craze,
which I mentioned, and there are some great,

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:24.180 position:67%
really interesting ideas about what
physical education was, and actually dance,

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:27.770
now that I'm thinking of
the Modern Dance Movement.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:36.270 position:73%
There's a particular dance word that's escaping
me, but there's a ton of great information

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:41.380
on dance; what suitable exercises
were for good posture,

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:45.360
and it might be very interesting
from that perspective.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:50.730 position:75%
You could do some of the physical exercises they
recommend, in these newspapers that would be on,

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:56.650 position:66%
okay, in most cases, but in some, it might
not be very healthy for you, thought.

00:39:56.650 --> 00:40:00.880 position:70%
&gt;&gt; I want to jump in on one thing, and add
just one more layer to this, that Rich, here,

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:07.040 position:61%
puts some information about the changes
in rules and purposes of sports.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:10.670 position:61%
&gt;&gt; There's some wonderful articles on,
about football, during that time period

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:15.910
because of how dangerous it was,
and partially because of the play,

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.290
and partially because of
the equipment and changes

00:40:18.290 --> 00:40:20.110 position:64%
that were put into place because of that.

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:26.000 position:63%
So, that time period is really ripe with
football, if you're interested in that.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:33.120 position:69%
And actually, next week on the teaching the
Library of Congress blog, are other teachers

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.070
and residence, Trace Smith is
going to be posting up some--

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:42.370 position:70%
putting up a blog post that will also contain
some resources from Chronicling America.

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:48.810
&gt;&gt; I read about Kellogg's
starting a new cereal company, too.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:55.640 position:72%
I read the history around that is fascinating,
and now you see a lot of great food ads

00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:00.500 position:64%
in Chronicling America's vault for
things that are still around today, from;

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:05.460
Wrigley's to varieties beer--
Wrigley's Gum to varieties of beer.

00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.120
So, there are some really,
really fascinating ones.

00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:14.370 position:59%
We, just in a blunt post, I think on
the main Alty Bolog page about coffee.

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:18.530 position:56%
Whiskey is also supposed to give a
cure if you're feeling summer tired,

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:22.560 position:73%
which we didn't know that being summer tired
would be a problem until we started finding ads

00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.450 position:56%
for this particular kind of Whiskey.

00:41:24.450 --> 00:41:29.780 position:73%
So, yeah. If you're interested in food history,
Chronicling America is one interesting place.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:38.960 position:73%
The history of pastas, actually, too; just
what's considered macaroni, how you cook pasta.

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.510
Yeah, we all love the food things
a lot in Chronicling America.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:46.470
[ Silence ]

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:49.520 position:64%
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead and jump in real
quick if I could, Mike, if that's okay,

00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:56.400 position:72%
and just address something coming up way early
in the chat window, and that was the idea

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.330
of anniversaries of special events.

00:41:59.330 --> 00:42:04.720 position:73%
Some people mentioned that they were interested
in looking at the American Revolution,

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:10.170 position:64%
for example, and with Chronicling
America, only covering 1836 through 1922,

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:14.960 position:69%
you're not going to get the actual events of
the American Revolution as primary sources.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:22.810 position:69%
But, what we can look at is how people from
1836 through 1922, viewed those individuals,

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:27.000
viewed those events, and how
those views changed over time.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.890
I've done a little bit of
research for a 5th grade teacher

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:35.160
who is doing some work specifically
with that, with her students,

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:42.680 position:67%
and looking at George Washington, and how
he was viewed, and how he was essentially--

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:49.500 position:67%
kind of the mythology of George Washington,
and how it shows itself in newspapers

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:52.020 position:56%
over decades, and it is fascinating.

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:55.830
So, even if you are studying
earlier time periods,

00:42:55.830 --> 00:43:01.260 position:61%
Chronicling America may still have some
avenues for you to incorporate some

00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.900 position:56%
of their content into your teaching.

00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:11.160 position:70%
&gt;&gt; I see that for the simple words here,
that we see things of the Civil War Soldiers,

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:16.620
50 years afterwards, and it was
really interesting to read stories

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:20.640
about Civil War Veterans going
back to where they had fought,

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:28.500
and they sort of remembrances
is associated with that.

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:33.870 position:70%
I'd like to see the question from Jamie about
if musical event for advertising newspapers,

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:38.690 position:64%
and yeah, there are really advertisements
for musical events, and newspapers.

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:44.450
There are also a bunch in--
about in movies, too.

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:50.700 position:69%
There are some really great sections about
movies, and movie premiers, in the 19 teens,

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:58.940 position:61%
and 1920 to '22, that provide a really
interesting view into thematic history.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:07.960 position:66%
There's another tint that I was going to
go on, but I think I've lost my attention.

00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:08.690
&gt;&gt; Robin, Tom?

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:14.890 position:67%
Do you have any kind of final ideas for
the good of the cause before we wrap it up?

00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:20.860 position:66%
&gt;&gt; I'll jump in with one more thing, as I
was making notes and watching that chat go

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:26.640 position:73%
by from earlier, and it kind of goes along
with what Robin was mentioning at the beginning

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:29.850 position:56%
of the presentation with all the
great resources on Women's Suffrage.

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:35.240
Someone mentioned looking at ideas
related to sexism and racism,

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:41.460 position:72%
and just to note that while you, at times, you
may find specific stories that directly deal

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:49.800 position:70%
with those events, also looking at stories
that show who is not represented in the news.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.510
Who's not being talked about.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:58.870 position:72%
Whose kind of being ignored, or underreported,
can also give some support to those ideas

00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:00.890
that have been sexism and racism.

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:04.600
That is another avenue that
you may want to look towards.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.020 position:70%
So, that is just one additional little note
that I had written down I wanted to throw in,

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:09.650 position:58%
and Robin, I'm handing it off to you.

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:15.070 position:69%
&gt;&gt; So, this feels important, the final word.

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:18.560
Newspapers, they're really great
for so many different things.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.470 position:69%
Every time I start poking around in there, I
find another six things that I try to blog,

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:25.750 position:75%
and then I have to go write a topics page on it.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:26.230
But, yeah.

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:30.610
I think that's-- we chatted
about a lot of the things I love,

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:34.910
so, I think I'll leave it at that.

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:35.990
&gt;&gt; Well, Robin and Tom.

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:37.510
That was an awesome presentation.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:41.710 position:56%
Thank you so much, and bigtime kudos
to everybody in the chatroom, too.

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:46.350 position:58%
That was, the chat was really
beneficial, as well, and going crazy.

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:49.880 position:69%
So, anyway, thanks everybody for being here.

00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:56.130 position:56%
I would like to invite you this time
to, you know, look at the screen,

00:45:56.130 --> 00:46:00.800
and click the survey link, and
provide feedback on this session.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.650
It's very valuable to us.

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:08.180 position:66%
So, again, thanks very much for joining
us, and hope everybody has a good evening.
