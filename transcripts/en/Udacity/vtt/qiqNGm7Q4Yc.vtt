00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.180
Now I have to admit there's
a lot going on in this question.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.240
At the end of the day,
we want to know how much we have to pay.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.610
Well, that's a question of money and
money shows up here.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.800
It's $6 for
each 24 ounce package of chicken wings.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.420
Okay, so I guess that means I need to
know how many 24 ounce packages I need.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.360
Which means I need to figure out
how much chicken I need to order.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.880
Okay, well the first thing I want to
do is figure out how many pounds I'm

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.310
going to have to order.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.450
And I know I'm getting 0.3 pounds per
person, which I can write like this, and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.660
that there are 60 people.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.680
So I'm going to multiply by 60 people.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.130
Well, person, people,
same thing then they cancel out.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.320
So I have 60 times 0.3 and
the only unit left is pounds.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.475
And this works out to eighteen pounds.

00:00:45.475 --> 00:00:49.000
Okay, so
I need to buy 18 pounds of chicken.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.220
How many ounces is that?

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.000
Looks like I need to convert
to ounces to figure out

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.240
how many of these
packages I have to buy.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.580
Well, I'm going to multiply
by my conversion factor,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.180
which is going to be 16
ounces divided by one pound.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.230
Again, my units cancel.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.120
I'm left with 18 times 16 ounces.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.020
Plug that into my calculator, and I find
that I need 288 ounces of chicken wings

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.790
and I should point out that, normally
I'd be doing this all on separate lines.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.400
And that's how you should
be doing it in your book.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.220
I just want to make sure this
all stays on the same page, so

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.100
I'm being a little bit sloppier
than I normally should be.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.490
So we need 288 ounces of chicken.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.595
How many packages is that?

00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:32.680
Well,l I could just think of
this is dividing 288 by 24 and

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.870
that would give me the answer.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.390
But as long as we're thinking
in terms of conversion factors,

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.635
I want to write it like this.

00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:44.395
Times one package over
24 ounces of chicken.

00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:46.235
And again, units cancel.

00:01:46.235 --> 00:01:48.195
Ounces of chicken go away.

00:01:48.195 --> 00:01:51.015
But now I have to multiply by 1 over 24.

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:53.145
Which, again,
is just like dividing by 24.

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:55.945
And the unit I have left is package.

00:01:55.945 --> 00:01:58.329
So I get 12 packages of chicken.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.060
Now how much do I have to pay?

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.210
Well, it's $6 per package.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.270
I can even think of that as
being a conversion factor.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.520
Package cancels, and I'm left with $72.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.130
And that's the answer
you should have gotten.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.730
And if you didn't,
believe me, I understand.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.160
There was a lot going on here.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.930
I would re-watch this video and
see if you can make sense of all of

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.770
the different uses of conversion factors
because there were a ton in here.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.990
Once you can get to the point
where you can answer this question

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.190
without seeing the solution video,
well, you're good to go.
