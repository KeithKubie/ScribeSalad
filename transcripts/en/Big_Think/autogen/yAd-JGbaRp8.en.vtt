inflammation and they found that there
 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.780
inflammation and they found that there
was a down regulation of inflammatory

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790
was a down regulation of inflammatory
 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.470
was a down regulation of inflammatory
genes from one day of meditation what

genes from one day of meditation what
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.610
genes from one day of meditation what
this means is that inflammation which is

anything they're completely equina me as
the pain comes and they feel it you see

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290
the pain comes and they feel it you see
 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.130
the pain comes and they feel it you see
it register physiologically but there's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140
it register physiologically but there's
 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.839
it register physiologically but there's
no emotional reaction and there's no

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849
no emotional reaction and there's no
 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.030
no emotional reaction and there's no
emotional reaction afterward so in other

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040
emotional reaction afterward so in other

the pain physiologically they don't have

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079
the pain physiologically they don't have
 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.110
the pain physiologically they don't have
the emotional reaction and what we find

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
the emotional reaction and what we find
 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.080
the emotional reaction and what we find
is that calming the emotional reaction

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090
is that calming the emotional reaction
 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.170
is that calming the emotional reaction
is one of the most powerful benefits of

one of the strongest findings on this
 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.610
one of the strongest findings on this
has been that it helps with people who

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620
has been that it helps with people who
 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.530
has been that it helps with people who
have chronic pain and I'm talking about

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540
have chronic pain and I'm talking about
 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.839
have chronic pain and I'm talking about
paying that medications not going to

paying that medications not going to
help you with there's nothing medicine

knows what to do about this except give

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169
knows what to do about this except give
 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.559
knows what to do about this except give
you you know horrible narcotics that are

you you know horrible narcotics that are
 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.640
you you know horrible narcotics that are
addictive and here is a very positive

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650
addictive and here is a very positive
 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.470
addictive and here is a very positive
alternative because what happens when

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480
alternative because what happens when
 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.899
alternative because what happens when
you do MBSR if you have chronic pain is

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909
you do MBSR if you have chronic pain is
 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.599
you do MBSR if you have chronic pain is
the emotional component changes you

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609
the emotional component changes you
 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:39.059
the emotional component changes you
shift your relationship to the pain it

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:39.069
shift your relationship to the pain it
 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:41.819
shift your relationship to the pain it
no longer is my pain oh my god I can't

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829
no longer is my pain oh my god I can't
 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.860
no longer is my pain oh my god I can't
stand it instead it's oh there's that

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870
stand it instead it's oh there's that
 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:44.909
stand it instead it's oh there's that
sensation again

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919
sensation again
 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.580
sensation again
so the physiology of the pain continues

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590
so the physiology of the pain continues
 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.710
so the physiology of the pain continues
but the emotional component which is

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720
but the emotional component which is
 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.520
but the emotional component which is
really where the hurt is disappears or

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530
really where the hurt is disappears or
 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.219
really where the hurt is disappears or
is much reduced because you no longer

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:56.229
is much reduced because you no longer
 

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:58.890
is much reduced because you no longer
have that same relationship to the pain

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900
have that same relationship to the pain
 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.470
have that same relationship to the pain
that we do ordinarily
