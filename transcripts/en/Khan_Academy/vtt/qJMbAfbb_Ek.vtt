00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.660
- [Instructor] You've
already spent a lot of

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.650
your mathematical lives
talking about functions.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.270
The basic idea is give a
valid input into a function,

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.180
so a member of that function's domain,

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.950
and then the function is going
to tell you for that input

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.610
what is going to be the
corresponding output.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.800
And we call that
corresponding output f of x.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.960
So, for example, there's many
ways of defining functions.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.960
You could say something like
f of x is equal to x squared.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.500
So that means that whatever x,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.310
whatever you input into the function,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.910
the output is going to
be that input squared.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.790
You could have something
defined like this.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.080
F of x is equal to

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.150
x squared

00:00:45.689 --> 00:00:48.070
if x odd.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.070
And you could say it's equal
to x to the third otherwise,

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.083
otherwise.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.980
So if it's an odd integer,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.790
it's an odd integer, you just square it.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.100
But otherwise, for any other real number,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.870
you take it to the third power.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.320
This is a valid way of
defining a function.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.980
What we're going to do in this
video is explore a new way

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.760
or potentially a new way for
you of defining a function.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.650
And that's by using a definite integral,

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.200
but it's the same general idea.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.020
So what we have graphed
here, this is the t-axis,

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.540
this is the y-axis, and we have
the graph of the function f,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.940
or you could view this as the graph of

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.870
y is equal to

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.420
f of t.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.330
Now, what I want to,

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.840
and this is another way of representing

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.870
what outputs you might
get for a given input.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.720
Here, if t is one, f of t is five.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.440
If t is four, f of t is three.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.640
But I'm now going to define a new function

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.000
based on a definite integral of f of t.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.920
Let's define our new function.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.080
Let's say g,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.370
let's call it g of x.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.940
Let's make it equal to
the definite integral

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.760
from negative two

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.480
to x

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.120
of f of t

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.953
dt.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.930
Now, pause this video,
really take a look at it.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.540
This might look really fancy,
but what's happening here is,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.810
given an input x, g of x
is going to be based on

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.660
what the definite integral
here would be for that x.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.480
And so we can set up a little table here

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.540
to think about some potential values.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.540
So let's say x, and let's
say g of x right over here.

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.470
So if x is one,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.413
what is g of x going to be equal to?

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.200
All right, so g of one

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.960
is going to be equal to
the definite integral,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.520
going from negative two.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.750
Now x is going to be equal
to one in this situation.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.740
That's what we're inputting
into the function.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.510
So one is our upper bound of f of t dt.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.380
And what is that equal to?

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.660
Well, that's going to be the area

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.490
under the curve and above the t-axis,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.060
between t equals negative
two and t is equal to one.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.470
So it's going to be this area here.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.420
And we, since it's on a grid,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.730
we can actually figure this out.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.930
We can actually break
this up into two sections.

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.140
This rectangular section is
three wide and five high,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.530
so it has an area of 15 square units.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.290
And this little triangular section up here

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.580
is two wide and one high.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.940
Two times one times one half,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.730
area of a triangle, this
is going to be another one.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.723
So that area is going to be equal to 16.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:27.750
What if

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.540
x is equal to

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.373
two?

00:03:31.373 --> 00:03:33.960
What is g of two going to be equal to?

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.210
Pause this video, and
try to figure that out.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.990
Well, g of two is going to be
equal to the definite integral

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.050
from negative two, and now
our upper bound's going to be

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.180
our input into the function
to two, of f of t dt.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.890
So that's going to be going from here,

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.370
all the way now to here.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.610
And so it's the area we just calculated.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.930
It's all of this stuff,

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.230
which we figured out was 16 square units,

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.930
plus another one, two, three,
four, five square units.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.790
So 16 plus five, this is
going to be equal to 21.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.140
So hopefully that helps,

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.950
and the key thing to appreciate
here is that we can define

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.667
valid functions by using
definite integrals.
