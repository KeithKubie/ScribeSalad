Our session today, Social Media and Social
Studies, Engaging Students in Their Medium.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.740 position:64%
I would like to introduce our presenters.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.330 position:73%

Publications include technology
integration, linking the learner to learning,

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.760
and from corn chips took garbology,
the dynamics of historical inquiry.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.190 position:64%
Peggy researches and presents nationally
and internationally about the connections

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.480 position:61%
between emerging social media learning.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.950 position:69%
Kelly Jones-Wagy is a social studies teacher
at Overland High School in Aurora, Colorado,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.590 position:63%
and an affiliate faculty member at
Metropolitan State University of Denver.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.730
Kelly has presented locally
and nationally about how

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.570
to integrate technology into
the secondary classroom.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.630 position:66%
Peggy and Kelly, welcome and take it away.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.450
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.170
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.760 position:69%
&gt;&gt; And Kelly and I are excited to share what
we have figured out and learned what we hope

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.510
to learn from you with using
social media with social studies.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.460 position:75%
Today's objectives are listed on the screen, and
I won't read through those, but you can go back

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.820
and read those, as well as
they're listed in our Google Doc.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.450 position:63%
We have a back channel, which is a
Google document that you could use to --

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:47.140 position:72%
we'll ask you to type your name, your grade
level, and we're you're from, so at any point,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.230 position:72%
and now, or anytime during the session or even
afterwards, you can just go in and type some

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.760
of the -- your name, your grade
level and where you're from.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.440
Okay, so let's get started.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.040
So one thing is, we want to
get an idea of the social media

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.040
that if you're using it, the
type that you use already.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.770
Okay, so I see blogs.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.790
So none with students but Facebook
for personal use you're okay.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:17.430
Google Maps.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.160
Oh, yeah. Geography.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.840
Oh, I'd like to learn more
about how you use that, as well,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.750 position:58%
and Google Maps with primary sources.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.880 position:67%
Perfect. We're going to do a Twitter
activity today, and I will be so interested

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.600
to get everyone's reaction with the
way we said and the way you use it.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.780
Survey Monkey.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.620
Perfect okay.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.590
Instagram, okay.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.070
LinkedIn. That's interesting.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.420
I want to hear more, either
in the chat or the Google talk

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.010 position:72%
about how you use LinkedIn with your students.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.960
So why use social media?

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.530
Well, there's an engagement
factor with social media.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.050
Engaging the students where
they are on social media.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.790
No doubt there.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.050 position:66%
We'll probably pull off their phones and
jump on their platform that they're using,

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.360 position:59%
and to get them to where you need them
to be, which is the learning target.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.900 position:56%
The other part about social media is
using social media for expression.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.510
So using social media is the format
for them to express their knowledge

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.160 position:70%
or their understanding of a concept or topic.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.330
So we talk about social media,
there's reasons to use that.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.940
Of course, many reasons.

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.730
Instant communication, it's
time and geography independent,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.880
so that your activity doesn't just
have to happen in your classroom.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.680
It can happen in different places.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.830
It encourages conversation,
and you all know that.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.020 position:64%
Would you have different types of
students, the ones that raise their hands

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.060
and answer immediately and
monopolize the conversation,

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.030 position:58%
as the ones that are very thoughtful.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.310 position:63%
They're just not out there all the time.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.710 position:59%
It is a different or different channel
by which to allow students to talk.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.890
And it also promotes a community,
a community of learning.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:14.810
So one of the things that we wanted
to use was this conversation prism.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.410 position:73%
This, to Kelly and I, is what most teachers see

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.040
when we talk about, well,
let's use social media.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.440 position:61%
They see this big blast of social media
tools, and when you zoom in even more,

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.530
it's even more confusing,
overwhelming, and I feel like --

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.300 position:69%
and you guys can express how you feel, but
when someone says, I'll let you social media

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.870
in the classroom, you know,
like, and you begin where?

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.810
So this is how Kelly and I,
how we try to make sense of it.

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.940 position:59%
What we're going to do is examine the
ways in which you can use social media

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.000
and primary sources to engage
students in historical thinking.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.230 position:73%
So we're going to rethink the framework, and
social media, in the context of social studies.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:04.740 position:66%
So Kelly, is there anything you want to
add before I move on to our new framework?

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.410
&gt;&gt; So one of the things, and we had
this conversation several times,

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.810 position:61%
is that when we're talking about social
media and the way that it's used,

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.070 position:70%
there are different ways in which you can
either bring social media into your classroom

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.430 position:70%
as a source, or you could use it as a way for
the students to express what they understand.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.250 position:70%
And so most of what we're going to talk about
today is using social media for the students

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.050 position:69%
to express their knowledge and their
learning, but there's also a way to bring it

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.480
into the classroom if you want to
as a resource in and of itself.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.420
And so we'll kind of walk you
all through that as we go.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.980
&gt;&gt; And just a reminder, Kelly is a
high school social studies teacher.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.590
So she's in the trenches with this,
and she also uses social media.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.470 position:72%
So this is the way we try to make sense of it,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.060
and let's see if this helps
you make sense of it.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:57.100 position:64%
There are three concepts that we're
looking at to distinguish the media type,

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.110 position:72%
the expression form and the social media tool.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:08.070 position:70%
When we talk about media type, we think
about the way you as teachers think about it.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:10.000 position:75%
That if we're trying to introduce a new concept,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.900
let's connect it to something
people already know.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.130
That they're already familiar with.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.360
So we think about the media type
with text image, audio, and motion.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.300
And if you think about primary
source media type,

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.160 position:64%
that a primary source media type would
be newspaper articles, letters, journals,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.310 position:63%
manuscripts; I use primary source image,
photographs, political cartoons, audio,

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:40.570
music sound recordings, motion,
video, film, animation.

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.890 position:67%
Then we think about the media type, so when
we build on this conceptual understanding,

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:51.610 position:75%
the media type, text, image, audio, motion,
then we'll also think about the expression form.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:57.640 position:63%
That you can have a concise expression
or you can have an expansive expression,

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:05.130 position:73%
and in all of these, and a traditional form,
you could have concise or expansive expression,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.470
or in social media, the same thing.

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.640
Here's our big chart on how
we try to put this together.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.160
So Kelly --

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:19.490 position:61%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so when we made the discussion
about really what this looks like,

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.520
and one thing as a teacher and, I
don't know about the rest of you,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:26.530 position:63%
but I always feel like people are adding
more and more to what I'm supposed

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.040 position:56%
to do and how I'm supposed to do it.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.890 position:66%
And there came a point in which I was very
overwhelmed with how do I use the tools

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.520 position:69%
that are available to me, and the same time,

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.150
how do I get the students to
engage in what we're doing?

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.510 position:64%
And so, one of the ways that I decided
that I had to do this is that if I wanted

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:49.300 position:63%
to bring social media into my
classroom, is that I had to make certain

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.900 position:67%
that I was taking something off my plate at
the same time I was adding something else.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.850 position:66%
And so that's what this really became for
me, was making certain that if I was going

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:02.500
to use Twitter, I was going to
use it to replace something.

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:07.150 position:61%
And so the idea was that I was going to
replace the idea of doing a brainstorm

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:12.390 position:73%
where I had the students read through something
or look at an image and tell me what they saw,

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.840 position:75%
and then we would write it all on the board, and
instead of doing that, I wanted to use Twitter

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.800 position:75%
as a platform for students to brainstorm as they
were going through primary source activities.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.920 position:61%
And it gave me both a good thing in the
sense that I was able to get students

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.750 position:69%
who don't normally anticipate participating.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:35.210 position:70%
I also got information that a may not have
gotten otherwise and allowed students to kind

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.750 position:72%
of move through the process at their own pace.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.310 position:61%
But at the same time, you also kind of
have to monitor just a little bit more,

00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:44.220
because they are using social
media in the process.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:49.080 position:63%
And there are some back channel ways in
which they're not as public with Twitter

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.180 position:58%
that you can use, especially if you
have a younger population of students

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.110
or if Twitter is not something
that you're comfortable with.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.960
There's a few back-channel social
media applications for it, as well.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.580 position:73%
The other thing I really had to kind of keep in
mind was what exactly did I want the students

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.230
to be able to do in this process?

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:13.550 position:69%
And so, you can see the idea of a concise
response from the students is under Twitter,

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.580 position:64%
because they're limited to14o characters.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:21.240 position:70%
I can't expect them to write a five-paragraph
essay in 140 characters, but I can,

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:26.760 position:73%
if you take a look over on the right hand side
where it talks about the WordPress and the idea

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:32.050 position:70%
of a blog replacing information, and that was
one of the big things for me is making sure

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:35.940 position:61%
that I understood like what did I want
the students to do with the information

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.680
and how did I want them to
express their knowledge?

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.840
Instagram I used to replace
when students made posters.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.760 position:69%
Flickr can sometimes replace a gallery walk.

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.520
There's a few other ones in here
with VoiceThread and SoundCloud.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.660
Ways to replace things like
pair shared or round robin.

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:57.090 position:56%
Vine we'll go over little bit today,
and that can replace a jigsaw,

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:02.250 position:67%
and then the other thing is the famous
PowerPoint presentation where students copy

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.000 position:69%
and paste everything onto their PowerPoint
and stand up there and read it to the class,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.270
it is all very exciting for us all.

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:13.390 position:72%
But instead, I started having my students make
videos and then uploading them to YouTube,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.930
and so that way, they were
standing there telling us what was

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.710
on their PowerPoint presentation.

00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:21.000
Instead, they made a video, and
they presented it to us that way.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.410 position:75%
And so it was a much more engaging way to get
the students to express their knowledge in a way

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.020 position:63%
that they had never been able to before.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:34.070
And this is not, by any means,
and exhaustive list.

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:36.850 position:63%
These are examples that we put together.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:41.690 position:59%
If you follow our list, our chart
along from left to right, for example,

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:46.810 position:56%
the media would be text, and then as
Kelly said, Twitter is a short form,

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:51.480 position:64%
a concise way to express, 140 characters,

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.030
and that could replace something
you traditionally do --

00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.340 position:67%
replace or enhance I should say, something
that you traditionally do in the classroom,

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.370
such as brainstorming, and then
when you follow it to the right,

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:07.390 position:56%
that a blog is unlimited characters.

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:10.160
You could have a five-paragraph
essay or whatever you want,

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:18.020 position:67%
and then it can be the expansive expression
of their knowledge or understanding.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:23.970
I think the other thing I wanted
to make clear is that I never think

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.150 position:64%
of social media as a better way to do it.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:32.780
That if paper and pencil work,
they work and they work great.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:37.240
The way that we try to take
social media into the --

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:42.700 position:70%
and connect it with traditional instructional
strategies is that it could be another way

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:46.920 position:73%
to enhance what you're already doing, to engage
students that you might otherwise not be able

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.880 position:73%
to engage, and of course, they're going to love
it when you tell them to take out their phone

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.530
because we're going to have
a brainstorming activity.

00:11:54.530 --> 00:12:00.610
So there is our trying to take this
big glob of social media and put it

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.870 position:73%
into a framework that makes sense for teachers.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.100 position:66%
So now, we're going to go to
instructional strategies and social media.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:07.370
Kelly.

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:10.720
&gt;&gt; And I'm going to go through one
of the things about social media,

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.270 position:61%
is originally, when I started using it.

00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:16.290
-- I really used it is kind of look
at the amazing thing that I found,

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.020
and I had really no idea what
I wanted the students to do.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:23.380 position:63%
It was more than like a bell and whistle
than an actual instructional strategy

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.940
when I first are using social
media, and I realize,

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.550
I started getting more and
more social media tools.

00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:33.940 position:70%
And the students really never became experts
in any of them, and I wasn't entirely certain

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:39.340 position:67%
if they were really getting out of each
lesson what I needed them to get out of it.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:44.030
And so one of the things that I
wanted to make clear was that I had

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:46.070 position:63%
to have an ultimate goal for the lesson.

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:49.170
It wasn't just about using
the social media anymore.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:55.090 position:73%
It was about very specifically what was my goal
for the lesson and how do I want my students

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:59.410 position:72%
to be able to express their knowledge or their
understanding by the time that we were done?

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.330
Was this a short one where they
could express things quickly?

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:05.570
Was this something that I needed
them to spend more time on?

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:09.870 position:61%
Was this closer to a summative
assessment than a formative assessment?

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.930 position:56%
And so what I really started boiling
down, because I got so overwhelmed

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:17.750
with so many social media tools,
I really started say, okay,

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:23.350 position:75%
one of the things that are going to get me where
I need to go and get my students were they need

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.090 position:72%
to go and engage them in a way that sometimes,

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:29.850
there are just some topics
that aren't that exciting.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:34.270 position:58%
And so I needed to make them a little
more exciting using social media.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:39.690
And so I really wanted to go
through and kind of take a look

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.260 position:69%
at the traditional instructional strategies.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.650 position:59%
If I wanted my students to brainstorm.

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:47.960
Okay, so we're going to use
Twitter to brainstorm.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:51.140
Or, I wanted my students to
analyze a primary source,

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:54.380
and I wanted them to simply
look at what was there.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.870
Then Twitter was a great
way for them to do that.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:02.020 position:73%
But if I wanted them to take a look at multiple
primary sources, and I really wanted them

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.760
to analyze the impact of that,
but I really needed to look

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.590
at a different social media tool
for them to be able to do that.

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:11.450 position:75%
And so that's what it really came down to as far

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:16.430 position:69%
as when I started rethinking the
traditional strategies, it was what strategy

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:21.890
and what tool is going to
serve my students the best?

00:14:21.890 --> 00:14:28.760
&gt;&gt; We're going to try primary
source analysis using twitter.

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:35.410 position:70%
So this is, again, using a familiar framework
or a familiar concept and then take it

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:40.680 position:66%
over to the social media realm, and on the
screen is the primary source analysis tool

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.740 position:61%
from the Library of Congress, where you
have students look at a primary source

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:49.370
and they observe, they reflect,
and they question.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:54.370
What we're going to try is to do
the observation part with twitter,

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:57.530 position:56%
and Kelly will explain a little bit
more about the activity in a minute.

00:14:57.530 --> 00:15:02.950 position:72%
But one of the things that I wanted to mention
is that right now we don't have time to go

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:08.260 position:72%
through the whole analysis activity, but one
of the things that I think about with Twitter,

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:13.870
in the very last presentations
with asking good questions,

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:20.660 position:72%
they were talking about the challenges to have
students observe without jumping to inference.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.210 position:59%
Like all of us, when we see something,

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:25.550
we want to look at something
and then jump to the inference.

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:30.750 position:61%
So in the observation phase,
observation can slow down that thinking

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:36.080
and make them make sure they look
and look carefully before they jump

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.760
to an inference of what that means.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:46.320 position:63%
And I think about twitter as a good tool
to do that with the 140-character limit.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:52.980 position:59%
You can confirm a lot that it might be
a good tool to slow down that thinking

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.530 position:61%
and actually do that observation phase.

00:15:56.530 --> 00:16:02.510 position:72%
And the teacher analysis tool and guide are on
the Library of Congress on the teacher's page.

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:09.540 position:75%
That's where you can find the activity dose or
the Library of Congress primary source analysis,

00:16:09.540 --> 00:16:11.920
which by the way, on the Google
Doc, all of the links that does

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:19.330 position:63%
to the things we are talking about,
they're all there, and you can get that.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:23.740 position:56%
So first let's try this, and Mike,
do you think we could put up a poll,

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.920
and let's find out how many
people are on Twitter.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.370
There we go, oh look at,
look at these Twitter users.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:33.890
My gosh.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:35.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; That will make this a lot easier.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.150
&gt;&gt; That, it's great.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:40.020 position:61%
And one of the reasons that we ask, and
I've been asked multiple times before

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.940 position:59%
about using Twitter was that one of my
students don't have a Twitter account,

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:49.200 position:73%
and there are times that you run into students
who either don't have it or they don't want it,

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.510 position:56%
or their parents won't allow them to
have it, or your district blocks it

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:56.210 position:56%
or something along those lines, and
other than the district blocking it,

00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:00.860 position:67%
any time that I use Twitter, I usually
have students work in groups or in partners

00:17:00.860 --> 00:17:05.180 position:67%
where at least one person has a Twitter
account, and almost never make them do this

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:10.970 position:75%
by themselves unless it's an optional activity,
simply because I don't want a student to be left

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.720 position:59%
out of an activity simply because
they don't have a social media account

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.450 position:58%
or their parents won't allow them to.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:25.390 position:73%
So there are ways that I make sure that this
works for my students, and this is one of them.

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.380
So, okay, Mike, if you'll go
ahead and we'll go close the poll,

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:34.620
and we'll move on to -- Kelly,
go ahead and you can --

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:40.490 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and Kelly did a good job of
explaining one of the things about brainstorming

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:44.800 position:64%
with my students in the idea of the
observation piece is that a lot of times,

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:49.000 position:73%
they try and jump immediately to try and figure
out what something is, and so you really have

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.770 position:67%
to train them to start looking first before
they start trying to jump to conclusions.

00:17:53.770 --> 00:17:57.550
And so, for the students to be
able to take a look at an image,

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.550
and we are going to give you
guys the image in just a second,

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:05.850 position:66%
and have you brainstorm your
observations, but not your inferences yet.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:11.450 position:66%
So the observation part is just being
able to write down the things that you see

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:16.300 position:66%
in the photograph, and then you get to
the point of what could those things mean?

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:20.960 position:56%
So this is how we're going to do it.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:30.150 position:61%
This is the primary source that we will
ask you to observe, and if you would,

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:36.360 position:69%
if you're on Twitter, if you would type
your observation, and then use this hashtag.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:41.580 position:56%
It's the #LCteachconf, #LCteachconf.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:50.770
On Twitter, and your observation,
and then include the pound sign,

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:58.940
and what that will do is create
a stream of observations.

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:06.950
So Keith, if you would put the link
to the Twitter, #LC hashtag feed,

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:10.600 position:72%
then you all could -- I can't share my screen.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:18.820 position:73%
If you all go to that link on Twitter, then
you'll see as others type in their observations

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:23.970 position:69%
on twitter and add that hashtag, then
you'll start to see a stream of observations

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.670 position:59%
around this particular primary source.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.690
Okay, so Leah just added
black and white photo, old.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:33.910
So there's her observation.

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.030
June, woman standing perfect.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:41.650 position:69%
So now we're starting to get a -- the
traditional way might have been PostIt notes

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.430
that you might post around
the photo on the wall.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:51.110
This can be the observation
using twitter, where we end up --

00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:54.760
so Patricia, woman is posting
the billboard and smiling.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.860 position:67%
Okay, and these are all great observations.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.850
You guys are so good.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:02.060
Nobody has jumped to inference yet.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:06.760 position:70%
&gt;&gt; And one of the things, when you're
working with students is that there are a lot

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:11.840 position:63%
of students who wouldn't naturally raise
their hand and put their information

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:15.320
and give what they see or their
observations or their inference.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:19.200 position:64%
They're not naturally those students that
will do that, but you'll find on Twitter

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.870 position:70%
that students that normally are very outgoing
may sit back a little bit more on this one,

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:29.660 position:64%
and the students who are much quieter may
jump in, and it's kind of fun to watch,

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:32.840 position:61%
but you'll notice that the students who
are really outgoing also have pictures

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:36.490
on their Twitter feeds that they
may not want everybody to see.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:41.550 position:69%
So be careful of that, but it's also very
interesting, the information that you'll get

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:46.840
from students having to do with
just that they'll put information

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.730 position:73%
out that they normally wouldn't, and you'll get
that very quiet student get making observations

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:53.840
that you normally would not
hear from them otherwise.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.570 position:64%
&gt;&gt; And Michelle added clothing is old
compared to now, but she likes the dress.

00:20:58.570 --> 00:21:03.730
And I think the other thing, too,
is this Twitter feed that you --

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.920 position:59%
this observation feed that you're
developing with all these observations

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:13.620 position:70%
around this primary source, is something that
you could print out later so that, you know,

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.600 position:56%
they all could see or it's something
that you go back and reference.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.410
The same thing when you have
the observe/reflect.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.290 position:64%
You could possibly do reflect on Twitter.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:31.790 position:70%
I'm not sure about the questioning, because
that might be in a more expansive form rather

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:35.730 position:75%
than concise, but you all would figure that out.

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:40.170
Okay, maybe, at this point,
before we go into strategies,

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:46.180 position:61%
what about the Twitter activity doing a
primary source analysis using Twitter?

00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:54.770 position:73%
Oh, okay, so Hope has does you can use a tool
that collects all the Twitter feed, social fee?

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:58.810
Whatever, Hope, great suggestion,
and all of this is going to be

00:21:58.810 --> 00:22:01.940 position:56%
in the Google Doc, and that's great.

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:07.090
And Michelle agrees with hope
that Padlet allows that, as well.

00:22:07.090 --> 00:22:10.890
And it may be an alternative
to schools who block Twitter.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.280
So there you go, Michelle.

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.820
Michelle Pearson, who I know,
is a middle school teacher.

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:21.640
So I'm sure Michelle lives with
applications being blocked.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:27.630 position:67%
Yes, Hope, and twitter does require concise
information, and I really like that.

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:38.180 position:75%
There's a skill to being concise, whether it's
image or video or text that cut in to the chase.

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.470
And Storify is great.

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:45.250 position:67%
Yeah, that could -- yeah, oh, nice Hope, so
Twitter feed could be the new flashcards.

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:48.640
Okay, and there's a real-life skill
for kids using concise language.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.280
Absolutely, Michelle.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.310 position:64%
And one of you had mentioned, and I can't
remember who it was on the Google Doc was

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:57.500 position:67%
that one of your concerns was that students
needed to learn how to be responsible

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.660 position:58%
on social media and things like that.

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:05.220 position:69%
And this is actually kind of a fantastic way
for them to become a little bit more aware

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:11.120 position:75%
of their digital footprint, and one of the most
interesting things I had is I had a student come

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:16.370 position:72%
up to me and ask why I was trending on
Twitter for my students, because I use my own,

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:20.050 position:56%
my name as a hashtag for the
students to be able to do this with.

00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:24.630 position:58%
So I have lots of students who will,
when we go through this, I'll have 30

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.920
or 40 students every day that
are using the same hashtag.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:31.120
So I end up kind of trending among
my classes, which is kind of fun,

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.770 position:58%
but then they get asked why they were
doing something, and they get I --

00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.830
asked very odd questions like,
"What are you talking about?"

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:43.850 position:58%
So it really allows them to have this
idea of exactly what gets left behind

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:48.190 position:72%
in their digital footprint, when their friends
ask what they're doing tweeting my name

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:49.750
and what's happening?

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:54.590 position:64%
And so it's a way for them to
understand just how quickly that spreads.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:24:01.690 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Okay, good job on the activity, you guys, you
are excellent students and excellent teachers.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:05.770 position:73%
So Kelly and I have a couple of other examples.

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.970 position:72%
The links to these live are in the Google Doc,

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:12.470
but I will just show you
some screenshots of this.

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:17.820 position:64%
So here's the instructional strategy,
another one, the primary source analysis.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:22.230
The medium would be the image
and then a concise expression.

00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:27.140 position:63%
So again, rather than the Post-it notes,
this time, we would use Thing Link,

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:33.800 position:59%
and I don't know if any of you have
used it, but I'm Thing Link, students,

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:39.940 position:64%
or whoever's doing the observation can go
and, and when you look at, for example,

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.120
the little stars in the hearts,
would you click on those.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:48.180 position:72%
Well, there's an example, why the women are
coming out to the eastern half of the country.

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:55.050 position:73%
So all of these observations that you made on
Twitter, well, here's another idea of doing it.

00:24:55.050 --> 00:25:00.700 position:67%
Putting a primary source up on something
like Thing Link and then having students go

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:06.930 position:58%
around to the different parts of the
source and adding their observations.

00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:09.130
Okay, Kelly.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:12.610
&gt;&gt; And so one of the things
-- this one is not me.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:15.550
The Vine that we have though
is absolutely adorable.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.310 position:63%
It's called six-second Shakespeare, and
unfortunately, we can't play it for you,

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.280
because it won't show up for you.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:26.360 position:70%
But there's the screenshot of it, and you can
see what this teacher has done is taken Vine,

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:32.400 position:59%
which limit you eight seconds total,
and it's a great way to use summaries.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.660 position:73%
So if you want to summarize something, exactly
what something means and eight seconds or less,

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:42.700 position:75%
this guy did a fantastic job of having the
students create little six seconds Shakespeares.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.600
They have to be able to summarize
an entire Shakespeare play in six,

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:51.250 position:56%
and he's got these cute little stick
figure drawings and everything else.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:52.720
I mean, it's fairly simple.

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.760
Everybody, you know, they're
happy and then they all die,

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.900 position:70%
because that's Shakespeare a lot of the time.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:02.040
But it's a great way to go through
and use it as a summary tool.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.630
So it would be fantastic if you had
multiple perspectives of something

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:11.730 position:64%
and had students make a Vine regarding
different perspectives of the same event.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.200
And so I've had my students --
I haven't done with Vine yet,

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.810
although it's on my list
of things to do next year.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:20.320 position:66%
Is I actually wanted to take the different
perspectives of the Sand Creek massacre,

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:26.120 position:64%
because it happened here in Colorado, and
go through and create a six-second vine

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:29.770 position:67%
about Sand Creek, but I have to be a little
careful about making sure it stays PG,

00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:32.300 position:75%
and Sand Creek is a little hard to do that with.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.480 position:73%
But it's one of the things that I want students
to be able compare the different perspectives,

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.330 position:56%
and so Vine would be a great way
for students to go about doing that.

00:26:40.330 --> 00:26:45.190 position:67%
And Keith added the link to the YouTube,
which you can look at now or you could look

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:50.030 position:63%
at later, the YouTube with the examples.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:52.470
And then the other way to
do it if you're looking

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.390 position:64%
for something slightly longer is Animoto.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.830
They have about 30 seconds for
free, but you can go longer,

00:26:58.830 --> 00:27:01.400 position:59%
and we have the link up here, as well.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.220 position:67%
And this is one that I used in my economics
class for students to do it very quick,

00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:09.220 position:72%
30-second difference between economic systems.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.530
And it's a very quick assignment,
but it was 30 seconds.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:15.250
It took them probably about an
hour to put the videos together.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:18.550
So we have a sample one for
you up here that we used

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:21.190 position:69%
to compare these different economic systems.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:25.040 position:58%
And so it's a way for students to
express, again, this idea of summary.

00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:31.270 position:61%
And so it depends on what you want your
students to be of to get out of it.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:37.300 position:67%
When it comes to Animoto, you can sign up,
I believe, for an educator kind of sign in.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.890
Oh, did some already put up there?

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:39.330
&gt;&gt; Patricia.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:39.860
&gt;&gt; Okay, good.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:39.970
Yeah --

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:42.340
&gt;&gt; And you get a little bit longer.

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:48.600 position:66%
&gt;&gt; So you can have longer videos with
Animoto once you have an educator account,

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:53.890 position:72%
and this one was make, actually, before you
they gave you that option, but you do have it.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:54.900
So thank you.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.890
&gt;&gt; And the next one.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:00.810 position:61%
&gt;&gt; And the next one is a WordPress, and
this is one of the things that I used

00:28:00.810 --> 00:28:03.120
for my students as an exit ticket.

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.060 position:58%
And the link is up there, and we
have a screenshot for you afterwards.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:12.950 position:64%
And so I come up with really complicated
questions for my students, because I can,

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:19.870 position:75%
but I figured they would be able to, they would
really be able to tell me about more information

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:24.720 position:69%
on a blog versus on Twitter, and so what I
asked them to do, I asked them to go through

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:29.450 position:66%
and really answer them more in depth on a
WordPress, and the difference between this

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:32.900 position:67%
and a regular exit ticket where they write
me a ticket -- paragraph and hand it to me,

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.870 position:75%
is that everyone else in the class can see this,

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:39.810
and everyone else in the class
is expected to respond to this.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:44.400 position:61%
And so you can't get away with the
student who just doesn't want to do it.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.520 position:63%
And students put a lot more thought into
it when everybody is going to see it.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:53.500 position:58%
And so it's a way for them to also be
able to share ideas with each other.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.330 position:63%
But if they just wrote it on an exit
ticket, they'd never be able to do that.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:59.470
They would never be able
to have that information

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.750 position:63%
to hear what everybody else is thinking.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:07.670 position:73%
And sometimes that kind of groupthink is very
helpful when it comes to complicated questions.

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:12.490
And so it not only lets me know
what students are understanding,

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:15.500 position:72%
but it also lets them build off of each other.

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:19.900 position:73%
And so I liked the blogs for those purposes, of
them being able to build on each other's ideas,

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:24.840 position:72%
which you can always do in a classroom
setting with them writing on a piece of paper.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.520 position:69%
They just can't all see it at the same time.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:36.030 position:73%
Okay, well, at this point, we would like to get
your ideas about how you might use social media

00:29:36.030 --> 00:29:40.780 position:61%
and primary sources to engage learners.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.430
And Michelle said if your school
has Google Classroom set up

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:47.240 position:58%
and a Google email Blog Spot is good.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:55.770 position:70%
Any ideas about an instructional strategy you
might change or replace with social media?

00:29:55.770 --> 00:29:57.980 position:73%
So June, she's like a Twitter in the classroom.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:04.040 position:70%
Great. Oh, and ideas for elementary students.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.080
&gt;&gt; That is not my forte.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.410
&gt;&gt; But I that we have --

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:10.940
&gt;&gt; But I bet there's people who
are better at that than I am.

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:15.150
&gt;&gt; Anyone out there who has ideas
for elementary school students.

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:19.270 position:66%
I'm wondering if Google Expedition could
somehow work with the Library of Congress.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.610
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:22.770
I have no idea.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:26.230
&gt;&gt; I'd love the ideas, though.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:29.610 position:75%
Vine for annotated bib and other summaries, too.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:36.360
Yeah, okay, and Michelle with Thing
Link and Animoto for elementary.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.810
So there's an idea for elementary.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:41.140
And Kid Blog.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.900
Diane has Kid Blog for elementary.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:50.810 position:72%
These are just great ideas, and we're going to
assemble all of these again in the Google Doc,

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:54.710
so that you all have a nice take
away from this presentation.

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:59.250 position:70%
"We Instagram to curate in our Makers Space."

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:03.040 position:56%
Nice, Leah, at the elementary level.

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:03.740
So there we go.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.550 position:66%
Ask a question and this group will answer.

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:09.090 position:72%
Parent interaction for community alert notice.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:11.160 position:59%
Oh, yeah, we can't forget the parents.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.960 position:58%
But talk about a way to bring parents
into the loop of what's going on.

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.520 position:64%
Mystery Hang Out is great for elementary.

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.980
Okay. Oh, does the school need
to set up a Google classroom?

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:27.960
I can set up or I can set
up using my Google account.

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.460
Do you know school wise?

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:36.050 position:59%
&gt;&gt; You know what, I don't know
because we don't use Google Classroom.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:39.690 position:58%
But I'm pretty sure you probably can.

00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:44.250 position:64%
Yeah, I can't imagine Google would lock
you out of it, even if the school is not.

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:45.820
And somebody answer for me.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:46.370
So yes.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:49.530
&gt;&gt; Michelle, she says you do
not need to use the classroom.

00:31:49.530 --> 00:31:50.730
So thank you, Michelle.

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.920 position:66%
And it may be a school by school decision.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.990
Commonsensemedia.org has great
lessons on digital footprint.

00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:59.800
Okay, Samantha.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:06.460
Okay, so Leah, she can share
her twitter handle and email.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:10.780 position:59%
They have fifth-grade set up account,
and teachers give direction on topics.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.020
So you guys are on list.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:15.150
Love the Common Sense Media.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.520 position:75%
And Bridget, anxious to try some of these ideas.

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.730 position:61%
And I also wanted to mention that there
is a way to carry on the conversation

00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:27.270
in the TPS Teachers Network,
which is TPSteachersnetwork.org.

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:34.550 position:75%
It is a social media network with the Library of
Congress to have teacher speaking with teachers.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:43.480 position:75%
It is a teacher/professional network, and please
feel free to join the network and join in.
