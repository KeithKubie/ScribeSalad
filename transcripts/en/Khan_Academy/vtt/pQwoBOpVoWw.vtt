00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.670
In the last video, we saw
that choice A is true.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.250
Now let's see if B, C,
and D are also true.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.820
So choice B, they're telling
us that the argument,

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.260
let me rewrite it
over here-- I'll

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.170
do it in another color,
their choice B is telling us

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.750
that the argument
of z minus z1 is

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.914
equal to the argument
of z minus z2.

00:00:25.914 --> 00:00:27.580
Now let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.621
We already did some work.

00:00:28.621 --> 00:00:31.870
We simplified what z
minus z1 is equal to.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.770
It's equal to t
times z2 minus z1.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:42.370
So this is equivalent to saying
that the argument of t times

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.020
z2 minus z1.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.690
I'm just leveraging
some of the algebra

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.040
that we already did,
because this thing is

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.930
the same thing as what's
inside of the absolute value

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.580
sign, which is the same thing
as this thing over here.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.310
So the argument, t
times z2 minus z1,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.440
is equal to-- so I'm
just rewriting statement

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.390
B. Statement B is just
saying that this should

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.025
be equal to the argument
of-- now what's z minus z2?

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:12.430
Z minus z2, we figured out
was this thing over here.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.130
Actually, let's say it's
this thing right over here.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.560
It's equal to this
thing right over here.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.400
And we could rewrite
this thing as being

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.990
equal to-- I'm running
out of real estate here--

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.520
but we can rewrite
this thing right here

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.160
as B equal to 1 minus t,
I'm just factoring out

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:40.660
the 1 minus t, times
z1 one minus z2.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.210
Or so we can get in
the same form here,

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.230
let's multiply this times
negative 1 and this times

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.736
negative 1.

00:01:52.736 --> 00:01:54.360
So I'm multiplying
by negative 1 twice.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.190
So I'm not changing the number.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.630
So this is going to be
equal to, or the statement

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.520
is claiming this is equal to,
the argument of t minus 1--

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.732
let me write it a little
bit neater than that.

00:02:07.732 --> 00:02:09.190
So the claim is
that this should be

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:19.877
equal to the argument of t
minus 1 times z2 minus z1.

00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:20.960
So let's think about this.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.335
And just remember,
all I did here

00:02:22.335 --> 00:02:25.370
is I multiplied this by negative
1, and this by negative 1.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.337
If I multiply two
things times negative 1,

00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:29.170
it's equivalent to
multiplying by negative 1

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.350
twice, which is just
multiplying it by one.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.640
So I was able to
swap both of these.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.190
So is this true?

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.680
Is it true that the argument
of t times z2 minus z1--

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.340
is it true that that's the
same thing as the argument of t

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.980
minus 1 times z2 minus z1?

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.980
So let's just think
about it a little bit.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.080
Let's draw an
Argand diagram here.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.950
That's the imaginary axis.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.540
This is the real axis.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.870
And let's draw the
vector z2 minus z1.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.620
So let's say that this
right here is the vector.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.180
Let me draw it like this.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.730
This right here is the
vector, z2 minus z1.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.140
Now what would t times
z2 minus z1 look like?

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.750
So t, we learned,
is between 0 and 1.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.300
So it's going to be a scaled
down version of z2 minus z1.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.960
So this right here-- so
who knows what it is.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.840
This right here would
be t times z2 minus z1.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.230
Now what would t minus 1
times z2 minus z1 look like?

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.170
Well t minus 1, remember
t is between 0 and 1,

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.320
so t is less than 1.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.220
So t minus 1--
this right here is

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.470
going to be a negative number.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.520
It's going to be
a negative number.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.100
So we're going to be scaling
it by a negative number.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.140
So we're going to be scaling z2
minus z1 by a negative number.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.250
So this thing right over here,
t minus 1 times z2 minus z1

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.350
is going to look like this.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:14.510
This is t minus 1
times z2 minus z1.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:17.709
Now the arguments
are just the angles

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.390
between each of these
numbers and the real axis.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.650
So the argument for this
thing right over here

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.745
is going to be this angle.

00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:29.130
It's going to be
phi right over here.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.660
So I could call that phi.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.650
But what's the argument
for this thing?

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.580
It's going to be that plus
pi, or plus 180 degrees.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.560
We have to go all
the way around.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.050
So they are not the same angle.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.320
Whatever number this
is right over here,

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.600
this number is going to be
that, plus or even minus pi.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.130
You could even go that way.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.480
But they're definitely not
going to be the same angle.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:03.980
So we can cross out B
choice B as an option.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.940
But now that we're
in this mode, let's

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.502
see if we can tackle choice D,
because it looks very similar.

00:05:08.502 --> 00:05:10.710
And then I'll probably do
choice C in the next video,

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:14.380
because I don't want to spend
too much time in each video.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.300
So what answer
choice D telling us?

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.460
So let me write it down here.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.864
Choice D is telling
us-- so we don't

00:05:20.864 --> 00:05:22.280
know, we have to
see if it's true,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.240
that the argument
of z minus z1 is

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:34.320
equal to the argument
of z2 minus z1.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.700
So let's think a little
bit about this right now.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.870
So once again, they
tell us, we already

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.740
figured out what z
minus z1 is equal to.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.420
It's equal to this
business over here.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.710
So this statement is
equivalent to the statement

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:54.110
that the argument of z minus z1,
which is t times z2 minus z1,

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.920
leveraging our algebra
in the last video,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.810
t times z2 minus z1.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.750
Is this equal to the
argument of z2 minus z1?

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.640
Well, once again, let's draw
our Argand diagram here.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.460
Actually, we could leverage
the same Argand diagram.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.860
In green right here,
we have z2 minus z1.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.797
It's argument would be
this angle right over here.

00:06:22.797 --> 00:06:26.480
It would be this angle, phi.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.350
This is z2 minus z1.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.840
That's that angle.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.240
T times z2 minus
z1 is just going

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.400
to be the scaled down version
of it, what we have an orange.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.170
Now clearly, this is
just-- t is positive,

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.920
so it's not pointing
in another direction.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.255
This is just a scaled
down version of this.

00:06:43.255 --> 00:06:47.184
This vector and this vector,
or this complex number

00:06:47.184 --> 00:06:48.600
and this complex
number, are going

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.730
to point in the same direction,
so their angles are the same.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.680
T-- let me do it-- this orange
vector is this right over here,

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.510
or that orange complex number
is this right over here.

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.350
This is t times z2 minus z1.

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:07.507
And then the green one, just to
be clear, z2 minus z1, is that.

00:07:07.507 --> 00:07:09.090
They're clearly in
the same direction.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.180
They clearly have
the same argument.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:19.735
So choice D another
correct choice.

00:07:19.735 --> 00:07:21.110
Now I'm going to
leave you there.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.927
In the next video, we're going
to see if choice C works.
