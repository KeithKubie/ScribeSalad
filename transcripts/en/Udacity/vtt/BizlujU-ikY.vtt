00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Why we really love thinking about these sort of things? This option is not right.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The reason this is not right is this has no electric field anywhere.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Clearly, if I put a positive charge in the middle somewhere,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
it will go to the right towards the negative charge so that can't be right.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
There must be some electric field, but on this one, this one has a weird shape.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
According to this one, if I put a charge here, it would fill a force upwards, it looks like.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now, that doesn't make sense. It should be attracted more towards the negative charge.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
There's no reason for to go up so that's wrong. These two look very similar.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's just the matter of what they point to the positive or point towards the negative,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and the correct answer is they should point towards the negative.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
One thing that's really interesting is to look at the strength of the electric field

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and how we see that with these pictures.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So for example, right between these two charges, the field would be very strong.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You can see there's a high density of field lines here.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In this one little drawing I made, this little shape, three field lines have gone through.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They are all tightly packed together. Tightly packed field lines mean a strong field.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Way out over here, I can draw a similar area, and no field lines are going through.

00:01:00.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The electric field would be very weak over here.
