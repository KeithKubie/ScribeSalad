JEN PERSON: Hello, I'm Jen
Person for the "Developer

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.320
Show."

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.540
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.280
news from Google.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.530
The Android Dev Summit
happened last week

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.920
at the Computer History Museum
in Mountain View, California.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.530
The team celebrated
10 years of Android

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.590
and shared updates to
Kotlin, Jetpack, Android

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.610
Studio, App Bundles, and of
course talked about Foldables.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.310
For all the details and a
link to the session videos,

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.250
follow the link in
the description below.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.970
Last week, the team introduced
both the AI Hub and Kubeflow

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.070
Pipelines to help make
AI simpler, faster,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.540
and more useful.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.950
AI Hub has plug
and play ML content

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.880
including pipelines, Jupyter
notebooks, TensorFlow modules,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.240
and more.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.470
Kubeflow Pipelines is a
new component of Kubeflow

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.390
that packages ML code
just like building an app,

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.430
so that it's reusable to other
users across an organization.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.970
For more details on both,
head on over to the link.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.600
Cloud Scheduler is a fully
managed cron job service

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.230
that allows any application
to invoke batch/big data,

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.050
and cloud infrastructure
operations-- essentially,

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.830
a modern managed cron service
for automated batch jobs.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.380
And it's now available.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.690
A link to the Quick
Start is on the post.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.080
Containerd is an industry
standard container runtime

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.750
and Dockers core
runtime component.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.480
It's now available in beta
on Containerd Optimized

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.960
OS for Kubernetes engine 1.11.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.280
Example commands and a link to
the user guide are on the post.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.460
The 2018 Go User survey
is open for responses

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.320
until November 30.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.710

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.610
and help us create
the best programming

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.700
language that fits the needs and
desires of the people closest

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.360
to it.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.010
That's you.

I'm Jen Person for
the "Developer Show."

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.730
Thanks for watching, and
we'll see you next week.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.720
Sometimes I'm walking around.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.290
I'm like, why are
people staring at me?

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.748
And then I realize
it's because I'm

00:02:00.748 --> 00:02:02.960
sort of dressed like a child.
