00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.350
MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.140
interesting developer community.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.290
has asked this question.

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.680
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.280
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.930
answer show.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.890
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.180
AMANDA SURYA: All right.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.870
Well, welcome everybody to our
session on Content API for

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:28.700
Shopping office hour.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.710
I am Amanda Surya.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.509
I'm a Developer Relations
Manager for

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.590
Google Commerce products.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.110
DANNY HERMES: And I'm Danny
Hermes, as you all may already

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.860
know, Developer Programs
Engineer on Google Shopping.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.650
So thanks for joining
us today.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.910
Amanda's got some questions that
we're going to be going

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.180
over covering some things that
people have been asking on the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.450
forum and also some recent
developments in Google

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.280
Shopping as we go forward.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.010
And if people have questions who
are viewing this remotely,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.790
please feel free to add them
to our Moderator queue.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.630
So--

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.460
AMANDA SURYA: All right.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.349
So there's this question in our
forum recently about the

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.600
benefits of switching from
existing data feed

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.340
infrastructure to using the
content API for shopping.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.940
Can you talk more about that?

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:14.650
DANNY HERMES: Yeah.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.540
So first I wanted to say we
did a video last October.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.300
And I mentioned this in
the forum as well.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.860
And you can see the screenshare
of the YouTube

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.410
video here that I'm sharing
in the Hangout.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.390
And we compare and contrast
feeds in the content API and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.950
kind of cut out firm use cases
where you might actually be

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.270
more interested in
the content API.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.280
And some of them were actually
expounded upon by Andrew from

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.040
Zazzle in the forum.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.720
And he actually explained what
they used to do, what they do

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.670
now, what some of the downfalls
are, and how the

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.270
pros outweigh the cons.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:59.750
So this actually speaks directly
to our best practices

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.790
because the best practices kind
of point to why you might

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.760
want to make the switch, or why
maybe you might not make

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.889
the switch, or why it might not
be necessary for you to

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:09.530
make the switch.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.690
So I have it pulled up here,
the very first part of the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.510
best practices page lists
when to use the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.380
content API for shopping.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.152
So--

00:02:21.152 --> 00:02:23.150
AMANDA SURYA: So when
should we use it?

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.910
DANNY HERMES: Exactly.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.315
So there are sort of
four use cases.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:30.660
The first use case obviously
is when you want to be

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.210
programmatic, when you don't
actually want to have human

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.300
interaction or you don't
actually want to be uploading

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.410
something by hand.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.442
AMANDA SURYA: If you
have a lot of--

00:02:43.442 --> 00:02:44.270
DANNY HERMES: Right.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.120
Or maybe you just have an
automated system and you want

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.930
it to stay automated, right?

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.930
Obviously, there are
ways to do this

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.580
already with feeds files.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.180
But it requires manually
creating spreadsheets, or

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.000
comma-separated value sheets, or
some other column-formatted

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.720
feed, and then using FTP to
programmatically upload it.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.930
And then, of course, there are
all these other issues.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.520
Another nice-to-have feature,
which we certainly emphasize

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.360
in that video and we emphasize
here as well, is the fact that

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.060
you get immediate feedback back
from the API rather than

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.790
when you're using feeds.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.930
Feedback is asynchronous.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.510
And it comes in an email
summary, whereas feedback from

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.240
the API is immediate, on the
order of half a second.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.710
And it is for every single
item in your particular

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.850
request that's being
given feedback.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.110
And one of the main things that
Andrew emphasized and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.450
that a lot of people making
the switch, the original

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.330
poster was asking-- they
said they had a

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.000
million and a half products.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.550
Well, if you're sending feeds,
and even if you're sending

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.120
them once an hour and your feeds
are getting processed in

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.760
that hour, it's still an hour
out of date for some of the

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.220
products that were updated
at the very beginning.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.269
So what they said at Zazzle
was they actually had some

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.980
merchants who were upset by the

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.670
infrequency of these updates.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.080
And by using the content API,
they're actually able to get

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.740
these updates in almost
immediately rather than

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.620
waiting for the feed to get
processed and then the data to

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.820
get pushed back through.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.290
And a final use case, which I'll
also touch on briefly,

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.120
was if you have multiple
subaccounts.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.570
And going to the merchant center
and clicking through

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.480
all these subaccounts
is infeasible.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.370
So even if you had multiple
people working on it, once you

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.760
exceed probably 10, 20
subaccounts, it's not really

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.740
very possible for human beings
to go in and make sure

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.520
particular changes are actually
as desired by the

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.930
client or the end user that
you're actually managing

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.690
product data for.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.960
So the second part of this
document is actually the best

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.980
practices themselves, how to
actually go ahead and use the

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.110
content API.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.570
And the very first one says
don't use the API as

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.350
you would use feeds.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.620
So, obviously, this is sort of
like if you're on our side of

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.890
the fence, don't straddle the
fence type of recommendation.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.720
But it actually shines some
light on why you might want to

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.280
make the switch.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.890
in the feeds world, like I
previously mentioned, you have

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.460
to send your entire feed.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.970
So you have to send the things
that don't change at all.

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:43.650
You have to send all
the new things.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.530
You have to send the updates.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.730
And you have to make sure
the things you're

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:47.500
deleting aren't in there.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.600
Well, with the content API you
don't have to do that.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.190
So all you have to do
with the content

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.830
API is send the changes.

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.990
And that's about all I'm going
to say about best practices.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.890
Or actually, the fourth bullet
point in how to use the

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.280
content API for shopping is a
caveat that Andrew noted in

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.470
his response, which
is actually a

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.050
pretty important caveat.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.000
So by default, products, whether
they're inserted via

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.890
feeds or via the content API,
they can't expire in

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.060
more than 30 days.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.580
So the longest expiration you
can have for a product that

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.280
you insert or update
is 30 days.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.750
And so if you're using the
content API, you're not

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.580
actually sending updates for
products that don't change.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.010
Well, if for some reason part
of your inventory hasn't

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.820
changed in 30 days, on day 31 if
you don't send any updates,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.550
that product will disappear
and eventually be garbage

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.070
collected and actually be out of
your inventory rather than

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:46.180
showing as expired in
your inventory.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:49.520
So it's actually important when
you make the switch to

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.100
change this frame of mind from
I need to send all my product

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:56.690
data all the time to I need
to send my updates

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.170
whenever they happen.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:02.690
And I also need to make sure
that my infrequently updating

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:07.190
products don't get obsoleted
via an expiration date.

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:09.850
So it was a great question.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.510
And the poster also had another
question, which we're

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.820
actually going to
jump right to.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.706
So--

00:07:17.706 --> 00:07:18.870
AMANDA SURYA: Right.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:21.680
So let's switch gear
a little bit.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:26.102
There is another question,
different question about our

00:07:26.102 --> 00:07:33.510
Java sample code, and what we
currently have, what we

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:37.350
currently provide, for a
developer who's using Java and

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.460
wants to use the content API for
shopping, and what's our

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.200
plan forward in terms
of resources.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.160
DANNY HERMES: Sure.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.520
So people who look at our
Developer Resources in our

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.280
documentation will notice that
there's a Java Developer's

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.320
Guide, a .NET Developer's Guide,
a Python Developer's

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.960
Guide, and PHP Developer's
Guide.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.380
And people who know all four
languages might look at the

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.570
Java Developer's Guide and
think, we don't like Java

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:02.830
developers.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:04.170
But that's not the case.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.190
We're a small team.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.890
It's something we're aware of
that is a bit lagging behind

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.720
the other three.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.900
But our sample is certainly a
workable starting point for

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.400
actual working Java code.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:23.370
So the PHP library is sort
of a special case.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:27.470
We manage our own small PHP
library just for shopping.

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.660
But for .NET and Python, there
are large gdata libraries.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.730
So Python is
gdata-python-client.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.465
And for .NET it's
google-gdata.

00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:40.390
.NET must have gotten there
first for grabbing that name.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.780
But for Java, we don't really
have any equivalent library

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.280
that we recommend
for merchants.

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.680
However, one exists.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.310
Just like there's a
gdata-python-client, there's a

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.320
gdata-java-client.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.600
And for actual gdata APIs, other
than the content API for

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:05.140
shopping that are implemented
there, the way the code is

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:08.120
implemented-- for example, the
way the HTTP requests are

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.940
formed and sent--

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.310
it uses an external
library that

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.040
obviously works with HTTP.

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.200
Similarly, for doing
authentication like client

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:24.800
login, OAuth, AuthSub, OAuth
1.0, or 2.0, that is, it uses

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.510
a JAR coming from a different
Google client library.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:33.190
And this is something that the
original poster, Rich,

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:34.880
actually asked about.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:39.570
So first I want to say that all
these dependencies in the

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.880
sample are actually consistent
with what the

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.620
gdata-java-client requires.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.080
But the fact that we have sort
of hand-held data classes is

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:51.730
just a symptom of us
being a bit behind.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.450
So we certainly are working
right now actively on getting

00:09:55.450 --> 00:10:00.390
support into the library and
actually updating the section

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:01.700
in the Developer's
Guide about Java.

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.770
A few more things that I
want to say about this.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:12.980
So first of all, the original
poster asked about the

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.810
difference between this
gdata library

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:17.880
and these new libraries.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.590
And he quoted some statement in
the google-api-java-client

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:26.930
library about how Google
is updating to

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.790
discovery-based APIs.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:38.010
And so I actually talk a bit
about all of this in a video

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:38.730
that I recorded.

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.270
We actually have a playlist of
all of our videos for content

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:45.040
API developers, and you
should see that

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.310
flashing across your screen.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.990
This specific video where I talk
about Auth and OAuth 2.0

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.510
and some of these other
mechanisms is called Getting

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.560
Started with Google Shopping.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:01.470
And there should be a short
link to the YouTube video

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.800
flashing across your screen
for that as well.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.120
I actually go through the Auth
flow in Python around the

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.187
18-minute mark.

00:11:08.187 --> 00:11:09.975
It takes about 22 minutes.

00:11:09.975 --> 00:11:11.316
AMANDA SURYA: Right.

00:11:11.316 --> 00:11:19.450
DANNY HERMES: So the difference
between gdata APIs

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:25.410
and these other APIs is just
sort of the newer Google APIs

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:26.270
are exactly that.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:26.990
They're newer.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:30.630
So gdata uses sort of
an older framework.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.130
And we certainly don't have any
estimations on a timeline

00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:35.220
or anything like that.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.360
But for the time being,
the content

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.090
API is a gdata library.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.700
So that is the target
for developers.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.790
You shouldn't be targeting this
new library that exists,

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.920
but it's not actually intended
for gdata APIs.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.990
So you should actually
be targeting

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:52.190
what's in the sample.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.500
And finally, the last question
about why OAuth?

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:56.700
Why not client login?

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.630
Why not some of these
other ones?

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.670
So there are a few things
to say about that.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.870
But most importantly, we
announced on April 20, as you

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:09.580
may be able to see in the screen
I'm sharing, that along

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.135
with some other older Google
APIs, the actual Auth APIs ,

00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:16.390
other than OAuth 2.0, are
being deprecated.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:21.010
So client login, AuthSub and
OAuth 1.0 are all being

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:21.910
deprecated.

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:26.400
And I believe April
20, 2015 is when

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.600
they're officially retired.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.890
But between now and then, they
are to be considered

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:31.810
deprecated.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:34.510
And I would highly recommend
against developing

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.250
with them in mind.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:37.780
Rather, develop with
OAuth 2.0 in mind.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:38.200
AMANDA SURYA: Right.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.310
DANNY HERMES: And this is
something we certainly get

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.430
plenty of questions about.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.640
And we're happy to go more in
depth about if people still

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.723
aren't understanding things.

00:12:46.723 --> 00:12:47.328
AMANDA SURYA: Yeah.

00:12:47.328 --> 00:12:51.320
And definitely feel free post
your additional questions

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.665
around OAuth 2.0 the
forum as well--

00:12:54.665 --> 00:12:55.480
DANNY HERMES: Yeah.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.716
AMANDA SURYA: --if you have
concerns about that.

00:12:57.716 --> 00:12:58.300
All right.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:03.600
So another question that we
recently got is about

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:03.930
destination.

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:04.695
DANNY HERMES: Yep.

00:13:04.695 --> 00:13:10.570
AMANDA SURYA: So in the spec,
there's three supported

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:12.070
destination values--

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.960
product search, product
ads, commerce search.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.460
Can you talk more about that?

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.760
There are other valid
values as well.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.430
What are those and how
can people use it?

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.410
DANNY HERMES: Right.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.650
So this question from Thor--

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:31.900
love the name--

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.130
was a good question.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.930
So he was asking, I'm seeing
some other values like

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:41.360
Shopping API and Affiliate
Network.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.790
And I'm wondering why these
aren't in the documentation.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.670
So these attributes are not
valid for every account.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.510
So that's kind of why we don't
include them in our

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:50.300
documentation.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.050
So some people who also have
used the search API for

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.420
shopping may be familiar with
the Google Affiliate Network.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.120
And so product data, you can
actually make valid for the

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.100
destination Google Affiliate
Network if you're actually in

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.400
the Google Affiliate Network.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.130
And by the same token, if you
elect, your product data can

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:14.770
also be consumed by all users
of the shopping API--

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.920
excuse me, the search
API for shopping.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.710
And that's why the shopping API
destination is a possible

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:21.720
value as well.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.730
But for the time being, products
ads, products search,

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.790
and commerce search are these
valid destinations.

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:31.740
So a bit more about how
to use destinations.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:36.750
So Thor was having some issues
where he was getting errors

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.490
that he didn't really
understand why.

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:44.850
So if no destinations are sent,
then by default we say

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.610
you have to require at least one
destination as valid for

00:14:47.610 --> 00:14:48.510
your product data.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:52.450
And so the default value for
a required destination is

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.580
product search.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:56.960
And the way required
destinations work is if your

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.730
product doesn't validate for
that destination, then your

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:00.980
response will be rejected.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:01.870
And you'll get a failure.

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:03.990
So your product data will
never get uploaded or

00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:07.000
inserted, whatever term
you're looking to use.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.550
But whatever it is, it won't
end up in the database

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.260
corresponding to your merchant
center account.

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.210
So what Thor was doing was he
was asking for validate

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.920
destination for product search
with nothing else.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.970
So this default value required
for product search was also

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.620
being inserted.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:31.440
So the API doesn't allow you
to validate and require the

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.380
same destination.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.910
So that's why his requests
were getting rejected.

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:38.280
And for those who aren't
familiar, what it means to

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.840
validate rather than
required--

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:43.070
so I mentioned this term
"validate" when I was talking

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.110
about required.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.090
So are they the same?

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:45.730
Are they different?

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:50.010
Well, required will go ahead and
validate that destination.

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.590
And if it fails validation, it
will reject the request.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:57.510
On the other hand, validate
destination will go ahead, and

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.750
it'll validate the destination
in question.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:04.110
But rather than rejecting the
request if the actual product

00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:07.580
data is valid for some other
destination, it won't get

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:09.530
inserted for the destination
that

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.030
you asked to be validated.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:15.250
But you will get the errors back
for why it wasn't valid.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:18.480
So it's a way for people who
maybe aren't as strict about a

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:23.080
particular destination, maybe
shopping API, for example.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.860
But it allows for them to
actually attempt to get the

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:30.120
data put in there and then find
out why, for some reason,

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:33.010
the given product or set of
products weren't valid.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:35.710
And then, of course, there's
this third value which Thor

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.090
didn't ask about but "excluded
destination." And that's

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.420
exactly what it sounds like.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.760
You don't want your product
data surfacing in that

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:43.970
destination.

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.420
And it just won't
be validated.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.620
It won't be inserted.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.490
And then, there was sort of a
third question that Thor had.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.240
And that was, given the move
from Google Product Search to

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.350
Google Shopping, what's going to
happen with product ads and

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.820
product search, and where
are we going with that?

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.100
So that's something I want
people to know that we're

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.930
thinking about.

00:17:03.930 --> 00:17:05.900
But we don't have anything
to say at this time.

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:10.160
But it's certainly something
that we're aware of.

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.010
And I'm going to--

00:17:11.010 --> 00:17:13.879
AMANDA SURYA: Speaking of
that, there's actually a

00:17:13.879 --> 00:17:20.940
series of webinars that are
Google Shopping, Product

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.349
Marketing Managers, and

00:17:23.349 --> 00:17:25.560
Partnership Teams put together.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:33.960
And if you're wondering about
what it means, how to turn on

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:37.880
product listing apps on your
product listings, these series

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.465
or webinars, we highly recommend
you to review them.

00:17:41.465 --> 00:17:46.170
It's a great resource to get
started at and also paint the

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:50.470
bigger picture in terms of
where Google Shopping is

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.840
moving forward.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:58.740
And you can view the series
in the YouTube channel.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.480
Or you can follow John
Venverloh, who is in the

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.230
partnership team.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:09.800
And he basically, on his G+
page, lists all the series of

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:13.050
webinars that he and
his team has done.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.720
And it's a great resource,
again, for some of you who

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:20.020
want to get a better
understanding of the overall

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:24.135
picture and interim materials
to Google Shopping.

00:18:24.135 --> 00:18:25.155
DANNY HERMES: Yep.

00:18:25.155 --> 00:18:28.050
And we'll be posting some links
in that YouTube video

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.800
after the fact.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.840
So if you're actually watching
the YouTube video after the

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.160
fact, the link should be
in the description.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.540
We'll link to John's page and
the specific posts that he has

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.710
linked as well as to the channel
where you can find

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:42.606
some of these videos.

00:18:42.606 --> 00:18:43.630
AMANDA SURYA: All right.

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:49.060
So those are pretty much
the questions that

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.940
we've seen in the forum.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.165
And there are no questions
in the Google Moderator.

00:18:55.165 --> 00:18:57.410
So I think we're off
the hook here.

00:18:57.410 --> 00:18:58.620
DANNY HERMES: All righty.

00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:03.450
AMANDA SURYA: And for those of
you listening in, thank you

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:04.770
for joining us.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.170
And if you want to learn more
about the content API for

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:13.940
shopping as well as our other
commerce APIs, visit

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.300
developers.google.com/commerce
and all the information and

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.730
documentation should be there.

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.410
And we're doing this biweekly,
so hope to

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.180
see you in two weeks.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.290
DANNY HERMES: How many
days are in August?

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.684
30 or 31?

00:19:28.684 --> 00:19:30.148
AMANDA SURYA: 31?

00:19:30.148 --> 00:19:31.130
DANNY HERMES: I think
there's 31.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:35.840
So September 13th is
14 days from now.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:36.250
All righty.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:37.150
Thanks, everyone.

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:37.850
AMANDA SURYA: All right.

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:38.650
DANNY HERMES: And
have a nice day.

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:39.520
AMANDA SURYA: Thank you.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:50.000
