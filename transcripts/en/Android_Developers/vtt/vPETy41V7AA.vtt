00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.460
RETO MEIER: All right.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.080
Thank you very much for joining
us, GDG Oslo, for our

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.770
second GDG App Clinic.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.920
My name's Reto Meier.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.500
I'm a developer advocate
on the Android team.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.720
And joining me live from
New York is Roman

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.090
Nurik and Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.160
IAN NI-LEWIS: Roman--

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.640
did I mention that we're
in New York?

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.820
Roman's in New York,
and so am I.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.520
RETO MEIER: Very nice.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.850
So we're going to take a look
at a few apps from the

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.010
excellent developers in Oslo.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.440
You've got your work
cut out for you.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.550
The guys from Prague we looked
at last time were pretty

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.160
impressive.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.270
So we'll have to see how well
you do for the North.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.200
So without further ado, I'd like
to invite the developer

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.930
of NSB to come up and tell us a
little bit out their app and

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.730
about themselves.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.600
And we can go from there.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.510
JON: Hello?

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.420
RETO MEIER: Hello, welcome
to the show.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.940
JON: Thank you.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.520
Greetings from Norway.

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.010
RETO MEIER: So tell us a little
bit about your app.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.900
And introduce yourself,
of course, please.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.370
JON: Yeah.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.180
My name is Jon.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.310
I'm from NSB.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.260
I'm a digital consultant.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.642
And I'm going to talk
about the NSB

00:01:11.642 --> 00:01:14.500
app, which we submitted.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.020
It's the 5.0 version, so
it's not released yet.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.553
The current version
is 4.04, actually.

00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:26.030
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:34.510
And so the new version has
a flat design and so on.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.350
And the meaning with the app
is for the Norwegian train

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.440
company called NSB to increase
ticket availability, get

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.220
real-time travel updates,
and the ability to get a

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.790
ticket on the phone.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:49.440
RETO MEIER: So this is NSB.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.260
So this is the new front page.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.200
And as you can see, it shares a
little of the same thematic

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.510
elements as the previous
version.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.300
But we've kind of lost that
dashboard pattern with the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.930
big, giant, oversized buttons
which was one of the bits of

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.300
feedback that had beforehand.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.870
So already, this is looking
a lot nicer.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.985
IAN NI-LEWIS: The design
here is really good.

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:09.430
It's really clean.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.850
There's a lot of things
to like about it.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.200
The main thing that bothered me
when we first loaded it up

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.990
is that so many things
are blank.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.400
So for instance, if you press
the button labeled Train

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.060
journey, now you've used it a
little bit in the sense that

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.200
you have a couple
of favorites.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.492
I see they begin with A, just
like my favorites do.

00:02:33.492 --> 00:02:41.440
But before you have anything
in the favorites or the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.380
journey, or before you've
performed any search, that

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.630
area below the search
bar is simply blank.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.170
However, if you click in the
search bar, which you might

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.430
want to do right now, I
don't know actually

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.170
what's going to happen.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.620
So that brings up a list
of matching stations.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.690
And if you don't have anything
in the search

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.865
bar, they're all there.

00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:05.020
So my first piece of advice is
that should always appear.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.920
It's just logical.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.270
There's no reason that it should
suddenly appear when

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.752
you click on the search bar
versus not being there to

00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:13.002
begin with.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.270
The favorites are more
or less the same way.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.190
When you don't have any
favorites, it's literally just

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.440
a blank screen.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.660
And the user has no way to
interact with it, which is

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.320
disturbing.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.570
So my suggestion would be that
you actually have something at

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.400
the top of the screen that,
for instance, an

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.390
Add Favorites item.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.490
I don't know how you go about
it, Roman, but I'm a big fan

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.520
of lists whose last item
is Add Another Item.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.320
ROMAN NURIK: That's kind of
following the principle of

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.910
direct manipulation, that the
actions that you can take on

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.310
the thing you're working on are
directly on top of what

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.430
you're working on.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.170
So it's kind of like if you
remove an item from a list, so

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.190
swipe it away.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.342
If you add an item to the list,
it's at the bottom of

00:04:03.342 --> 00:04:05.070
the list where that
item had appeared.

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.150
You've added it to
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:18.329
IAN NI-LEWIS: So if you plan
a journey, I think this is

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.589
really where it shines.

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:24.093
You set a--

00:04:24.093 --> 00:04:27.280
RETO MEIER: I'm getting a
server error, which is

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.720
unfortunate.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.700
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, you
can't see it on there.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.920
So now you search for
a couple stations.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.570
You plan a journey from them.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:43.230
And with one exception, I think
it's a wonderful UI.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.930
Unfortunately, with Reto's
server error, the one

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.950
exception keeps popping up over
and over, which is the

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.810
"Your ticket is valid
from" spinner.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.550
Props to making a spinner
that's flat.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.700
One thing we've noticed, though,
is that even though

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.540
the spinner, back in 2006,
was just really trendy,

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.920
it hasn't aged well.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.490
It's not actually as convenient
a UI as you think

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.060
it might be.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.590
And you've noticed that we've
moved off the spinner in some

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.130
of our apps towards more direct
things like numeric

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.260
keypads that seem to
work a lot better.

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.960
ROMAN NURIK: And sometimes for
calendars, especially,

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.410
[INAUDIBLE] free, right?

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:30.710
So you can actually use 30-day
month calendars that you flip

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.670
up and down between the
different months.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.220
It's a little more square, so
it works better in different

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.300
aspect ratios.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.055
It's scrollable, so it
definitely works for longer

00:05:40.055 --> 00:05:42.840
content with the
longer spaces.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.360
But it's just really easy to
wrap your head around.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.460
So you can actually visually
see the days of the week.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.060
I think days of the week are
one of the most important

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.860
aspects of choosing a date,
especially when you're

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:55.910
planning a trip.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.830
You're probably planning a
trip around a weekend, or

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.260
around a specific date
like going out or

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.950
[INAUDIBLE], whatever.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.740
And visually seeing the place
in the week that you're

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.470
choosing something will give you
that extra bit of content.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.450
So I definitely recommend
something

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.860
like a month calendar.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.550
I think we've started using the
month, a 30-day view, in

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.915
some of our apps.

00:06:17.915 --> 00:06:18.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.370
When I see something like this,
my first thought is, oh,

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:27.322
I guess your project manager
has an iPhone.

00:06:27.322 --> 00:06:28.572
JON: I do.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.670
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.970
It's unfortunate that we can't
quite get to the last bit

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:39.330
where we actually
see the ticket.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:43.560
But I think one of the things
which I noticed in the

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.840
previous version, and I've seen
a little bit of it here

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.896
as well, is that every time
you do something which

00:06:47.896 --> 00:06:50.630
requires contact with the
server, we get a little

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.100
flash-up dialog telling us
that we're communicate

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.650
something with the server.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.930
That's something which I really
think takes away from

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:58.920
the magic of how mobile
phones work.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.860
We all know that it's connected
to the internet, and

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:02.240
it needs to talk to
your server and

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.625
do all of that stuff.

00:07:03.625 --> 00:07:05.990
You kind of want your users to
think that it's just a magic

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.740
thing where your phone
just knows how

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:08.930
to pull train things.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.550
And the fact that there's an
internet connection and mobile

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:12.980
telephony all about
is just kind of

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.400
completely hidden away.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.390
So you want to try and make
sure that you're not

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.520
displaying any of those sorts
of dialogs, particularly

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:22.250
because usually, they just
come up really quickly.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.830
You have sort of a flash
of talking to server.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:29.135
And if it all works,
it flashes away.

00:07:29.135 --> 00:07:31.770
And you just kind of think
as a user, what was that?

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.285
Was that important?

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.070
Should I have read that?

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.410
So you really want to try and
just disguise all of that,

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:38.220
unless something goes wrong.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.800
And if it does go wrong, try and
be as descriptive as you

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.380
can in a way that doesn't rely
on understanding how your app

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.390
is being implemented
to your user.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.440
So something like, unable
to buy train tickets.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.420
No connection to
internet found.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.130
Something like that is more
useful than, server

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.210
communication error, where the
user is like, I don't know

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.375
what any of that means.

00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:01.250
Did I do something wrong?

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.270
Rather than, OK, well, I can
try again later because my

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:08.145
connectivity is down, which they
may be more easily able

00:08:08.145 --> 00:08:10.270
to understand.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.910
IAN NI-LEWIS: So we just got the
schedule, which you may be

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.880
able to see here if I can
hold it still enough.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.010
I realize that's coming
through very well.

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.900
You can see that's a really
clean design.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.000
It's got the nice red
band at the top.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.520
Everything else is monochrome,
but there's a fairly good

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.720
differentiation using fonts
and highlighting.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:36.450
I think based on the specific
application, and I'm not

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:42.700
familiar with the trains of
Norway at all, but I can

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.760
readily believe that they are
all color-coded in different

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.830
shades of gray.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.860
But if they're not, and if
there is any kind of

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:54.800
color-coding, that might be a
really nice additional effect

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.020
is to add some more information
that's going to

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.400
help people find the platform
for the particular train that

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.480
they're looking for.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.110
But this does a pretty
good job of not

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.350
being too busy, I think.

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.040
I don't know.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:11.300
If I were to redesign this, I
might just use a thin font on

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.750
the city names.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.530
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, that's one
of the best ways to add a

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:20.100
touch of elegance to your apps
as well as help even further

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.310
the visual hierarchy that
you get from text.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.630
Use different weights of Roboto,
different sizes--

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:31.070
not too many different sizes, at
most maybe two or really at

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:32.426
most three different sizes.

00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:34.873
But different font weights would
really help [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:34.873 --> 00:09:35.800
the hierarchy.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.510
But yeah, like you said,
the hierarchy is

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.850
very evident as is.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.402
IAN NI-LEWIS: I think Roman
would probably say that

00:09:45.402 --> 00:09:48.624
putting the entire time in
the same weight is wrong.

00:09:48.624 --> 00:09:51.303
Of course, the hours should
be bold, and the minutes--

00:09:51.303 --> 00:09:53.030
just kidding.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.150
Yeah, this looks really good.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.400
And especially, I don't know if
you can see it, but I love

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.040
the way that the platform
is in a little box.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:04.430
They make it really easy to see
it and also is a little

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:06.390
kind of elegant.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.360
So that's very nice.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.330
RETO MEIER: Yeah, I
have to say, the

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.536
biggest feedback I have--

00:10:11.536 --> 00:10:13.750
I have a page of notes which
I've tried to take

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.150
on each of the apps.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.420
And they were all based
on version 4.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.170
And version 5 fixes
all of them.

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.870
So my feedback is nice
job on version 5.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.310
You've really updated the app,
brought it into the modern age

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.780
of Android where it's action
bar, Holo theme, a nice,

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:31.970
clean, flat line.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:33.790
There's a lack of clutter.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.410
Simple, intuitive navigation.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.870
So all of the little niggles
that I had around making it

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.010
sort of more of a modern,
up-to-date app, I think you've

00:10:41.010 --> 00:10:42.100
absolutely nailed.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.200
So nicely done.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.600
ROMAN NURIK: The one thing I
wanted to mention is about the

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.710
home screen.

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:49.180
We spent a little bit
of time talking

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.720
about onboarding flows.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.540
And I think that outside of the
Google playlist thing, the

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.490
very first thing you see in the
app is probably your most

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.510
important screen.

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.140
It's almost a hero moment.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.960
So I would spend even more time
on this landing screen to

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.980
tweak it a bit.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.410
Right now, it feels
very static.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.470
That's one of the problems, one
of the reasons we've moved

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.710
away from the dashboard pattern
and anything that

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.110
basically just has
links on it.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.680
We've moved more towards a
content-driven home screen.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.760
So one of the things that you
may want to consider doing is

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.880
things like profile.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.800
You want to move it to the
action bar, since it is

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.340
navigation, but it's often
treated as an action.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.580
It's kind of like a common thing
is to put the profile in

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.340
the overflow or something.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.640
And then things like "View
ticket," if you don't have a

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.570
ticket, is there any reason to
show that, I'm guessing?

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:41.750
But you could also just
have it as a--

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:44.070
I don't want to say card, but
have it as a scrollable item

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.880
you can get to.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.555
IAN NI-LEWIS: Another thing to
think about is, this would be

00:11:48.555 --> 00:11:51.070
a perfect opportunity
to use some of

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:53.910
the new action detection.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.930
Because if you know that the
person is in the middle of a

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:02.600
train journey, then probably the
first thing they want to

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.950
do is view a ticket.

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.996
That's probably why they pulled
it out of their pocket

00:12:05.996 --> 00:12:08.210
to begin with because
the conductor is

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:10.890
coming down the aisle.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.710
That would be a truly magical
moment to always see exactly

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.240
what you need and then perhaps
hide some of this other stuff

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.920
either on the action bar or in
a drawer or some other way,

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.040
some other well understood
way to access these

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.040
navigational tools.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:29.900
ROMAN NURIK: So it's almost
like Google Now tries to

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.862
predict what you may be
most interested in.

00:12:33.862 --> 00:12:39.620
Here, you may be able to say, if
you think that the user is

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.170
in a place where they
want to access that

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.960
ticket, show that ticket.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.350
Actually show the actual ticket
at the very top, and

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:49.760
then show other options like
favorites and then let's say

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.380
like even potentially place the
entire search screen or

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:56.800
the beginning of the search
process into this screen.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.370
So you basically give easy
access, immediate access to

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.470
the very first step of
each of those flows.

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:05.430
And then once the user decides
that, hey, yeah, I do want to

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:08.090
vies the full ticket, they just
touch that tile, and they

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:09.950
get taken to the full
ticket view.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.500
But then the position
is based on things

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.330
like activity detection.

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.990
IAN NI-LEWIS: Another thing
that I think would be

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:18.220
incredibly useful here but
significantly more work would

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:20.410
be integration with
a Map view.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:22.920
That's one of the things
I notice when I--

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:27.802
I frequently need transit in a
city that I'm unfamiliar with.

00:13:27.802 --> 00:13:29.880
And the first thing I'll do is
open my map and figure out

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.290
where I need to go, try to find
a station nearby and then

00:13:33.290 --> 00:13:36.280
get directions to that.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.160
So that's one thing that could
be really nice if you fell

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.080
that many of your users
might be going

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.170
to unfamiliar locations.

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:48.260
Of course, if they're going to
familiar locations, it's great

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.466
to just have those favorites
in hand.

00:13:51.466 --> 00:13:51.930
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.530
In fact, that's probably one
of the bits of feedback I

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:57.400
have, based on what Ian and
Roman have just been talking

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.410
about, is that right now, your
home screen kind of looks as

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:04.420
though it was designed based
on your API endpoints.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:08.100
So we have an API which lets us
call for the train journey.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.470
We have another one which lets
us retrieve our favorites, one

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.140
which gives us access
to our profile.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:15.460
But it's sort of data-driven
design.

00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:18.000
It would be really interesting
to see a reimagined version of

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.915
the home screen based around the
guidelines that Roman and

00:14:20.915 --> 00:14:24.330
Ian were talking about, which
is, what does a user want to

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:25.640
do when they open up the app?

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.640
What are they thinking?

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.760
What are the most likely things
for someone who uses

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.970
this every day, for someone
who is visiting Oslo?

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.270
How are they going to take
advantage of the app?

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:38.230
And try and think about
redesigning the UI from the

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:41.130
perspective of what you want
to do rather than what's

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:43.160
available for you to do.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:45.190
So I definitely agree.

00:14:45.190 --> 00:14:48.310
I think putting things like the
ticket on the bottom of

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:50.690
the main screen seems like
an obvious thing to me.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.110
If I have a ticket already, and
it's valid, have it there.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:56.750
And if I don't, it seems like
the most likely thing I want

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.170
to do with the app
is buy a ticket.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:01.500
So having a big plus symbol
there so that you can initiate

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.200
that action right from
the beginning seems

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.190
like it might be useful.

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.990
So yeah, I would consider
redesigning the home screen,

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:13.195
which is really the only thing
which hasn't changed much in

00:15:13.195 --> 00:15:16.850
the redesigns, to be more of a,
what is it that you think

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:19.360
people want to do, and reduce
the number of steps for them

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:21.730
to be able to get to the
specific action that they have

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.470
installed this app for.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.680
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now before we
move on, though, I want to

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.260
point out the one feature that
none of us talked about, but

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:33.500
which is really incredibly
well done, and that's

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.685
localization.

00:15:34.685 --> 00:15:37.090
RETO MEIER: Yes.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.140
IAN NI-LEWIS: We did not ask
for this app in English.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:45.240
But here it is, showing us
almost completely in English,

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.120
except for I don't know
what Ruter is.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.850
RETO MEIER: It's the name
of the company.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:49.220
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.320
Well, there you go.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.500
RETO MEIER: I wondered
the same.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.360
It's the equivalent of
Amtrak, I guess.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.210
But yeah.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:15:58.730
No, I absolutely,
totally agree.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.810
This is something which a lot
of people overlook when

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.300
they're building apps for a
specific application is they

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:06.820
figure, well, you don't
need to localize the

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.980
train app for Norway.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.890
It's going to be used by
Norwegian people--

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:14.500
except when it isn't, which is
what I found out when I was

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.220
traveling around Italy trying to
buy tickets on Trenitalia.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.310
And their website does
not localize to

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:21.070
anything but Italian.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.670
And that makes it an intriguing
challenge to buy

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.850
Eurail tickets in a
foreign country.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:26.730
IAN NI-LEWIS: Everybody
can read Italian.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.120
Come on.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:31.250
RETO MEIER: Well,
I prefer not to.

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:37.080
But yeah, this sort of thinking
as to who all your

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.680
potential users are is really,
really valuable because

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.670
suddenly, you have everyone
who's visiting is going to use

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.040
this app because it's
all localized.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.920
They feel comfortable.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.900
It looks familiar.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:47.170
It works in a familiar
way, and they

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.020
understand what it says.

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.090
So yeah, thank you
for localizing.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:53.400
It certainly makes our jobs
as reviewers easier.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.750
And I think it's going to help
to grow your audience of

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.710
potential users online
as well.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which languages
are you localized into?

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.340
JON: Sorry?

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.079
IAN NI-LEWIS: Which languages
do you have translations for

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:07.770
in your app?

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.530
JON: I think it's connected
through the

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.425
language in the phone.

00:17:11.425 --> 00:17:14.306
But I think it's only in
Norwegian in English.

00:17:14.306 --> 00:17:14.732
IAN NI-LEWIS: OK.

00:17:14.732 --> 00:17:17.640
You might want to add Chinese.

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.060
JON: Chinese?

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.500
OK, noted.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.750
RETO MEIER: Yeah, it's
an easy one.

00:17:24.214 --> 00:17:26.849
IAN NI-LEWIS: All the Chinese
[INAUDIBLE] sees this.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:28.372
RETO MEIER: That's true, yeah.

00:17:28.372 --> 00:17:29.350
All right, perfect.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:31.800
Thank you, Jon, and thank you
for your patience in letting

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.510
us detour around your app
and come back into it.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:38.090
Do you have anything else that
you'd like to add in terms of

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.830
responding to our feedback or
things which you have a plan

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.140
to do but perhaps haven't had
time to implement in the

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.200
current version?

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:45.990
JON: Not really.

00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:49.430
I'm going to take the notes back
to the team, and we'll

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.960
discuss it.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.280
RETO MEIER: Awesome.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.790
We're looking forward to seeing
version 5 when it comes

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:54.590
out for real.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.250
It's definitely a great job and
a really good update, so

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.626
nicely done.

00:17:58.626 --> 00:18:01.740
JON: Yeah, thank you Thank
you very much.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:01.950
ALEX: Hi.

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.910
I'm Alex.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.270
I'm the creator of
Phonelocator.

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.500
RETO MEIER: Hey, Alex.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:13.880
ALEX: This project started in
2007 on Symbian when Android

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.090
was just in its infancy.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:19.660
So the idea back then was to
track my motorcycle tour

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.710
around Europe.

00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:25.060
I wanted to show my friends back
home where I was, where

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.820
my friend was at well.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.740
So I made the app.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.780
It had no login, no nothing.

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:30.710
It just showed--

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:32.730
there was just a website, and
you could just see where this

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.500
one Nokia phone was.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.700
In those days, GPS on phones
was completely new.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.545
So quite late, actually, last
year, I released this Android

00:18:42.545 --> 00:18:48.665
version, which represents
about 120 hours of work.

00:18:48.665 --> 00:18:50.815
It has all the same features
in it that

00:18:50.815 --> 00:18:52.940
the Symbian one did.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.830
Which it kind to morphed into a
security product long before

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.230
it was built into your iPhone
or Android device.

00:18:59.230 --> 00:19:04.010
So you can send this phone a
text message containing the

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.725
word alarm.

00:19:04.725 --> 00:19:07.160
I think my friend's going
to try that now.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.370
And it will sound an alarm so
you can find the phone.

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:16.420
[ALARM]

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.860
ALEX: So it creates
a notification.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:20.950
You have to deactivate
the notification.

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:23.520
You can choose whether or not
you want to hide that message

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.470
so that the person who has the
phone can see it or not.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:32.060
You can set a passcode as well
so that the person who has the

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.180
phone has to type in a passcode
before they can

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.720
disable the alarm.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.560
It has a bugging message
feature.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:42.220
So if the SIM card on the phone
is changed, it will text

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.060
a pre-defined number saying,
this is the new number that's

00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.730
in the telephone.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.400
And of course, it periodically
updates its location So you

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.080
can see the time that
it's going to

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.470
update in, in 10 minutes.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:58.610
You have to be pretty
conservative with the updates.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.470
It was before this
new Google Play

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:04.520
services, low power stuff.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.630
I had to code it all myself to
try and decide whether it's

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:12.840
going to use GPS or Wi-Fi to
work out where the phone is.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:18.440
Yeah, so the Symbian version had
400,000 registered users.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.030
The Android version is
a fraction of that.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:25.670
Only a few thousands people
have used it, I think.

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:26.940
So yeah, that's Phonelocator.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.247
RETO MEIER: OK, nice, so thank
you for the update.

00:20:30.247 --> 00:20:33.490
So I had a few thoughts
based on my first

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:34.620
experience of using it.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:37.450
And I think probably the biggest
feedback I have is

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:40.360
that it's not immediately
obvious when you install it

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.100
what it does or how to use it.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.340
So without getting your
two-minute intro there, it's

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.470
not entirely clear.

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:52.370
You have to create a login, and
then it takes your GPS and

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:53.810
sends it to a server.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:56.290
But it's not immediately obvious
when I'm using the app

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:57.980
what it's doing with
any of that data.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:58.650
ALEX: What it does.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:20:59.490
RETO MEIER: Yeah, exactly.

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.550
So it sort of starts to get
you a little bit nervous.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:07.370
And also, the amount of time
it takes to get set up is

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:08.340
longer than you'd expect.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.230
You have to go to the website
to create this whole profile

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:11.940
and user name and--

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.400
ALEX: I knew you
would say that.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.780
So let me tell you why.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.030
It's not really an excuse.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.770
But there's some legacy there.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:24.750
This app was made before it was
actually standard to use

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:28.210
ACDP and JSON to actually
update.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:32.580
So it uses a really
low-bandwidth protocol to send

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.760
the updates to the server,
binary protocol.

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.070
And in those days, making
forms of things on

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.010
Symbian was hard work.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:41.210
So I thought, well, why not
just do it on the web?

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:44.290
And then when I came to do the
Android version, I nearly

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:47.240
changed it so it had a proper
login screen and everything.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.770
But in the end, I thought, oh,
I'll just use the same web

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.070
interface rather than
recoding it.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.840
But I take the point.

00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.640
It's not very intuitive.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.470
RETO MEIER: Well, see now,
you've got an advantage.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:03.457
You could actually take
advantage of the fact that

00:22:03.457 --> 00:22:06.100
you've procrastinated this
long and just use Google+

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:06.930
Sign-In instead.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:08.780
So then you don't have
to do the form or

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.160
anything like that.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.610
It gets simple.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:12.673
So you get rewarded for
having put it off.

00:22:12.673 --> 00:22:15.760
But that might be a neat way to
reduce the friction of that

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.360
initial sign-in for it.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.760
IAN NI-LEWIS: I would like to
say one thing about that.

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:23.260
So there's two things that are
really important about the

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:24.710
beginning of your app.

00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:27.590
First is that you can
do something without

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:28.770
having to log in.

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:32.280
That's something that is
difficult to do, but in this

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.050
case, for instance, there are
some features that you could

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:41.550
enable without logging in that
might give the user some idea

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.470
of what they're getting into.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.100
But the other thing is--

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.120
ALEX: So how could that look?

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:52.910
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, for
instance, in this case, you

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:56.510
can set your buddy message.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:59.310
I think there's a couple other
things, some settings and

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:00.200
things like that.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.300
Obviously, the app has
no functionality.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.170
But for instance, the screen
we're looking at now could

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:11.060
give some message like, would
have a next update in two

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.920
minutes if you were logged
in, which you're not.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.790
And then have a facility
for logging you in.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.440
The other thing that you want to
think about, though, is how

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:22.440
many clicks it takes
to log in.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.660
On the website form,
it's a lot.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:26.740
And--

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:29.870
ALEX: I f agree with the
previous comment.

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:31.490
It's got to change.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:35.745
This app is actually going to be
retired and replaced with a

00:23:35.745 --> 00:23:40.070
new brand that's something
completely awesome.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.240
ROMAN NURIK: Actually, a similar
thing you could do,

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.320
and this is all part of that
onboarding flow which is so

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.660
important, especially if
you ever get featured.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.320
A lot of people get into your
app that don't know about your

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.850
brand, don't know
what it does.

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:52.570
One of the things you could
do is say, here's

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:53.460
your current location.

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.000
Like let's say we're
in New York.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.600
And then maybe even show a
preview of the website.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.870
This is kind of crazy, but if
you show a preview of the

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:03.650
website showing the map with
your location, saying, here's

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:05.460
what you would see if you
were on a computer

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:06.380
and you had the service.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.860
You would see that your
phone is in New York.

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.710
So you could almost use the live
data and see where the

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.630
person is, because you
don't need a login

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:14.590
to get their location.

00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:17.530
And then just kind of show a
fake version of the website

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:18.000
showing that location.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.990
That might be some way of
communicating the value in a

00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:25.920
direct way, rather than
just talking about it.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: Remember that
we've done a lot of work to

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.150
make it easy to download and
install lots of apps.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:34.330
So one usage pattern we see a
lot is that people will search

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.930
for a term, install 5 or 10
apps that seem to have

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:44.075
associations with that term, and
then they will uninstall

00:24:44.075 --> 00:24:48.360
the ones that they don't like
after about 20 seconds of use.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:51.200
So the first 20 or 30 seconds
are absolutely crucial.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.010
In fact, I'd even say the first
five seconds is crucial.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.840
ALEX: OK, so it's just
like a web page.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.423
You've got a few seconds to
impress, and then that's it.

00:25:02.423 --> 00:25:04.300
You've blown it.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:05.550
IAN NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:10.260
ROMAN NURIK: On that point,
it's not even after you

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:10.630
install the app.

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:12.340
It's before you even
install the app.

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.150
So the screen shots, the app
icon on Google Play, the

00:25:16.150 --> 00:25:18.650
description, all of that is part
of that user experience,

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.510
that initial onboarding
experience.

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:24.250
The very first time the user has
any sort of communication

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.900
with your brand or any sort
of interaction with you is

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:27.700
through that.

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.900
So that is even before
you get to the app.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.460
ALEX: That's a very kind
way of putting it.

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.410
Thank you.

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:35.960
I've got a new brand.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.770
It's made by a designer,
not by me.

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:38.230
I'm a developer.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.746
And it looks really cool.

00:25:40.746 --> 00:25:41.560
RETO MEIER: Awesome.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.460
Thanks.

00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.460
ALEX: By the way, this
app is open source.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.450
So anybody who's watching and
wants to get involved, then

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:52.302
that would be brilliant,
if they can find me.

00:25:52.302 --> 00:25:54.571
It's on GitHub.

00:25:54.571 --> 00:25:55.040
RETO MEIER: Excellent.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.670
So a couple of other points
along the same lines.

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:02.640
I think probably the biggest
feedback is based on where the

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.480
app has come from.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.850
So it's an app that has been
around for a long time based

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.120
originally on Symbian.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.860
I think we all know that
the world has changed

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:11.800
significantly in terms of the
way mobile phone apps look and

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.220
work since that time.

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:17.260
Even though a surprisingly
short period of time has

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.160
passed, a lot has changed.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.610
So I think a lot of the feedback
is going to be along

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:22.670
those lines.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:25.650
I'd love to see you integrate
the new location-based

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:30.180
services as well to try and help
make the location updates

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.250
a little bit more efficient.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.310
And Google+ Sign-In as well,
as an alternative to

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:38.280
potentially having to create
a new account each time.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.730
I also noticed that we are
forced into portrait mode that

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:42.710
doesn't work on a tablet.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.440
Which makes a lot of sense
in some instances.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:49.300
But it might be interesting to
see how an app like this would

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.130
work on a tablet, if there is
some functionality that you

00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:56.270
could continue to use, things
like the GPS updates would,

00:26:56.270 --> 00:27:00.285
even if the security aspects
of being able to call the

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:03.020
phone aren't available.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:04.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: You might also
want to give just a little bit

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:08.960
more thought to your
action bar layout.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:15.180
It doesn't seem like the
ordering of the menu is

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:18.550
effective in terms of getting
the most important things on

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:19.630
the action bar.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:21.760
There are some things that
probably shouldn't ever leave

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.570
the overflow menu.

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:26.600
For instance, settings is almost
never necessary as an

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:29.730
action bar button.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:34.190
I also noticed that if you do
go to, for instance, buddy

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.150
message settings.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:36.600
Can you do that, Reto,
on your phone?

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.890
No, not settings, but
buddy message

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.370
settings, which is also--

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:47.930
that's something that might want
to live under settings

00:27:47.930 --> 00:27:50.860
rather than under a different
menu item.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.970
This page, I think, would be
really a good candidate for

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:58.340
the Done Cancel action
bar pattern.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.440
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:01.930
ALEX: OK.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.200
RETO MEIER: And one of the good
things about this app is

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.230
that it's simple.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:06.830
It doesn't have a
cluttered UI.

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.710
You don't have a million
different things confronting

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:09.640
you on screen.

00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:14.200
But you've almost gone too far
in that direction, in that a

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.330
lot of this stuff, you could
quite easily have put on the

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.080
main screen, because all we
have there is a countdown.

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.540
So you could certainly add a few
more elements to that to

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.850
explain what happens when
that countdown runs out.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:27.650
And basically, like this buddy
message, for example, you

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.275
could have that displayed
on screen.

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:34.080
ALEX: If you don't set the buddy
message, it does warn

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.820
you that you've not set
the buddy message--

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.515
RETO MEIER: It does.

00:28:36.515 --> 00:28:37.360
ALEX: --on the main screen.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.605
RETO MEIER: But it doesn't
tell me what that means.

00:28:38.605 --> 00:28:40.650
It just says, you haven't
set a buddy message.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:44.140
And it's like, OK, is
that a bad thing?

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.250
IAN NI-LEWIS: I don't even know
what a buddy message is.

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.960
RETO MEIER: Precisely.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.330
I'm still not sure what
a buddy message is.

00:28:49.330 --> 00:28:51.760
yeah, so this is what
we get, the, you

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:52.990
haven't set a buddy message.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:54.920
And you have the button to fix
it, which is good that it's an

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.515
actionable prompt to be able
to go in there and fix.

00:28:58.515 --> 00:29:01.220
But again, you have no idea of
what the implications are.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.210
And as a user, the first time
I open up the app, this is

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:05.560
what I see.

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:08.020
And so I'm basically being
told, hey, you're doing

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:08.880
something wrong.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.890
You haven't done
this thing yet.

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:14.500
So I don't even know if you
deserve to use my app.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:16.460
Which isn't really the kind of
feeling you want to give

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:16.870
people, right?

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:18.870
You want to make them feel
happy, feel like they're doing

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:20.880
the right thing, and that if
there's something which isn't

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.200
set, it's, I'm sure you just
haven't gotten around to it,

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.030
or here's a thing which we could
use to make this app

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.270
even more useful to you.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:30.490
So you want to provide a
little bit of context.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:33.070
You want to try and be more
positive in terms of the

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:36.260
messaging and in terms of what
this will allow you to do,

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.970
rather than how you haven't
done this thing.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:41.395
ALEX: OK.

00:29:41.395 --> 00:29:43.770
Cool.

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:46.540
RETO MEIER: Yeah, so I think
that's about all the feedback

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:46.730
that I had.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.120
I don't know if there's any
more specific stuff.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.920
The thing is, it's not
particularly complex, which

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.730
means that once you get kind of
past those initial bits of

00:29:56.730 --> 00:29:59.580
feedback, there's not too much
else that we can provide at

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.530
this stage.

00:30:00.530 --> 00:30:02.110
But hopefully that's
useful for you.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.960
Is there anything else--

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.420
ALEX: Yeah, thanks
very much, guys.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.796
Really appreciate that.

00:30:05.796 --> 00:30:06.380
IAN NI-LEWIS: Thank you.

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:08.380
RETO MEIER: Cool,
yeah, thank you.

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:08.760
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:08.890
Hello.

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:09.830
Can you hear me?

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.530
RETO MEIER: Absolutely.

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:12.110
MALE SPEAKER: Fantastic.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.850
OK, first off, just thank you
very much for doing this.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:18.370
We really appreciate you
taking the time.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:23.780
And so the Finn app,
where to start?

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.960
I can tell you a little
bit about the company.

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:33.040
It's a reasonably recognized
company in Norway in terms of

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.190
a lot of people know
who Finn are.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:39.720
And the websites have about 3
and 1/2 million visitors a

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:42.750
week, unique visitors.

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:46.640
And there are like 5 million
people in Norway.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:52.810
And it's a marketplace
for properties,

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.890
bits and pieces, cars.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:31:00.960
It's a place where you go
to find jobs, et cetera.

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:07.820
So what we've done is we're
actually in the process of

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.260
making this Android app.

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.400
It's in alpha at the moment, and
there's a few months away

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.650
from launch.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.160
It's the first time we're
actually showing it off to

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.420
anyone outside Finn, so
that's pretty cool.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.220
RETO MEIER: Wow, thank you.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:30.210
MALE SPEAKER: And the idea
behind the app is to make it

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:35.750
faster for people to access
the content, of Finn.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:41.910
So at the moment, we have a web

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:43.520
platform for mobile phones.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:48.320
And what happens is if you go
onto Finn, you have to go

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.110
through a number of steps
in order to do a search.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.750
So what a lot of people do is
they go onto Finn and then

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:57.550
dream about upgrading the house
or whatever, so they

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:00.050
spend a lot of time searching
through the

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:01.690
things that are on Finn.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:07.420
And in our current web app for
mobile, what you have to do is

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.050
you open it up, and then you
click on a market, and then

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.980
you click on a sub-market, and
then you have to select a

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:16.430
location and go through all
the filters, and then you

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.970
click search, and then you're
at the results page.

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.620
So it's like a very
long process.

00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:23.560
So what we wanted to do with
this app was try to squeeze

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.670
down the navigation path a
little bit and also do

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:30.570
something that we haven't
done before.

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:33.250
And that is to try to be a
little bit smart about how we

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:38.480
deliver updates and relevant
info to the user.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:41.610
So we have the main page, the
landing page that you see when

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:45.400
you open up, it's like
a stream of content.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:50.420
And the idea is for that content
to show new hits on

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:55.920
the searches that you have going
on and updates to things

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.396
that you're looking for.

00:32:57.396 --> 00:32:58.614
RETO MEIER: All right.

00:32:58.614 --> 00:33:00.410
So why don't you tell us a
little bit about what we're

00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:02.590
missing while I get it
installed over here?

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.970
IAN NI-LEWIS: Well, it's
a very pretty app.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:09.700
Now the navigation departs
pretty significantly from what

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:14.550
we consider to be current
Android standards.

00:33:14.550 --> 00:33:17.010
We certainly can't say
that it's bad.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:21.660
It's just non-standard, so
it has the possibility of

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:26.400
confusing the user and maybe
making their learning curve a

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:30.330
little higher than
it has to be.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:34.310
It doesn't use the standard
action bar, for instance.

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:38.350
It uses a non-standard drawer
patterns that actually

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:43.500
confused me already because
there seem to be multiple

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.340
drawers that come out
at different times.

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:49.690
But it is a very
beautiful app.

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:54.760
It's sort of card-based,
a little bit--

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.770
it's very, very open and easy
on the eyes, lots of open

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:00.500
space, maybe a little
too much.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.290
But not much, like the margins
[INAUDIBLE] cards [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:06.480
You'll see what we're talking
about in just a second here.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:08.400
I'll go ahead and wait
for you [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:08.880
RETO MEIER: Great.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.800
We can switch.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.679
IAN NI-LEWIS: I do want to know
what the exchange rate is

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:16.420
because I'm seeing some amazing
houses I'm thinking

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:17.670
about buying.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:20.670
ALEX: Yeah, you don't want to.

00:34:20.670 --> 00:34:22.764
It's very pricey in Norway.

00:34:22.764 --> 00:34:24.580
RETO MEIER: Yeah, well, we live
in the Silicon Valley,

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:28.639
and I can assure you it's
not cheap here.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.260
So we have the right
person on screen

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.510
right now, which proves--

00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:32.590
it's a good example, right?

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:35.330
So what we saw beforehand was
what happens if you just get a

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:40.110
website, wrap it in a native
wrapper, and stick it up.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:40.960
It doesn't look great.

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.110
It's slow.

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:43.880
It's janky.

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:46.250
It's really not an optimized
situation.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:48.304
So what we have here is exactly
what happens when you

00:34:48.304 --> 00:34:51.110
do it the right way and create
something which is truly

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.350
native to give that
richer experience.

00:34:54.350 --> 00:34:56.620
So we can see what you were
talking about now with that

00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:58.610
stream of content.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:01.650
Right on the landing page, as
soon as you go in, you're

00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:03.610
shown things.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.770
So suddenly, you're not having
to think about navigating

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:09.150
through different areas of
shopping, but you're shown

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:12.270
actual content that you can
engage in gets you thinking

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:14.470
about what it is that you're
interested in.

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:17.830
IAN NI-LEWIS: So if I can ask a
question, I'm going through

00:35:17.830 --> 00:35:18.520
these cards.

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.500
They all have the same heading,
which is Finn.no.

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:26.880
I don't see any difference.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:30.160
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, so just to
explain that very quickly, the

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.790
idea is for that stream that
you see on the home page to

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:37.870
have content that relates to
your searches, so new results

00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:39.670
on searches that you make.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:43.540
But we haven't been able to
implement that bit yet.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:46.130
We're sort of in the process
of doing it.

00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:52.000
But we have what we call curated
content as well, which

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.745
we call the Finn cat.

00:35:53.745 --> 00:35:55.210
We have a mascot.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:58.010
It's really weird, but we have
a mascot that is a cat, and

00:35:58.010 --> 00:36:00.530
he's really sarcastic, and he
makes all these sarcastic

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:02.540
comments about different
things.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:08.270
So that's the cat that's sort
of posting all these little

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:09.480
updates onto the stream.

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.950
So the idea is to have a mix of
updates from that cat but

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:17.210
also like new hits on the
searches that you're making.

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:19.160
RETO MEIER: I would love
to get updates

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:19.940
from a sarcastic cat.

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:23.126
That sounds like the coolest
feature so far.

00:36:23.126 --> 00:36:26.200
ROMAN NURIK: That's such a
great way to form a true

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:30.420
emotional bond with your user is
to give them a personality

00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.140
that they're working with,
almost like when they open the

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.122
app, they're kind of
talking to the cat.

00:36:34.122 --> 00:36:35.890
RETO MEIER: Yeah, I particularly
like the idea

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:38.230
that it's a sarcastic
cat, too.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.440
It's not like a helpful,
friendly cat.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.190
ALEX: Makes all the
difference.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:44.675
RETO MEIER: It's totally in your
face, making fun of you.

00:36:44.675 --> 00:36:46.120
And I think that's excellent.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: I hope not.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.930
So I think the one thing that
I'm seeing on the home screen

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:54.830
is I'm very comfortable with the
design, but it does seem

00:36:54.830 --> 00:36:56.620
like it's going to take me
a while to get anywhere.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:00.600
And I wonder if there's
something, a few techniques

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:03.680
that you could use to, for
instance, compress some of the

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:04.180
information.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:07.850
You know, once I've seen the
photos, I may-- and this is

00:37:07.850 --> 00:37:09.560
why I asked about
the headers--

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.270
I may be able to locate the
card that I'm looking for

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.040
afterwards just by looking
at the headers.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.715
So you could do something like
slide cards over the top of

00:37:17.715 --> 00:37:23.755
one another or shrink them down
or something once the

00:37:23.755 --> 00:37:27.860
user has seen them so that
getting to the bottom or

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:31.400
navigating around doesn't
take as many swipes.

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.920
RETO MEIER: Yeah, you could use
a similar approach to what

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:36.120
we have in Google now, where
some of the cards sort of

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.620
consist of other cards layered
on top of each other that you

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:40.990
press to expand or move
around that way.

00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:44.410
It could be quite interesting.

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:46.400
Yeah, it's a very
attractive-looking app.

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.820
It's interesting the way you've
implemented a sliding

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.950
drawer for search.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.150
So this is basically where you
have your categories, as well

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:57.233
as the actual searching,
is that right?

00:37:57.233 --> 00:37:58.670
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
that's right.

00:37:58.670 --> 00:38:00.020
So that's all the
main markets.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:02.800
And there are more markets
to be added onto that.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.510
RETO MEIER: OK.

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:06.870
And I assume that what I'm
reading on screen here means

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.430
search Finn.

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:09.500
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
so that's a global

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.960
search for all the markets.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:12.870
RETO MEIER: Cool.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.630
What do you think about the idea
of using a drawer pattern

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:19.730
for search categories, Roman?

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:22.060
ROMAN NURIK: Overall, my
feedback here is that the

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.890
drawer, like you mentioned in
the beginning, the drawer

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:27.370
being used in different ways
as well as hierarchy within

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:31.000
the drawer, actually having a
back button or I guess up

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.570
within the drawer is going to
lead folks to be somewhat

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:37.760
confused because you end up
creating lots of modes and

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:40.726
states where I could
actually see the--

00:38:40.726 --> 00:38:44.960
I could get the drawer to its
child screen, like what you

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.660
have now, slide over
the content.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:51.360
And then maybe a few minutes
later, I slide over to expand,

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:57.350
and I completely forgot the
drawer was in the mode of a

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:58.350
child view.

00:38:58.350 --> 00:39:01.900
So there's a lot of hierarchy
in the drawer.

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.910
There's a lot of different
states for the drawer.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.930
I'd really try to
simplify that.

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:09.280
The other thing is that we
obviously do have guidelines.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.090
I don't want to talk too much
about guidelines here.

00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:13.860
But we do have navigation
drawer guidelines.

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.910
These do depart quite
a bit from there.

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:19.340
So if possible, I would
try to follow those.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.990
And really, once you start
searching, once you start

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:25.090
going into the flow of doing a
search, you may want to just

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:29.240
replace the main content
with the search filter.

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:31.984
That might simplify things.

00:39:31.984 --> 00:39:34.950
RETO MEIER: Yeah, I think
you're absolutely right.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.230
I think that's where it gets
confusing is that once you're

00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:40.840
on this screen here, then
search actually

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.710
means refine search.

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:46.510
Which is fine, except that it's
different from what you

00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:49.540
have in the home screen, where
search means allow me to

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.430
search or let me sort
by category.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:54.660
So it's kind of different
content, even if it's related.

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.230
I also always find it a little
bit disconcerting when you

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:00.390
have two sliding panels.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:03.620
So we have the sliding drawer
on the left search, and we

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:07.850
have the sliding drawer on
the right for logging in.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:10.630
That, particularly this login
piece, feels like it should be

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:13.290
part of an action bar or
something like that.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.855
I think this is very
non-discoverable.

00:40:16.855 --> 00:40:19.310
And I assume that pressing
that is the same thing.

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:21.210
So you press the profile
button, and

00:40:21.210 --> 00:40:23.622
that drags it across.

00:40:23.622 --> 00:40:28.370
But I think the idea of the way
that we use the sliding

00:40:28.370 --> 00:40:31.210
panels and the drawers, as
Roman says, this is very

00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:33.025
different from the way we have
them in the design guidelines.

00:40:33.025 --> 00:40:35.400
And so it can be a little
bit disconcerting or

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.050
counter-intuitive to users who
are expecting it to in a

00:40:38.050 --> 00:40:38.710
certain way.

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:39.680
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.920
It's sad, though, because it's
absolutely beautiful.

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.950
The action here and the
animation, the colors, it's

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:52.952
just really, really nice.

00:40:52.952 --> 00:40:58.920
And I'd love to see some of
those elements kept, but you

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.970
have to think about what
are your users going be

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:03.470
experienced with.

00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:05.935
It's always tempting to go with
an entirely new design.

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:12.240
It's also very tempting
sometimes to import a design

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.860
from another mobile
device family.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:17.370
But you have to remember,
someone who's had their

00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:21.560
Android phone for a while, who
loves it, will have interacted

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:26.320
with a lot of apps that offer
similar navigation and

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.290
functionality to yours, perhaps

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:29.890
in a different vertical.

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:33.490
And this will be a learning
experience, and learning

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.250
experiences are sometimes fun,
but they're often frustrating

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:40.102
when you have a task in mind
that you want to get done.

00:41:40.102 --> 00:41:41.000
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.850
I just wanted to mention that
we're actually struggling a

00:41:43.850 --> 00:41:47.010
little bit to find a
suitable pattern.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:51.810
So we did look through quite a
few Android apps and Android

00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:54.390
guidelines looking for something
that sort of

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:58.760
combined drilling into your
markets and also having the

00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.100
filters there.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.860
Another reason we did it like
this was because it scaled up

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:05.910
quite nicely when you're
on a tablet.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:10.720
So you can have the filter
constantly available on the

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.740
left hand side, so you can tweak
the filters while seeing

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.600
real-time updates of
the results on

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.850
the right hand side.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:19.550
So it works.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:23.290
We thought this was something
that kind of-- we know that

00:42:23.290 --> 00:42:24.300
it's not optimal.

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:28.225
But we didn't find a better
solution, to be honest.

00:42:28.225 --> 00:42:29.370
RETO MEIER: Yeah, I hear
what you're saying.

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:32.650
I think for the tablet layout,
it would look great.

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.815
I think it's exactly the sort of
layout that you want to use

00:42:34.815 --> 00:42:37.570
where you have everything
on screen.

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:39.835
Here, it almost feels
as though--

00:42:39.835 --> 00:42:46.100
I think it's, as well, rather
than any individual problem,

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.760
it's more of a combination of
a lot of paradigms that are

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.705
being used slightly differently
from how you

00:42:50.705 --> 00:42:51.730
would expect it.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:56.070
And so then as an experienced
Android user, you start to get

00:42:56.070 --> 00:42:59.670
confused as to what you need
to do to navigate around.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:01.090
It's primarily around
navigation.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:06.100
So here, for example, I'm
expecting to be able to swat

00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.090
to bring something back,
but I can't.

00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:12.420
Here, it's back, which is an up
button which looks similar

00:43:12.420 --> 00:43:14.370
to what I would expect
an up button to be,

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:15.640
but it looks different.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.950
So it, again, gives me that
pause for thought, like, what

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:20.780
is this going to do?

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.605
So you're never quite sure how
to navigate back to where

00:43:23.605 --> 00:43:24.000
you're from.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:27.710
Because here I need to either
hit back, or I need to bring

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:30.360
my navigation drawer back and
then hit back in order to

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.630
return to the previous menu.

00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:33.305
That's kind of unexpected.

00:43:33.305 --> 00:43:36.320
I never expect to have to slide
out a drawer before I'm

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:39.826
able to navigate back
up in the hierarchy.

00:43:39.826 --> 00:43:43.610
IAN NI-LEWIS: Now I'm going to
take a slightly contradictory

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:49.540
position to Reto and say, this
app feels very designed.

00:43:49.540 --> 00:43:53.740
And it feels like every
interview, that I have, every

00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:57.670
question I have about
navigation, is solved in an

00:43:57.670 --> 00:44:00.540
elegant matter.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.042
I do agree that it's completely
non-standard, but I

00:44:04.042 --> 00:44:05.580
think we should recognize
that a lot of thought

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.990
has gone into this.

00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:08.530
And there's some interesting
problems.

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:11.763
What I would really love to see,
if Roman's up for it, is

00:44:11.763 --> 00:44:14.580
to have this be an "Android
Design in Action" candidate

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:17.920
and talk a little bit about the
challenges that you faced,

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:22.140
how you solved them, and see if
we can find something that

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.240
fits into the Android
standard that

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.687
solves the mess elegantly.

00:44:25.687 --> 00:44:26.940
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:44:26.940 --> 00:44:30.440
ROMAN NURIK: There's a lot
of hierarchy here.

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.700
That's one of the hardest things
you can deal with as a

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.610
designer is dealing with
different hierarchies and

00:44:34.610 --> 00:44:37.850
different flows as well as,
obviously, what you mentioned

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:40.950
before, the tablet versus
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:43.140
How do things work, how
do things respond

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.330
to different sizes?

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:46.410
Definitely, in the next few
episodes of "Android Design in

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:51.265
Action," we were looking to get
back into the redesign or

00:44:51.265 --> 00:44:52.910
the re-imagining world.

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:55.980
So definitely, this is one of
the apps I would consider.

00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.720
RETO MEIER: I think it's
one of the challenges.

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.000
I've seen this a lot from apps
which are trying to do some

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.510
sort of shopping, or anything
where you have to navigate

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:07.240
through multiple categories
and do multiple sort of

00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:09.820
filtering on each of
those categories

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:10.920
becomes a real challenge.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.250
I've seen people try and do it
using drop-downs in the action

00:45:14.250 --> 00:45:18.930
bar or having the filter
controls here on the top of

00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:19.315
the screen.

00:45:19.315 --> 00:45:21.070
But then that obscures
all of the content.

00:45:21.070 --> 00:45:24.130
So yeah, I've seen a
lot of apps try.

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:27.310
And having that sort of
multi-level hierarchy is

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:28.140
definitely a challenge.

00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:32.330
So I would be very interested to
see what Rowan and his team

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:35.400
can come up with as possible
alternatives.

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.020
ROMAN NURIK: One minor t I
wanted to call out here.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.370
So this kind of starts feeling
a little bit like this is

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:44.530
solving the problem of
master/detail, you have master

00:45:44.530 --> 00:45:47.910
gets-- when you actually go
into search, you have the

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.460
search filter.

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.675
It takes a little bit of mental
gymnastics to see it,

00:45:53.675 --> 00:45:57.250
but maybe it's like a master
on the left and

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:58.490
detail on the right.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:46:03.290
And what you end up having is
basically you're now in the

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:06.920
cars or the guitars or things.

00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.070
RETO MEIER: Motorcycles, baby.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:08.530
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:11.060
And pressing up should actually
take you back to the

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.600
top with the stream and the
navigation on the left.

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.200
So basically, you have
two activities.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.250
At the top, you have the
screen as well as the

00:46:18.250 --> 00:46:19.330
navigation drawer.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:23.310
But as soon as you jump into
cars or something else, you

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:26.460
get taken to a new activity with
a sliding pane layout,

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:32.020
which works on tablet as well as
phone, where the left side

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:36.370
is your master and the right
side is your detail.

00:46:36.370 --> 00:46:38.440
So that's one way we
could approach it.

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.940
But definitely for "Android
Design in Action," if we get a

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.510
chance to take a look at this,
we'll see if that pans out.

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:45.410
It's just kind of an
off-the-cuff idea.

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:48.880
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I have to
admit, that's the one thing.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:51.290
I feel like every single page
here is beautiful, but the

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.430
navigation is a little weird.

00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:56.250
And right now, I'm just trying
to figure out how to get back

00:46:56.250 --> 00:46:57.500
to the sarcastic cat.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:02.690
RETO MEIER: Yeah, it's
definitely a beautiful app.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:05.200
I think we really want to
emphasize the fact that it

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.610
looks great.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:10.710
Even understanding nothing in
terms of Norwegian, you're

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:13.540
still able to navigate it and
understand what's going on.

00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:16.800
You've used icons in the right
places to be able to

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.240
understand.

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:19.840
Like again, here, even without
understanding what these

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.670
categories are, it's obvious to
me that they are categories

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:25.240
and that I can use them to
navigate into the app.

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.950
And I can figure out
where search is.

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:29.130
I understand how to
change prices.

00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:32.040
I understand what I'm looking
at, what it represents.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:36.320
And it actually represents a
really good example of what we

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.070
should all be doing when we
create our apps, which is

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:40.550
trying to use it without
being able to

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:42.770
understand any of the language.

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:47.780
Even do a localization in just
gibberish, so that the text

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:50.630
lengths are about the right
size, but you have no idea

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:51.100
what it says.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.710
And then give it to someone
and see how well

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:54.050
they navigate it.

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:56.870
It gives you a really good idea
of how your visual cues

00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:59.310
are working, how the layout,
how the navigation, how

00:47:59.310 --> 00:48:02.160
everything is implying to them
what they're looking at

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.930
without actually using
the text as a cue.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:07.220
And for a mobile app, this is
really important because

00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:11.010
people don't necessarily read
what they're looking at.

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:12.870
It's just kind of truism
for a lot of things,

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:14.030
people don't read.

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:16.280
You can tell them things a
million times, put it on big

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.190
screens, explain something
in detail.

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:18.840
They're not going to read it.

00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:20.130
They're going to skip
straight through it.

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:23.420
So you need to make sure that
the rest of the app pushes

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.550
them in the right direction,
gives them all of the other

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:27.990
cues, so that even if they're
not paying attention, they're

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.690
just glancing at the screen, or
they're making assumptions,

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:31.400
it works out.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.900
It does still do what they
expect it to do and makes them

00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:36.660
feel comfortable that they
understand how it works and

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:37.940
how they can interact with it.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:40.270
And I think you've done a
really good job there.

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:43.380
It's just as we've said
repeatedly, it's just the

00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:46.750
navigation which could use a
little bit of a tweak, and I

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:48.510
think otherwise, it's
a great effort.

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:49.840
It's a great-looking app.

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.420
IAN NI-LEWIS: The one thing that
I really appreciate and I

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:55.920
want to point out specifically
because it's very hard to do

00:48:55.920 --> 00:49:00.415
is that the app is buttery
smooth even though it has to

00:49:00.415 --> 00:49:03.210
fetch quite a lot of data,
including photos.

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:08.570
And you can see that the photos
not only load in the

00:49:08.570 --> 00:49:14.390
background, but they also fade
in with a nice effect, which

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:16.130
makes the app feel considerably

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:18.670
smoother and less abrupt.

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:22.260
So I think the engineering
behind the central list view

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.490
is really stellar, and I want
to congratulate that.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:27.520
ROMAN NURIK: All right, of my
last points of constructive

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.150
criticism or feedback.

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:32.750
First, there's a distinct lack
of touch feedback throughout.

00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:35.260
So when you put your finger
down on something, it

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.310
should light up.

00:49:36.310 --> 00:49:38.970
The entire touch area should
light up to indicate that

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:40.800
you've begun interacting
with it.

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:43.820
The second thing was with those
photos, they load in

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.300
just beautifully.

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.680
But as you're scrolling through
the list, there's just

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.385
white space there.

00:49:49.385 --> 00:49:51.880
And it almost feels like
they're just missing or

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:52.455
misaligned.

00:49:52.455 --> 00:49:55.010
So you may want to use a
placeholder image, maybe even

00:49:55.010 --> 00:50:00.195
just a slightly gray, like an
off-white color, to indicate

00:50:00.195 --> 00:50:02.590
that this is a placeholder
state where

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:04.290
something will load in.

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:08.990
That'll potentially improve
the feeling of alignment.

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:10.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:13.990
And I think that if you look
into these products, they've

00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:19.950
actually done that in some cases
where the-- let me get

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:22.200
one that I haven't looked
at already-- when

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:23.450
the photo is loading.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:27.240
No, not really.

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:29.460
Yeah, it's got a loading
spinner, but it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:33.540
Yeah, I like the idea of a very
slightly darker gray box.

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:35.360
RETO MEIER: Just something so
that you know that something

00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:37.790
is going to come is a
really good idea.

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:40.350
Everything, I love how buttery
smooth everything is.

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:44.350
I like that you can tell a lot
of thought has gone into how

00:50:44.350 --> 00:50:46.150
much pre-caching you do.

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:49.880
So when I do load up a page for
a new article, I can swipe

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:53.080
once on two or three photos, and
they're there instantly.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:57.810
But once I start to go much
further, then it's going to do

00:50:57.810 --> 00:50:58.510
the reload.

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:01.500
So it doesn't aggressively
download all nine photos, but

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:03.730
it will get the first four, the
ones which I'm most likely

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:04.560
to look at.

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:07.300
Those little touches can make
a really big difference, so

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:08.830
nicely done.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:09.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: The other
thing I'm really a

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:11.060
fan of here, Reto--

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.380
I want you to check it out.

00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.930
I don't know how you feel.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:17.420
But I feel like swiping through
photos, obviously, I

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.460
want to either look at
one or the other.

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.190
And I've worked with some apps
where you really do need to

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.970
swipe it all the way across, and
it's a big finger gesture.

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:29.150
You'll notice, this, after
you've moved about maybe 5 or

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:33.850
10 millimeters, it'll simply
swipe over to the next one.

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:37.660
So it just takes a very tiny
gesture to get it to move from

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:39.070
one photo to the other.

00:51:39.070 --> 00:51:42.795
I really appreciate that because
it saves my thumbs,

00:51:42.795 --> 00:51:44.045
and my thumbs are arthritic.

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:47.495
RETO MEIER: Yeah, I'm
not quite seeing

00:51:47.495 --> 00:51:48.420
it happen that quickly.

00:51:48.420 --> 00:51:52.163
It needs to go about halfway as
far as my eyes can see it.

00:51:52.163 --> 00:51:52.596
IAN NI-LEWIS: Huh.

00:51:52.596 --> 00:51:55.610
Yeah, it's definitely
velocity-sensitive.

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:57.920
And I think that's probably
appropriate.

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.990
So if you try--

00:51:58.990 --> 00:52:02.990
RETO MEIER: Yeah, it's a very
small throw will transfer.

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.640
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.130
Once you get above a
certain velocity

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:07.210
threshold, and that's great.

00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:10.570
That just feels really good.

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:13.270
I think that's an excellent
gesture.

00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:16.050
RETO MEIER: There are only two
other things which Roman has

00:52:16.050 --> 00:52:18.530
prompted me on which
are worth noting.

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:23.820
So one is that where you have
the action bar icons up here,

00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:25.550
they don't have tooltips
associated.

00:52:25.550 --> 00:52:27.720
So you want to make
sure that they do.

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:30.950
So if people long-press on
these, it'll tell them what it

00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:32.170
is that they're trying
to accomplish,

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:33.040
which is always useful.

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.930
Particularly for people with
visual impairments, those

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:38.790
sorts of things make a really
big difference.

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:42.050
And while we're talking touch
targets, it would be, I think,

00:52:42.050 --> 00:52:45.880
really useful to allow users to
select some of the text in

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.420
the description fields for the
items that they're looking at.

00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:52.570
So you do have a mechanism for
sharing, which will allow you

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:55.980
to send a link to that
particular item to someone.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:57.920
Great, really useful.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.980
But I think it would also be
useful to be able to quickly

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.010
and easily select things like
the price or the description

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:06.720
so that they can take that, cut
it, paste it, put it into

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:08.730
something else, maybe an email,
maybe a document,

00:53:08.730 --> 00:53:11.160
Google Keep, whatever it is that
they're doing to try and

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:12.100
keep track of things.

00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:14.990
So I think adding that
flexibility would be really,

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:16.820
really useful.

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.320
IAN NI-LEWIS: By the way, going
back to what we were

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:21.810
talking about in some of the
other apps about what can you

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:24.100
do when you're not logged
in, check out--

00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:27.062
press the little heart button,
which in my opinion, should

00:53:27.062 --> 00:53:28.500
probably be a star, but
heart, whatever.

00:53:31.310 --> 00:53:34.590
Now there's no explanatory text
here, and there probably

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:38.920
should be, but this is a good
example of how you can provide

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:40.670
value without being logged in.

00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:44.205
You get to a point in the app
where you have to be logged

00:53:44.205 --> 00:53:47.920
in, in this case, to set a
favorite, and you're given the

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:49.510
opportunity to log in there.

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:51.270
At least, I think that's
what's going on.

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.840
RETO MEIER: I believe so.

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.730
I think the one comment I have
here is that there doesn't

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:56.120
appear to be a way to create
an account if you don't

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.330
already have one.

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:02.100
Is that because you can't?

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:04.790
MALE SPEAKER: No,
no, it's coming.

00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:07.440
We just haven't gotten
around to it yet.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.310
RETO MEIER: It isn't completely
finished?

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:09.560
I'm outraged.

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.710
So the other thing, and I know
that given this is a retail

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:16.880
store, and I know how this
works, and I'm sure that you

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.170
have your own database of
people's profiles, which

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:25.120
you're creating on purpose.

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:27.960
If it doesn't have this
complicated back end, it would

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.480
be interesting, again, to think
of using something like

00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.040
Google+ to simplify that login
process so that I don't need

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:36.120
to go through and create
an account.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.250
I hate creating accounts
on my phone.

00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:39.800
I very seldom do.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:42.360
It's usually a good reason for
me to decide not to use an

00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:44.120
app, if I have to go
through this whole

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.190
process of doing something.

00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:48.190
Whereas with Google+, it's
much, much easier.

00:54:48.190 --> 00:54:51.580
It's just a one click login
and then accept.

00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.720
So something to consider if you
don't have restrictions

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:57.350
preventing you from being able
to take that approach.

00:54:57.350 --> 00:54:58.900
IAN NI-LEWIS: And this isn't
just a plug for Google+.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:00.480
There are other apps.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:03.205
For instance, in America, it's
very common to have a Twitter

00:55:03.205 --> 00:55:06.090
or Facebook account
on the phone.

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:12.120
Any account provider that's
installed an account provider

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.280
plug-in on the phone
will offer your

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.260
users a one-touch login.

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:19.290
So if you want to log in with
Twitter, you want to log in

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:22.100
with Google+, you want
to offer multiple

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:23.450
options, that's fine.

00:55:23.450 --> 00:55:27.800
The most important thing is that
they can log in with just

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:31.560
a couple of touches because
that will keep them coming

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:32.150
back to your app.

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:36.160
That will prevent them from
uninstalling your app out of

00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:38.240
frustration because they
don't have an account.

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:42.330
So you'll see a greater
attach rating.

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:45.060
RETO MEIER: It's also a really
great way of maintaining users

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:46.130
across devices.

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:49.440
So if they get a new phone, or
if they buy a new tablet and

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:52.030
are able to log in and get all
of the customizations that

00:55:52.030 --> 00:55:54.530
they did for free without having
to remember the user

00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:58.100
name and password that they
created two years ago, it

00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:01.830
really helps just to encourage
people to, as Ian said, log

00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:04.840
back in and keep
using your app.

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.230
IAN NI-LEWIS: A lot of people
that run very popular services

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:10.510
don't think this is very
important because they know

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:14.360
that many of their users have
installed this app because

00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.820
they love the service.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:19.220
But if you look at the way the
trends are going, that's not

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:20.870
going to last much longer.

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:23.990
There's been a period of several
years where mobile

00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:28.960
uptake was driven by users who
had used the website and

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:32.100
enjoyed it and wanted the same
thing on their device.

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:36.130
But if you look at our
statistics for usage, we're

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:40.300
seeing many more people
interacting with the web and

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:44.380
services on their mobile phone
to the point where it's very

00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:47.860
likely that the majority of your
new users will come from

00:56:47.860 --> 00:56:49.330
the mobile experience
in the future.

00:56:49.330 --> 00:56:54.460
So being able to offer them
the quickest possible to

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:59.380
usable behavior and useful
functionality is going to be

00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:00.610
really important to
your bottom line.

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:02.235
RETO MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:57:02.235 --> 00:57:04.190
And it's all about retention
as well.

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:06.892
I went through the process
last weekend, while I was

00:57:06.892 --> 00:57:12.210
shopping, of trying to install
and register my Safeway app.

00:57:12.210 --> 00:57:14.760
While my wife was shopping, I
was pushing the trolley trying

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.160
to get the Safeway
app installed.

00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:19.190
And I had to create an account
and then associate it with my

00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:22.350
Safeway card, and the whole
thing took like half an hour.

00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:25.400
Which was fine, because it beats
shopping, but wasn't the

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.160
best experience in terms of
encouraging me to actually use

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:30.640
the app, let alone recommend
it to anyone else.

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.730
So it's about retention.

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:36.060
It's about getting to a point
where you're driving a lot of

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.480
new users from mobile devices.

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.110
And I think, as Ian suggested,
we're kind of heading to that

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:43.980
direction now, where you're
going to be getting more and

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:47.200
more new users from mobile,
particularly younger users,

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.590
who just use their phones
for everything.

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:52.840
Never had a desktop, barely
use their laptops.

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:56.140
So yeah, definitely an
interesting area.

00:57:56.140 --> 00:57:58.190
IAN NI-LEWIS: Check out
that Moto Guzzi.

00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:59.130
That's awesome.

00:57:59.130 --> 00:57:59.650
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:01.620
IAN NI-LEWIS: Holy
[INAUDIBLE].

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:04.520
RETO MEIER: There's a lot
of nice things here.

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:04.790
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right.

00:58:04.790 --> 00:58:07.180
RETO MEIER: Anyway, we could
browse here for hours, but

00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:08.320
that's probably not
the most effective

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.200
use of anyone's time.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.440
So thank you very much
for joining us.

00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.960
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks
for your time.

00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:13.680
Cheers, guys.

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.161
Thanks.

00:58:14.161 --> 00:58:15.411
RETO MEIER: Thank you.

00:58:18.971 --> 00:58:19.790
All right.

00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:22.220
Now the next app that I have
probably got the wrong version

00:58:22.220 --> 00:58:27.140
installed of on my sheet of
paper is Realtime T-Bane.

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:30.110
So the developer
of Realtime T--

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:32.360
I'm guessing that's "bon." No,
it could be "bain." You'll

00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.910
have to tell me how
to pronounce it.

00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:35.194
IAN NI-LEWIS: It's T-Bane.

00:58:35.194 --> 00:58:36.750
RETO MEIER: Sounds kind
of like a wrestler.

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:37.950
IAN NI-LEWIS: Daniel,
can you put on the

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:39.810
auto-tuner for this one?

00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:41.060
RETO MEIER: The auto-tuner.

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:44.840
COLIN DODD: All right.

00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.255
You're almost right,
Tayuh-bahma.

00:58:46.255 --> 00:58:49.350
RETO MEIER: Tayuh-bahma,
of course.

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:49.760
COLIN DODD: Hey.

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.900
My name's Colin.

00:58:50.900 --> 00:58:52.990
I'm the creator of
Realtime T-Bane.

00:58:52.990 --> 00:58:54.590
RETO MEIER: Thank you
for joining us.

00:58:54.590 --> 00:58:58.330
COLIN DODD: Which is an app
that's mostly useful to people

00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:02.710
in Oslo, who use the T-Bane,
which is the local metro

00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:04.396
subway service.

00:59:04.396 --> 00:59:10.710
The app provides a real-time
view of the

00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:13.890
T-Bane network in Oslo.

00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:19.010
So it allows you to see the
network as it is now--

00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:20.620
once you're in Oslo.

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.610
RETO MEIER: We're
getting there.

00:59:21.610 --> 00:59:24.580
We're getting there.

00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:26.065
COLIN DODD: Yeah.

00:59:26.065 --> 00:59:26.790
I'm sorry.

00:59:26.790 --> 00:59:31.820
You can see in real time,
although maybe

00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:33.910
the data didn't load.

00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:34.860
RETO MEIER: I'm not sure.

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:37.550
I looked at it yesterday, and
I saw all the little things

00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:38.150
moving around.

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:41.380
I looked at it today and have
not been able to see any.

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:44.270
So I'm not entirely sure
what's going on.

00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:47.070
COLIN DODD: Oh, maybe it's the
wrong version of the app.

00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:50.120
RETO MEIER: Seems likely.

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:51.600
COLIN DODD: No, there is only
one version of the app.

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:53.605
That's the right version.

00:59:53.605 --> 00:59:56.270
But it looks like maybe the
data hasn't loaded.

00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:59.690
You can try and back out of
the app and load it again.

00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.960
RETO MEIER: Sure.

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:00.810
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, we're
seeing some--

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:01.040
RETO MEIER: You're seeing
the movement?

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:01.250
Cool.

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:01.610
All right.

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:03.050
IAN NI-LEWIS: Data, yeah.

01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:04.930
RETO MEIER: I'll back out of
this and see if we can get it

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:05.240
to load up.

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:07.070
IAN NI-LEWIS: Lots of litle
moving circles.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.390
This is so cool.

01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:10.525
RETO MEIER: So do you want to
tell us a little bit about it?

01:00:10.525 --> 01:00:11.730
COLIN DODD: They have
better internet

01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:13.010
connectivity in New York.

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.570
RETO MEIER: Probably.

01:00:13.570 --> 01:00:17.360
Yeah, this is like a dead
zone in this building.

01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:20.140
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, so remember,
Reto is standing in

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:23.360
what was once Andy
Rubin's office.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:26.450
And the entire Android program
was built around him.

01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:30.950
So there is all kinds
of wireless devices.

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:33.990
It's almost like keynote
at the Moscone Center.

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:35.120
Nothing works.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:35.960
RETO MEIER: Yeah, Daniel,
could you switch

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:39.190
to the other box?

01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:42.630
COLIN DODD: There is sort of
a bug, maybe, feature.

01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:45.460
But it starts at your
GPS location.

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:45.860
RETO MEIER: Yes.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:49.420
COLIN DODD: Because, while I did
think about maybe fixing

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:51.850
that so if you're outside of
Oslo, it's always set on Oslo,

01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:55.480
but I didn't want to make too
many assumptions on the user's

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:55.830
[INAUDIBLE].

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.880
So if you want it to force to
load in Oslo, you should

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.160
switch off GPS.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.092
RETO MEIER: All right.

01:01:01.092 --> 01:01:01.960
No, that's OK.

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.465
I enjoy scrolling.

01:01:03.465 --> 01:01:06.190
But it's definitely something
you want to consider doing is

01:01:06.190 --> 01:01:09.830
you do have the GPS button
effectively on the map anyway.

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:11.750
And nice work on using
the latest

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:14.320
version of the Maps API.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.980
Being able to sort of scroll
and turn and change the

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:20.972
perspective on this stuff
is actually really fun.

01:01:20.972 --> 01:01:22.510
Let's see.

01:01:22.510 --> 01:01:26.460
I don't know why I can't
get the locations.

01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:28.100
That's interesting because we're
getting enough data to

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:29.310
be able to get the route.

01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:31.080
So I don't know if you're
pulling the routes down server

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:35.980
side, or if they are
built into the app.

01:01:35.980 --> 01:01:37.910
COLIN DODD: The routes are
built into the app.

01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:38.340
RETO MEIER: Ah.

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.740
So it's likely that we're just
not getting good updates,

01:01:41.740 --> 01:01:42.990
which is very strange.

01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:50.280
IAN NI-LEWIS: I do think it
might have been nicer to have

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.095
a way to search by station,
for instance.

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.980
That would allow me to go
directly to what I'm

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.660
interested in, no matter
where I am.

01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:03.180
But it does also seem like
you're right that purely

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:08.590
real-time data on this system
is unlikely to be useful

01:02:08.590 --> 01:02:09.981
outside of Oslo.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.020
ROMAN NURIK: So a couple of
minor things while we wait.

01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:19.290
The first is I'd consider
using a

01:02:19.290 --> 01:02:20.390
translucent action bar.

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:22.310
Your entire screen is the map.

01:02:22.310 --> 01:02:25.550
Go one step further and make
the action bar translucent

01:02:25.550 --> 01:02:27.060
above the map.

01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:31.080
There are some issues, of
course, with showing the top

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.180
left compass and the
My Location button.

01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:36.300
But you don't need those,
necessarily.

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.991
You may be OK without them.

01:02:39.991 --> 01:02:41.241
But yeah, let's--

01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:47.200
RETO MEIER: So I'm curious to
know if there was a specific

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:50.310
driver behind the creation
of the app.

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:53.010
Is there a reason that you put
it together, or is it kind of

01:02:53.010 --> 01:02:55.580
an experiment of, hey, we have
this real-time data.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:58.310
Wouldn't it be awesome
to put it on a map?

01:02:58.310 --> 01:02:59.140
COLIN DODD: It was
a bit of both.

01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:02.700
I'd done a lot of Android
development privately, as

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:03.090
private projects.

01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:07.850
And I've never really bothered
to put them out into Play

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.980
Store because they were
a bit messy and

01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:12.860
weren't very well designed.

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:18.530
So it was really an idea that I
had to force myself to make

01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:21.650
an app that I would have to
think about the design and

01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:23.440
make it usable.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:30.810
So it's really sort of just
a play-toy, you could say.

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:32.790
RETO MEIER: It's a pretty
cool toy, as toys go.

01:03:35.862 --> 01:03:38.850
ROMAN NURIK: I had one minor
comment about the line

01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:40.110
visibility.

01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:41.930
Right now, you have the
little eye icon.

01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:44.010
Pressing that gives you
a list of lines.

01:03:44.010 --> 01:03:47.680
You may want to make those check
boxes or something like

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.980
that where you can just
show multiple lines.

01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:54.820
If you decide that it's really
not useful to see lines two

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:57.240
and three, you either want to
see one of them or all of

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:57.920
them, and that's fine.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:01.500
But it is an option you
can [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.700
COLIN DODD: I did
think about it.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:07.940
I tried to make the main
use case the simplest.

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.160
I think most people are going
to look at one line, so I

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.970
would rather make that
the main use case.

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:16.453
But I did investigate
that, though.

01:04:16.453 --> 01:04:20.170
IAN NI-LEWIS: The one thing
that I'd suggest--

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:22.930
this is just a sort of bell
and whistle thing, but it

01:04:22.930 --> 01:04:26.730
would be really cool if each of
these circles had some sort

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:30.970
of extra, perhaps an arrow or
something, so that you knew

01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:34.350
which direction it was going.

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:37.100
Now obviously, I can sit here
and watch the circles move,

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.892
and I know basically which
direction they're going.

01:04:39.892 --> 01:04:43.230
But for instance, if a train
was broken down, I wouldn't

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:45.630
know which track it was on.

01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:50.310
ROMAN NURIK: It also relies on
your short-term memory across

01:04:50.310 --> 01:04:52.710
a number of different things
on the screen to recognize

01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:53.820
what way it's going.

01:04:53.820 --> 01:04:55.446
So having an arrow
is a great idea.

01:04:55.446 --> 01:04:57.840
I think it would really help
provide an immediate, at a

01:04:57.840 --> 01:04:59.160
glance view to what's
going on.

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:01.940
And maybe you add the arrows
only at a certain zoom level.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.790
Like when you zoom in to the
point where you actually

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:06.540
distinguish the different
blobs.

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.890
Like when you're zoomed out, you
see all of the blobs all

01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:10.900
on top of each other.

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:13.890
And the arrows would even
further clutter things.

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:18.270
But when you're zoomed in, you
may want to add arrows.

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:18.660
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:21.180
It's a really nice app,
particularly when you're

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:24.670
actually seeing the movement
of the trains.

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.890
I'm really not sure why they're
not coming up here.

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:28.770
We do have internet
connectivity, and it does seem

01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:30.480
to be loading, but it definitely
doesn't seem

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.740
to be coming up.

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:33.410
Such is life.

01:05:33.410 --> 01:05:35.040
IAN NI-LEWIS: Then you are
really missing out, Reto.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:35.700
This is kind of awesome.

01:05:35.700 --> 01:05:36.736
RETO MEIER: Yeah, I've got it
on my other phone, and it

01:05:36.736 --> 01:05:37.950
looks great.

01:05:37.950 --> 01:05:41.325
Just not the phone we have
connected to the overlay.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:47.660
IAN NI-LEWIS: Last
tiny bit is--

01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.350
well, no, actually
I've got two.

01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:53.025
The first, there's a circle up
at the top of the screen that

01:05:53.025 --> 01:05:53.760
has an i in it.

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:59.710
That appears to be basically
just a data provider.

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:03.020
I would suggest that that's
probably less important than

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:07.220
the share icon, which is hidden
in the overflow menu.

01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:08.840
You might want to switch
those around.

01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.420
COLIN DODD: I'm not very
good at bugging people

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:15.830
into sharing my app.

01:06:15.830 --> 01:06:17.000
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, it's
to share the app.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.200
IAN NI-LEWIS: Oh, it's
to share the app.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.280
Well then just take it.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:20.690
COLIN DODD: Yeah.

01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:22.130
It's just [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:23.596
to the Play Store.

01:06:23.596 --> 01:06:25.757
IAN NI-LEWIS: I thought you
were going to share like a

01:06:25.757 --> 01:06:27.250
route or something.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:29.410
Actually, yeah, [INAUDIBLE],
that's a good point.

01:06:29.410 --> 01:06:37.980
And then also, when I click on
a particular car, it looks

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:40.330
like I should be able
to press this little

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.940
pop-up that comes up.

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:45.880
And in fact, sometimes when I
press it, it actually does

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:48.610
change color as if there
was some activity

01:06:48.610 --> 01:06:50.200
associated with it.

01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.230
But there doesn't seem to be.

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:52.915
And actually it's stopped
changing color now.

01:06:52.915 --> 01:06:56.590
I'm not sure why.

01:06:56.590 --> 01:06:59.270
ROMAN NURIK: But it would be
cool to at that point get into

01:06:59.270 --> 01:07:05.030
a detail screen for that
specific vehicle.

01:07:05.030 --> 01:07:08.990
And then from there maybe share
its projected route or

01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:10.130
something like that.

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:13.420
Something more than just
showing it on screen.

01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:17.274
But yeah, I think the utility
of this app is probably

01:07:17.274 --> 01:07:20.010
obvious to folks that are using
this transit system.

01:07:20.010 --> 01:07:20.330
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:22.830
That's more a bug report
than anything.

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.910
And I'll make a feature
request, too.

01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:28.340
I think if I were using this
app, I would also want to

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:31.770
click on the station
and see when the

01:07:31.770 --> 01:07:33.030
next train is arriving.

01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:35.800
You have that information
if I click on the train.

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.420
But if I'm at a particular
station, I might be more

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:43.166
interested in when I'll see the
next train at that point.

01:07:43.166 --> 01:07:43.600
COLIN DODD: Yeah.

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:46.180
I was a bit worried about
cluttering the map with too

01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:47.010
much information.

01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:49.490
So I wasn't really sure of
a clever way to do that.

01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:52.045
Because obviously, once the
trains are on the map, which

01:07:52.045 --> 01:07:54.410
they're not at the moment, it's
quite a lot of data on

01:07:54.410 --> 01:07:55.550
screen at one time.

01:07:55.550 --> 01:07:58.850
IAN NI-LEWIS: Yeah, but you're
already showing the station.

01:07:58.850 --> 01:07:59.990
It's part of the Google Maps.

01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:02.270
There's a little
T in a circle.

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:03.520
COLIN DODD: Yeah.

01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:07.400
IAN NI-LEWIS: And in fact, if
I were in the Google Maps

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.515
application and clicked on this
T, that's exactly what I

01:08:10.515 --> 01:08:16.050
would see is the trains
that were

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:17.140
available at that station.

01:08:17.140 --> 01:08:18.979
I don't think I'd see
the real-time data.

01:08:18.979 --> 01:08:21.450
That's the value that
you provide.

01:08:21.450 --> 01:08:22.700
COLIN DODD: Yeah.

01:08:24.850 --> 01:08:26.520
RETO MEIER: The other thing
which might be useful as well

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:31.270
is to provide some kind of
linking to Google Maps so that

01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:32.689
once you're looking
at something here.

01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:37.194
So again, if you're a local
resident of Oslo, and you know

01:08:37.194 --> 01:08:39.859
where the stations are, and you
know how to get there and

01:08:39.859 --> 01:08:42.390
everything else, and you are
really just looking to get an

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:45.380
update as to basically how long
you need to wait for your

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:48.660
next train to arrive,
then it's fine.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:52.640
But it may be worth considering
visitors, people

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.689
who are new to the city, who
might want to download the app

01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:58.340
and be able to find out how to
get to that particular station

01:08:58.340 --> 01:08:59.700
from wherever they are.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.220
So rather than building all of
that into your map, which I

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:05.590
think is fair to say would be
overkill, would be able to

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:09.060
have a way of being able to, as
I say, when you press on a

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:12.195
station, be able to say, get
directions to here, which then

01:09:12.195 --> 01:09:14.890
kicks you out into Google
Maps to actually show

01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:16.140
you how to get there.

01:09:19.410 --> 01:09:20.649
Yeah.

01:09:20.649 --> 01:09:21.370
It's a nice app.

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:24.069
It's really well designed,
really clean, really

01:09:24.069 --> 01:09:25.590
uncluttered.

01:09:25.590 --> 01:09:27.660
I think it's a really
good effort.

01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:31.060
IAN NI-LEWIS: Reto, you're the
location and Maps guy.

01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:35.470
There isn't a way to install a
layer provider in the Maps

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:36.229
app, is there?

01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:37.043
RETO MEIER: No.

01:09:37.043 --> 01:09:39.110
IAN NI-LEWIS: That'd be cool,
though, wouldn't it?

01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.500
RETO MEIER: It would.

01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.463
And I think we used to
call it My Maps.

01:09:41.463 --> 01:09:43.770
ROMAN NURIK: Then you can
open a [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:47.040
file in Google Earth.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.664
IAN NI-LEWIS: But that's nothing
like this, though.

01:09:50.664 --> 01:09:51.434
RETO MEIER: Yeah.

01:09:51.434 --> 01:09:51.819
Cool.

01:09:51.819 --> 01:09:52.439
IAN NI-LEWIS: All right.

01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:55.120
RETO MEIER: All right, yeah,
thank you very much.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.370
COLIN DODD: Thank you.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:09:59.380
RETO MEIER: All right.

01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.300
So I think that's all
we've got time for.

01:10:01.300 --> 01:10:04.280
I'd like to think Hans
for organizing

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.250
GDG App Clinic Oslo.

01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:09.792
So a round of applause,
everyone, for your organizer.

01:10:09.792 --> 01:10:14.220
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:16.790
RETO MEIER: So thank
you very much.

01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:18.050
HANS: Thank you.

01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:18.850
RETO MEIER: Thans, guys.

01:10:18.850 --> 01:10:24.850
[APPLAUSE]
