00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.220
So now that we have seen
a two level page table,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.520
let's see if we can work with
a four level page table.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.750
This time let's assume we have
a 64 bit virtual address space.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.140
A 64 kilobyte page size.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.710
An eight byte page table entry.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.970
And we have a relatively large program
that is only using addresses zero

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.010
through four gigabytes from
this huge address space.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.820
The flat page table size is very large.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.850
The question for you is it's
a power of two, what power of two?

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.842
So it's two to what?

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:35.890
And if you have a four level page
table where the page number is split

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.820
equally so the bits of the page
number are divided into

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.860
four equal groups to
access these page tables.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.768
This page table uses
how many kB of memory?
