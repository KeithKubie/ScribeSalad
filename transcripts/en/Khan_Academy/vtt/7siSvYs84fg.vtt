00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.490
- [Instructor] We've been
talking about the law of demand

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.790
and how if we hold all else
equal, a change in price,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.910
if price goes up, the
quantity demanded goes down,

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.230
and if price goes down, the
quantity demanded goes up.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.760
So if you hold all else
equal, ceteris paribus,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.370
we are just moving along this
curve depending on what price.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.470
But what we started talking
about is what happens

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.310
when you change some of those things

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.700
that we have been holding equal,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:24.980
how does that change demand?

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.570
In the last video, we
talked about the price

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.800
of related goods, price of related goods.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.110
And if the price of related goods change,

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.900
both complements and substitutes,
how that might change the,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.510
how that might increase
or decrease demand,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.710
the entire curve, not just
one particular scenario.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.160
Now let's talk about
another one of those factors

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.560
that we've been holding constant,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.880
and think about how that
would change demand,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.800
the entire curve, if
we were to change that,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.110
and that's expectations of future prices.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.330
I'll do that in this green.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.330
So expectations, expectations
of future prices,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.340
of future, future prices.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.030
So let's say that, let's
talk about a first scenario

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.180
right over here, where,
let's say that this curve,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.040
people didn't expect prices
to change for my ebook.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.691
And now, all of a sudden, people expect,

00:01:20.691 --> 00:01:23.490
there's a change in expectation,
now all of a sudden,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.580
they expect the prices
to go up going forward.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.580
So now, now, now expect,
expect the future price,

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.713
the future price to go up.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.040
What's going to happen?

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.210
If you expect the future price to go up,

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.240
and the good or the product
in question is something

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.320
that you can store, well, and depending on

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.440
how much you expect it to go up,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.230
you're probably more likely to buy it now,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.530
buy it before the price goes up.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.320
So regardless of what point
on this curve we're at,

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.620
regardless of the price point,

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.180
at any one of those
price points, people now,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.680
because they want to, instead
of buying it later they want

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.280
to buy it now, they are more,
the current demand will go up

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.820
at any of these price points.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.790
So at $2, more people will want to buy it

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:10.960
'cause they think it's gonna go up.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.520
At $4, more people will want to buy it

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.910
'cause they think it's gonna go up.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.090
At any of these price points,
because now there's an,

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.160
the expectations have
gone from being neutral

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.170
to now expecting prices to go up,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.060
it will shift the entire
curve to the right.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.080
So this will shift the
entire curve to the right.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.170
So this right over here is scenario one.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.900
And it depends how much
this changes to say

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.370
how much this shifts to the right.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.710
This is just a general
idea, this is scenario one.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.020
And the shifting of the entire curve,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.210
you could say they increased demand.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.800
So this is literally demand increasing,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.400
demand, demand increased.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.190
And when we talk about demand, remember,

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.860
and you're probably
tired of me saying this,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.740
I'm not talking about
a particular quantity.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.770
I'm talking about the entire
curve shifting to the right

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.520
because people expect
future prices to go up,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.320
so the current demand went up,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.610
the current demand curve
shifted to the right.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.040
And now we can just take
the other side of that.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.150
Imagine what happens in scenario two.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.840
Before people were neutral,
that was our curve right there.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.280
They didn't have any opinion about

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.030
whether future prices
were gonna go up or down,

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.210
or maybe they just assumed
they were gonna stay the same.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.270
And now they expect
future prices to go down.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.270
Now expect future prices,
future prices, to go down.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.260
And this is something that happens

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.730
in consumer electronics
all the time, you see,

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.250
whenever you buy a laptop or
any type of electronic device,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.800
we now assume that the
prices will go down.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.070
Now what we're talking about
is a change in expectations.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.210
So you're going from neutrality,

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.440
or let's say you're going from,
you expect them to go down,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.360
but now you expect them
to go down even faster.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.790
And if all of a sudden
you expect them to go down

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.250
even faster, you're even
less likely to buy them now.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.710
So if you expect, if before
you thought prices were going

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.490
to be roughly constant, and
now you expect them to go down,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.980
now you're gonna say, well,
hey, at any given price point,

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.940
why don't I just hold off a little bit

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.660
and wait a little bit?

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.860
So it's going to lower demand.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.390
So in this scenario, the whole
curve will shift to the left.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.440
At any given price point, the
quantity demanded will go down

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.770
at any point in that curve.

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:22.100
And so, the entire demand curve
will be shifted to the left.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.930
So because of scenario two, demand,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.370
demand was decreased,

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.433
demand was decreased.
