00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:14.139
The peanut butter and jelly sandwich is such
a staple of American childhood these days

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.750
that it seems like it’s been around, well,
forever.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.820
In fact, it took a surprisingly long time
after all the necessary ingredients were invented

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.019
for someone to put them together, and several
decades more before doing this became popular.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.769
In fact, there are people alive today in America
who grew up in a world where the PB&amp;J sandwich

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.740
simply wasn’t well-known at all.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:33.740
*gasp*

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.740
First, let’s start with the ingredients.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.990
Bread, of course, is an ancient food that
has been eaten for tens of thousands of years.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.270
However, pre-sliced bread—which would make
PB&amp;J making a convenient task—didn’t come

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.360
about until the early 1900s, when a man named
Otto Frederick Rohwedder of Davenport, Iowa

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.810
invented a device to automate this process.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.580
He first built a prototype of his bread slicer
in 1912, which didn’t interest bakers he

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.510
showed it to as it was thought that no one
would want their bread pre-sliced.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:09.429
Unfortunately, Rohwedder’s blueprints and
machine were destroyed in a fire in 1917.

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:13.050
From there, he struggled to obtain funding
to begin again on his machine owing to the

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.259
lack of interest.

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.399
The primary concern was the reduction in shelf
life of the bread.

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:23.359
Even if it was reasonably well packaged, it
still became stale faster than well packaged

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:24.359
whole loaves.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:29.670
Finally, in 1927, Rohwedder was able to re-build
the machine and produce a model ready to use

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.469
in an actual bakery, soon to be advertised
as “the greatest forward step in the baking

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.490
industry since bread was wrapped,” which
later morphed into “the greatest/best thing

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.189
since sliced bread” when describing various
other products.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:47.580
Rohwedder got around part of the staleness
problem by wrapping the thinly sliced loaves

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.770
in wax paper directly after slicing was complete.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.659
Apparently it was good enough as pre-sliced
bread was a hit and within a decade people

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.689
who had access to pre-sliced bread were eating
more bread per person than before and began

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.140
experimenting with various new spreads to
put on the now commonly thin bread slices.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.069
As for jelly—which in the case of the peanut
butter sandwich could mean jelly, jam, or

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.120
other fruit preserves (see the difference
between these here)—that’s been around

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.210
for a long time too, going all the way back
to at least the first century, mentioned in

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.210
Of Culinary Matters by Marcus Gavius Apicius.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.960
Despite this lengthy history, for the purposes
of this article, one Mr. Welch is the man

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.299
to pay attention to here.

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.260
He developed Grapelade from Concord grapes
in 1918, which proved to be extremely popular

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.560
among the troops during World War I.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.950
When they got back from the war, they spread
the practice of using it on bread.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.150
Peanut butter has actually been around much
longer than you probably think, and was not

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.569
invented by George Washington Carver, with
the first reference of it going back several

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.263
hundred years before Carver, first created
by the Incas and Aztecs.

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:45.579
However, peanut butter more or less as we
know it today was popularized at the 1893

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:46.579
World Fair.

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.960
In the early 1900s, peanut butter made frequent
appearances in tea rooms across the nation

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.450
where it was billed as a dish for rich people.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.990
Back then, it was paired with such crowd-winning
favourites as cucumbers, cheese, celery, and

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.990
crackers.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.569
With all the ingredients around so long, it
might surprise you that the first known reference

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.269
to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich didn’t
happen until 1901, with this first mentioned

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.230
in the Boston Cooking-School Magazine of Culinary
Science and Domestic Economics, written by

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.610
Julia Davis Chandler:

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.780
For variety, some day try making little sandwiches,
or bread fingers, of three very thin layers

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.250
of bread and two of filling, one of peanut
paste, whatever brand you prefer, and currant

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.150
or crab-apple jelly for the other.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.269
At that point, however, peanut butter was
still considered a “high end” food and

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.500
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches were not
a commonly eaten food item.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.519
Peanut butter being more available to the
masses occurred in the 1920s and 1930s, shortly

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.330
after Grapelade had become popular and pre-sliced
bread was all the rage.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.430
It was at this point that another major PB&amp;J
breakthrough happened: commercial brands of

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.299
ultra-creamy peanut butter were developed
such as Skippy and Peter Pan.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:58.019
With the Great Depression, peanut butter on
bread became a staple in many American households

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.650
because it provided a hearty, filling meal
with a cheaper-than-meat substitute for protein.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.900
No doubt some at this point were happily creating
PB&amp;J sandwiches, but the real surge in popularity

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.499
was yet to come.

00:04:10.499 --> 00:04:12.090
This brings us to WWII.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.819
Grapelade’s popularity with the troops paved
the way for jelly to be included in the soldiers’

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:17.750
rations during this war as well.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.650
Along with the jelly was the trusty high-protein
peanut butter that had proved so useful during

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.550
the Great Depression, and, of course, pre-sliced
bread.

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.170
The perfect storm.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:31.020
Perhaps they had heard of peanut butter and
jelly sandwiches before, or perhaps it was

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.720
simply a natural inclination to combine these
three staple ingredients in their rations,

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.080
but before long the peanut butter and jelly
sandwich became a popular meal among United

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.560
States soldiers.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.920
When soldiers arrived home from the war, peanut
butter and jelly sales skyrocketed.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:05:03.020
It was an instant hit with just about everyone—kids
loved how good it tasted, parents loved how

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:14.190
easy it was to make, and college students
liked that it was cheap.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.430
Since then, this sandwich has become a “traditional”
American favourite.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:38.460
(That isn’t to say that PB&amp;Js aren’t enjoyed
across the globe, but it’s certainly 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:57.199
a bigger hit in the United States than in
most other countries.)

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:13.229
In the end, despite all the needed ingredients
having been around for millenia in some form

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:35.000
or another, America’s favourite sandwich
seems to have only been around for just over

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:48.300
a century, and has only been popular for about
60-70 years.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.229
Who knew?
