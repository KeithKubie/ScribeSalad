00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Now it turns out that this graph does actually have a Hamiltonian path.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:14.000
And to see this, let's go ahead and start here, and let's come around here and here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We're going to come over here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And we have covered every single vertex, as you can see.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.500
Now it turns out that this graph does not have a Hamiltonian cycle.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000
And, in order to show this, you would actually have to know a bit more math

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or exhaustively check every single possibility, which I am not going to do

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in this video because it would take far too long.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So I invite you to try and find a Hamiltonian cycle if you doubt that,

00:00:49.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but it may take some time.
