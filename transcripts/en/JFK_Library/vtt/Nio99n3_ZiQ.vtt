00:00:00.116 --> 00:00:04.283
- In your hands, my fellow
citizens, more than mine,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.517
will rest the final success
or failure of our cause.

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:17.161
And so my fellow Americans, ask not

00:00:18.857 --> 00:00:21.436
what your country can do for you,

00:00:21.436 --> 00:00:24.588
ask what you can do for your country.

00:00:24.588 --> 00:00:26.838
(applause)

00:00:31.984 --> 00:00:33.416
- I want to be a speech therapist

00:00:33.416 --> 00:00:37.144
so that I can help those who
have difficulty communicating,

00:00:37.144 --> 00:00:38.361
need a little bit more confidence

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:39.792
in the way that they communicate.

00:00:39.792 --> 00:00:42.784
- Stay informed and really,

00:00:42.784 --> 00:00:44.728
if you see something that's wrong,

00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:45.792
you've gotta say something.

00:00:45.792 --> 00:00:48.090
You've got to call your representatives

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.528
and make your voice heard.

00:00:49.528 --> 00:00:51.769
- I will make sure that every young person

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:54.432
across the country is
empowered and motivated,

00:00:54.432 --> 00:00:57.282
and has the tools and
opportunities they need

00:00:57.282 --> 00:01:01.449
no matter what their economic
status or racial status is.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.344
- I plan on standing up for
civil rights and women's rights

00:01:05.344 --> 00:01:06.472
because as a black woman,

00:01:06.472 --> 00:01:08.608
that is my responsibility that I have.

00:01:08.608 --> 00:01:12.072
- New citizen of this
country, and this year

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:16.112
I am graduating from
Mass College of Pharmacy,

00:01:16.112 --> 00:01:17.532
I will be a pharmacist

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:20.728
so I will make sure that all my patients

00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:23.168
who come to my pharmacy
will be treated well,

00:01:23.168 --> 00:01:26.796
with respect and with the
correct pharmaceutical therapy.

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:31.168
- We are getting more active
in our local political process

00:01:31.168 --> 00:01:32.490
in our community.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.136
- I think the single most important thing

00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:35.608
that the average citizen can do

00:01:35.608 --> 00:01:38.688
is show up to the polls and vote.

00:01:38.688 --> 00:01:41.993
And if you can work for a
local campaign office, do so.

00:01:41.993 --> 00:01:44.608
- Expose the issues that
exist in the communities

00:01:44.608 --> 00:01:48.697
around us now, and will
partner with my peers

00:01:48.697 --> 00:01:51.015
in order to make a better world today.

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:51.928
- Is vote.

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:54.496
One of the things that I looked forward to

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:58.122
in becoming a citizen
is the right to vote.

00:01:58.122 --> 00:02:02.112
- Let us go forth to
lead the land we love,

00:02:02.112 --> 00:02:04.862
asking his blessing and his help,

00:02:06.312 --> 00:02:10.592
but knowing that here on earth, god's work

00:02:10.592 --> 00:02:13.056
must truly be our own.

00:02:13.056 --> 00:02:16.806
(uplifting orchestral music)
