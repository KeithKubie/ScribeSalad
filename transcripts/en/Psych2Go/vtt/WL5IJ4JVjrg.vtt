[Music]

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.540
People with depression want the same
thing as anyone else.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.250
We're all looking for love and this is true
no matter what we're dealing with on the inside.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.180
Sometimes it's very hard to tell if someone
has a crush on you.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.680
Whether they're happy and extroverted or quiet
and introverted. But there are a few simple

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.790
ways you might be able to tell even with people
who have depression.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.110
They seem afraid of getting rejected.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.550
Rejection is never fun, but in many ways,
it's just another part of love.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.480
Most of us have felt the sting of rejection
in our lives before, and we've come to accept

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.480
it.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.390
But this is true whether you have depression
or not.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.190
You might find yourself in a situation where
you're pretty certain someone likes you but

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.730
they seem too scared to take that leap of
faith, they just don't want to get hurt again.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.970
Studies have shown that a person with depression
deals with rejection in slightly different

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.509
ways, so that might be something to look out
for.

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.329
They might feel like you're out of their league.

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.620
Have you ever been attracted to someone but
it seems like you have zero chance with them?

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.030
We've all been there.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.710
But depressed people might be feeling this
a lot more than the rest of us.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.250
Studies have shown that depressed individuals
tend to feel a sense of worthlessness.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.860
Like they're just not good enough.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.790
In a romantic setting, this might cause them
to feel like you're totally out of their league

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.230
even when it's not even true.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.290
A person with depression might want to be
with you more than anything, but sometimes,

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.760
they need a little bit of encouragement and
support to make them feel more at ease.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.920
If they're not interested in sex, that doesn't
mean they're not into you.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.619
Just because someone isn't interested in you
sexually, that doesn't mean they're not attracted

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.760
to you.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.270
Studies have linked depression with sexual
dysfunction, perhaps a lowered sex drive for

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.270
example.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.729
Sure, they might not be drooling over you,
but they could still be attracted to you.

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.599
Look for other signs of romantic attraction
and you might find that a person with depression

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.099
is totally into you.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.430
They might seem desperate.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.260
Desperation definitely doesn't show up in
all people with depression, but it is relatively

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.959
common.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.129
Studies have even shown that depression is
linked with out-of-control sexual behavior.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.189
They might have allowed their depression to
get the better of them and it could be impacting

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.109
their relationships in a negative way.

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.969
Of all the signs, this might be the easiest
to spot.

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:47.150
Some studies have even shown a link between
hyper sexuality and depressive symptoms.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.909
They might seem awkward when they flirt.

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.450
Most people remember a time when flirting
got a little awkward, but with people with

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.900
depression, this might be a little more common.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.219
A few studies have explored the link between
depression and lowered interpersonal communication.

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:09.549
Examples of this might be slowed or slurred
speech and awkward silences.

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.739
So look out for these signs.

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.510
If you don't look hard enough, you might not
even realize that they're trying to flirt

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.049
with you.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.459
They might seem uncertain about the new romance.

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.849
It's always exciting when there's the spark
of a new romance.

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:28.769
Most of us feel a mixture of hope, excitement
and a little anxiety.

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.219
But a person with depression might feel a
lot more uncertain about a new romance than

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:34.569
others.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.579
This is due to something called "Relational
Uncertainty", which is explored in a number

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.840
of studies.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.540
Relational uncertainty is exactly what it
sounds like, people feeling uncertain about

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.510
their relationships.

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.919
The thing is, depressed individuals tend to
feel things a lot more than others.

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.829
So, if a person with depression is crushing
on you, they might also be feeling a lot of

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.599
anxiety at the same time.

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.189
They might have trouble looking into your
eyes.

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:09.139
Studies have shown that people with depression
have trouble maintaining eye contact and in

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:13.250
a romantic setting, this can be quite a challenge
for them.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.859
We all know that the eyes are the window to
the soul, but how can depressed people hope

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.530
to connect with their crushes if they can't
even look them in the eye?

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.980
If you think a person with depression might
like you, watch them closely.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.910
Maybe they seem like they want to look you
in the eye but they can't.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.110
If so, then they might just have a major crush
on you.
