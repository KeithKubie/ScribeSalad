00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.520
Let's say that this right over here is the
graph of lowercase f of x.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.050
That's lowercase f of x there.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.050
And let's say that we have some other
function capital F of x.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.480
And if you were to take its derivative,
so, capital F prime of x,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.820
that's equal to lowercase f of x, lower
case f of x.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.280
So given that, which of these, which of
these, could

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.350
be the graph of capital, of capital F of
x?

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.080
And I encourage you to pause this video,
and try and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.500
think about it on your own before we work
through it.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.212
Well if, if this curve is going to be the
derivative of one of them.

00:00:44.212 --> 00:00:46.033
That means that any, for any x value

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:49.020
it's describing what the instantaneous
rate of change.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.698
Or what the slope of the tangent line is,
of which

00:00:52.698 --> 00:00:56.880
ever one of these is the possible capital
F of x.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.740
So, let's just look at a couple of things
right here

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.580
so what, what do we know about lower case
f of x?

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.959
What do we know of which is the derivative
of one of these?

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.370
Well, one thing we know is it's always
positive.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.550
It, it has as we go to negative infinity,
it asymptotes towards 0.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.780
But it's always positive.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.650
So since this is describing the slope of
one of these.

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.060
That means that the slope of one of these
always,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.860
or out of the candidates, has to always be
positive.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.130
And, if we look at this, the slope

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.620
of the tangent line here is, indeed,
always positive.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.400
The slope of the tangent line here does
look like it's positive.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.400
Every time we increase an x, we're
increasing by y.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.580
Here it's positive.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.510
But here it's negative.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.110
When we increase by x, we decrease by y.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.580
So, we can rule, we can rule this one out.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.510
Now, what else, what else do we know?

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.230
Well, this is the derivative.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.150
This is telling us the slope of the
tangent line.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.930
So, for example, when x is equal to, when
x is equal to negative 4,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.290
f of, f of negative 4 is pretty close to
0.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.920
It's pretty close to 0.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.850
So, it's slightly, slightly more than 0.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.264
So, that tells us that the slope of
tangent line of capital F

00:02:09.264 --> 00:02:14.696
of x has to be pretty close to 0, when x
equals negative 4.

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:17.996
So, let's see, when x equals negative 4,
the slope of tangent

00:02:17.996 --> 00:02:21.480
line, here, isn't close to 0, this
actually looks closer to 1.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.280
So, we could rule this one out.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.850
Over here, when x is equal to negative 4,
the slope of

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.800
the tangent line, yeah, that actually does
look pretty close to 0.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.170
So I won't rule that one out.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.550
And over here, the slope of the tangent
line, when x

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.000
is equal to negative 4, that also looks
pretty close to 0.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.660
So these are still both in the running.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.760
So let's see how we can think of it
different.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.290
So let's just pick another point.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:53.390
When x is equal to, when x is equal to 0,
f of 0 looks like it's pretty close to 1.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.120
I don't know if it's exactly to 1.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.260
Actually it looks almost exactly.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.450
Almost exactly equal to 1.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.520
So when capital F of, so at capital F of
0, the

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.770
slope of the tangent line needs to be
pretty close to 1.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.990
So over here the slope of the tangent
line, when

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.460
x is equal to 0, that looks smaller than
1.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.780
So this slope is definitely not 1.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.222
While over here, when x is equal to 0.

00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:27.905
The slope of the tangent line does look,
the slope of the tangent

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:33.180
line does look pretty, pretty close,
pretty close to 1.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.730
So this, right over here, looks like the

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:41.290
best candidate for capital, for capital F
of x.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.260
So that one right over there.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.970
Lemme, that is capital F of x.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.400
And you might say hey these look similar
to each other.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.700
And fact they look almost or actually they
do look almost identical.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.190
And you might remember from what you knew
about

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.840
differentiation, that these actually look
like the basic exponential function.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.130
Were, were I didn't ask you to find out
what the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.209
actual function was just the possible
anti-derivative of this function would be.

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.307
This is the derivative, lower case f is
the, is the derivative of capital

00:04:10.307 --> 00:04:15.260
f, or you could say that capital f is an
anti derivative of lower case f.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.180
And when you just inspect this, this looks
like this, the,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.004
the function, both of these functions is,
are e to the x.

00:04:21.004 --> 00:04:25.440
Because the derivative of e to the x is e
to the x.
