Hi, um, I'm Billie Brown.

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:10.276 align:start position:0%
I'm here for
the babysitter position.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.545 align:start position:0%
Oh, um, uh...

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:13.546 align:start position:0%
<i>Yo soy--</i>

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:14.847 align:start size:75% position:25%
- You're the babysitter?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.250 align:start position:0%
- I'm here
for the interview,<i> sí.</i>

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.685 align:start position:0%
Yes,<i> sí.</i>
Yes.

00:00:19.718 --> 00:00:21.187 align:start position:0%
I'll follow you.

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:27.593
Yikes.
- And is this where you put her?

00:00:27.626 --> 00:00:29.228 size:84% position:58%
- Yes, in the sitting room.

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:30.863 align:start size:47% position:53%
- Hello, hello!

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:32.165
- Welcome!
- Hi!

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.400 align:start size:59% position:41%
- This is our home.
Can you believe it?

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:35.835 align:start position:0%
- No, that's great.
Hi.

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:38.838
- Please, sit.
- Oh, that sounds like fun.

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.306 align:start size:78% position:22%
- It's Wilhelmina, right?

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.742
- Oh, or Billie.
Most people call me Billie.

00:00:42.775 --> 00:00:44.010
- Or Bobbie?

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.344
- Well, no.

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:48.014
- This is my lovely wife,
Tanzy, and I'm Kent.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.382 align:start size:47% position:53%
- Russell, yes.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.617 align:end position:100%
I just read an article about
your new hybrid sports car line.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.119 align:end position:100%
It's so interesting
to read about--

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:55.021 size:84% position:42%
- It makes me uncomfortable

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:59.092 size:88% position:44%
when people tell me things
I already know about myself.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.493 align:end position:100%
So we looked over
your résumé.

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:01.894 align:end position:100%
Very impressive.
Harvard.

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:03.463
both: Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.497 align:start position:0%
- Oh, thank you,

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.865
but it makes me uncomfortable

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:08.134 align:end position:100%
when people tell me things
I already know about myself.

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.770
[chuckles]
- I don't understand.

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:11.771 align:start size:34% position:66%
- [giggles]

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:13.606 size:84% position:42%
- Tanzy, do you understand?

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:16.976 align:end position:100%
- No, I was just thinking
about Danny DeVito.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:17.977 align:start size:25% position:75%
"Twins."

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.380
[both laugh]

00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:22.782 align:start size:41% position:59%
- It's funny.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:25.251 align:end position:100%
Um, as you probably
also noticed,

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:27.386 align:end position:100%
I don't have a ton
of nannying experience,

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:28.788 align:start size:50% position:50%
but I love kids.

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.723 align:end position:100%
I'm sure I'd get along great
with your daughter.

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:32.291 align:start position:0%
- Oh, she's not mine.

00:01:32.324 --> 00:01:33.826 align:start size:78% position:22%
I've never been pregnant.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.262 size:88% position:56%
I wouldn't be able to drive.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:37.663 align:start position:0%
- Mm-hmm.

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:39.932 align:start size:38% position:63%
- Oh, that--
Is that her?

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:41.767
Wesley Snipes.
- Yeah, it is.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.536 align:start position:0%
Can I be honest
with you, Bill?

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.805 align:start position:0%
You know, my--my--
my daughter's a great gal,

00:01:45.838 --> 00:01:47.974 align:start position:0%
but she had some trouble
with school.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.275 align:start size:59% position:41%
- Uh, that's great.

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:51.144 align:end position:100%
I taught in grad school,
so I could tutor her.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:52.345
- Oh, that's perfect.
- Yeah.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.247 align:start position:0%
- I mean, she has to pass
her GED.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.515 align:start size:38% position:63%
- I'm sorry?

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:57.884 align:start position:0%
- It was part of the deal
I worked out with the judge.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:01:58.951 align:start size:66% position:34%
- Judge--What judge--

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:00.753 align:start position:0%
- Now, my daughter has--
How do I put this?

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:02.755 align:start position:0%
A criminal past...
present.

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:05.191 align:start position:0%
You know, I probably should
just let you two meet.

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
Oh, hey. There she is.

Am I late?
- No, no.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:27.613
- I wanted to make
a good first impression.

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:29.415
Is this her?
She's gorgeous.

00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:30.716 align:end position:100%
Is this your natural skin?
Can I touch it?

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:31.717 align:start position:0%

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.718 align:start size:38% position:63%

- Oh, you can call me Gene.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.825 align:end position:100%
Like Eugene Levy,
but just the Gene part.

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:42.328
- I thought you said
your daughter was seven?

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:43.863 align:start position:0%
- Oh, she caught us.

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:45.631 align:start position:0%
Oh, she caught us,
didn't she, Tanzy?

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:46.632
- This is a joke.

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:48.568 align:start size:47% position:53%
- I don't know.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:51.037 align:start position:0%
- Yeah, we may have fudged
the age a little bit in the ad.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.238 size:81% position:41%
When we said "babysitter,"

00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:55.908 align:start position:0%
we meant more of
a "court-appointed guardian."

00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:57.810 size:84% position:42%
- Is that an ankle monitor?

00:02:57.843 --> 00:02:59.145
- What?
- Is that...

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:00.780
both:
An ankle monitor?

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:03.382
Is that an ankle monitor?

00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:06.085 align:end position:100%
- Oh, my gosh. I can do
a spot-on impression of her.

00:03:06.118 --> 00:03:07.353
- Yep. Yep.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:10.590 align:start position:0%
- Okay, I don't have
the background with criminal--

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:13.226
- Come on, Bill. You never
had any trouble with the law?

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:14.427 align:start position:0%
- No, no, no.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.363 align:start position:0%
I-I-I jaywalked once
to save a hurt bird.

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:19.031
- Bird.
- What are you doing?

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:20.700
- See?
You're practically twins.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:21.734 align:start size:22% position:78%
- Yeah.

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:23.069 align:start position:0%
- It'll be, like,
constantly having

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:25.271 align:start position:0%
a gal-pal
to hang around with,

00:03:25.304 --> 00:03:26.539 size:75% position:38%

- Ooh, I'll be Phoebe.

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:29.875 align:end position:100%
I look the most like her.
You have to give it to me.

00:03:29.908 --> 00:03:31.811
- That's "Friends."
- Hire her.

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.746 align:end position:100%
Oh, I should check
this out first.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:35.281
- What are you doing?
No, no, no!

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:36.515 align:end position:100%
- I'm just making sure
we don't have

00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:38.518 align:end position:100%
a Mrs. Doubtfire situation
on our hands.
