00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:03.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: So
unless you guys have

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.550
been living under a rock, or
maybe you just joined Google,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.250
you're probably aware
of the myriad of ways

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.440
that stress is bad for you.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.100
And we're all now starting to
explore the nature of our minds

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.650
and how we are, as individuals,
wound up and triggered.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.630
And so today we have
Gadadhara Pandit Das,

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.720
and among many things, he
is a meditation teacher.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.740
And his approach
combines eastern wisdom

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.750
with meditation practices
to help us all do just that.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.400
So I had the opportunity to
read his book in the past couple

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.990
of weeks, and I was
not surprised to find

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.810
that, like the stories
of many wise people,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.340
he faced a pretty serious
existential crisis

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.360
in his youth, which I'm going
to let him tell you about.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.075
But it launched him on
a spiritual journey.

00:00:52.075 --> 00:00:55.310
It carried him to Mumbai
and eventually New York

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.660
where he helps
young people like me

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.820
with their quarter-life crises.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.260
He works with
students at Columbia

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.400
and also NYU as a
lecturer, and also

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.200
some of us with
our midlife crises

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.760
that we may be going through.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.180
He's been featured
on PBS and NPR,

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.830
and he's given a
Ted talk as well.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.390
So I just picked out a quote
from his book that really

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.910
resounded with me, and I hope
it might with you as well.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:21.410
So.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.190
"That is taking care of
the needs of the body

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.660
and ignoring the
needs of the soul

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.480
is like watering the
leaves, fruits, and flowers

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.490
of the tree, but forgetting
to water the actual root."

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.530
I know for many of
us, our material needs

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.570
are pretty well
met here at Google.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.580
We may not be facing
an existential crisis

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.140
on a day-to-day basis,
but we're all here

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.300
because we're concerned
about that inward journey

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.220
and the spiritual
aspect of things.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.490
So I'm very excited to welcome--
we can call him Pandit,

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.490
he has informed me,
like a political pundit.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.570
So everyone, please
welcome Pandit.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.510
GADADHARA PANDIT: So I'm
really happy to be here,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.860
and I want to thank the people
who have organized this.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.940
Gopi was the one
who invited me here,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.320
and [INAUDIBLE]
put a lot of work

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.800
into getting this whole
program organized,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.100
and of course, [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.430
So I'm just grateful
to be able to share

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.810
this wonderful information
with you on managing stress.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.260
And the first
thing I like to do,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.240
because I know you're all
coming from meetings or eating,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.510
emails, so I like to get
everybody on the same page.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.110
So I like to a short,
mind-quieting exercise

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.210
to start off our session.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.980
So if you're eating, I'm sorry.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.070
It might disturb your
eating just a little bit,

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.180
but if you can sit comfortably
and close your eyes.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.280
And just feel your
feet on the floor.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.570
Feel the weight of your
body sinking into the chair.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.210
Now slowly take
a deep breath in,

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.822
feeling the cool air
going in through your nose

00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:08.780
and filling your lungs.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.220
And when your lungs
are completely filled,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.800
focus on the warmer
breath leaving your body

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.055
through your nose.

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:27.310
And you'll notice the inhalation
is cooler than the exhalation.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.270
Again, take a deep breath in.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.570
Feel the cool air going
in through your nose

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.650
and filling your lungs.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.010
When your lungs are
completely filled,

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.260
you can slowly exhale,
feeling the warm breath

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.940
leaving your body
through your nose.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.820
We can do this one more time.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.610
You can take a slow,
deep breath in,

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:00.840
feeling the cool air
entering your nose.

00:04:04.896 --> 00:04:06.145
Filling your lungs completely.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.090
And then exhaling,
emptying out your lungs.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.165
Now you can bring your
awareness to your eyes.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.880
And you can slowly
open your eyes.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.400
When I feel like we get into a
room with so many people having

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.680
so many different
thoughts, it's,

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.410
you know, about 50,
60 people in here.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.490
It's almost like having
50 or 60 radios playing

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.220
at different radio stations.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.940
So now even for a minute or two,
we could all do the same thing.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.300
It's quite powerful.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.427
Such a busy environment.

00:04:47.427 --> 00:04:49.510
Somebody described this
environment recently to me

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.711
like Disneyland out here.

00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:51.460
And it really was.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.880
Like oh, my gosh.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.750
There's food trucks,
and there's people,

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.600
and there's G-Bikes, and all
kinds of things going on.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.020
So it's nice to be
able to do-- everybody

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.990
can do the same thing
for just a little while.

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.300
Now as we're talking
about stress,

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.133
and I know there's many
factors in our lives

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:05.734
that causes stress,
and we're all

00:05:05.734 --> 00:05:07.400
going through a lot
of different things.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.921
So I like to start
off with a question.

00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:11.420
Kind of a personal
question, and you

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.050
can feel free to
yell out an answer.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.420
Feel comfortable.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.630
And the question
is, what in life

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.120
right now is causing you stress?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.560
I'll just tell you this
that last time I asked this,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.210
it was at Bank of America.

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.420
One lady, without any
hesitation, yelled out,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.600
"It's my husband."

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:34.370
So if you feel that confident
and comfortable with everyone

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.920
around, and you want to go ahead
and say something personal,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.490
please do so.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.800
So what's on your mind?

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.850
What's causing you stress
today, or in general causes

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.335
you stress?

00:05:44.335 --> 00:05:45.085
AUDIENCE: Clutter.

00:05:45.085 --> 00:05:45.410
GADADHARA PANDIT: Clutter.

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.370
OK.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.190
Thank you.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.690
All right.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.570
What else?

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.320
AUDIENCE: Parents.

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.700
GADADHARA PANDIT: Parents.

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.040
OK.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.970
We're getting into the family.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.290
It's getting more personal now.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.790
OK.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.252
What else?

00:05:55.252 --> 00:05:56.144
AUDIENCE: Noise.

00:05:56.144 --> 00:05:57.060
GADADHARA PANDIT: Huh?

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:57.726
AUDIENCE: Noise.

00:05:57.726 --> 00:05:58.260
Noise.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.490
GADADHARA PANDIT: Noise.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.030
OK.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.390
Good thing you don't live in
New York City where I live.

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.151
I live right on the Avenue.

00:06:03.151 --> 00:06:03.650
OK.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.457
What else?

00:06:06.457 --> 00:06:07.290
AUDIENCE: Commuting.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:07.575
GADADHARA PANDIT: OK.

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.610
Yeah, that's going
to be stressful.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.621
Anything else?

00:06:10.621 --> 00:06:11.746
AUDIENCE: Death of my aunt.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:13.160
GADADHARA PANDIT: The
death of your aunt.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.250
Thank you for sharing
something so personal.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.702
Anything else?

00:06:17.702 --> 00:06:18.540
AUDIENCE: Deadlines.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.706
GADADHARA PANDIT: Deadlines.

00:06:19.706 --> 00:06:20.850
OK.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.560
Too much to do and
not enough time.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.440
There's so many different
factors that cause us stress,

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.050
and according to the
American Institute of Stress,

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.685
they divided up into
four basic categories.

00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:34.760
So the biggest reason
in our lives that

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.780
causes us stress
is our workload,

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.090
and a lot of stuff what
people said was work-related.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.220
And it's 46% of all
stress that we experience

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.340
is connected with our work.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.310
That might sound like
a lot, but if you

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.160
think about it, about half
of your waking time, the time

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.840
that you're awake,
you're at work.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.447
If you're getting, let's
say six hours of sleep,

00:06:58.447 --> 00:07:00.280
hopefully you're getting
at least that much.

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.120
Hopefully.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:01.828
What do you have?

00:07:01.828 --> 00:07:03.840
18 hours remaining in your day.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.340
And easily 10 of those
is either commuting

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.530
to and from work and at work, or
maybe even more than 10 hours.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:10.830
Maybe it's 12 hours.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.540
So 46% might even
be a low figure.

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.980
It might even be more than that.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:19.190
So but at least
46% of our stress

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.300
is caused by our workload,
deadlines, things like that.

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.042
28%, people issues.

00:07:25.042 --> 00:07:26.750
Maybe you don't get
along with the person

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.240
you're sitting next to at work.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.929
And you're spending
half your day at work.

00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:32.970
Or maybe you've got personal
issues in your life.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.600
Between workload and people
issues, that's 75% right there.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.060
Those two items take up 75%
of the stress we experience.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.750
20% is juggling your
work responsibilities

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:51.077
and your personal life, and then
6% is a lack of job security.

00:07:51.077 --> 00:07:52.160
So that's also a huge one.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.210
And of course,
besides this, there

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.090
may be other things
in our lives that

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.960
cause us stress which
weren't covered here.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.100
I know one thing that
causes a lot of stress

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:04.720
for a lot of people is
just uncertainty in life.

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.630
You're hoping to achieve
something by a certain time,

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.130
or you're hoping this'll happen.

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.670
But it doesn't happen.

00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:12.930
You're really expecting it.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.280
You're really counting on it,
but it just didn't happen.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.710
And that's causing stress.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:20.910
Or something that happens
that you wish didn't happen.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:23.340
So unexpected,
unpredictable things.

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.120
And there was a lot of
unpredictable things in my life

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.790
that caused me a lot of
stress, and some of you

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:32.010
who have the book will have
a chance to read about it.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:34.200
I grew up-- I was born in India.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.340
My parents came over to
this country in 1980.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.130
Moved to Los Angeles actually.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:40.880
The first thing that
my parents did-- they

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.659
didn't come over
with a lot of money.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:45.480
They were doing swap
meets at Venice Beach.

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.964
So they set up a little
shop on Venice Beach.

00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:49.380
You see all those
vendors, so they

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:51.360
were one of those
vendors in 1980,

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.490
'81, just selling all
kinds of gift items.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.650
And I was seven years
old at that time,

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.620
and that was my
first introduction

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.350
to American culture.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.830
So I was just learning
to play basketball.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.190
I was skateboarding up
and down the boardwalk.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.610
I was listening to funk music.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.166
That was what I was
exposed to in 1980,

00:09:09.166 --> 00:09:13.310
a seven-year-old Indian
kid in landed America.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:16.400
So they struggled really hard
to establish their business,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.720
and it was incredible.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.040
I don't know how they did
it, but within five years,

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.170
they established a multimillion
dollar jewelry business

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:24.807
that went across the country.

00:09:24.807 --> 00:09:26.640
It's incredible how
hard they-- I don't even

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.740
know what they did, because
I was just working-- I

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.126
was just playing, basically.

00:09:30.126 --> 00:09:32.000
But they worked so hard
that they established

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.810
an incredible business,
and then we-- my dad

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:44.060
bought this piece of land on
top of the Glendale Hills.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:45.980
We carved out the
hill, and that's

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.550
where we built our humble abode.

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.210
This was my room right here.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.450
It's no longer my room.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:52.745
We don't live here anymore.

00:09:52.745 --> 00:09:55.090
I'm going to explain
to you why not

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.970
So as you can see, on the
side there's no other houses,

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.160
so we had the last spot.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.560
And in front my room
there was no houses,

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:03.992
so I could see all
of Downtown LA.

00:10:03.992 --> 00:10:05.950
That was like my morning
view every single day.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.380
It was kind of a scenic spot.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.830
People would come up,
especially on Friday

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:10.570
nights and Saturday nights
to look at the view.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.695
But that's what I would
wake up with every morning.

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:16.210
A swimming pool in the
back, a Jacuzzi, waterfall,

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:18.770
six bedrooms, the whole works.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.260
But the story doesn't end there.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:25.980
In 1993, my parents had a
jewelry manufacturing plant,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.590
electrical plant.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:30.734
And during heavy rainfalls,
the thing caught on fire.

00:10:30.734 --> 00:10:32.150
And our entire
business collapsed.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.790
It took us so long to
try to reestablish that.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.910
Actually everything
collapsed and finished.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.940
And when that
business collapsed,

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.910
eventually, we lost all our
properties, including this one.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.540
We lost all our cars.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:48.320
It was a full-blown demolition.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.700
It was a complete wipeout.

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:51.242
We lost everything.

00:10:51.242 --> 00:10:55.670
And in an attempt to
get back up on our feet,

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.950
my dad follows a lead
from a friend of his

00:10:58.950 --> 00:11:00.530
to go to East
Europe, because they

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.540
were coming out of communism.

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:05.910
And he thought that he could
import things from India

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.410
and somehow try to-- because
once you've lived that life,

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.030
you can't go back
to living simply.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.630
It's kind of hard.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.779
So he went to Bulgaria.

00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:14.820
Anybody been to Bulgaria?

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.450
Anybody from Bulgaria here?

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:17.830
OK.

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:20.530
So he went to Bulgaria,
and just a little

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:23.010
while later, my mom I
decided that well, there's

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.760
no point in us living here,
because our life is just kind

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.937
of turned upside down.

00:11:26.937 --> 00:11:28.770
Might as well go to
Bulgaria and be together

00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:31.280
and figure out where
our life's going to go.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.330
So in 1993, we packed our
bags and went off to Bulgaria.

00:11:39.155 --> 00:11:41.600
We went from that
incredible house

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.892
to living in one
of these buildings

00:11:43.892 --> 00:11:46.100
in a one-bedroom apartment
in one of these buildings.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:50.100
Smaller, or the same size of
like a New York City apartment.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:53.140
And Bulgaria, at that time, it
had just come out of communism.

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:56.440
It was about 50 years
behind in technology.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.280
So in order for me
to make a phone call,

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.196
I would have to walk to
the post office, which

00:12:00.196 --> 00:12:02.280
was about a mile away.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:05.120
Hardly anyone in the
country spoke English,

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.000
so even buying groceries
was a challenge.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.620
And the stuff that
was on television

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.660
was all basically in
Bulgarian and Russian,

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.076
so I couldn't
understand anything.

00:12:15.076 --> 00:12:16.910
There was no
entertainment for me.

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:20.634
I went from living the LA
life, the 90210 lifestyle,

00:12:20.634 --> 00:12:22.550
to a place where I didn't
have anything to do.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.591
Even the movies that were
playing in the theaters

00:12:24.591 --> 00:12:26.960
were like a year old, and I
had seen everything already.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.280
There was absolutely nobody
to talk to, nothing to do.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.960
Incredible time of
introspection and reflection

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.100
really trying to
figure out what I

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.210
wanted to do with
the rest of my life.

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:40.309
Was I going to live
and die in Bulgaria?

00:12:40.309 --> 00:12:41.350
What was going to happen?

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:43.260
I went from a life
of complete certainty

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:46.980
to a life of
complete uncertainty.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:51.396
Two years after being in
Bulgaria for two years in 1995,

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:52.770
the country was
kind of unstable.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.640
It was becoming a
little unsafe for us,

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.489
so we decided to leave
and move back to the US,

00:12:58.489 --> 00:13:00.280
but we wanted to be
close to New York City,

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.325
so we moved to New Jersey.

00:13:02.325 --> 00:13:03.700
And my parents,
as they're trying

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.730
to establish another
business in New Jersey,

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:12.320
I decide to try my hand
at the mortgage industry.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.235
You're thinking, why mortgages?

00:13:14.235 --> 00:13:15.020
I don't know.

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.311
I was just trying to figure
out what I was going to do.

00:13:17.311 --> 00:13:20.430
And we're trying to-- here
I was a loan officer trying

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.820
to give loans to
people with bad credit

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.490
using the equity in their home.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:28.780
Wasn't sitting so well,
because these loans were

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.840
good for like three months,
and after that you'd

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.589
have to pay for those
loans, and it really

00:13:32.589 --> 00:13:33.770
wasn't helping people.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.350
So it wasn't something that
was sitting well with me

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.380
in my conscience, and I'm like,
OK, I can't do this anymore.

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:42.510
So at one point I said, I really
need to take a break from life.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:45.300
Because life had just been
the craziest roller coaster

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.760
imaginable.

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.660
And in 1999, I took a
huge step in my life.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.720
Something I would do on my
own, really for the first time.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.120
To figure out what I wanted
to do and who I really was,

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.080
I went to live in a
monastery in India,

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.250
but the idea was to
be there for a month.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:11.700
So I was living--
I'm an only child.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.210
I went from being an only child,
having everything to myself,

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:18.330
to living with 40 monks.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.920
That mean shared bathrooms,
shared floor space,

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:23.590
sleeping on the floor in a
sleeping bag on a thin straw

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.000
mat, waiting in line to
use the bathroom at 4:00

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.920
in the morning, because they
got up real early, these guys.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.640
Because our meditation
services started at 5:00.

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:38.730
So a huge shift, but I
can say that being there

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:42.080
and taking that time out
for myself was probably

00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.830
the most satisfying experience
I've ever had in my life,

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.920
even when we were millionaires.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:51.440
It kind of felt like-- when
I could really reflect on it,

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.720
it felt like I'd been--
up until then I'd

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.145
been eating food that
didn't have enough salt.

00:14:58.145 --> 00:15:00.520
Food can be really tasty, but
if there's not enough salt,

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.081
no matter how else you spice
it, it just tastes bland.

00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:04.580
Right?

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.496
Salt just brings out the
flavor in everything.

00:15:06.496 --> 00:15:08.440
I kind of felt like
I'd been living

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.156
a life with not
enough salt in it.

00:15:11.156 --> 00:15:12.530
And it was such
a deep experience

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.456
I extended my stay from
one month to six months.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.080
I ended up staying
in India six months,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.350
here, and at
different monasteries.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:23.610
And then eventually I decided
to come back to the US

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:27.240
after six months, and
that one-month retreat

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:33.162
has extended until
August of 2014, now.

00:15:33.162 --> 00:15:35.180
It's 15 years later.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.930
I'm still living in a monastery.

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.520
I'm not dressed in my
traditional saffron robes.

00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.530
We wanted to take
it easy on you guys.

00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:45.620
After you guys just had
lunch, we weren't sure

00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:48.320
how much that would affect you
seeing me in robes up here,

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.640
so we kind of wanted to
take it easy on everybody.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:54.400
So I'm dressed-- I like to
say I'm undercover today.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.866
So one of the things
that I studied

00:15:58.866 --> 00:16:00.990
while I was in the monastery,
continue to study now

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:02.690
is the nature of the mind.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.400
Because the mind
is where all stress

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:09.610
and anxiety and anger and
frustration and fear-- they

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.230
all rest in the mind.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:13.660
So we did quite
a bit of studying

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.530
about the nature of the mind
and became aware of our mind.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:19.160
And my realization
was that the mind

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.250
is very much like a hard
drive of a computer.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:26.380
That it stores everything.

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.200
Like how many files
are on your computer?

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.230
Millions of files.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:32.410
And how many do you remember?

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.810
Hardly 1% of what's
on your computer.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.010
That's our mind.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.460
It is taking in whatever
the senses bring in,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.810
whatever you see every day.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.420
It all gets stored in the mind.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:45.650
Whatever you hear every day.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.280
It all gets stored in the mind.

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.570
Smell, taste, touch, everything
gets stored within the mind.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:55.314
We're not aware of most of
the stuff that's going in.

00:16:55.314 --> 00:16:56.730
Sometimes all of
the sudden you'll

00:16:56.730 --> 00:16:58.840
remember something random,
because it was already

00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.650
in there.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.240
We're just not aware of it.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.820
So everything--
and you can imagine

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:09.470
how much we're being bombarded
by things of this world

00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:11.020
every single day.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:14.490
In one day, how
much is going in?

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:20.569
According to "Psychology
Today," an average person

00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:27.144
goes through between 25 to
50,000 thoughts per day.

00:17:27.144 --> 00:17:29.560
Because you're probably taking
in hundreds of thousands of

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.920
impressions every single day.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:34.600
When you walked into this room,
you can't remember everything

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:37.050
in this room, but your mind
kind of took a snapshot,

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.270
and it's all in there.

00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:41.460
In a month, you can go
over a million thoughts,

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:44.754
and in over a year, it could
be 18 million thoughts.

00:17:44.754 --> 00:17:46.170
Penny for your
thoughts everybody.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.740
Right?

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:51.630
So, and like I mentioned
earlier, most of these things

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.810
we don't remember.

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:57.230
Every day, it's like we're
experiencing a daily overload.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.100
Really an overload.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.308
So we shouldn't be surprised
if at the end of the day

00:18:00.308 --> 00:18:04.300
we feel stressed or
just like exhausted.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.880
We're taking in a
lot of information.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.760
A lot of data is going
into our hard drive.

00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:12.740
Thoughts.

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.410
We're having so many different
thoughts every single day

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:17.910
because of all the
impressions that are going in.

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:20.840
A lot of our thoughts
are things from the past.

00:18:23.495 --> 00:18:24.870
The negative things
that happened

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:28.630
a year or two years ago, or
some of the positive things

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.520
that happened, some memories.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.940
Unfortunately, too much time
we spend in the past thinking

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:40.250
about the things that we've
lost, people that we've lost,

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:41.987
people that have hurt us.

00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:43.320
We can't let go of these things.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:46.910
It's really hard, and we spend
too much time in the past.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.210
If we're not doing
that, the mind

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.230
is spending time in the future.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.160
What am I going
to eat for dinner?

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.620
Like how many have
planned dinner

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:57.950
while you're eating lunch?

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:59.240
I've done that too.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.697
Monks do that too sometimes.

00:19:01.697 --> 00:19:03.280
Because I have a
little stricter diet,

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.988
so I'm wondering where
am I going to eat,

00:19:04.988 --> 00:19:07.070
because I'm not sure if
I can get what I can eat.

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:08.860
So we're planning
the next meal, we're

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.440
planning our weekend,
our vacation.

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.600
You know, just all
kinds of things.

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.180
When and how I'm
going to retire.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:17.180
So if it's not in the
past, it's in the present.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:19.080
If it's not in the
present, it's in the past.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.470
It's like a set of windshield
wipers with no off switch.

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:25.002
Imagine if from the
day you bought your car

00:19:25.002 --> 00:19:26.460
to the day you gave
it up you never

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.070
turned off your
windshield wipers.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.444
You think you'd
kind of go crazy.

00:19:29.444 --> 00:19:30.920
Everybody would
think you're crazy.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.919
But that's kind of what's
happening in the mind.

00:19:32.919 --> 00:19:36.040
Very little are we actually
in the present moment.

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:38.430
And most of it,
we're unaware of.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:39.580
You drive down the street.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.100
So much going in, we
don't remember most of it.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.080
And even when we
dream-- it's amazing--

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.260
our mind doesn't stop.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:51.890
When you go to sleep,
it's a 24/7 machinery.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:55.760
Your hard drive is
running all the time.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.240
So don't be
surprised, even if you

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.948
haven't had an exhausting
day that you're

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:00.150
tired at the end of the day.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:04.960
There's a whole lot going on up
there that we're not aware of.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:10.510
So now, the mind impacts the
body in a huge way, actually--

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.740
very, very significant way.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.680
What happens to the
mind affects the body.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.900
What happens to the
body affects the mind.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.070
That relationship is
very, very intimate.

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:24.680
And there is such a
thing as positive stress,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.470
that adrenaline boost, if
you want to accomplish goals,

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.230
maybe you're in danger.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.030
That positive stress helps
you defend yourself, protect

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.010
yourself, but you don't
want to be living even

00:20:34.010 --> 00:20:37.340
on that adrenaline
boost all the time.

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.940
So the things that we
want to talk about today

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:43.400
are things like stress, anger,
and anxiety that ultimately

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:47.430
take a toll on our body.

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:49.100
Things like high blood pressure.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.880
We know that's a
product of the mind.

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.020
Think about it.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.650
It's not necessarily the
circumstances around you.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.024
It's your mind that's giving
you high blood pressure.

00:20:57.024 --> 00:20:58.940
We're going to explain
that a little bit more.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.910
Your mind is creating fatigue.

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.410
It's your mind
that's preventing you

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.570
from getting a
good night's sleep.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.653
Like you just can't let
it go-- the project you're

00:21:05.653 --> 00:21:07.750
working on or maybe
the conflict you had.

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:10.280
You're holding onto it,
and you can't fall asleep.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.270
You're trying, but the
mind just plays it over.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.540
It's in instant replay mode.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.630
You can't get it out.

00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.400
And then, of course, in a
worst case, heart attacks

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.030
and strokes.

00:21:19.030 --> 00:21:21.670
We can note that's all
a product of the mind.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:26.380
So good way to understand this,
how the mind affects the body,

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:27.630
is the phenomena of nightmare.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.574
Anybody recently
have a nightmare?

00:21:29.574 --> 00:21:31.240
For some of us, maybe
it's more graphic.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.490
You saw a horror
movie, and then you're

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:33.700
like the victim
in your nightmare.

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:33.980
You know?

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.896
Like, oh, my God, I'm
being chased by somebody

00:21:35.896 --> 00:21:37.040
with a hacksaw.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.054
And then when you
wake up from that,

00:21:39.054 --> 00:21:40.970
what are your bodily
symptoms when you wake up

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.011
from a nightmare and
realize it was just a dream?

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.340
AUDIENCE: Sweating.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.215
GADADHARA PANDIT: OK.

00:21:48.215 --> 00:21:48.890
You're sweating.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:49.410
What else?

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:50.310
AUDIENCE: Your heart's pounding.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:52.180
GADADHARA PANDIT:
Your heart's pounding.

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.263
You feel like the guys may
still be in the closet.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.540
Everybody responded to that.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.790
So your heart's beating.

00:22:01.790 --> 00:22:03.739
You're breathing faster, maybe.

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:06.030
And to think about it, you
were comfortably tucked away

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:09.810
in your bed in beautiful
Northern California.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.570
The sun is always shining,
and the hills are flowing.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:13.430
Right?

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.280
But what made your
heart beat faster?

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.770
It was your mind.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.430
You weren't running.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.390
What made your breathing faster?

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:22.950
It was your mind.

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.880
What made perspiration
come out of your body?

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.340
How hard you have to work out
for perspiration to come out?

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:31.220
Think about it for a moment.

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:34.310
How hard do you have to run
on that treadmill before like,

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.900
OK, finally I'm sweating?

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.250
But here, it's like
you're sitting still.

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:44.160
You're as inactive as possible.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.060
And the mind says, well,
we're going to make you sweat.

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.450
So it's a product of the mind.

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.250
The physical health is
a product of the mind.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:58.450
Who knows which movie
this quote is from?

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:59.975
"The mind makes it real."

00:22:59.975 --> 00:23:00.540
Come on.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:01.780
Someone's got to know.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.020
"The Matrix." "Inception"
is a good guess.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:04.810
It was similar.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:05.710
Who said Matrix?

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:06.210
OK.

00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:06.710
Yes.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:08.430
It's one of my favorite movies.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:12.480
Now this is when Neo is
getting trained by Morpheus.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.860
He comes out of that
training session bleeding.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:15.860
It didn't really happen.

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:16.440
It was in his mind.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.140
He says, "I thought
it wasn't real."

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.750
And then Morpheus says,
"The mind makes it real."

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:23.250
I was trying to sound like
Morpheus with a shaved head.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:26.360
So he said the
mind makes it real.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:30.270
And that's what it is, because
the mind can create a reality.

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.650
So much that we may forget
what is real and what's not.

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:35.920
So sleepwalking.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.470
That's another
interesting phenomena.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:40.122
How many here sleepwalk
or have slept-walked

00:23:40.122 --> 00:23:41.560
at some point in their life?

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:43.090
OK.

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:45.134
You want to tell
us what you do--

00:23:45.134 --> 00:23:48.613
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
sleepwalked when I was a kid

00:23:48.613 --> 00:23:50.601
and not after I grew up.

00:23:50.601 --> 00:23:52.100
I mean, I don't what kind of--

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:52.740
GADADHARA PANDIT:
Even if you did,

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.948
we don't hold it against you.

00:23:53.948 --> 00:23:55.739
It's OK.

00:23:55.739 --> 00:23:57.530
So you don't remember
exactly what you did?

00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.310
AUDIENCE: No.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.450
GADADHARA PANDIT: Anybody
have a funny story

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.170
of them sleepwalking
or watch-- yes?

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.160
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.872
So when I was in
college, I think

00:24:05.872 --> 00:24:08.595
I'd just become a TA,
teaching assistant.

00:24:08.595 --> 00:24:12.555
In the middle of the night
around 2:00 or something,

00:24:12.555 --> 00:24:14.040
I'm in my sleep, I'm walking.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.515
And I go to my
roommate's room, and I

00:24:16.515 --> 00:24:18.069
start giving her
a lecture of what

00:24:18.069 --> 00:24:19.485
I was going to
teach the next day.

00:24:19.485 --> 00:24:21.151
And she's looking at
me like, Sonia, you

00:24:21.151 --> 00:24:23.620
need to go back to bed.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:24.870
GADADHARA PANDIT: Oh, my gosh.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:25.369
Yeah.

00:24:28.199 --> 00:24:28.740
It's amazing.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.240
I've had people tell me that
they watched their roommate get

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.365
up, go to the kitchen,
make a sandwich.

00:24:33.365 --> 00:24:34.070
All right.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.020
One lady said that
her friend told her

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:39.560
that she got up in the middle of
the night and washed her face.

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.280
You'd think water
would wake you up,

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.113
but if the mind doesn't
want you to wake up,

00:24:43.113 --> 00:24:44.850
you're not waking
up no matter what.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:46.870
And then she went back to bed.

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:50.650
So this is-- the idea is
that for us to understand

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:53.180
the nature of our mind,
how powerful it is.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.320
It makes a plan for you.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.257
Imagine, especially,
sleepwalking.

00:24:57.257 --> 00:24:58.090
I used to sleepwalk.

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:01.040
My parent said I'd try
to walk out of the house.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:02.490
And it makes a plan for you.

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:05.210
It makes you execute it, and
it tells you go back to bed,

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.570
and don't remember anything.

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:08.330
OK.

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.310
So that's how much in
control your mind is.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.640
So how much control
are we in actually?

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.490
It's just something
to think about.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:16.760
So our mind has a strong
impact on our body.

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:22.840
According to the American
Psychology Association,

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.170
the things that we do that
are unhealthy in dealing

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:26.337
with stress.

00:25:26.337 --> 00:25:27.920
These are some of
the four main things

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:34.000
that we do when we're stressed
is smoking, drinking, comfort

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.030
eating.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:38.570
Anybody relate to that
picture right there?

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:39.520
Right?

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:41.990
Comfort eating and
inactivity, and you

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:46.690
might think that
inactivity-- this guy-- OK.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:50.350
My slideshow's jumping
around on me, actually.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.220
So you might think
that inactivity

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.860
would have a picture of a
guy kind of lounging out

00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:56.440
in a chair with
a remote control,

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:58.930
so you can imagine that now.

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:01.470
You'd think that
that's maybe relaxing,

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:03.000
and I think it
could be at times.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.090
Of course, if you combine
it with the other three,

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.431
that can be kind of
a lethal combination.

00:26:07.431 --> 00:26:07.930
Right?

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:12.210
So we want to be careful
how we combine things.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.110
And there's a lot of, I
think, positive solutions

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:18.110
that we-- I'm sure
a lot of us already

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.130
apply into our lives
to deal with stress.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.855
And one such thing, of course--
how many of you do yoga?

00:26:24.855 --> 00:26:26.630
A lot of people do
yoga around here?

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.920
I know there's a yoga class here
like on Monday nights, right?

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.310
Gopi leads a yoga
class or something.

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:32.194
AUDIENCE: There's like
five classes every day.

00:26:32.194 --> 00:26:33.140
GADADHARA PANDIT: Huh?

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.431
There's five classes every day.

00:26:34.431 --> 00:26:36.730
My gosh, you guys
are like yogis.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:37.680
Natural-born yogis.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.650
OK.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:42.830
So exercise, yoga, of
course, is a wonderful thing,

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.800
one way to stay healthy.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.360
Getting a good night's sleep.

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.980
So important.

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:49.930
If you don't get
that, you're going

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:51.910
to be tired and sleepy
at work, and that's not

00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:55.070
going to be fun for you
or for people around you.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.130
Personal hobby.

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:59.620
You know, once you get out
of college, a lot of that

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:01.370
starts slipping away.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.220
Things that you enjoy doing
that made you feel good,

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:06.330
made you just kind of
connect with yourself,

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:07.630
do something for yourself.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:08.880
Maybe you like to ride horses.

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.050
Maybe you like to bird
watch or go for walks

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:14.310
or draw or play music.

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:17.590
So important to somehow
revive those things.

00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:21.000
Bring them back into your life.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.470
Don't forget-- don't
leave yourself behind.

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.360
So keep implementing
those things.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.130
Positive relationships.

00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.230
So important,
because that can be

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.430
really a huge cause of stress.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:36.340
Especially like personal
relationships not going well.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.580
That's going to spill over
onto work and everything else.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:44.400
And it can be-- and developing
relationships is hard.

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.630
Maintaining them is hard,
because everybody gets so busy.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.870
You have to schedule
everything a month in advance.

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:54.290
But make that endeavor to
connect with your friends

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.970
from college, connect
with your family,

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:57.620
because ultimately
when you're going

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.130
through difficult
situations in your life,

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.480
these are the people that are
going to be there for you.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.830
It's not going to
be anything else.

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:05.750
And then what
about relationships

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.660
with our colleagues?

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.030
We are spending a good amount
of time with our colleagues.

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:11.969
Half your day.

00:28:11.969 --> 00:28:13.510
You might know your
colleagues better

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.900
than you know your spouse.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.150
You know the eating
habits and talking habits

00:28:18.150 --> 00:28:21.730
and everything, because you're
kind of next to each other.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.750
Making that endeavor,
and it is an endeavor,

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.390
to get to know them and
to have a nice positive

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:29.590
harmonious
relationship with them.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.220
So important.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.012
Can relieve stress.

00:28:31.012 --> 00:28:32.761
And then you understand
each other better.

00:28:32.761 --> 00:28:34.320
Less opportunity
for misunderstanding

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.730
and miscommunication when
you understand each other.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.780
So that little investment
can prevent you

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.180
from a lot of stress
in the future.

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:47.830
So the last two items were
healthy eating and meditation.

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.850
So we're going to talk about
those now in the slides.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.470
According to Harvard
Health Publications,

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:57.200
red meat in addition to raising
the risk for colorectal cancer

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.710
and other health problems, it
can actually shorten your life.

00:29:01.710 --> 00:29:04.490
The National Cancer
Institute, people whose diets

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.190
are rich in plant foods, such
as fruits and vegetables,

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.070
have a lower risk of
getting cancers, diabetes,

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.202
heart disease, and hypertension.

00:29:13.202 --> 00:29:16.460
My friend just took me
into your cafeteria here,

00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:19.190
and I was looking at all
the signs on the walls.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.330
I was like, oh, my god.

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.300
I'm talking about
this stuff right here.

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:23.300
I like it.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.650
Google's healthy.

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:29.180
It said, "Go lean,"
on the dairy and meat.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.449
I'm like, yes, I like that.

00:29:30.449 --> 00:29:31.990
It said that-- one
of the other signs

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:35.120
said, half your plate
with vegetables-- for me

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:37.700
it's a full plate-- but it
says at least half your plate

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.850
with vegetables.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:41.690
Mix up the vegetables, because
different vegetables give you

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.160
different nutrients
and vitamins.

00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:44.510
I used to do vegetarian
cooking classes

00:29:44.510 --> 00:29:45.920
at Columbia for about 11 years.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:49.270
Had like 100 students
coming in, and you were just

00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:51.830
talking about eating a variety
of fruits and vegetables

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.670
really improves your health
and stamina and everything,

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.029
actually.

00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:58.570
According to the
Physicians Committee

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:01.860
for Responsible Medicine,
vegetarian foods

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.740
are powerful for health.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.800
They can help with
preventing cancer,

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.880
lowering blood
pressure, and also

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.100
help you in beating heart
disease, which we already saw.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.330
Preventing and reversing
diabetes, gall stones,

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:17.010
kidney stones, and
osteoporosis, lots of benefits.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.300
Incredible, right?

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:22.420
And helps with removing asthma.

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:22.920
OK.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:26.000
That's jumping too quickly.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.020
So how many of you know that
Bill Clinton went vegan?

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:34.840
After he had this quadruple
bypass surgery, he went vegan,

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.270
cut out all meat, all dairy.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.180
And he says that
within six months,

00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.860
his body begin to heal itself.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.970
It began to heal itself.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.110
The stuff just fell away,
the clogs and everything

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.700
was just kind of falling away.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.890
And it was an incredible
change in his life.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:54.800
So, and I went vegetarian
about 15 or 17 ago.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.430
It wasn't easy, because I was
kind of carnivorous growing up.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:01.690
Every meal, every lunch and
dinner for me had to have meat.

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.240
I almost never ate
lunch or dinner

00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.537
that didn't have some
kind of meat there.

00:31:05.537 --> 00:31:07.870
Breakfast was cereal, but
everything else just had meat.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:08.960
If it didn't have
meat, I'd like,

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.900
I don't think I've
like really eaten yet.

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:11.750
I need to eat.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:12.990
I haven't eaten yet.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.280
So that was just
kind of like how

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.660
people think about
vegetarian food.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.761
So I was part of that
culture, but for me, I

00:31:19.761 --> 00:31:21.260
mean I'm just really
grateful that I

00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:25.320
was able to go do it
for my own health.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.570
So other items.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:30.780
So what we've been
talking about here

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:34.050
are foods that cause us stress.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:38.620
So we've talked about if meat
is causing-- has a potential

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:41.380
or increases your possibility
of getting cancer, that

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.650
means it's stressing
your body out.

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:44.650
It's stress on the body.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.441
It's not able to really
digest it properly.

00:31:46.441 --> 00:31:49.440
It's staying in
there way too long.

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.520
This is really interesting.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.420
I know you guys probably
aren't happy to see the slide.

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.650
Duke Medicine.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:31:59.510
Caffeine effects our
long-lasting and compound

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:01.100
stress.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.210
No need to hide
your coffee mugs.

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.650
I'm not a judgmental monk.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.076
You can do what you want.

00:32:07.076 --> 00:32:08.450
Caffeine taken in
the morning has

00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:11.490
effects on the body that
persist until bedtime

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:16.120
and amplify stress consistently
throughout the day.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.750
Because it's revving
up your system.

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.460
A lot of these
are comfort foods,

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:22.160
and what they do
is they make you--

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.410
they give you an instant rush.

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:25.500
Why do they relax you?

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.249
I'll tell you why.

00:32:26.249 --> 00:32:28.250
Because you're stressed,
and it tastes so good

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:32.000
you stop-- you're no longer
in your mind anymore.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:32.820
It's a distraction.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.640
It just serves as a distraction.

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.510
But 20 minutes later, it's
going to affect your body,

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:40.810
it's going to affect
your energy level,

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:42.510
it's going to bring
it right back down.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.990
In that instance, it's
kind of like a baby.

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:46.420
You distract it for something.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:47.460
That's what happens.

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:50.030
We like to distract, so we
put something in our mouth,

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.620
and we get distracted.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.130
So there's a really nice image.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.012
And it's on the New
York City subway system.

00:32:57.012 --> 00:32:58.970
New York City subway
systems are going healthy.

00:32:58.970 --> 00:33:00.550
The rest of New York isn't,
but the subway system's

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:01.420
going healthy.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:03.540
They have these posters
on the subway where

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:06.960
they have 68 packets of sugar.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.730
OK?

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.970
And they're pouring
into the sugary drinks.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:14.510
All the sodas and lemonades
and things that we're drinking.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:20.460
Four sugary drinks equal
68 packets of sugar.

00:33:20.460 --> 00:33:26.030
17 packets per bottle of
whatever you're drinking.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.040
Sodas and sugary drinks.

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.760
Imagine next time you go to
like Starbucks or something,

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.860
just for the fun of it,
just grab 17 packets

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.960
and look at them for awhile.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.460
Yeah.

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.720
That's a lot of sugar.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:41.406
And next time you want
to grab a sugary drink,

00:33:41.406 --> 00:33:43.030
you can imagine that's
what's going in,

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:47.790
and all these extra calories
can bring on obesity, type 2

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:51.690
diabetes, and heart disease.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.490
So comfort foods,
they taste good,

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.540
they make you feel good
for a little while,

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.740
they give you a
little extra energy.

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.660
Is it worth it for the long run?

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:02.930
Because when you're young,
you can get away with it.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:06.550
20 years later, your
body will remind you.

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:09.350
I promise it'll tell you
that you don't remember,

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.370
but you put all
this stuff into me.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:12.489
And now it's payback time.

00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.429
Healthy eating.

00:34:18.429 --> 00:34:21.980
There's another sign that
I saw in the cafeteria that

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:26.409
said, replace like sugary drinks
with like juices or something,

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:28.310
or sugars with
fruits and juices.

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:29.502
Something like that.

00:34:29.502 --> 00:34:31.210
So what I personally
like to do because I

00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:32.630
have a huge sweet tooth.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.429
I love my sweets.

00:34:34.429 --> 00:34:35.350
Monks love sweets.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:36.150
All monks.

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:37.850
Every monk on the
planet loves sweets.

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:41.060
So I love my sweets, and I know
that if I don't have fruits

00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:44.639
at my desk, I'll go
for something sugary.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:48.159
So when I start my
day, I just grab

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:52.810
some stuff-- raisins, and
apples, and things like that

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:54.139
and have them on my desk.

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:56.480
Juices, so when I
feel the craving,

00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:58.540
if it's not
available right away,

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.170
my mind's taking me
to a candy machine.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.410
So easy thing,
simple habits that we

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.390
can try to implement
into our lives.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.970
Bring it in with you,
so it's just there.

00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:12.750
Water.

00:35:12.750 --> 00:35:13.382
Simple.

00:35:13.382 --> 00:35:15.840
I can't remember, there's a
really great quote about water.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.140
Oh, yeah.

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.140
It's the only thing that
can quench your thirst.

00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.764
I've got all these
Google quotes.

00:35:19.764 --> 00:35:21.430
So it's the only thing
that could really

00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:22.680
quench your thirst,
and that's true.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.096
You know when you
get thirsty, you

00:35:24.096 --> 00:35:25.780
may want to go for
something else.

00:35:25.780 --> 00:35:27.810
It's putting sugar in your body.

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:29.750
It's not really
quenching your thirst.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:33.830
And remaining properly hydrated
can keep your cortisol levels

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:34.760
down.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.600
So cortisol is the
hormone that your body

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.205
releases when you're stressed.

00:35:40.205 --> 00:35:42.330
And that's the stuff that
really-- cortisol affects

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:43.413
your body in so many ways.

00:35:43.413 --> 00:35:46.110
It starts like the learning
process gets affected,

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:49.040
memory gets affected,
immune system gets weaker.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.626
So the more-- drinking water
really helps keep it down.

00:35:53.626 --> 00:35:55.250
Are we drinking enough
water every day?

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:58.000
That's something we
have to ask ourselves.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:00.750
Another thing I like to do,
I have a one liter bottle.

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:03.010
And I just fill it in the
morning, keep it at my desk.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:05.093
Of course, if you can drink
more than that, great.

00:36:05.093 --> 00:36:06.800
But I know if it's
on my desk, it's

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.840
my goal to like get through
that by the end of the day.

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.140
And I kind of have to
have it right there

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:15.090
to really make it possible so
that I actually follow through

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:16.920
on it.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:17.580
Baby's feet.

00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:18.927
Nice meditation, right?

00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:21.260
It's such a stress reliever
just to look at baby's feet.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:21.920
Isn't it?

00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.420
You kind of forget
about everything.

00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:26.940
So there's a point
I'm making here.

00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.870
I mentioned a lot
of health tips.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.935
And we really have
to take baby steps.

00:36:31.935 --> 00:36:34.450
Like if you're not used to
drinking a lot of water,

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.080
don't run out and
drink a gallon.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.424
That's actually unhealthy.

00:36:39.424 --> 00:36:41.340
And if you're thinking,
well, yeah, maybe now.

00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:43.410
I kind of maybe have always
thought about vegetarianism.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:44.493
Maybe I'm going to try it.

00:36:44.493 --> 00:36:46.040
I'm going to just
go for it tomorrow.

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.247
Try one day a week first.

00:36:48.247 --> 00:36:49.330
Try like meatless Mondays.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:52.180
That's kind of a popular term
in Northern California I think,

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:52.680
right?

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.888
You do like meatless Mondays.

00:36:53.888 --> 00:36:55.430
Try one day a week.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:56.650
Increase it two days.

00:36:56.650 --> 00:36:58.700
You have plenty of
time to cut back.

00:36:58.700 --> 00:37:00.944
Better to start in
a way that you'll

00:37:00.944 --> 00:37:02.360
be able to sustain
it and maintain

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.900
it as opposed to getting
all fired up for one week,

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.010
going cold turkey--
no pun intended

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.860
there-- going cold
turkey, and then

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.740
falling off the wagon,
and just diving head

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.550
first into the next like
20-ounce steak or something.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:18.510
So take baby steps.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:22.190
You'll be sustain-- it took me
one full year to wean myself

00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:23.880
off of meat, actually.

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:24.730
A full year.

00:37:24.730 --> 00:37:27.450
Because I mean that's all I ate.

00:37:27.450 --> 00:37:30.320
That's all that I
knew how to eat.

00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:36.690
So the next thing, one of
the most important things

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:40.420
about dealing with stress,
because stress is in the mind.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.080
It's happening up here.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.030
We talked about all the ways
the mind creates our reality.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.610
So now we're going to talk about
something that directly deals

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:55.770
with your mind, goes to the
very source of where stress is,

00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.610
and creates a healthy
environment for where

00:37:58.610 --> 00:38:00.185
all of these items
are processed.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:06.810
A lot of research is
being done on meditation.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:10.430
According to MIT News,
our data indicate

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:13.320
that meditation training
makes you better at focusing.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.140
That's a neuroscientist
from MIT.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.299
Makes you better at focusing.

00:38:17.299 --> 00:38:19.840
Makes sense, because the mind
is responsible for how much you

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:21.420
can focus.

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:24.340
You're relaxed.

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:26.010
If that mechanism
is relaxed, you'll

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:27.093
naturally be more focused.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.120
Forbes magazine.

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.339
Meditation makes
you more productive.

00:38:35.339 --> 00:38:36.880
And this is all very
recent research,

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:38.740
the last couple of
years, actually.

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.770
New York Times-- there's
mounting evidence

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:45.652
that the practice can enhance
creativity and memory.

00:38:45.652 --> 00:38:47.610
We could always use a
little bit better memory.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:48.690
I think we can remember.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:49.910
Usually you meet somebody.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:51.760
Five minutes later
you forget their name.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.580
Had that happen to anyone?

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:53.220
Maybe not you guys.

00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:54.386
Maybe it happens to me only.

00:38:54.386 --> 00:38:54.940
I don't know.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:58.810
Psychology Today-- helps you
decrease anxiety, depression,

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:01.010
and stress.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:04.810
Because again, all of these
things are happening up here.

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:08.640
You don't want them to happen,
but the mind makes it happen.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.260
The mind makes it real.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.920
That's what's really happening.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:16.030
How much you decide to
take stress over something

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:19.090
is really up to your mind.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.619
And, well, I think
we can sometimes,

00:39:20.619 --> 00:39:22.410
in retrospect, we see
like, I didn't really

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:26.262
need to work myself up
that much because of that.

00:39:26.262 --> 00:39:28.800
Like I was so crazy, and
I just let myself do that.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.050
I did it to myself.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.460
There's no need.

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.860
So now we're going to just talk
about how meditation can really

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:42.540
help us bring our mind to a
healthier, stronger place,

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:46.390
so we can function from a place
of strength and not weakness.

00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:48.450
Imagine living your
whole life without really

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:51.390
taking care of your mind.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:55.680
So what meditation does for the
mind, it nourishes the mind.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.260
So we have our
physical body, and we

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:00.500
take care of our
physical body how?

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:04.274
By exercising, by
eating properly,

00:40:04.274 --> 00:40:10.150
but the control center is
up here for the whole body.

00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:13.180
And we're not doing anything
about the control center.

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:16.500
It's like cleaning the car,
but letting the engine just

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:17.790
fall apart.

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:19.380
Think about it for a moment.

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:22.349
That's the control center,
and when was the last time

00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:24.890
we actually sat down-- oh, we've
got to take care of the mind

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:26.570
right now?

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:27.840
No one tells us to do that.

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.430
We've forgotten it.

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:29.804
Out of sight, out
of mind, right?

00:40:29.804 --> 00:40:32.010
That's kind of what's happening.

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:34.715
So meditation-- it's an
exercise for the mind.

00:40:34.715 --> 00:40:37.310
It makes the mind your friend.

00:40:37.310 --> 00:40:40.670
And it helps you develop
positive perspectives.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:42.870
So when you meditate,
your mind wanders.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.090
You have to bring it back.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:44.620
It wanders.

00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:45.870
You have to bring it back.

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:47.440
And that's an exercise.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.710
Kind of like pushups
for the mind.

00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:51.990
So the more we
exercise the mind,

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:53.730
we take time out
on a regular basis

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:56.170
to do that, the
healthier it'll become.

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:59.800
We'll feel the effects
of depression and anxiety

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.910
decreasing.

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:03.682
We'll feel having more
positive perspective.

00:41:03.682 --> 00:41:05.140
Something difficult
happens, you'll

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.910
be able to see that as
an opportunity for growth

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.659
instead of just diving
into it and staying

00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:11.076
depressed for the next
couple weeks about it.

00:41:11.076 --> 00:41:12.450
It all depends on
a healthy mind,

00:41:12.450 --> 00:41:15.370
and this is the way
to really do it.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:18.060
Through the positive
perspective, helping you

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.260
see the glass as half full
and not as half empty.

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:22.860
The really great
quote here that I

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.959
like from Steve Jobs,
"You can't connect

00:41:24.959 --> 00:41:26.000
the dots looking forward.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.110
You only connect
them looking back."

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.084
And unless you have
a healthy mind,

00:41:31.084 --> 00:41:33.250
you can't really even connect
the dots looking back.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:35.870
Like all these things
led me to this point,

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.607
and I'm actually like, now
I can look back and say

00:41:38.607 --> 00:41:40.690
that everything that
happened to me was actually--

00:41:40.690 --> 00:41:43.340
I'm glad, because I
needed to go through all

00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:47.230
of that to come to
where I am today.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:49.230
And maybe you're still
thinking that, well, it's

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.910
only for monks.

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.007
Well, it's not only for monks.

00:41:52.007 --> 00:41:54.340
A lot of people now, as you
already see in the research,

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:58.240
are into meditation or
have been into meditation.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.850
Oprah's talking about
meditation constantly.

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:03.370
Phil Jackson-- you
guys know, right?

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:07.500
He's a coach of the
Bulls and the Lakers,

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.500
won 11 championship rings.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.137
Most rings of any
other NBA coach.

00:42:13.137 --> 00:42:14.720
He's called the Zen
master, because he

00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:17.990
used to make his team
meditate before games.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:19.820
Steve Jobs used to
be into meditation.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.320
I also have a
picture-- I don't know

00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:23.410
if it's going to pop up--
of Arianna Huffington.

00:42:23.410 --> 00:42:28.750
One time, so much stress she
collapsed, hit her cheekbone,

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.770
and she realized that
something was wrong.

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:33.210
She needed to
implement meditation

00:42:33.210 --> 00:42:35.530
into her life for
healthier living,

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:37.280
so she can't stop
talking about it either.

00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.890
So professionals,
very successful people

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.765
who are exploring some
concept of meditation.

00:42:42.765 --> 00:42:45.200
And there's different
types of meditation.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.659
Of course, what we already did
a little bit of-- breathing.

00:42:47.659 --> 00:42:49.116
We're going to do
a little bit more

00:42:49.116 --> 00:42:51.170
now for just a five
minute, a little bit more.

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:54.970
Some focusing, someone
mantras, and the mantras

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:58.220
are audible recitation
of sounds, actually.

00:42:58.220 --> 00:43:00.090
So that's another way
using sound vibration

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:01.650
to calm the mind.

00:43:01.650 --> 00:43:04.880
A lot of people will
affiliate mantras to some

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.230
more like a spiritual
religious practice.

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:10.340
So we won't go into
anything like that today.

00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:13.220
But we will do some
breathing and meditation.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:18.110
So having said all that, we can
do some meditation right now.

00:43:18.110 --> 00:43:20.190
And then I'll open
it up for questions.

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.834
That sound OK?

00:43:21.834 --> 00:43:22.740
All right.

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:26.336
So if you can go ahead
and again sit comfortably.

00:43:26.336 --> 00:43:29.752
What's the time?

00:43:29.752 --> 00:43:30.728
Ten minutes.

00:43:34.144 --> 00:43:36.110
OK.

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:37.190
You can close your eyes.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:48.820
And for now don't worry about
what you're going to do later.

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.020
Try not to think about
what happened yesterday

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:52.480
or last week.

00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.180
Just feel your body
sitting in its chair come

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.180
into the present moment.

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:07.210
And take a deep breath
in through your nose,

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:08.120
filling your lungs.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:16.480
And exhale deeply, completely.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.100
Now we're going to do a
countdown of our breathing,

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.800
keeping our mind focused on our
breath even when it wanders.

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:29.010
Inhale 10.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:35.830
Complete inhale.

00:44:35.830 --> 00:44:38.440
When your lungs are
filled, exhale 10.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:47.320
Exhale completely.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.330
Inhale nine.

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:57.480
Exhale nine.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:09.095
Inhale eight.

00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:18.310
Exhale eight.

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:19.610
Stay focused on your breathing.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.750
Now continue breathing and
counting down on your own

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:29.590
till you get to one.

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:31.750
As your mind wanders,
keep it on the breath.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:13.190
Stay focused on your breath.

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.740
Don't plan.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.340
One more deep breath in.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:36.750
Keeping your eyes
closed, exhale.

00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:39.920
Now bring your awareness
to the top of your head.

00:46:44.224 --> 00:46:46.390
Focus all of your attention
on the top of your head.

00:46:49.282 --> 00:46:53.030
Now bring your awareness
down to your forehead.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:00.196
Center your awareness in
between your eyebrows.

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:09.950
Now take a look
inward into your mind,

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:11.680
and become an
observer of your mind.

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:25.740
Bring your awareness
to your eyes.

00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:27.050
Relax the muscles in your eyes.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.610
Bring your awareness down to
your mouth and tongue and jaw.

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:45.220
Relax the muscles in your jaw.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:46.030
Relax your tongue.

00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:48.238
Let your tongue slip down
to the bottom of the mouth.

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:04.420
Bring your awareness down
to your neck and shoulders.

00:48:10.592 --> 00:48:12.550
Release the tension in
your neck and shoulders.

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:14.090
Let your shoulders drop down.

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:28.395
Now bring your awareness
down to your heart.

00:48:28.395 --> 00:48:30.910
And see if you can feel
the beating of your heart.

00:48:39.874 --> 00:48:42.070
When you become aware of
the beating of your heart,

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:43.510
focus harder and see
if you can pick up

00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:44.843
on the rhythm of your heartbeat.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:59.840
Take a deep breath in
bringing your awareness

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:04.070
slowly back up your body
to the top of your head.

00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:08.785
Exhale slowly.

00:49:12.194 --> 00:49:13.610
Bring your awareness
to your eyes.

00:49:17.019 --> 00:49:20.100
And slowly open your eyes.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:39.820
See how easy it is for
the mind to wander?

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:41.140
Takes a few seconds actually.

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:45.410
Within two seconds, the mind's
already on another thought.

00:49:45.410 --> 00:49:47.240
And many of our
thoughts that we have

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.985
are unrelated to each other.

00:49:48.985 --> 00:49:53.050
It's like a pinball
machine in there.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:57.654
And like anything, if you
exercise the mind regularly,

00:49:57.654 --> 00:49:58.570
it'll become stronger.

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:01.731
If you work out once
a year, not much good.

00:50:01.731 --> 00:50:03.230
Work out regularly,
become stronger.

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:04.884
Your stamina increases.

00:50:04.884 --> 00:50:06.550
Now we did this for
five, seven minutes.

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:07.887
I saw some people doze off.

00:50:07.887 --> 00:50:08.470
That's normal.

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:12.220
I see it all the time,
because it relaxes you.

00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:16.160
But five minutes in the morning,
or in the evening, and or in

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.390
the evening, in the
middle of the day.

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.300
Go into your nap pods
here that you guys,

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.820
which I'm hoping to
see before I leave.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:23.640
They really true?

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.390
Do they really exist?

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:26.195
You know.

00:50:26.195 --> 00:50:28.110
Just find a space.

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:30.639
Do it in the middle of the day
before a stressful meeting.

00:50:30.639 --> 00:50:33.180
If you know something's going
to be stressful, take time out.

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.380
Just gather yourself.

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.780
Strengthen yourself
before going in.

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.070
So I want to thank you all
very much for your patience,

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:43.840
your attention, and
your participation.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:44.340
Yes?

00:50:47.124 --> 00:50:48.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:52.550
You spoke about your
diet restriction,

00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:57.166
not to have a few things--
Coke, sugary things.

00:50:57.166 --> 00:50:59.990
But isn't it true that
everything in moderation

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.490
is good?

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:04.740
Every food comes with
some of its benefits?

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:08.390
So rather than completely
doing away with it,

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:11.637
having it in moderation
isn't a good idea?

00:51:11.637 --> 00:51:13.470
GADADHARA PANDIT: Well,
like a sugary drink?

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:15.860
That's already going
beyond moderation.

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.530
So we're talking
about those things.

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:19.470
Yeah, I mean the sugar
in fruits, actually.

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:21.720
The sugar in fruits, everything
in moderation is good.

00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:24.240
It's just some of these products
are already beyond moderate.

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.010
You have one of
those, you've already

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:27.070
gone beyond the
moderation limit.

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:30.910
AUDIENCE: I saw a cup
of tea in your picture,

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:33.921
so I thought tea had come
with some health benefits.

00:51:33.921 --> 00:51:34.420
Right?

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:34.910
GADADHARA PANDIT: Yeah.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:35.572
I don't know.

00:51:35.572 --> 00:51:37.780
I mean, I know it stimulates
the body and mind, which

00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:41.030
is there's other ways to do that
same simulation without putting

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.990
something in.

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.740
Again, I'm saying
that you've got

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:44.090
to do what you've got
to do for yourself.

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:45.910
Whatever you feel
is healthy for you.

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:47.360
These are some suggestions.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:49.550
These aren't dos and don'ts.

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:52.720
You see where you're at, what
you're able to do comfortably.

00:51:52.720 --> 00:51:56.220
And these are suggestions
and recommendations.

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:58.989
So whatever you feel is
best for you, you know.

00:51:58.989 --> 00:52:01.030
AUDIENCE: So what we did
today, is that something

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:04.790
that one could probably do
like in the morning or at night

00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:05.380
before bed?

00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:05.680
GADADHARA PANDIT: Yeah.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.055
I taught something
that I thought

00:52:07.055 --> 00:52:08.650
people could do on
a regular basis.

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:10.980
There's many more techniques
and many more elaborate things.

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:12.354
I mean, I meditate
for like-- I'm

00:52:12.354 --> 00:52:14.050
kind of fanatic
about my meditation.

00:52:14.050 --> 00:52:15.425
I do it for like
two hours a day.

00:52:15.425 --> 00:52:16.696
But you do it five minutes.

00:52:16.696 --> 00:52:18.070
Something is better
than nothing.

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:19.160
It's a good start to your day.

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:20.159
It's a great way to end.

00:52:20.159 --> 00:52:22.840
It relaxes you at
the end of the day.

00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:24.640
It might help you sleep better.

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:27.525
So, yeah, I think absolutely
it's a good way to start.

00:52:27.525 --> 00:52:28.840
It's a great way to start.

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:33.110
AUDIENCE: I'm a believer in
all this stuff, especially

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:35.930
the meditation piece, but
I've struggled mightily

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:39.640
to incorporate it
into my daily routine.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:43.620
And even just the one minute,
five minutes, small chunks,

00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:46.110
and I was wondering if you
had any suggestions on how

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:53.910
to incorporate into the daily
schedule or daily habit.

00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:56.760
Is it-- do you
find that it's best

00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:00.095
to do it first thing
in the morning or right

00:53:00.095 --> 00:53:00.970
before you go to bed?

00:53:00.970 --> 00:53:03.390
Like time of day?

00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:05.094
How do you manage it?

00:53:05.094 --> 00:53:07.260
GADADHARA PANDIT: It all
depends on each individual.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:10.860
Whatever you think would work
best for you, just start there.

00:53:10.860 --> 00:53:13.360
Whatever you know that you would
have the easiest time with.

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:14.240
Maybe it's the first thing.

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:15.323
Maybe it's the last thing.

00:53:15.323 --> 00:53:17.220
Maybe it's in the middle.

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.550
Finding other people that
like to do it is a good way.

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:22.840
Like last year I did a 10-week
meditations course session.

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.110
And after that was over, five
of the people-- we got about 10,

00:53:26.110 --> 00:53:27.840
15 people coming--
five of the people

00:53:27.840 --> 00:53:29.990
formed a little
group on their own.

00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:31.740
And they said that
OK, from now on,

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.240
whenever we do our
meditation, we're

00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.470
going to text the
others that I did it.

00:53:35.470 --> 00:53:37.720
And then the other-- imagine
in the middle of the day,

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.320
get a text like, I meditated.

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:40.840
OK.

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:41.756
I've got to do it now.

00:53:41.756 --> 00:53:43.680
So getting and
finding a community

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.180
of others that are also
doing it is very powerful.

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.840
So I mean if you have like
five [INAUDIBLE] classes,

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:52.410
and maybe there's some
meditation sessions happening.

00:53:52.410 --> 00:53:54.989
Things where you can
join other people.

00:53:54.989 --> 00:53:56.280
Little things, it sounds funny.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.910
Put it in your schedule.

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:59.010
Put it in your calendar.

00:53:59.010 --> 00:53:59.861
Let it pop up.

00:53:59.861 --> 00:54:00.360
Oh.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:02.484
Like if you know that
tomorrow probably around 3:00

00:54:02.484 --> 00:54:04.444
PM you might have
time, just put it in.

00:54:04.444 --> 00:54:06.360
If it doesn't happen,
at least it reminds you.

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.568
And put it on a daily repeat.

00:54:07.568 --> 00:54:09.860
Just let it every
day to remind you.

00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:11.610
These are the simple
techniques we can do.

00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:13.610
And I think having other
like-minded association

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:14.675
is really powerful.

00:54:14.675 --> 00:54:15.300
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:18.030
I like the idea of doing
it with other people.

00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:20.705
I think the notion of
putting it on your calendar

00:54:20.705 --> 00:54:24.834
is something that I've
tried, and I just ignore it.

00:54:24.834 --> 00:54:27.375
And I feel like it's just like
one more thing on my calendar.

00:54:27.375 --> 00:54:28.835
You know, and I'm like, oh--

00:54:28.835 --> 00:54:30.626
GADADHARA PANDIT: If
you schedule something

00:54:30.626 --> 00:54:33.491
on your calendar, you
might not show up.

00:54:33.491 --> 00:54:33.990
Yeah.

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:35.260
I think finding a
group of people,

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.093
and it seems like there's
a lot of diversity

00:54:37.093 --> 00:54:39.380
here on this campus.

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:42.720
Maybe you could find a group
of people that can help you.

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.410
I know, I think Jess connected
with some meditation groups

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:45.570
here.

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:47.530
You can check with him
and see what's going on.

00:54:47.530 --> 00:54:50.160
If you were in New York, I could
help you out a little bit more.

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.284
AUDIENCE: I agree with
everything that you've said.

00:54:52.284 --> 00:54:54.365
and I do a lot of yoga,
and I try to meditate,

00:54:54.365 --> 00:54:56.764
and I'm practically vegan.

00:54:56.764 --> 00:54:58.180
So I agree with
all of this, but I

00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:00.010
feel like there's
been a lot of research

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:02.930
recently on how
to quiet the mind,

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:06.890
but there hasn't been a lot
of why is the mind this way.

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.700
Because for-- I think
one of the reasons

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:12.807
humans survived against
bigger, scarier animals

00:55:12.807 --> 00:55:14.890
is because we are so smart,
because our brains are

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:16.380
so powerful.

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:18.715
And it's true that right
now they're in overdrive.

00:55:18.715 --> 00:55:22.240
We don't need our brain to--
we're not surviving anymore.

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.121
As you said, in the hills of
California, land of plenty,

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:26.620
we should be relaxed,
and we're not,

00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:28.610
because our brains
are built this way.

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:31.030
But have you come across
any kind of books or studies

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:36.550
on the positive of the
brain being overpowerful

00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:38.220
basically for its purpose?

00:55:38.220 --> 00:55:40.871
Or the benefit of
having a big brain?

00:55:40.871 --> 00:55:42.620
GADADHARA PANDIT: Well,
you know, the mind

00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:43.510
is an active thing.

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:44.930
You can never really
fully quiet the mind.

00:55:44.930 --> 00:55:47.160
It's almost impossible with
all the stuff going in.

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:48.890
And the thing is
that all that energy

00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:51.360
can be directed toward
something positive.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.780
It's like you have
a very active child.

00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:55.510
It can either be destructive.

00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:57.510
It could be productive
and creative.

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:59.260
It all depends on
how you engage it.

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.760
So if using all
that energy, if you

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.426
like a challenge in
your life, challenge

00:56:02.426 --> 00:56:03.780
yourself to meditate every day.

00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:05.800
Why the mind's like that?

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.620
That's hard to say.

00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:07.220
It just is.

00:56:07.220 --> 00:56:08.720
That's how we got it.

00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.910
We all came with
an overactive mind,

00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:14.072
and now our goal is once we
make the mind our friend,

00:56:14.072 --> 00:56:15.530
then it can actually
help us become

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:19.930
so much more productive, even
much nicer people to be around.

00:56:19.930 --> 00:56:22.490
So it's just utilizing
it in a positive way.

00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:25.070
Again, that for me means
more meditation and things

00:56:25.070 --> 00:56:28.610
like that, and then helping it
through proper eating things,

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:31.110
because all the food that
we eat affects our mind.

00:56:31.110 --> 00:56:32.720
It's a relationship.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:35.222
So I think just utilizing
it in a positive way.

00:56:35.222 --> 00:56:37.430
I don't know if there's
research done on this or not.

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:38.700
Maybe there is.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:41.700
But I think just utilizing,
channeling energy

00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:44.220
into more positive activities.

00:56:44.220 --> 00:56:45.760
Well, thank you all
very much again.

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.589
It was a pleasure being
here with all of you.

00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:50.561
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:00.610 --> 00:57:03.930
My name Gadadhara Pandit
Das, and the name of the book

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:08.050
is "Urban Monk-- Exploring
Karma, Consciousness,

00:57:08.050 --> 00:57:09.950
and the Divine."
when most people

00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:12.840
think of what a monk
is, the first thing that

00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.200
comes to their minds
is mountain peaks,

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.140
forests, a beautiful monastery
in the middle of nowhere.

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:24.950
I live surrounded by
nightclubs, bars, tattoo shops,

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:28.590
laundromats, subway stations,
bus stations, and nonstop foot

00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:29.450
traffic.

00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:31.220
A lot of monks do
live in the city

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.530
for the purpose
of helping others

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:35.530
find a more balanced
way to live.

00:57:35.530 --> 00:57:37.070
Every day I'm
talking with people.

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:40.590
I work as a religious
life adviser or chaplain,

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:44.382
and part of that responsibility
involves talking to people,

00:57:44.382 --> 00:57:46.340
listening to them,
listening to their problems,

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:48.680
helping them come up with
solutions to their problems,

00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:51.640
helping them lighten the
load of all the difficulties

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.180
that they're going through.

00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:57.300
I didn't write the book with
the idea of publishing it.

00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:58.890
It started as a
journal, because I

00:57:58.890 --> 00:58:00.660
wanted to reflect
on my own life.

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:04.280
I decided to turn my
journal into a book,

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:08.160
because I thought maybe that me
sharing my story would inspire

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.780
others to, perhaps, also turn
towards your spirituality

00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:12.450
in difficult times.

00:58:12.450 --> 00:58:15.110
The book goes through my
own journey growing up

00:58:15.110 --> 00:58:18.240
in Southern California
where my parents lose

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:21.470
their multi-million
dollar business, which

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:24.260
forces us to move
to East Europe.

00:58:24.260 --> 00:58:27.030
Being so uprooted from
my society and my culture

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:28.800
and my lifestyle
that I had in LA,

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.860
it was a very difficult
time, a very uncertain time.

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:34.360
And so I decided to explore
the Bhagavad Gita, one

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:36.805
of the main spiritual
texts of India

00:58:36.805 --> 00:58:40.050
to understand why all
this is happening to me.

00:58:40.050 --> 00:58:42.160
Why am I suffering so intensely?

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.180
And at that moment, the
Bhagavad Gita really

00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:46.470
gave me the answers
that I was looking for.

00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:47.260
It gave me solace.

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.220
It actually gave me hope.

00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:51.970
A lot of times when people
go through difficulties

00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:55.820
in their lives, we
just become fixated

00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:58.260
on trying to fix the problem.

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.610
Find a quick solution,
so the suffering

00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:02.950
goes away, so the
pain goes away.

00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:05.180
However, that's
not really getting

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:09.327
to the core of the problem,
which is deep within side.

00:59:09.327 --> 00:59:10.910
One of the things I
try to help people

00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:14.380
understand is the
nature of their own mind

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.660
and that if we can
actually nourish the mind,

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:18.385
feed the mind
through meditation,

00:59:18.385 --> 00:59:20.910
and exercise the mind--
because when you meditate,

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:23.720
the mind wanders, and you know
that it just went somewhere.

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:26.280
Then you have to bring it
back, and that bringing it

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.237
back is an exercise.

00:59:28.237 --> 00:59:30.570
It's like I like to think of
it as pushups for the mind.

00:59:30.570 --> 00:59:32.410
What I'm really
hoping is that people

00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:34.760
will be inspired
through this book

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:37.785
to give their spirituality
a serious chance

00:59:37.785 --> 00:59:39.160
not only when
they're struggling,

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.570
but when things are good also.

00:59:41.570 --> 00:59:44.470
Just to keep it as much
a part of their life

00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:46.860
as breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:59:46.860 --> 00:59:51.560
Make spirituality a part
of the everyday experience.
