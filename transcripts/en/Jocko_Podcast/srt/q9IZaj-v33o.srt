him and really excited
to have Tim on the show.

13
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,130
As you know, there's not been
a lot of guests on the show.

14
00:00:56,131 --> 00:01:00,570
The only other guests that's been on this
show so far has been Mr Leif Babin who

15
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:02,400
was one of the platoon commanders,

16
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:06,480
worked for me in Ramadi or last deployment
and wrote the book that I wrote with

17
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:11,481
him and we had a pretty fired up podcast
and talked about a lot about the things

18
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:16,710
that we went through and experienced.
And you know, knowing you,

19
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:20,100
and I know you're a little bit
younger than me, but, uh, you know,

20
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:25,101
you just been through a lot of the same
kind of life events and mistakes and

21
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:27,870
mistakes and same kind of stuff.

22
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:31,230
So it's pretty cool to hang out with you
a little bit today and get to talk to

23
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:31,321
you.

24
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:35,580
And for everyone that's waiting to know
the results of the grappling death match

25
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:37,350
between 10 candidates come and go.

26
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,100
We can't even tell results
because it's still to be decided.

27
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,710
It didn't happen today.
We, uh, we ran out of time.

28
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,270
Tim's got a little dinged up
injury and so we had to forgo that.

29
00:01:48,271 --> 00:01:51,060
And so instead we just went out
and slaughtered some meat. Dude,

30
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,360
it's amazing barbecue coming from
a text and I was like, really?

31
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:58,530
You're taking me to buy into barbecue?
Yeah. Had to do it. Not disappointed.

32
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,780
So also with us, of
course, is Echo Charles.

33
00:02:03,781 --> 00:02:05,610
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,860
So we're going to get straight
into it. Uh, two questions.

35
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:14,730
We've got a ton of questions from the
Internet. Everyone's like exploded.

36
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,010
It did explode. Like, what questions
should I ask? And he's like,

37
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,040
my phone's on fire by
the Internet broke and,

38
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:24,870
but we did get a ton of questions,

39
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:27,180
so thanks everybody for asking
a bunch of cool questions.

40
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:30,780
Obviously we can't answer them all and,
but we're going to try,

41
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,270
we're going to take a crack at it.
And the first one,

42
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,360
and I just started this whole thing off
with cause it for anybody that does know

43
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:41,340
who you are, because I bring in a lot
of fans from, you know, MMA or whatever,

44
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,650
but not really, you know, most of
the people that are listening to me,

45
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,190
I think they might be Jujitsu guys,
but there's a lot of business people and,

46
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,101
and stuff like that.

47
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:50,340
So I guess to start this off with a
question that would give everyone a little

48
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:54,510
bit of background about you, other than
what I've just said, is someone said, hey,

49
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,570
I'd like to hear a little bit about Tim
Kennedy upbringing and what led him to

50
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,430
enlist.

51
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,900
Oh man, go Tim. Uh, I grew
up in central California,

52
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,430
uh, Rural California. When I say I'm
from California, people are like, Oh man,

53
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:12,310
you like, Hollywood is like, no, like
do you surf? And I was like, dude,

54
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,220
I speak Spanish.
I argue with Mexicans.

55
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,780
I ride horses and that's all
there is to do where I'm from. Um,

56
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,510
it's beautiful there,
but uh, it's very rural.

57
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:26,170
It was like an hour long drive from
my folks place to the gas to them,

58
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:29,380
the supermarket. Um, so you know,

59
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:34,381
as I was like the Christian version of
a boy scout or royal ranger and grew up

60
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:36,820
hunting and shooting,
um,

61
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,660
and I dunno,

62
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,820
pretty normal kind of rural kid.

63
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,620
Like there's a lot of like the Marcus
Luttrell and then Chris Kyle's like,

64
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,700
they're from Texas and it seems like
a pretty natural thing as a a decent

65
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:52,330
athlete. I wrestled and
always wanted that next thing,

66
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,860
that next challenge. And
uh, so I was in college,

67
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,120
I was fighting, um, I just won the ECC.

68
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,130
It was like I find Jason
Miller, Ryan McKown. Anyways,

69
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:08,890
just like Dennis Kang was in
the tournament is an eight
man, one 85 tournament.

70
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:13,580
Chucklito was in my corner.
Matt Hughes was the ref and um,

71
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,860
it was for three fights
in one night and uh,

72
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,460
one that which ranked me in the
top 10 in the world. And uh,

73
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,960
that was like August 30th of 2001
then September 11th happened,

74
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,530
um,
uh,

75
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:37,120
watching planes find a buildings
piss me off pretty bad.

76
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,290
So at that time I was a pretty bad person.

77
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,430
I had three women pregnant.
And um,

78
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,570
within the next couple of weeks I also
found out that I had possibly contracted

79
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,360
the HIV virus. And, um,

80
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
so it's professional fighter and Grad
school working at Dotcom and commerce in

81
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:58,630
California thought I was pretty awesome.

82
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,560
And like all revelations in life,
um,

83
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:06,880
when you're not reaching your potential,
it's a stark,

84
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,340
horrible reality.
And that's what it was.

85
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:12,570
It was this wake up call that I was a
piece of shit I should be probably buried,

86
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,870
would be, um, what I've sir,

87
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,260
it would have served the planet
better had I just knocked,

88
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,540
continued consuming oxygen.

89
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,400
So you're saying that that trigger
moment for you was when September 11th.

90
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,910
Yeah. You saw everything that was
happening and you said to yourself, man,

91
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:31,420
this is what I've done with my life
so far. Yup. That's pathetic. Yeah.

92
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,750
Time to get in the game.
Yep. All correct there.

93
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,200
But I think a little
bit more, um, negative,

94
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:43,260
like I am a super nasty piece
of poop beyond the theoretic.

95
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,350
Yeah. I'm looking on, my dad's an
amazing human. My mom's an amazing human.

96
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,750
My sister and my brother, you
know, like even to this day,

97
00:05:49,751 --> 00:05:54,550
I aspire to be what they are. And then
I was like, man, I'm a really bad.

98
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,250
So I go down to the recruiter's office
and I didn't know the difference between

99
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,660
special forces, Navy Seals,
um, marine recon, um,

100
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,360
being a ranger, being a green
Brae. So I went in, I was like,

101
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:07,370
I obviously want to [inaudible]
they're all in the one at the same.

102
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,550
And I was like, I just want to, you
know, be Chuck Norris. Essentially.

103
00:06:10,551 --> 00:06:15,200
They laughed at me. Um, but it's
when I got to the recruiter's office,

104
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,670
when I thought I was like this awesome
American, again taking my say self like,

105
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,220
aw, I'm so cool that I'm
going to go do this, you know,

106
00:06:22,221 --> 00:06:27,221
like how selfless of me and there's
2000 people in line ahead of me,

107
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:32,480
you know, not, not like 1000, not
like 100, which would been a lot,

108
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,610
2000 people in s in rural California.
We're like,

109
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,850
Oh man, I got to go do something and
they'll beat me to it. So I'm again,

110
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,090
a complete piece of shit.
So that,

111
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:45,740
that was kind of like the
genesis and the origin.

112
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,390
That's what brought me to
the recruiter's office.

113
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:49,350
And then through the course of
trying to figure out, you know,

114
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:52,730
what they're as vap score and your gt
score, being a college athlete, you know,

115
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:56,420
like what the right fit was. I wanted
the fastest thing to get me behind a gun,

116
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,390
um, with people that
wanted to kill bad people.

117
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,100
And that's a ended up being the
green berets. Awesome. You know,

118
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:06,440
one of the things, I was on a, uh,

119
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:11,720
interview in England and I was talking
about the fact that America's pretty

120
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,750
restrained in the way it handles things.

121
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:17,750
But I also said that if we
get pushed to a certain point,

122
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,600
and I don't know where that point is
and you can't describe it and no one can

123
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:23,330
predict it, but that's a
case in point. You know,

124
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:26,570
something happens like September 11th,
and you've got 2000 men,

125
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,780
military age males in rural California
standing in line to go and make the

126
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,830
ultimate sacrifice if need be.

127
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,230
You can't forget that about American now.
You can't forget that about him.

128
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:44,030
You go to Pearl Harbor, you
know, Beautiful Hawaii. You
drop some bombs on us for,

129
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,590
you know, because you're pissed off about
the economics of some oil deals. Uh,

130
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,160
we're going to drop nuclear bombs on you.
Yeah.

131
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,720
You come and fly some
planes into our buildings.

132
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:57,710
We're going to go and try to wipe your
culture off the face of the planet for 15

133
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:01,310
years. And that's where we are
right now. Yup. Get a freaking clue.

134
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,480
Don't fuck with us. We get pissed
off if you push this too far,

135
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,730
that's pretty much it.
You know,

136
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,560
you got guys like this who are
already in there just like listen man,

137
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:14,300
bad decision.
Yeah,

138
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,430
it unfortunately you can see that
because it is American because it's an

139
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,240
isolated place and it's a very comfortable
place to live and people are driving

140
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:30,290
around, you know, while you were, you
know, flying around on a, on a helicopter,

141
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,880
getting ready to get inserted on a target,

142
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,720
there was someone else flying around
the mall and they're Cadillac Escalade,

143
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:37,910
getting ready to go and buy some new,
you know,

144
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:41,420
apple software or hardware
and that's their reality.

145
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,130
I mean they have no idea what that's like.

146
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:47,660
So we do forget in America
that what's happening,

147
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:51,650
what can happen to us and the
threats that are out there.

148
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,620
We can forget about that very easily.
And a lot of Americans do.

149
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:57,000
I know a lot of Americans, I know
Americans are listened to this podcast.

150
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:59,730
They don't forget that. Then they know
what we talk about it all the time.

151
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,700
But there are Americans that have no idea.

152
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:08,170
They live so isolated from the rest
of the world that it just wait, the,

153
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:13,020
the thought of going to war for them,

154
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,510
it means going to the mall cause
it doesn't change their life.

155
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:18,510
It doesn't impact their life at all. I
mean, we're here in California, you know,

156
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:21,020
like the perceived Utopian know,

157
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:25,890
like the Shangri la of the United States
and just two hours north of year. Yeah.

158
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,150
Two radicalized fanatics,
bring machine guns,

159
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,420
automatic rifles or raw shot rifles
and start mowing people down.

160
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:39,020
So I think we're coming to a crossroad
where people are going to either need to

161
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:44,811
wake up and stop being pandered
entitled Little Bitches.

162
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:46,823
Um,

163
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,280
or we may not have the same type of life
and culture and opportunity that we've

164
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:56,790
always claimed America to
have and to be. Yeah. Uh,

165
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,980
the key point of that being
freedom and the freedom to move,

166
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:03,360
the freedom to go to that ball.

167
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:07,230
It's the freedom of all those things that
we definitely take for granted because

168
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,270
we've had it for over 200 years.

169
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:11,910
If people forget what it's like
to live in an oppressive society,

170
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,190
they're gonna learn it here pretty
quick. Yeah. Yeah. And that's,

171
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,710
that's one of the best things that the
military does for you is you get to

172
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:23,430
travel with these all these other places
in the world and see what the rest of

173
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:24,360
the world lives like.

174
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:28,830
I caught a little flack from the Inter
webs because I didn't mention that. Yeah.

175
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:31,380
I know that there's other countries
that are first world countries in Europe

176
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,100
that are nice places to live
too. I get that. But would that,

177
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,680
they don't send us in the military
to those places. We, you know,

178
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:40,380
we don't get to go to the first
world countries that are all nice.

179
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:43,740
We go to horrible places
where there's wars happening.

180
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:46,080
And so that's our impression
of the world a lot of times.

181
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:50,280
And it's accurate because that's what
most of the world alive is like. I got it.

182
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:53,790
Germany's nice. Right. You know, but
you said Belgium was really nice.

183
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,340
We said it like from, you know, from
the fifties until just, I don't know,

184
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,420
about two months ago we were like,
Oh man,

185
00:11:00,421 --> 00:11:03,270
they got great chocolate
and she's and coffee,

186
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:07,050
when is the last time you were in
Belgium? Right. Pretty Nice. Oh crap.

187
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:09,260
They're pretty much breeding
terrorists there. Yup.

188
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,730
So shut your face if you're talking to
Jocko about what the world actually is,

189
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,220
and at the same time you,

190
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,180
you talk about like where you don't get
sent to the nice places and the people

191
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,780
complaining they don't get
sent to the bad place. Right.

192
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:29,270
They don't go on a vacation
to Liberia. Yeah. Yeah. So
it happens. So yeah, they'll,

193
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,660
of course they're all, hey, I,

194
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
I've been all over the world to all this,

195
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:37,830
all this horrors that you claim to
have seen, you know, kind of ad.

196
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,850
Obviously you don't say that, but I had
a pretty good and balanced perspective.

197
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,420
Like you live in San Diego, California,
right. It's freaking gorgeous here.

198
00:11:45,421 --> 00:11:47,760
It's one of most beautiful places
on the planet. It is. Yeah.

199
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:51,870
You've been to some nasty places. Um, I
think in like, if we're going to be like,

200
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:55,650
oh, Yin and Yang and you know,
balance of life and crap, um,

201
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,630
with the amount of evil that you've seen,
you've seen the sheer amount of BD,

202
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,690
you know, he married the same woman,
got a beautiful family, you know,

203
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:05,650
you've been in, had an amazing
career, run a great company. Yeah.

204
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:06,970
You saw horrible things too.

205
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:10,840
But like if somebody's going to come
and talk to us about our perspective on

206
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:13,450
life, you know, and like, oh, you don't
really understand if you, you know,

207
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:16,990
if you spent time in France,
like bitch, I have, first of all,

208
00:12:16,991 --> 00:12:19,330
second is I'm not talking about France,

209
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,720
even though Paris just got their
ass kicked and then the train,

210
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:26,260
which would have been like a
complete massacre. Oh, that
would have been, um, yeah,

211
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,010
I understand. And you don't understand
until you've been with me too.

212
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:34,630
Like Kazakhstan or the packy Afghany
border. Shut your fucking face

213
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,460
Jackie. Uh, okay.

214
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,150
To cuss on here cause
that was that. Sorry. You,

215
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,350
you can, uh, you can swear if you
feel the need to. I'll try not to.

216
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,540
When I said I was running late, as I was
walking out the hotel, uh, to come here,

217
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,490
I got grabbed by some people and like,
man,

218
00:12:57,491 --> 00:13:00,250
I'm getting some great feedback
about your presentation yesterday.

219
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,790
Did you know that you said Fuck 18 times?
And I was like,

220
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:06,410
I thought it's about 10 thank you.

221
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:10,330
So is that a positive
or negative feedback?

222
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,150
All in one of the podcasts we talked
about swearing and we talked about it for

223
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:16,790
like 17 minutes. Yeah, because,

224
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,320
and my basic point was I try
not to swear on the podcast.

225
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:25,590
The reason I try not to is because this
is going to be out there forever and it,

226
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,630
my kids are going to listen to this and
other humans are going to listen to this.

227
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,583
And so I think,
man,

228
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,320
I'm going to try not to swear and I
do swear sometimes, but I try not to,

229
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:39,920
but sometimes it's needed and I believe
in you let in the last statement it was

230
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:40,754
needed.
Okay.

231
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,660
I'm going to also try not to agree,

232
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,530
but sometimes you put the exclamation
mark at the end of a sentence.

233
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,020
Sometimes it's needed, you know,
sometimes it is. All right.

234
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,130
Anything else on that?
We're just kind of get warmed up.

235
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,180
I know. First question, we're just like,

236
00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:02,300
well I hate session begins
at war for 15 years. Yeah. It

237
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,750
was a coming out of the gate strong.
So getting into America a little bit.

238
00:14:05,751 --> 00:14:07,820
Next question.
I love this country.

239
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Thoughts on current
military law enforcement,

240
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:16,640
self defense techniques and what you
both would incorporate to make better?

241
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:21,920
Hmm,
that's a super broad question.

242
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,740
You know, I'll narrow it down. Okay.

243
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,360
And I've talked about it a little
bit on the podcast, but you got cops,

244
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:38,300
police who have a hard job. I'm
miserable. Do you never do it?

245
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,840
I'd be in jail. I could never do
it. Never would want to do it.

246
00:14:41,841 --> 00:14:43,850
Would you say to me?
Yeah dre.

247
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:47,440
I mean just dealing with dealing
with the dregs of society, you know,

248
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,000
for 14 calls and then the 15th call,

249
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:53,290
you're going to you some domestic
violence. And I mean just,

250
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,760
it's just a horrible hard job.

251
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,720
And then you have these shootings where
quote unquote innocent people get shot.

252
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,240
And sometimes they are. I mean I've
seen some of these police shootings,

253
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:10,300
there's no way I can approve it and I am
all about killing bad guys and some of

254
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:14,540
the shootings you just say man that comp
and I and I always look at it the same

255
00:15:14,541 --> 00:15:19,541
way and I say that cop didn't have
the training they needed and I,

256
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,830
what really hurts is
that I know how to train.

257
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:27,470
I know what to do to make them better and
get them better at that. I know you do.

258
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,630
I don't have the money. They don't have
the time. You don't have the money.

259
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,560
They don't have the time.

260
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,650
A lot of times they don't even have
the experience within the department of

261
00:15:33,651 --> 00:15:36,380
someone that knows how to train people
mentally cause that's what it is.

262
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:41,381
It's mental preparation of getting
someone ready to handle these scenarios

263
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,540
because it's just an unknown scenario.
That's what it is.

264
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:49,160
And one of my worst examples is this
guy pulls up to a seven 11 it's all,

265
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:52,460
it's all body camera, the guys, the whole
thing's on video. The guy gets a call,

266
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,410
there's a guy with a gun and stuff.
11 pulls up in his cruiser,

267
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,880
the seven 11 gets out of his car, sees a
guy walking away, starts yelling at him.

268
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:02,390
The guy's wearing a hoodie. The guy's
walking away from him. He's the cops,

269
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,770
yelled at him, freeze, freeze priests.

270
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,990
That guy doesn't freeze
and find these yelling at.

271
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:10,220
He's standing the cops standing in a
wide open, holding his gun out, you know,

272
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:13,370
priests, priests, and finding. The
guy turns around and looks at the cop,

273
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,630
reaches his hands in his pockets.
Boom, cops shoots him. Guy Falls down,

274
00:16:17,631 --> 00:16:21,080
falls the curb roles. He's on his
stomach. Cop comes over, rolls over,

275
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:24,170
starts to search him. He finds,
pulls his head, pulls his hood off.

276
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,150
He's got headphones in,
reaching in his pockets.

277
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,150
He's got an iPhone on and he was just
sitting there listening to music.

278
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,630
Couldn't hear the cop turned around,
reached in his pocket,

279
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,300
turn off the iPhone and you know,
the cop who got the call,

280
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,930
there was a guy with a gun and it takes
you reaching for a gun. Dustin guy died,

281
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,740
bled out, and you can hear the cop.
The cop felt horrible, you know,

282
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,880
once he realized that, he's like,
come on buddy, it's going to be okay.

283
00:16:43,881 --> 00:16:44,211
I'm gonna get you.

284
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,180
You mean just like the classic things that
I've know you've heard before of like,

285
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,090
I want to save this guy's life
and it's not gonna happen.

286
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:56,110
And what I know is that that guy going
into that situation from the get go,

287
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,250
if you think someone's got a gun, don't
stand out in the open and talk to them.

288
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,840
Get behind cover and stand back and you,
you'll stay behind your car,

289
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:05,683
get on your cruiser,

290
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,770
get on your loudspeaker and look at him
and watch him and see what he's doing

291
00:17:09,771 --> 00:17:10,760
and see if there's a real threat.

292
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:14,210
But don't expose yourself to by standing
out in the middle of the open where if

293
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:16,080
he does have a gun he's going to get yet.
Yeah.

294
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,300
And those are simple things that you know
you could do to improve the training.

295
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:23,030
What you have to do is you have to put
people in stressful situations during the

296
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:25,760
training and that's what
we did in the seal teams.

297
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,630
I know that's what you guys do in the
SF is you get put in these horrible

298
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,570
stressful situations where
everything is getting destroyed.

299
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:35,900
You're getting shot with paint ball and
they're blowing smoke grenades up at all.

300
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,050
Frags hit you. They do that in the
trainings that when you get in combat,

301
00:17:39,051 --> 00:17:41,930
you're not freaked out and
you can handle this situation

302
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:48,550
train hard so you bleed less. You know,
it's like, it's pretty simple. And uh,

303
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,950
but we,
we do

304
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,410
in Austin,
we do a stress test a week.

305
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:56,220
Sometimes it's barbell stuff on the range
and kit where we're doing like Olympic

306
00:17:56,221 --> 00:17:59,880
lifts to a sprint and then you
pick up your gun and shoot, um,

307
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,000
or it slung and you do
like a five mile run.

308
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,600
And as soon as you step on the range,
it's like 500 targets.

309
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:09,930
You're just running down the line.
Um,

310
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,450
that's so,
I know,

311
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:16,140
and it feels normal for my heart rate
to be pounding so that I can't hear

312
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:21,000
anything besides my own beating heart
in my ears, sweat dripping into my eyes,

313
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,500
sweat dripping on my optics,

314
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,130
my grip being jacked up because it's
covered with sweat and you know,

315
00:18:26,131 --> 00:18:30,240
a little bit of blood cause I tripped
and fell on my face, you know, like,

316
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,710
and that seems normal.

317
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,390
If I went to a range and shot
in like a vacuum, you know,

318
00:18:36,391 --> 00:18:41,040
like where it's like air condition and
like guys, like, all right, um, no,

319
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:44,820
you can't shoot faster than one round a
second and know drawing from the holster.

320
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,210
So let's just, you know, have a good
time here. I would know what to do.

321
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,120
I'd be like, this is
really uncomfortable. Um,

322
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:54,180
can somebody just start screaming at me
and throwing something at me so I could

323
00:18:54,181 --> 00:18:58,720
just at least shoot, you know,
100%. Um, the training for that,

324
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,290
my brother's a police officer.
My Dad's a police officer.

325
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:05,040
I went to the police academy in
[inaudible] 99. Um, and how was astounded?

326
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,620
I was a kid.
I was 21 years old.

327
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,480
I was astounded at how they
were not prepared for anything.

328
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,120
One was like, all right, how about this,
all 20 of you try to get cuffs on me?

329
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,890
Yeah. Didn't happen. No. Now my
wrists were bloody, you know,

330
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:24,060
I had a cough on my leg.

331
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:28,290
I have one cop on my arm but I had like
six or seven of them cuff together and

332
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,040
there's like,

333
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,020
there's like 18 or there's 12 of them
yet left and they didn't know what to do.

334
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:38,160
You know this is a 21 year old
kid and it's not their fault.

335
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,360
Just like you said, they just don't
have the training. Yeah. With that said,

336
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,250
if a cop tells you to get on the ground,
get on the freaking ground,

337
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,250
talk to them about it later and I get it.
Like you're,

338
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,060
you know the constitution so well and
you're like the greatest lawyer about,

339
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,090
you know, legal criminology, shut up,

340
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,870
lay down and just figure it out later.
Or have your lawyer do it.

341
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:03,930
If you can't afford a lawyer,
just have talked to sergeant afterwards.

342
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,470
Yeah.
Just give those guys more training.

343
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,950
And you got to do the right kind
of training. You got to do the,

344
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:14,940
I think you got to do force on force,
man on man training.

345
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,210
And it was the last time that a municipal
police department did a force on force

346
00:20:18,211 --> 00:20:21,120
training. You should be doing
it all the time. All the time.

347
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:25,410
Cause we even heard of a department doing
it. That's horrible. Sim, Serta, whatever.

348
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,300
I mean, whatever. Whenever you're going
to use, you got to have people, humans,

349
00:20:30,301 --> 00:20:33,540
other humans that are maneuvering on you,
that are reacting to you,

350
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,370
that are drawing on you or they're not,

351
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:37,890
or they're raising their hands or
they're pulling out their cell phone or

352
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:41,850
they're running scared. So when you
did force on force in the seals, um,

353
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,330
who do you use as your op for seals?
See other CIS dude.

354
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,950
And is there nothing better than,

355
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,160
I mean, who wants to win?
Everybody. Everybody wants to win.

356
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,150
So like we at Fort Bragg would use like
82nd airborne or would you use another

357
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:57,130
SF group? Dude. And that's, I mean,

358
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,440
if there are any second guy
like this is their chance,

359
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:04,300
they're going to do everything that
they can to shoot an SF guy. You know,

360
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,860
if it's a, if it's another SF guy,
then the, the level of competition,

361
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:11,680
that competitive nature like, oh, I'm
gonna, I'm gonna, we're going to do,

362
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:12,514
I'm an amble Shum.

363
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,220
We're going to crawl up
into the ventilation and try
to shoot him in the top of

364
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:17,560
their heads from the, from the
air conditioning. You know,

365
00:21:17,561 --> 00:21:21,310
they're like taking quickie saws
and cutting the ventilation open.

366
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,030
I mean it's gangster gangster
and you know what? That's what's,

367
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,260
what's great about that is
guess what the enemy does.

368
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,690
The same thing with the moves does,
they're just not as good.

369
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,410
They built false walls, they build trap
trap doors. They do all that stuff.

370
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,090
And I was,
had a,

371
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,920
had a group that was going through their
land warfare training in the seal teams

372
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,330
and they actually failed.

373
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,900
And so we were retreading them make and
go make them them go through it again,

374
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:45,850
go through their FTX is their
field training exercise,

375
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:47,830
these big giant training exercises.

376
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,870
We've all kinds of chaos and they
were doing their first re retreads.

377
00:21:52,871 --> 00:21:55,150
They're trying to pass
the exercise this time.

378
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:58,020
And I go out there and I'm listening to
their brief and I'm watching her duty to

379
00:21:58,021 --> 00:22:01,030
rehearsal and they get done with rehearsal
and they all come together and the

380
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,600
senior enlisted guys kind of putting
out some word and he looks at me and he

381
00:22:04,601 --> 00:22:08,290
goes, Eh, Hey Jocko, do you got
anything to say to these guys?

382
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,810
And I wasn't really expecting
it, you know, so I said, no,

383
00:22:10,811 --> 00:22:15,370
this is 40 40 man seal element. And
I said, yeah, I got something to say.

384
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,450
You guys are going to go out
there against six other guys.

385
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,560
There's 40 of you, you guys
got machine guns, grenades,

386
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,190
and there's 40 of you.
I said, go out there.

387
00:22:27,191 --> 00:22:32,170
And when they start shooting at you
hunt those motherfuckers down and murder

388
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:36,100
them. And they're like, yeah.

389
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,780
And so the troop walks away and
they're all fired up. And then the,

390
00:22:41,781 --> 00:22:44,520
the senior enlisted guy in the senior
officers standing there and they said,

391
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,640
hey man, thanks for, thanks for, you know,

392
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:52,600
getting her guys fired up. I think that
really helped them out. And I said,

393
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,810
you should hear what I'm
about to go tell my guys,

394
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,650
which was my guys that were to go against
them because I would give my guys all

395
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:03,790
kinds of rewards. Anybody that they
could kill I, they would capture bodies.

396
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:06,820
Anybody could get into perimeter. They
would just completely what you're saying,

397
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:08,260
they were just completely mud.
Suck them,

398
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,840
draw them into the most
chaotic situations.

399
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,070
And the point of all this conversation
is that you're going against other human

400
00:23:15,071 --> 00:23:18,550
beings and other human beings that
are going to do unpredictable things.

401
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:21,010
And that's what makes
the training challenging.

402
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,470
And that's what makes life challenging.

403
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,540
That's what makes these
situations challenging in a
real scenario is you don't

404
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:27,280
know what these people are going to do.
How many,

405
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,370
how many times have you been
dealing with some, you know,

406
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,280
enemy or or unknown and you're like,

407
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:36,720
what in God's name is this person
doing Iraq or Afghanistan? I didn't,

408
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:39,910
I didn't fight in Afghanistan. But in Iraq
you'd be looking at someone going, Oh,

409
00:23:39,911 --> 00:23:43,390
this person is insane. What are they
doing right now? Why are they doing that?

410
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:45,800
They're going to die if
they, you know, it's, it's

411
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,600
crazy. Yeah. That's the thing about
humans is there humans, you know,

412
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,930
there's like points of
departure from logic, you know,

413
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,210
and they live in chaos and some
people can't even live without chaos.

414
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,380
And then we're going into a place where
cultures are different languages or

415
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:01,550
different,
you know,

416
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:06,580
what is the norm is different and we're
trying to enact what we think is normal.

417
00:24:06,621 --> 00:24:10,590
And they're like, Bro, you're,
you're crazy. I'm like, no,
no, you're crazy. I'm like,

418
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:14,720
no, it's, yeah, it's
all poor cops. Yeah. So,

419
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,670
and you know what you can do if
you're a cop though and you don't,

420
00:24:16,671 --> 00:24:19,520
you're forced doesn't have the money
for this or they're not doing this.

421
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:24,200
You can absolutely train. You can actually
absolutely train in Jujitsu, in MMA,

422
00:24:24,201 --> 00:24:27,770
in fighting. So you get more comfortable
and more confident in those situations.

423
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,990
And the other thing I've said to
do in the past, his man, yeah,

424
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:34,400
I know it sounds lame,
but watch some youtube videos.

425
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,940
Watch some youtube videos of these, of
bike. The thing that I just described,

426
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,930
watch that youtube video and say,

427
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,890
I watched youtube videos in
combat and before combat,

428
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:46,430
you know what I watched before youtube?
I watch war movies, but documentaries.

429
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,700
Yeah. So I could watch these
guys in action and get,

430
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,490
see what was happening in their faces
because you can watch people on Youtube,

431
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:56,840
watch these perpetrators and start to
understand human nature better just by

432
00:24:56,841 --> 00:25:00,890
watching what they're doing. Just grow
your mind, grow your brain a little bit.

433
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:06,590
And if you wanna get better at shooting
dry fire, yeah. I spend 90% of my,

434
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,570
my practice time of shooting,
um, without bullets in my gun,

435
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,513
you know?

436
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,110
And there's like a few grand masters
that are out shooting me right now. Yeah.

437
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,160
So dry fire.
Yeah.

438
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,230
These are good questions.
Yeah. The Internet,

439
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,760
the Internet's going onto number three.
This is not voting welfare time.

440
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,810
Okay. For those of you that don't know,
they recently removed bayonet training,

441
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:41,150
dammit. Yeah, I know Tim. I'm sorry.
But they removed bayonet training.

442
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,540
What makes the Green Grass Crow?
Do you know what makes the green grass go?

443
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,300
Thought it was banned at Cheyney?
No blood, blood, blood, blood.

444
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,690
If blood blood. That's what it
does. That's the motto. Okay.

445
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,890
And so the question was,
and I,

446
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:58,820
I guess I put this in here
just for entertainment value.

447
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,310
Would you have kept bay in that
trading in, that's the question.

448
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,800
And it says w does it sell warrior spirit
are not, um, Tim Kennedy your opinion,

449
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:13,630
please. I don't even want to dignify this
question with a response. I don't. Um,

450
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,710
it's so infuriating. So yeah, I get it.

451
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:19,400
We're not going to have
bayonets on 80 fours. You know,

452
00:26:19,401 --> 00:26:24,401
we are in an army now that
tactics are dictating that,

453
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:27,860
that's not how we're going to train.
With that said,

454
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,000
during bayonet training,
it doesn't give you a thirst for blood,

455
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,720
but gives you an understanding
of what war's like.

456
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,610
And war is chaos. War is
hell. War is ugly wars,

457
00:26:40,611 --> 00:26:43,560
disgusting wars, violent. Most of all,

458
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,590
it's violent and bayonet training while
you're running around a fixing your band

459
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:53,040
net and show what makes the
green grass grow blood but blood.

460
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:56,190
Nick's green grass grow.
Yeah, that sounds primal.

461
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,930
It is primal wars. Disgusting. And
you have to one, understand it.

462
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:04,860
And maybe have trained in it so that
you can appreciate what it's going to be

463
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:05,151
like.

464
00:27:05,151 --> 00:27:10,151
So when you get there the
first time you've seen crazy
and chaos and anarchy and

465
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,430
rage is there is not there.
It's in training nuggets.

466
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:22,260
That's pussy. Exactly what we've
just talked about. You know,

467
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,300
it's exactly what we just
talked about and the other,

468
00:27:25,301 --> 00:27:27,120
this is what that question
happened made me do

469
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,890
Tim crunched up is coconut water can ah,

470
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,320
within the statement of that question.

471
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,990
And the other piece of
this is Tim said in that,

472
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,900
I'll go ahead and call it
a little bit of a rant.

473
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,500
He said that war is crazy and chaotic
and evil and disgusting and savage and in

474
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:58,281
a way when you're in war
you have to become that

475
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:07,530
and you can't just become it from nowhere.

476
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:12,000
You have to develop that mindset
over time. Like I'm a bad ass.

477
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:16,770
That's not how it works. It doesn't work
that way. And so this type of training,

478
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:22,860
which I would call primal, truly, even
with people use that word all the time,

479
00:28:22,861 --> 00:28:23,580
primal,

480
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,530
I'm actually using it in its
in its proper terminology,

481
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,500
usage,
primal training.

482
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,730
I'm taking a tool used to kill
things and attaching it tool,

483
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:39,090
a tool that's used to kill things.
Um,

484
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,890
so I can practice with a tool stacked
on top of another cool tool about how to

485
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:46,370
kill things. And then you're going
to take that thing and you're gonna,

486
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:51,150
you're gonna slam it into a
thing that looks like a person.

487
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:52,043
Yup.

488
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,770
Upset to get him used to it over and
over in your shoulders going to hurt and

489
00:28:55,771 --> 00:28:57,750
your hands are going to hurt,
you know,

490
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,940
and like you're going to have
blisters and cut your hands up,

491
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:02,010
up against your gun.

492
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:05,250
He didn't realize you had to hold it that
way and you're made to make the mental

493
00:29:05,251 --> 00:29:07,680
note that I'm not going to hold up
against my shoulder at that time next time

494
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:11,610
because I can't feel my shoulder. You
know, like these are good lessons learned.

495
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

496
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,980
So let's keep the Bain at training,
bring it back.

497
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:24,960
Bring it back.
Next question,

498
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:33,050
can you instill the will to kill and
the will to die in soldiers without a

499
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,270
corollary? Nihilism. Yes.

500
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,100
And we get a direct answer from Tim

501
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:43,080
[inaudible] movie.

502
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:47,900
The next question we had kind of already
talked about it when we said, you know,

503
00:29:47,901 --> 00:29:52,550
in the contrast of things like your life
I think is a personification of how to

504
00:29:52,551 --> 00:29:54,020
do that.
You know,

505
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:57,860
if you can't have beauty with,

506
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,020
unless you know what ugly looks like.
True.

507
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:05,021
You know you can't have hot if you
don't know what cold feels like.

508
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:06,950
You can't have evil without good.

509
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,700
And I don't think that you
can teach people how to,

510
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:19,730
let's say if we're just teaching everybody
how to be like murderer killers, um,

511
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,310
you know, soldiers that can
just, we're not making robots.

512
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:27,530
We're showing them how to do something
and the reason that they can do it and

513
00:30:27,531 --> 00:30:32,120
not be complete psychopathic murderers.
Occasionally one slips through.

514
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:36,770
I'm not saying that, but not very
often. It's because the humanity of us.

515
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,830
Like what, what is the thing that's
stopping us from killing, you know,

516
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,210
Echo Charlie here cause I'm highly
trained. You are, um, you know,

517
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,420
it's our humanity, you know, and
that's an and my appreciation,

518
00:30:47,421 --> 00:30:49,940
my beautiful wife and my kids,
you know, and Loving Austin,

519
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:53,030
Texas and barbecue and motorcycles,
like that's normal to me.

520
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:57,770
So when I have to go and deploy and
see disgusting things and you know,

521
00:30:57,771 --> 00:31:01,190
make mistakes like throwing grenades
into a room with women and then having to

522
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:02,180
live with that the rest of my life,

523
00:31:02,181 --> 00:31:07,181
the reason that I'm still saying is
because I know what right is because of

524
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:13,670
ethics and morality and humanity. So yeah,
that's, that's how we, and you can do it.

525
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,150
It's because guys,
intelligent guys that,

526
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,630
that end up in units like the ones that
you were in can understand what the

527
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:21,464
difference is.

528
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,990
Yes. Yes. And I think that,

529
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,820
I think that this is
something new that is, again,

530
00:31:33,821 --> 00:31:38,230
referring back to the culture of America
that a lot of people starts to slip

531
00:31:38,231 --> 00:31:40,090
away.
But,

532
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,360
but you gotta remember those 2000 men
that lined up in rural California?

533
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,660
Sure. So, sure. There was a little
handful of them that were like, oh cool,

534
00:31:49,661 --> 00:31:50,890
I'm going to go kill some people.

535
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,740
But there was a lot of people that saint
hammer to go out and protect freedom.

536
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,740
And so I think it's not only
something that you instill in,

537
00:31:59,741 --> 00:32:02,950
you work on through the training and
like through the training that we just

538
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:07,630
talked about of stabbing or shooting
man shape targets or even better when

539
00:32:07,631 --> 00:32:10,360
you're using simulation.
I mean you're shooting at other people.

540
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,750
It instills in you that you can do that.

541
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,810
But I think the values,

542
00:32:16,811 --> 00:32:21,811
the American values that we're taught
as people growing up in this country are

543
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,000
they do respect life.

544
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:31,140
They do respect freedom and the the
right for the pursuit of happiness.

545
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:37,480
The things that you just talked
about, barbecues, motorcycles, wife,

546
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:40,730
kids,
those are things that we respect.

547
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,390
And I'm sure you've been in the situation.
I know I've been in it many,

548
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:48,740
many times of where you're taking the,
the man from the house,

549
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,680
either you killed them or
you're taking them away. Yeah.

550
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,430
And he's not going back
and he's not going back.

551
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:58,340
That's one of those things
where, you know, as just as a,

552
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,160
as a person you're looking at,

553
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,500
you're looking at the wife
and kids and you know,

554
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:06,950
you're kind of thinking yourself, well,
you know, you married the wrong guy,

555
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,090
but you do feel bad for them.
Absolutely. I mean, Hey, sorry, you're,

556
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,750
you're one of the most beautiful kids on
the planet. Your Dad's not coming back.

557
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,550
Oh,
your dad did the wrong thing.

558
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:20,780
But that dad would also hide behind
those kids were in a ball on that.

559
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:24,260
Absolutely. Strap a bomb
to him himself. Absolutely.

560
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:28,850
It's not the same type of human note that
it's not, you know, we are, it's not,

561
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,730
it's absolutely not. And that was
one of the most, that was the APP.

562
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,850
That was absolutely one of the
most disturbing things that,

563
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,130
that my guys would have to deal with,

564
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:42,250
was it surgeons using kids as shields
and thank God I had some really good

565
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:49,211
snipers that were able to kill guys
that were literally using kids as human

566
00:33:49,431 --> 00:33:50,264
shields.
Yeah.

567
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,810
We had a guy walking towards us wearing
a bomb vest and we were using thermal

568
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:57,770
imagers and he had his kid in front
of him and he was trying to cover,

569
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,850
because we heat signature.

570
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:02,660
He was trying to cover himself so we could
get close enough and he's holding his

571
00:34:02,661 --> 00:34:04,580
kid out. Like, take my kid, take my kid.

572
00:34:04,581 --> 00:34:08,150
And the only reason was he was trying to
cover the distance so he could hurt us

573
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:13,070
with his bomb vest, which had glass
and shrapnel and nails and stuff.

574
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,570
Yeah. So period. His body, who's going to
use the bodies of water? Impulse charge.

575
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,160
Um, so no, it's not naive that I'm
saying they're not the same humans as us.

576
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:25,760
They're not, they do not fit
for me to see their same human,

577
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:29,490
you have to have the same value
for human life. Um, when you,

578
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,500
when I watch marines jump on top of Afghan
and Iraqi kids trying to protect them

579
00:34:34,611 --> 00:34:39,360
from a bomb going off, not using
the kid as a bomb jumping on top of,

580
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,970
they're not American kids.

581
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:46,450
These are marines or navies or army
guys jumping on top of local kids.

582
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:52,360
Indigenous kids to save them different
understanding of what humanity is.

583
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,550
Yeah. So we get it. Your question.
Great question. You can do it.

584
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:01,370
Yep.
And you can definitely,

585
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,450
and we have done it as a nation and we
are doing it and we are continuing to do

586
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:09,530
it. I don't think we've had
a stronger military, um, ever

587
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,920
guys coming out of 15 years of war.

588
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,540
The experience and the training,
um,

589
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:22,000
while we have been shrinking for the past
five years, money wise, it's given us a,

590
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:27,440
we've had to fight wars the
war differently and now,
now I don't think there's,

591
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:32,840
I'm talking like Spartan Samurai or
even the World War Two era America.

592
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,990
Like that's the type of generation
of warriors that it's small.

593
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,650
It's like 0.5%. Um, but they're, they're,

594
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,230
yeah, yeah, no doubt.

595
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:50,150
Next question.
Number five.

596
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,420
Exactly.

597
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,730
How much better our green
berets then the seals at what

598
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,790
I think we have to the first
just like me at, at, you know,

599
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,720
21 years old. I didn't
understand the difference. Um,

600
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,080
so every special mission unit has a pretty
well defined mission and all of them

601
00:36:20,021 --> 00:36:21,790
are different.
Um,

602
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:27,330
I would never want to get in a gunfight
with a bunch of navy seals on a boat,

603
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,500
anywhere near the water.
I mean,

604
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:37,270
within like miles of water, it
would be, it's just a catastrophe.

605
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,643
Um,

606
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:43,870
I also don't think that there's any been
on the planet besides special forces

607
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,100
that can do a force force multiplier.
Like weekend. You can take 12 of us,

608
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,720
you can drop us in Venezuela,
leave us there for six months.

609
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,190
And we probably overthrew the
government and place the president,

610
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:01,870
the new president in place and
running the economics, the Wa,

611
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:06,190
the power plants, the
commerce, um, transportation.

612
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,520
And like each of us, the 12 of us, uh,

613
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,140
have like married at least four or five
Venezuelans. It'd be like, that's, that's,

614
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,230
people don't understand like why
we have to speak other languages,

615
00:37:17,231 --> 00:37:21,520
why we have to go through
economic and, um, you know,

616
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,510
geopolitical classes. It's
because we're different, you know,

617
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:29,560
like the missions are different. What
we're supposed to do is different. Um,

618
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,670
and
because of a different mission,

619
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:37,690
we end up with different products and
those products are a groups of dudes that

620
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:39,760
are the baddest dudes.
The planet on the planet

621
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,090
for what they have to do.
Yeah,

622
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,270
and I mean I left that question
in there for a couple of reasons.

623
00:37:45,271 --> 00:37:46,600
Number one was because it was,

624
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:49,770
I thought it was kinda funny whoever
wrote whoever wrote that at a sense of

625
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:53,990
humor and you know the real
question, you know, which is still,

626
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,190
to me it was just about
really defining and I'd,

627
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,600
I'd say the exact same thing that you'd
say, I would add this to it, you know?

628
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,940
Yes. You know, you look at Rangers, you
look at seals, you look at Greenbrae, you,

629
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:09,510
you look at Mar soc and everyone's
got their own little specialty of what

630
00:38:09,511 --> 00:38:11,520
they're really good at
and as a whole they'll,

631
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:16,380
there'll be better at that than the
other group. And then within the seals,

632
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:18,060
within the rangers,
within the,

633
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,920
within SF you got different
levels of guys that are in there.

634
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,490
I know you probably worked with some seals
that you thought, what are these guys?

635
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,340
And you probably work with some
guys that will, you said, damn,

636
00:38:29,341 --> 00:38:33,060
I'd love to love to work with those guys.
And same thing with me.

637
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:36,490
I've worked with some SF guys that I,
to myself, man, these guys are just,

638
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,160
these guys are unbelievable.
I would do anything for these guys.

639
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,570
And sometimes you look at and you go, oh,
I wonder how these guys make it through.

640
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,880
You get to teams,
I get to teams that'd be like,

641
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,210
did you really pass selection dude,

642
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:54,280
that's one thing that's really hard for
the American public to understand is

643
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:56,530
that there is, and I've explained
this a bunch of times on the podcast,

644
00:38:56,531 --> 00:38:58,720
that there's a bell curve.
Just like any other organization.

645
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,980
There's the top guys that are, you
know, bad, totally bad ass guys.

646
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:03,850
It just made it through.

647
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:06,610
And then there was a bunch of guys in
the middle that are totally solid guys

648
00:39:06,611 --> 00:39:08,770
that get it done all the time. And
then there's a bunch of guys that just,

649
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:12,160
they barely got through and
they skate and that's, you know,

650
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:13,270
that's part of the way it is.

651
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,810
But one thing I can tell you for sure
is the special operations community.

652
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:24,820
I don't limit my respect for the
special operations community alone.

653
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:29,470
For me working with the army, the
conventional army guys, the Marine Corps,

654
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:32,920
marines, I, they're always
good. They're always good.

655
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,850
They're there consistently.
Your rifle company. Awesome.

656
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,330
Can I please work with you? Because you
just wanted like a bunch of pit bulls.

657
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:42,700
They'd been like locked up in a cage and
they just get prodded every once in a

658
00:39:42,701 --> 00:39:46,300
while and maybe they go into like tear
something apart and they get thrown like

659
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:49,330
some raw meat and I call this just
good, you know, do I get it? What do I,

660
00:39:49,331 --> 00:39:50,950
where do I get to kill to get
another piece of this meet?

661
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:55,630
The Marine Corps really is an outstanding
organization and then there's units

662
00:39:55,631 --> 00:40:00,460
within the army that are unbelievably
just squared away professional,

663
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:05,290
and they have a heritage
behind them of glory,

664
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,760
for lack of a better word.

665
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,320
And so I'm a huge fan of the entire
military of the entire US military.

666
00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:16,810
It'll be like you, are you proud
to be a seal? Yeah, I mean,

667
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:21,760
yeah. Yeah. I'm proud of proud to be
a green baret when army plays Navy,

668
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,970
like I don't know crap about
football, you know? But I'm like,

669
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,790
go just for crying out loud,

670
00:40:27,791 --> 00:40:32,791
beat navy for once in this
decade or damn near century.

671
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:37,930
To be honest with you, I literally
don't care. And the biggest,

672
00:40:37,931 --> 00:40:40,960
when we were in Ramadi working with
the army and with the Marine Corps,

673
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,840
those guys,
the sacrifices that they made were so

674
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:53,470
they were so just impressive date day
what these guys did and you know we had,

675
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,640
of course we do have better training,

676
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,940
we do have better gear and yet those
Marine Corps platoons and companies would

677
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:08,200
be out there doing, I mean they're,
first of all, they're living in the city.

678
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,780
You know,
we're going back to a little fog.

679
00:41:10,781 --> 00:41:15,770
We got a little bit of video games and
internal walls. Huge walls. Great Gym.

680
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:19,180
Yeah, protein powder. Exactly.
Those guys don't do any of that.

681
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,050
They don't have any of that.

682
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,400
We airdropped a pallet of porn and
protein to a fire base that a bunch of

683
00:41:24,401 --> 00:41:27,820
marines that like saved our lives when
we were like knocking on their gate at

684
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:29,350
two o'clock in the
morning where we weren't,

685
00:41:29,351 --> 00:41:32,360
we were like 200 meters away and we
didn't want them all to murder us and they

686
00:41:32,361 --> 00:41:34,040
were going to like,
please let us

687
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,040
in. Um, our air won't come pick
us up. And we got in there like,

688
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:39,210
you guys haven't eaten t
rats and they're like, Yay,

689
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,650
we've been pretty much a gun fight every
single night. And you're like, yeah,

690
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:47,210
they were taking you guys, carry
you guys. God bless all of them.

691
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:51,860
No doubt about that.
Next question,

692
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:54,440
we'll American Roe,

693
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:59,090
that's rules of engagement continue to
become more bureaucratic and cumbersome

694
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,570
or will the u s regained the will to win?

695
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,580
Ah, ah. First of all,

696
00:42:07,581 --> 00:42:12,410
the guys there have the the will to win
and they'll, they'll wait to tell people,

697
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:15,860
shoot at them. Not like,
not like near them like you,

698
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,670
like as the Roe is. Um,
not like it used to be.

699
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:23,600
If somebody shot and you heard the
gunshot, that's like getting shot at,

700
00:42:23,601 --> 00:42:27,710
but now we have to be able to
actually say that we were shot at,

701
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,800
that's like bullets
snapping past your head.

702
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:35,450
Like that's hearing the Wiz and
then the crack that's close.

703
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,340
That's what we pretty much
have to have. Um, Roe. So,

704
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:42,350
so just let me put some context
around that because we don't have,

705
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,390
not everyone that listens.
This is in the military.

706
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,150
Let me put some context
around what Tim just said.

707
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,630
That's freaking ridiculous.

708
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,150
That means you're waiting until you're
about to get killed before you take

709
00:42:56,151 --> 00:42:58,520
action.
If you're waiting for rounds,

710
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,400
because when rounds are snapping over
your head that that means you're,

711
00:43:01,401 --> 00:43:05,360
you're under suppressive fire just about,
you can no longer maneuver.

712
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,660
So this is like waiting
until for a civilian.

713
00:43:08,661 --> 00:43:13,661
This is waiting until the knife is at
your throat before you decide to defend

714
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:16,910
yourself. That's, that's what
Tim's talking about. Yeah.

715
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:22,030
It'd be like a salesman being like your
commission based salesman and you see a

716
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:24,620
potential client come in,
but you're not allowed to engage him.

717
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:28,190
You're not allowed to. You actually have
to wait, let him pick up the product

718
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:35,410
and then walk over to you and ask if he
can buy it and almost have the customer

719
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:39,560
be walking out the door.

720
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:43,370
Had he already set the product down right
before you're allowed to talk to him,

721
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,770
that's when you're allowed to engage him.

722
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,890
Does that make sense from
a sales perspective? Yes.

723
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:51,650
That does echo Charlie wisdom thrown down.

724
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:57,110
I'm so not good. Not Good. Uh, we'll see.

725
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:59,660
First of all,
the rules of engagement,

726
00:43:59,661 --> 00:44:02,450
there are not going to be the same here.

727
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:08,380
So I think some places like Afghanistan
and Iraq have been capitalizing on and

728
00:44:10,341 --> 00:44:14,660
now Syria on our rules of engagement.
I know Africa is Africa is like, okay,

729
00:44:14,661 --> 00:44:17,330
we know the Americans are only allowed
to go to the last concealed cover

730
00:44:17,331 --> 00:44:20,540
position and they're not allowed
to directly engage in less.

731
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,820
They have been actively
fired. So they'll be like, oh,

732
00:44:22,821 --> 00:44:23,930
there's the Americans over there.

733
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:26,990
We're not going to shoot at
them so they can't shoot back.

734
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:29,420
We'll just kill all the Africans
who they're there to help.

735
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,800
They're like intentionally doing this
and they're pretty clever about it.

736
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:33,720
The book of Romp.
Um,

737
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:38,740
but then right now with
the radicalized cells here,

738
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:42,030
the fanatic Muslims that
think that they're going to
come here and be able to do

739
00:44:42,031 --> 00:44:45,600
that node, Bro, remember Pearl Harbor,

740
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,190
remember the Alamo,

741
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,200
remember nine 11 shit will be different
if you think you're going to come here

742
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,310
and play around
Roe

743
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:59,490
will not exist. Nope. No, not here.

744
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:03,320
Don't, don't, don't.

745
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,010
There's a lot of political correctness
that steer stuff from time to time

746
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,880
gets people killed. It
does. It does. You know,

747
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,100
one of the things that's coming
up a lot in the news right now,

748
00:45:16,101 --> 00:45:17,540
and we got asked them questions about it,

749
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:23,410
is women women coming into
combat roles inside the military,

750
00:45:24,801 --> 00:45:26,780
which, you know, first of all,

751
00:45:26,781 --> 00:45:30,110
credit to the women that have served

752
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:34,100
in the wars.
And I've seen women,

753
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:39,050
I've seen women in Ramadi rolling out
on Cassie facts to go out and help my

754
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:43,370
guys. Yeah. God bless him.
Fearless, fearless, brilliant,

755
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:47,210
awesome. Totally capable of their
respective jobs. Full credit.

756
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:55,720
And then there's a limitation in my
opinion as to where you would want to

757
00:45:56,301 --> 00:45:59,820
intentionally assigned women too,

758
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,760
is that women could do that.
We could never do that is true.

759
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:06,420
I'm in South America.

760
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,330
I want to get some Intel.

761
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:14,780
I can go into a bar and work it for
a month before I get one informative.

762
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,350
I just spent, you know, $20,000
of taxpayer dollars. Yeah.

763
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,480
You stick girl in there an
hour. Yep. Has, she has 10.

764
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:29,280
She like, you suck, you suck,
you suck, you suck. You suck.

765
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:32,090
I'm awesome at this.
I'm

766
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,050
just put a hundred pounds on her back
and throw out of the back of an airplane.

767
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,473
I love women.

768
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:41,190
Yeah.

769
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,540
Their legs are going
to break. Yeah. It's a,

770
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,100
just a biological factor of
what is it?

771
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:55,110
Muscular skeleton. Anatomy.
Anatomy. There you go.

772
00:46:55,111 --> 00:46:57,210
Thank you.
And uh,

773
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:02,240
they're built differently and thank God
they're built differently cause I could

774
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:06,030
never give birth know, eat their
way. Tell her that I are there.

775
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,260
We are like what? What right
now is like the, you know,

776
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:14,040
we were talking about at the
pinnacle of exercise. Uh, well,

777
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:17,190
one really good way to judge
would be the crossfit games.

778
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:22,740
Very well rounded athletes that have
to have strength, endurance, agility,

779
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:27,060
et cetera. And are there different
standards for men and women?

780
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,200
There are different standards
for men. Water. Yeah.

781
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:33,070
So are we going to have different
standards in let's say special forces

782
00:47:33,071 --> 00:47:37,210
selection? I would hope not. Okay.
So if we had the same standard,

783
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,790
um, you had given an example
of the crossfit games.

784
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,160
Yeah, I mean it was, it was interesting.

785
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:49,360
I was watching the finals of the
crossfit games. It was last year I think.

786
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:53,610
And the event the made,
the finals men went first,

787
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:58,540
it was 10 guys or something and they
came out in the first they had to do

788
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:02,200
multiple physical activities. The first
one was a pegboard link. What you had,

789
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:04,030
it was her heart. Yeah.
There are the wrestling room.

790
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:04,990
They had him in the wrestling room.

791
00:48:04,991 --> 00:48:08,200
You had him in school and you
couldn't go home until you did it.

792
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,860
And this one was,
I want to say it was 15 feet tall.

793
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:15,610
So it's a pretty tall pegboard and
they had to sell. The guys come out,

794
00:48:15,611 --> 00:48:18,400
they have to go up a peg board and
back down. They get done with that.

795
00:48:18,401 --> 00:48:19,360
They have to jump on a,

796
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:22,140
on a rower and row a certain amount
of calories and they got hers.

797
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,430
Then they moved down the line and
they're picking up and cleaning.

798
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:28,030
I think they are cleaning or cleaning
and jerking weights that were increasing

799
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:32,140
in weight as they went towards the end
and there was a 10 minute maximum time to

800
00:48:32,141 --> 00:48:36,370
complete this evolution. So the
guys come out, boom, they go,

801
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:41,430
they all go hard. It's hard. They climbed
the pegboard, they come down the road,

802
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,750
the road, they lifted weights,
they're done. Everybody finishes.

803
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:45,340
They give the guy in the
first place. Okay, cool.

804
00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:49,780
Then it's the girl's term and the,
and they have it set up for the girls.

805
00:48:49,781 --> 00:48:52,300
They're doing the same thing. They
make the weights a little bit lighter,

806
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:57,660
but they have the same basic concept
and the girls come out and these girls,

807
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,550
they look as big and
strong as I do or you do,

808
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:07,800
and I'm not kidding. These girls
are beasts. They're amazing across.

809
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:12,810
The athletes are beautiful and they come
out and out of the eight or 10 girls

810
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,250
that goes into the first
thing and hits the pegboard,

811
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,390
only one of them can make it up.
They're tough.

812
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:27,450
And the other seven or eight or
nine athletes can't even get up it.

813
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:30,820
And then the girl,

814
00:49:30,821 --> 00:49:34,990
it took her so long to get up the peg
board that when she got to the roller,

815
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,741
she was exhausted.

816
00:49:35,741 --> 00:49:38,560
She got done with the rower and she
didn't complete the rest of the course

817
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,040
because she ran out of the 10
minute time limit. Yeah. And to me,

818
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:45,310
I'd never really had thought too much
about the physicality. I always figured,

819
00:49:45,311 --> 00:49:47,230
you know what? You get a girl
that's in good enough shape.

820
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:50,800
Maybe they could make it through some
of the training that is required for

821
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:53,290
special operations.
But when I saw that,

822
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:58,300
it really did leave an impact on
me mentally of how different it is.

823
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,650
And I'll tell you another thing.

824
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I was at my gym several years ago
and I hadn't rolled with a girl,

825
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,440
a Jujitsu for a long time.
Right.

826
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:15,400
Maybe played around and all of a sudden
we had a girl that was coming into town

827
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:16,261
that was a,

828
00:50:16,261 --> 00:50:21,261
a black belt in Jujitsu and was a multi
time world champion and great technique.

829
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:24,250
And, and so I said to me
when I was going to run,

830
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,950
so we were on the mat and she's
like, you know, hey, you want a role?

831
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,490
And in my mind I thought to
myself, okay, you know what?

832
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:34,460
I got to bring my a game right now. Yeah.
I mean this girl's a world champion.

833
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:39,530
She's not a small girl, you know,
I mean, she's 160 165 pounds.

834
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:42,740
And you know, if you make a mistake
against 165 pound black belt,

835
00:50:42,741 --> 00:50:46,550
you're going to tap. That's it. So I
say to myself, you know what, I gotta,

836
00:50:46,990 --> 00:50:49,550
I gotta be careful.
I've got to kind of bring my a game here.

837
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:55,670
And we shook hands.
And as soon as I like grant and was g,

838
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:58,790
as soon as I touched her
g and she touched mine,

839
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:02,810
I just realized there's no way that
she could ever submit me. Yeah. I mean,

840
00:51:02,811 --> 00:51:04,460
unless I just was completely,

841
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:08,540
it just wasn't going to happen
because she just didn't have,

842
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:13,460
she just doesn't have the strength.
Yeah. Well, I want to talk about that.

843
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,290
Um, you know, how long have you been doing
martial arts school? 20 something years.

844
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:19,280
I was just talking about
this the other day.

845
00:51:19,281 --> 00:51:23,090
Like we can within a second
of touching somebody,

846
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:27,460
have an idea about what they
can do. I mean, within seconds,

847
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:32,000
like this isn't just like you,
you know, in this misogynistic,

848
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,980
sexist way. Um, we're
all in with his girl. Um,

849
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,760
she doesn't have a chance after I touched
her, that's not what it was. This,

850
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,900
this is like one of the best grapplers
on the planet and a navy seal and amazing

851
00:51:44,481 --> 00:51:48,920
black belt and an instructor
that legitimately had the row,

852
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:49,813
the revelation,

853
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:54,800
like realized that this isn't possible.

854
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:58,670
Yes. And Actually Echo, you described a
story last week. The first time he ever,

855
00:51:58,671 --> 00:52:01,040
he was a white belt and the first
time I ever trained with Dean lister,

856
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,370
as he said, as soon as he touched him, as
soon as you locked up with him, he goes,

857
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,810
Oh shit. I can't do anything. It's this
guy. And so I failed to mention that,

858
00:52:07,811 --> 00:52:09,680
that yes,
when you're a grappler,

859
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:14,810
as soon as you tie up with
someone second you go, Oh, oh,

860
00:52:14,811 --> 00:52:17,690
this is gonna be tough.
This guy doesn't really know anything.

861
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:21,220
You even know things like, Hey, I've got
to watch out for this guys, you know,

862
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:26,030
head position or he's really good.
You can feel all that just by a clinch.

863
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:30,500
Yeah. And so, yeah, that's what
I, so I should've stated that,

864
00:52:30,530 --> 00:52:34,730
but as soon as I made contact with
her, I said to myself, wow, I was, uh,

865
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:37,370
I was mistaken because this is no factor.

866
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,400
So let's say one in a thousand women could
make it through one of our respective

867
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:45,050
selections,
um,

868
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,730
which I think might be a
little unrealistic. Honestly,

869
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:54,240
I'm thinking more of
like one in 5,000 could,

870
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:59,180
could do it. That still doesn't
mean that they should be there.

871
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,580
I'm not saying they
shouldn't or they should.

872
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:06,710
We have to see what it can't be
is dictated that we have to do it.

873
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:09,470
And then second,
we can't change anything.

874
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:13,010
Otherwise it undermines the
entire idea of being special.

875
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:17,420
If you have a special unit and there's
a special requirement to be there,

876
00:53:17,730 --> 00:53:20,090
that requirement has to stay the same.

877
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:23,330
If you're going to then
change that requirement,

878
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:28,510
you've then changed the unit and then
you've undermined the woman earning her

879
00:53:29,011 --> 00:53:33,030
chance to be there.
It's going to change the chemistry.

880
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:38,190
It's going to change how the
team is going to function. Um,

881
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:42,780
not for the worse, not for the better. We
just don't know what that's going to be.

882
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:47,280
Yeah. And it's not just, first of
all, it's not just special operations.

883
00:53:47,281 --> 00:53:48,240
It's not just military.

884
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:53,160
I mean it's any job that
requires physical strength.

885
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:56,400
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about physical strength.

886
00:53:56,850 --> 00:54:00,690
And if you can't maintain,
if you can't do what the job requires,

887
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:04,350
if you're a firefighter and you can't
pull yourself up a ladder with Karina, uh,

888
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:08,340
80 pound rope on your back or
80 pound hose on your back,

889
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:13,650
you shouldn't be able to have that job.
And yeah,

890
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:17,340
so it's just one of those, it's one of
those really tough things because, hey,

891
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:20,790
I got, by the way, I got
three daughters, right?

892
00:54:20,791 --> 00:54:23,340
I got one son and three daughters.
Believe me,

893
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:25,720
I want my daughters to be
successful and I want whatever,

894
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,490
have every opportunity they possibly can.
But I'll tell you what,

895
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:33,330
something else I do not want.
My daughter's going onto the battlefield.

896
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:38,190
If they can't pull one of their buddies
out from the street, if they're,

897
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:42,030
if they've been shot. How
much do you weigh? 230 pounds.

898
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:46,850
So you way to 65 to 70 with kid
on, oh, more than that. Yeah.

899
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,540
Our kids gotten lighter. Okay.
So like my, my plates, um,

900
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:56,400
my first deployment or 24 pounds,
now they weigh five pounds.

901
00:54:56,670 --> 00:55:01,080
The whole thing, like the actual
Bot just to place. Yeah. Yeah.

902
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:05,730
It's like, so you're saving, you're
saving off, torn on tears in there. Okay,

903
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:09,120
nice. Just stuff's getting
lighter. Nice. Yeah.

904
00:55:09,121 --> 00:55:12,030
But they're not going to pick up
285 pounds and I'm can happen.

905
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:16,410
It's not going to happen.
I'm normally a 220 pound guy and I love,

906
00:55:16,411 --> 00:55:20,550
I'm a Garan grenade carrying maniac.
So while my kid is normally like 20,

907
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:24,000
30 pounds, I had didn't have a
backpack with like 20 grenades.

908
00:55:24,001 --> 00:55:26,040
Cause sometimes I'm like I'm
going to Flash Bang this room.

909
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,450
And sometimes I'm like,

910
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:32,160
I'm going to Frag it cause I
don't want to deal with sin side.

911
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:34,290
You know,

912
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:39,290
you get guys like you and I appreciate
when someone like yourself takes a

913
00:55:40,591 --> 00:55:45,270
certain artistic perspective when it
comes to combat and you say to yourself,

914
00:55:45,271 --> 00:55:48,690
you know what? These little
fragmented aids, I liked them.

915
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,350
I like what they do. They're
so little, they're so mean.

916
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:56,010
They're so little and they're so
brave. And I liked that. I like,

917
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:01,040
I like people that have that artistic
expression that they utilize it combat to

918
00:56:01,321 --> 00:56:05,610
express themselves. It's a beautiful
thing. So for an opportunity,

919
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,320
but that's,
that's the uh,

920
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:12,660
that's the political
correctness and bureaucracy,

921
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:16,740
bureaucracy in the military.
Not a good thing.

922
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:24,130
Geez. Here's another one.
How do you stay positive?

923
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,210
Having seen the absolute worst
in humanity? No Man. Easy.

924
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:33,370
I have a beautiful Brunette.
I'm going to do a huge alliteration here.

925
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:38,610
Beautiful Brunette busty babe
that's banging in the bikini

926
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:46,060
that will drink bourbon with me.
Boom. Yeah, boom. Yeah. Nice.

927
00:56:46,510 --> 00:56:49,420
Um,
so yeah,

928
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,410
I have heard kids in women's scream
that I threw a grenade into the room.

929
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,180
They're having their dad shoot
from, um, get nightmares from it.

930
00:56:58,870 --> 00:56:59,703
Uh,

931
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:01,230
yeah.

932
00:57:01,230 --> 00:57:05,430
Yeah. I've seen doc donkeys go down
wells because the village lied to us.

933
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,850
Yeah.

934
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:10,260
I've watched bombs get dropped on entire
villages where I knew that there are

935
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:14,730
people like not bad people.
They were good people,

936
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:18,330
near bad people and watched
the all the buildings crumble.

937
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:23,020
Um,
I love life.

938
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,970
I love my wife. I love
my kids. I love a sunset.

939
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:32,250
I appreciate art. I play the piano.
I wish I could appreciate beer.

940
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:33,041
Don't have a palate for it.

941
00:57:33,041 --> 00:57:38,041
But like everything about life is that
much sweeter because I know how nasty and

942
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:41,470
ugly it is.
And if at any point,

943
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,400
I forgot why I fight and I forgot
what Wright was and I forgot,

944
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:52,510
um, what humanity is, I'm done.
The moment where I was like,

945
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,840
I want to go kill something.
I'm good at it, I'm good at war,

946
00:57:55,841 --> 00:57:57,070
there's nothing else I'm good at.

947
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,300
And there's that temptation
because you're good at something.

948
00:58:01,301 --> 00:58:05,290
You want to go do more of it to
go and spend time doing that.

949
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:07,750
If I ever had that,

950
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:13,590
well that realization that I'm
actually doing that, I'm done.

951
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,210
I turned my gun in, I'd go be
a salesman, I tried sell Kias,

952
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:21,360
I don't care. Now that I'm talking
smack about Tia Kias, I'm just,

953
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,010
or a Hyundai whatever.

954
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:29,610
And this is a subject that comes up that
I think people want to understand in

955
00:58:29,611 --> 00:58:30,540
the civilian world.

956
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:36,320
And you've definitely nailed a
perspective that I think most guys feel.

957
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,700
And I would say on top of that

958
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:48,820
is that war wallet does expose
you to the worst part of humanity

959
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:54,890
in my mind.
For ever.

960
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:01,690
I W I don't think I will ever see
anything as moving or as beautiful

961
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:06,923
as

962
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:08,873
men

963
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:15,370
rolling out into a horrible
place day after day,

964
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:20,590
night after night,
risking their lives directly,

965
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:21,740
indirectly

966
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:24,570
for their country,

967
00:59:25,110 --> 00:59:28,590
for the civilians that are there
that they're trying to protect

968
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:32,880
and for each other. Yeah. And to,

969
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:38,270
to go to memorial service after memorial
service and realize that these are,

970
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:43,020
and again, you know, I always try and
remind everybody that listens to this,

971
00:59:43,021 --> 00:59:44,730
that when I say memorial service,

972
00:59:44,731 --> 00:59:49,731
I'm not talking about a dog
tag and some body in a uniform.

973
00:59:50,101 --> 00:59:53,940
I'm talking about a kid
talking about person

974
00:59:55,590 --> 01:00:00,590
and a person that
sacrificed everything in,

975
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:03,540
in everything,
everything they are

976
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,530
and everything they ever will be.

977
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,830
And so yes, war, we'll show
you the worst part of humanity.

978
01:00:16,831 --> 01:00:21,480
But that right there is an
incredible part of humanity.

979
01:00:21,481 --> 01:00:24,600
And I don't care about the politics of it,
I don't care about any of that.

980
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,220
But you're talking about men that will
give their lives for their friends.

981
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:30,433
Yeah.

982
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:32,473
Yeah.

983
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,380
And when I have that
in the back of my mind,

984
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:41,890
then that makes it very easy
for me to stay positive.

985
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:45,280
Very easy for me to wake
up in the morning and say,

986
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:50,340
I'm going to do my damn this
today to live a good life.

987
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,140
Yeah.
And do some good things

988
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,430
and trying to honor those guys.

989
01:00:58,270 --> 01:00:59,103
Okay.

990
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:03,540
So I don't think war makes you worse.
I think war makes you better.

991
01:01:04,850 --> 01:01:09,620
No services. Those memorials.
They're not like just some dude

992
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:14,440
had a,
a young,

993
01:01:14,590 --> 01:01:19,590
a young guy and his wife was like,

994
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:25,250
you know, why don't you bring them
back to me? You know, do you want,

995
01:01:25,251 --> 01:01:29,390
it's like to lose him, you know?
Do you know what we had? You know,

996
01:01:29,391 --> 01:01:33,410
you didn't know him. I was
like, bitch, please. I didn't.

997
01:01:33,470 --> 01:01:36,410
I sat there and took it,
you know, like what do you,

998
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:41,570
what do you think we sit there and talk
about as we're staring at a tree for 12

999
01:01:41,571 --> 01:01:45,860
hours. Yeah. You know, I know
what your farts smell like woman,

1000
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:50,330
you know, I know what his favorite
panties were on you. You know,

1001
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:55,360
I know every single kid name of it all
through your kids when their birthday is,

1002
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,720
you know, you don't think, you think
you know him better than I know him.

1003
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:04,460
How much time did you spend with them
in the past five years? You know,

1004
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:09,320
day and night,
60 hours straight taking his blood,

1005
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:11,030
you know,
being covered in it.

1006
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,900
Like we know like this isn't
just some memorial, you know,

1007
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,740
did the sacrifices that you're
talking about? Yeah, it's,

1008
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:22,860
there's a different level of, you
know, we're talking about intimacy,

1009
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:26,670
the brothers and when we say it's about
the dude standing next to us, it's the,

1010
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:31,080
it's not just subdued, you know, it's
not some cliche line in a movie. Yeah.

1011
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,760
Like these are dudes when
we say would die for him,

1012
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,640
it's for a reason.
It's because we've no,

1013
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:43,641
it never known somebody that close and
never will forever and they're the best

1014
01:02:44,611 --> 01:02:45,570
dudes on the planet.

1015
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:49,933
Yeah,

1016
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:56,110
you're right over there. Echo
Charlie. Yes. Getting heavy for sure.

1017
01:02:56,460 --> 01:02:58,760
But kind of used to it though for sure.

1018
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:03,810
Used to do when he starts talking
I'm just like what is the next word?

1019
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:08,650
There's too much space cause
I can't take it anymore. Shit.

1020
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,353
Yeah.

1021
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,700
All right,

1022
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,020
let's bring it back to you a little bit.
I won't say it later question,

1023
01:03:23,021 --> 01:03:25,570
but a little bit of a,
of an easier question.

1024
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:31,390
If a non fighter wants to
learn physical self defense,

1025
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:34,900
where and how can they start?
First of all in your head,

1026
01:03:34,901 --> 01:03:38,140
stop calling yourself a non fighter,
whatever that is.

1027
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:40,210
Every bore,

1028
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:44,200
every dude that comes out of the vagina
and in my opinion has the capability to

1029
01:03:44,201 --> 01:03:48,070
be a fighter if he just so chooses to be.
And I think every dude is a fighter.

1030
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:52,900
So first turn the switch on. Stop being
a pussy. All right. Sorry. Go ahead.

1031
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:55,300
No,
that's actually a factual information.

1032
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:59,800
Or men are predators were predators.
Yeah,

1033
01:03:59,801 --> 01:04:03,640
we've got the dates right here. The eyes,
our eyes are in the front of our head.

1034
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:06,550
Right? Thought other than the top or the
side. They're not on the side over here.

1035
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:10,390
We're watching out for the attack or the
Predator. The Predator. Yeah. So you're,

1036
01:04:10,391 --> 01:04:13,450
you are correct. I can see wait right
here. I can't even see what's right here.

1037
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:20,260
I turned my head, so yeah, that's okay.
That's good. Start with a mindset.

1038
01:04:20,261 --> 01:04:25,180
Where are you going from there? Um, so w
you're asking the question. It's really,

1039
01:04:25,181 --> 01:04:28,090
to me, just a choice.
Anything's better than nothing.

1040
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:32,920
And then of the whatever that anything is,
then there's degrees of better.

1041
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:35,530
There's, I don't think there's
like a right or wrong, you know,

1042
01:04:35,531 --> 01:04:39,070
you could do Krav Maga, you could do Muay
Thai, you can box, you can do Jujitsu.

1043
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,830
Hell,
crossfit has self defense now,

1044
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,650
but anything is better than nothing.

1045
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:48,730
But then the degrees of what that is get,
you know,

1046
01:04:48,731 --> 01:04:50,860
I think a little bit better for me,

1047
01:04:50,861 --> 01:04:55,390
the foundational martial arts are always
the best to start wrestling, boxing,

1048
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:57,820
Muay Thai, Jujitsu. Yep. You know, you,

1049
01:04:57,830 --> 01:05:02,080
you step up a against a guy that has a
little bit of knowledge in any one of

1050
01:05:02,081 --> 01:05:07,081
those therapy in the ass and let alone
if he has a little bit in all of them or

1051
01:05:08,591 --> 01:05:11,710
he's really good at one of them.
In this case you're asking by,

1052
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:14,750
he'd go into sleep. Yup. Yup. Or you've,

1053
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,130
you've heard me say the same exact
thing actually. Yeah. Do you do too?

1054
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,180
I would say start with Jujitsu.
Uh,

1055
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:26,530
the reason is you already have a natural
defense for someone trying to strike

1056
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:30,680
you. And that is runaway.
You know, if someone said, if
you're coming at me and you,

1057
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:33,760
you got a knife or whatever, I'm going
to run from you. Yeah. It's okay.

1058
01:05:33,761 --> 01:05:37,780
It's defense. I'm being defensive.
I'm running away from you. That sucks.

1059
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:43,750
No, no. I'm saying like if somebody came
100% green with you, I was like, hey bro,

1060
01:05:43,751 --> 01:05:47,470
give me your wallet. And just like gotta
catch me first. Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

1061
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:53,220
Travels a few [inaudible] have to defend
yourself is if I grab a hold of you and

1062
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:56,380
now you've got to know how to
grapple some kind of grapple, right?

1063
01:05:56,381 --> 01:05:57,460
You gotta be able to get out of that.

1064
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:02,790
And so that's why I say start with Jujitsu
and then for me boxing only because I

1065
01:06:03,521 --> 01:06:06,520
think it's easier to learn than when
we tie failing and you want to learn a

1066
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:09,940
little bit of basic striking and then moy,

1067
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:14,320
Tai and wrestling, I
mean, you can just get,

1068
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:16,780
start getting into them too.
But there's the,

1069
01:06:16,790 --> 01:06:20,290
the beautiful thing is in America right
now, there's all these places to train.

1070
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:24,010
There's a Jujitsu school and
every, every city, every quarter.

1071
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,120
I mean I live in San Diego,

1072
01:06:25,121 --> 01:06:27,190
so I guess it's actually
completely out of control here.

1073
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:32,110
I could have taken you on a tour of like
74 totally legit to do Jitsu places in

1074
01:06:32,111 --> 01:06:35,190
San Diego and now they all have
Moitai. They all have boxing, all that.

1075
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:37,180
I mean everyone's doing everything.
Yeah.

1076
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:42,640
And so what do you think about like
the self defense oriented martial arts?

1077
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:47,770
So would you be talking about like Krav
Maga? I think those are good augments.

1078
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:52,240
So I, I think once you have a base of
Jujitsu, boxing, wrestling and Muay Thai,

1079
01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:55,900
then I think cool now learns from Krav
Maga because they're going to start

1080
01:06:55,901 --> 01:06:58,420
looking at weapons or start looking
at knives. I think it's good,

1081
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:02,700
but I think from the beginning I
would rather invest my time in the,

1082
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,650
the big four. Yep. I understand. Agree
to get the foundational pillars. Right,

1083
01:07:07,870 --> 01:07:11,380
right. Then you can build anything
you want on that. Speaking of that,

1084
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:14,410
there's someone that
asked about SD response.

1085
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:19,480
I'd like to hear more about SD response
and if Jocko is going to be involved

1086
01:07:21,130 --> 01:07:23,530
at lunch today, he took me to
barbecue and I was like, dude,

1087
01:07:23,531 --> 01:07:26,950
you have to come to one of these. She's
like, I do these. And I was like, I know,

1088
01:07:26,951 --> 01:07:29,130
but ours are filing in Texas,
you know?

1089
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,450
Then when we're done we'll hop
in a helicopter and go play.

1090
01:07:31,770 --> 01:07:35,560
You got you lowered me down
to Texas like 47 times today.

1091
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:40,450
It's going to happen as shit. Like
everything. I like food shooting,

1092
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:44,290
working out Jujitsu
machine guns. I mean, yeah.

1093
01:07:44,291 --> 01:07:47,200
I said I might not come back
once I get down there and we'll,

1094
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:51,460
we'll take a camera and we'll fill most
of it and you're going to see Chaco,

1095
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:55,990
like we're going to hook him into
the side of a little bird. And um,

1096
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:00,760
so people get mad sometimes when
I talk about hunting, you know,

1097
01:08:00,761 --> 01:08:05,320
until you, um, come and
do it. Shut your face.

1098
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,320
Um,
the farmers,

1099
01:08:08,321 --> 01:08:13,260
their pay us to either exterminate the
animals or I we've used when you're going

1100
01:08:13,261 --> 01:08:16,040
to come and stay at my house,
yeah, we're gonna eat elk. Yeah,

1101
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,900
we're going to eat bison.
You know,

1102
01:08:17,901 --> 01:08:22,400
we're gonna eat some remarkable bear.

1103
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:26,180
Nice. And, um, not a lot of
wild pig because the pig,

1104
01:08:26,181 --> 01:08:29,220
their tastes like toilet.
Um,

1105
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:32,750
well I get mad when you talk about hunting
because I want to be doing it instead

1106
01:08:32,751 --> 01:08:37,480
of you. Ah, tell you that. Talk about,

1107
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:38,630
talk about,
because the people,

1108
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:41,810
the people that might not know
about the SD response thing,

1109
01:08:41,811 --> 01:08:45,440
the sheepdog response
sheepdogs, it's all about, um,

1110
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,660
so sheepdog,
it was a phrase coined by,

1111
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:52,340
um,
Colonel Grossman,

1112
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:57,680
and he used it as this metaphor
that, um, you've got the sheep,

1113
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:01,550
which is like the normal people and they
just kind of cruise around eating grass

1114
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:05,390
and living their lives and they're naive
about the predators that are out there.

1115
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:10,010
Then you have the wolfs and those are
the things that want to get the sheep

1116
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:15,310
grass doesn't taste good when he got
canines, the using your hair. And, um,

1117
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:18,680
so the wolves want to eat the sheep and
there's nothing that would stop them.

1118
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:20,670
And this is in the reality of kind of,

1119
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:24,830
I think the millennial generation
is we've got a bunch of sheep. Um,

1120
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:29,090
well I mean if like the
sheep war really tight pants,

1121
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,330
flannels had beards and
never carried an axe before.

1122
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:34,910
Didn't know how to change your oil,
didn't know how to break down a gun,

1123
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:40,160
didn't know how to clean an
animal, let alone kill it.
Um, if those were the sheep,

1124
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,690
then that's what we have.

1125
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:47,140
The thing that separates them is the
sheep dog and the sheepdog is genetically

1126
01:09:48,411 --> 01:09:51,200
more similar to the
wolf than anything else.

1127
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:55,430
It has the same natural instincts.
Um,

1128
01:09:55,490 --> 01:10:00,490
the only differences that it likes
sheep not dead or blood in their mouth.

1129
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:05,730
It likes keeping the sheep alive.
Um,

1130
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,260
so that's what sheepdog is.

1131
01:10:07,261 --> 01:10:12,261
We give people skills to make them be
the hardest person somebody ever tries to

1132
01:10:12,931 --> 01:10:13,764
kill.

1133
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:18,210
So if you're going to go and get in a gun
fight with somebody that's come from a

1134
01:10:18,211 --> 01:10:21,120
sheepdog course,
you better be damn good.

1135
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:26,430
If you think you're going to go hands
on and start tussling with a guy that,

1136
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:31,460
or a lady that's finished sheepdog better
plan on it being bloody and violent.

1137
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:34,560
Cause when they come and they
way they finish that course,

1138
01:10:34,561 --> 01:10:37,320
we have requirements for you
to finish that course. Um,

1139
01:10:39,850 --> 01:10:42,880
people are afraid of their own blood,
but not one of our students.

1140
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:46,360
They've seen it, they've seen it on top
of the person that they're training with,

1141
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:50,440
you know, um, and it's not this
frightening thing. It's like cool.

1142
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:54,460
The fight just got started. Uh,
so that's what it is. It's, um,

1143
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,840
we are putting confidence and technique
and skills into people about being hard

1144
01:11:01,961 --> 01:11:04,400
to kill.
Yeah.

1145
01:11:04,820 --> 01:11:08,420
And I took a look at some of the videos
and stuff and it's something that people

1146
01:11:08,421 --> 01:11:12,380
have been actually asking me for and
I'm in the process of setting it up.

1147
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,100
But I think

1148
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:17,220
that the videos I saw
looked awesome and you know,

1149
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:20,310
anybody that can get to one of those
courses no matter where you are,

1150
01:11:20,311 --> 01:11:22,650
cause it's the, it'll cover
anybody on the spectrum. Right.

1151
01:11:22,651 --> 01:11:25,450
Like I could go and I'm going to
get something out of it. Yeah. Andy,

1152
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:30,460
someone on the complete other end of the
spectrum like echo could go. Not True.

1153
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:35,810
Can I bring guys like Jake
signs? Alex Acosta. Um,

1154
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:38,390
Tim Bhutto,
Blake Hays.

1155
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:42,980
So just in that group we have a couple
of professional competitive shooters.

1156
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:48,420
Um, so every time I do one, you're
getting better. I'm getting better.

1157
01:11:48,421 --> 01:11:52,100
Yeah. Like I'm trained with Alex Acosta.
Right. But my point was you have,

1158
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:55,310
you have women that ever shot a gun before
in that classroom. Is that right? Yeah.

1159
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:59,210
Yeah. And you both are first. We've
only done two civilian classes.

1160
01:11:59,211 --> 01:12:03,080
We'd been doing military and
law enforcement for a minute
and we're like, man, we,

1161
01:12:03,260 --> 01:12:07,940
we, it's unfair in this
society that we're at now.

1162
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:12,200
It's sad that we have to give, like
we see the things that, you know,

1163
01:12:12,650 --> 01:12:16,910
I think it would be a huge disservice
for you not to share the wisdom like you

1164
01:12:16,911 --> 01:12:21,430
do, um, to a society that
is now vulnerable. So that,

1165
01:12:21,431 --> 01:12:25,910
that was like,
it's selfish for us not to do this.

1166
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:28,220
And it's,
I think inhumane.

1167
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:32,150
So when our first two civilian courses,

1168
01:12:32,540 --> 01:12:37,400
both courses had people that
had never shot a gun before.

1169
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:40,970
Now I'm not encouraging you to come to a
sheepdog course if you've not ever shot

1170
01:12:40,971 --> 01:12:45,650
a gun before. Cause it ends up being
a huge, um, painted them but for us,

1171
01:12:45,910 --> 01:12:48,650
because then don't have to put somebody
with you the whole entire time.

1172
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:51,890
And that instructor could have been
used to help other people get better.

1173
01:12:51,891 --> 01:12:55,340
So it's a little bit shallow, selfish. So
if you're gonna come to a shoot course,

1174
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,520
I'm not going to say no. You know, you
got to learn this stuff to say alive.

1175
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:01,430
You have people on trains that just
walk out of bathrooms with machine guns.

1176
01:13:01,431 --> 01:13:05,090
They w they go do a Christmas party in
San Bernardino and start mowing people

1177
01:13:05,091 --> 01:13:09,110
down. Like this is a different era,
right? Like we can't, we can't.

1178
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,040
And and the, and the cops
and law enforcement cannot
be everywhere all the time.

1179
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:17,960
And the, what's the average response
time in America for minutes? Six minutes.

1180
01:13:17,990 --> 01:13:20,780
And that's if you're in like a night
in a city with a lot of cops in it,

1181
01:13:20,781 --> 01:13:24,440
you go out to some rural
area. Yeah, you're talking
days. We're talking like 20.

1182
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:29,150
Yeah. So you are like it
or not. Here's the reality.

1183
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:34,690
You are your first line of defense and
you might be your only line of defense.

1184
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,770
So invest in yourself
and learn some skills.

1185
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,160
Have you got money and you're going out
there and you're buying a $2,000 gun.

1186
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:49,700
Don't buy a $600 gun and then come
spend 1400 bucks and train with you.

1187
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:54,960
You know, cool and play jockey.
You know like you, you need,

1188
01:13:54,961 --> 01:13:59,961
you need a $500 gun and $100 site
until you get to a pretty high level,

1189
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:02,850
you know,
like stop wasting your money,

1190
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:06,140
get the skills,
get the skills.

1191
01:14:06,141 --> 01:14:11,120
What I think that thing a sound awesome
and I'm sure I'll be doing something

1192
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:14,650
with it.
Having my good times.

1193
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:21,070
Okay.
Next question for both of you.

1194
01:14:21,071 --> 01:14:25,130
I would like to know the most
influential book and why the,

1195
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,270
you've got many influential books.
Okay.

1196
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:33,450
Yeah, I mean one book,

1197
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:38,520
I think the idea of always searching
for knowledge is more important than the

1198
01:14:38,521 --> 01:14:41,880
actual single book.
I mean I read,

1199
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:46,290
right now I'm reading this
book on the war of electricity.

1200
01:14:47,220 --> 01:14:51,540
It was AC versus DC.
Huge Electric Chair.

1201
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:56,910
Yeah. It's a great story. Like it's a
great story. It's almost split the nation.

1202
01:14:56,940 --> 01:15:01,770
Yeah. They're like direct, current or
alternate current, but w direct current,

1203
01:15:01,771 --> 01:15:04,860
so much more powerful because
I can take a little bit, uh,

1204
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:07,050
12 volts and I can kill an elephant,

1205
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:11,700
but it takes 120 volts to do
the same thing. So, you know,

1206
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,580
Edison, you know, he put it,

1207
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:19,140
he backed the wrong thing and
he was too proud to admit it.

1208
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:20,363
Um,

1209
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:25,850
and so I'm learning a ton one about maybe
putting your belief in the wrong thing

1210
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:29,450
and how you had, how
damaging it can be, um,

1211
01:15:30,450 --> 01:15:35,450
and how much damage you can do it
if you're that fix gold stubborn,

1212
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:36,211
you know,

1213
01:15:36,211 --> 01:15:41,211
or just set in your ways and how
important it is to be able to always be a

1214
01:15:41,281 --> 01:15:46,170
fertile soil that searching
for more nutrients. You know,

1215
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:48,240
there's,
there's no doubt about that.

1216
01:15:48,241 --> 01:15:53,241
And I think that that's one thing that's
been common out of this podcast is I

1217
01:15:53,911 --> 01:15:58,620
got soaked cause I review books on the
podcast and I get all these people now

1218
01:15:58,621 --> 01:15:59,970
tell me, read this book, read this book.

1219
01:15:59,971 --> 01:16:02,670
I'm reading more right now than I did
when I went to college and I was an

1220
01:16:02,671 --> 01:16:05,910
English major in college. I got people
who just sent, I'm getting books,

1221
01:16:05,911 --> 01:16:09,090
I'm getting books in the mail.
Oh, somebody want a troopers.

1222
01:16:09,091 --> 01:16:13,710
Just sent me a lone wolf. He's
like, Hey, I sent you a book.

1223
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:18,420
This is two volumes,
so 700 pages each.

1224
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:22,410
I said, man, that's going
to be on my list, but that's
going to be a brutal read.

1225
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:26,760
I mean that's going to be heavy, but
yeah, absolutely. Reading all the time,

1226
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:30,900
uh, is what it definitely
happened to me. I know,

1227
01:16:30,901 --> 01:16:34,710
we know echo has been on a
reading rampage, big time,

1228
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,980
direct result of the podcast.
A nice story.

1229
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:41,730
Anybody adding been asked this question?
I,

1230
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:46,080
there's only one book that I refer to
all the time as the most influential book

1231
01:16:46,081 --> 01:16:49,350
I've ever read, which is about
face by Colonel David Hackworth.

1232
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,920
And I've read it many times and I always
go back to it because it's a great book

1233
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:01,890
about a war in leadership and
that's why I read it all the time.

1234
01:17:03,540 --> 01:17:04,373
But I got it.

1235
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:09,290
Stack of books to read fiction
ever. Barely. So I actually read,

1236
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:13,790
I split my time between fiction
and nonfiction and I get a ton.

1237
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:17,030
I love, especially in the
Times that we're in right now.

1238
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:20,090
I'm reading like French
Revolution era stuff.

1239
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:24,650
I love learning about the
why of the thing. You know,

1240
01:17:24,651 --> 01:17:29,651
why countless times the French people
over through the government why they went

1241
01:17:30,740 --> 01:17:34,790
and they started beheading the rich class,

1242
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:39,670
um, why they went and hung
or then built the GTA,

1243
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:43,760
or if there's the why of the thing,
not the, how I get that, you know,

1244
01:17:43,761 --> 01:17:47,780
and whether it's like Alexander Dumas
or Victor Hugo, you know, it's like, um,

1245
01:17:49,010 --> 01:17:52,580
I get a lot out of that. And then I
also get a ton of wisdom, you know,

1246
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:54,320
when I'm reading like the
Count of Monte Cristo,

1247
01:17:54,620 --> 01:17:59,290
when that priest was
digging with, um, you know,

1248
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:02,420
who would then in the metamorphosis as
he's crawling through those tunnels and

1249
01:18:02,421 --> 01:18:06,830
emerges then as the count, the
amount of wisdom that, that, that,

1250
01:18:06,831 --> 01:18:11,270
that priest gave him
about ruling government's.

1251
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:16,460
Um, I look at that for our government
right now, right. And it's profound.

1252
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,290
So,
um,

1253
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:23,060
I don't limit myself while I love reading
nonfiction and learning, you know, like,

1254
01:18:23,061 --> 01:18:25,520
I like the book I'm reading right now.
Uh,

1255
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:30,770
all based in real fact,
marketing, science,

1256
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:35,690
engineering. Um, I love going back
and it's not, it's not brain candy,

1257
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:40,680
you know, it's not, I'm just sitting
here chewing on, you know, some crap. Uh,

1258
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,070
did I get any reading romance novels

1259
01:18:47,450 --> 01:18:51,200
I get a lot from, so I split my time
between fiction, nonfiction, 50, 50. Yeah,

1260
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:54,460
I don't. And I sometimes I'll try, look,

1261
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:59,000
somebody will tell me about
a great fiction book. Yeah.
And I might give it a try,

1262
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:02,330
but in my perspective, you
know, you're talking about the,

1263
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:06,620
what was the why I always like to
figure out, like when I read about war,

1264
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:10,190
I like to think about the psychology
of what's happening with the guys,

1265
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:14,060
especially from a leadership and a
follower perspective of what guys were

1266
01:19:14,061 --> 01:19:14,391
thinking.

1267
01:19:14,391 --> 01:19:18,020
Because that to me it was always the most
fascinating thing about what was going

1268
01:19:18,021 --> 01:19:22,340
down was we got to get
all these guys to do this.

1269
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,710
Or my boss is trying to get me to do that.

1270
01:19:24,711 --> 01:19:28,250
And how does that work in
these most intense scenarios?

1271
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:33,350
So from Tim Kennedy,
get out there and read.

1272
01:19:38,370 --> 01:19:39,203
Next one,

1273
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,910
love to hear Tim's thoughts on combatives
how grappling changes in full kit with

1274
01:19:44,911 --> 01:19:46,260
multiple people,
et cetera.

1275
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:49,530
Hmm hmm.
Hmm.

1276
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:55,710
Uh,
it doesn't change and you know,

1277
01:19:55,711 --> 01:20:00,410
like the basic fundamentals of how
to punch somebody's remains the same.

1278
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:05,240
You give, so like the bodies
to me as a chassis, right?

1279
01:20:05,241 --> 01:20:06,950
It doesn't matter what you put on me,

1280
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:09,720
you can give me more or
you can take away less. My,

1281
01:20:09,750 --> 01:20:14,750
this chassis is still a
killing machine right now.

1282
01:20:14,941 --> 01:20:19,680
The only thing that changes
is my lethality. The type
of damage that I can do. Um,

1283
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:20,910
there's like a Honda Civic,
right?

1284
01:20:21,200 --> 01:20:25,170
Just it can go fast or it can run down
the road and gets 38 miles to the gallon.

1285
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:25,371
Right.

1286
01:20:25,371 --> 01:20:28,590
But you can change out the exhaust or you
can put some nitrile or you can put in

1287
01:20:28,591 --> 01:20:29,510
some wheels,
you know,

1288
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:32,280
eventually what was just a vehicle
that could drive down the road,

1289
01:20:32,281 --> 01:20:33,600
can drive down the road kind of fast.

1290
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:37,860
So it's just a basic chassis that
you can expand or detract from.

1291
01:20:38,290 --> 01:20:42,750
So this chassis, this particular one,
um, so I don't normally head, but people,

1292
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,580
if I'm wearing an ops core helmet,
I'm ahead button machine. I was like,

1293
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:51,120
what'd you say to me? Headbutt
you know, and I was like, oh yeah,

1294
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:54,450
we're gloves that have like
carbon fiber across the knuckles,

1295
01:20:55,410 --> 01:20:59,400
brings the bitch slapped back,
you know, like, no. Again,
I'm not being a misogynist.

1296
01:20:59,401 --> 01:21:01,100
I do not encourage people
to ever bitch slap.

1297
01:21:01,101 --> 01:21:02,670
And I realized that's a sexist term.

1298
01:21:03,090 --> 01:21:05,100
But if I ask you question
and you lied to me,

1299
01:21:06,150 --> 01:21:08,070
know that I want to hurt
you in the first place.

1300
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:11,520
I believe the politically correct
term is the Stockton slap.

1301
01:21:11,521 --> 01:21:16,521
This talks to slap the
back of the pimp slap.

1302
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:23,250
Okay. Um, or maybe more. So
really it doesn't change.
The skills remain the same.

1303
01:21:23,251 --> 01:21:26,610
You're just adding kind of the damage
that I can do with the more equipment that

1304
01:21:26,611 --> 01:21:31,020
you give me. Yup. That's
it. Pretty simple question.

1305
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,750
I don't even have anything to add.

1306
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,990
Next one.
Cheaters,

1307
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:45,000
PD use in MMA and elsewhere.
And then plan of action.

1308
01:21:45,001 --> 01:21:47,160
Defense for homeless person.
Just threw a bunch of questions in there.

1309
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:50,820
His work on range 15. Oh yeah. And we
definitely got to talk about range 15.

1310
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:55,560
I'm naked in it. That's, so originally I
was supposed to be wearing a loincloth,

1311
01:21:55,980 --> 01:22:00,090
um, but had been sweating so much
that when I tore my pants off,

1312
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:04,710
so went the loin cloth. It
was like actual real, um,

1313
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:10,590
skin of an animal and it was like
furry, uh, and skin when you get it wet.

1314
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:15,870
Hunters know this, it deteriorates.
And as did my loin cloth,

1315
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:19,680
so when I tore my pants off
to fight Zombie Randy couture,

1316
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:23,850
I'm not giving anything away
because we really do fight. And, um,

1317
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,990
so with my loin cloth,

1318
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:31,610
so tell people about the movie naked
range 15 and Tim Kennedy naked,

1319
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:35,100
um,

1320
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:41,340
is going to challenge everybody's
perspective as to what a veteran is. Um,

1321
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:42,360
I think there's,

1322
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:46,680
I don't know what it is where people
look at veterans and they're like,

1323
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:48,930
they're damaged goods,
um,

1324
01:22:49,620 --> 01:22:54,120
PTSD or actual physical impairment or,

1325
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,230
uh, just the mentality of they've
gone through training that I haven't,

1326
01:22:58,231 --> 01:23:01,500
so that person's now a freak.
Uh,

1327
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:06,670
not even dimension the, the climate
that I think is encouraged from

1328
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:11,800
the government to treat us differently.
Um,

1329
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:15,760
this movie is not very gingerly.

1330
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:18,070
Got To cover those topics.

1331
01:23:18,430 --> 01:23:22,620
It will absolutely offend what
I think to be about 70% of this,

1332
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:26,110
of this country. From what you
told me about the movie today,

1333
01:23:26,860 --> 01:23:31,210
I'm going to go ahead and up that number
to 90% and I'll tell you what, what,

1334
01:23:31,211 --> 01:23:35,290
when you were telling me about the
movie today, so what's, who made it?

1335
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:39,380
What's his name? Primary.
So Matt, best at best,

1336
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,320
Nick Paul Massano Matt Best owns a company
called an article 15 range or up is

1337
01:23:44,321 --> 01:23:49,300
our company. So that's why it's called
range 15, article 15 and ranger out, um,

1338
01:23:49,330 --> 01:23:54,010
pretty clever name. Very, very creative
army for us. That's army. Sorry.

1339
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:54,970
Listen,

1340
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:59,470
you fell a sophisticated cosmopolitan
and we all were officers in the military.

1341
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,410
Um,
so uh,

1342
01:24:02,500 --> 01:24:06,490
Matt and nick or the masterminds behind
that, Matt is our main character.

1343
01:24:06,491 --> 01:24:10,440
He's our hero. Numero Uno. Right.
And He's good looking, man. I,

1344
01:24:10,510 --> 01:24:14,170
I've seen a couple of things that
he's done. He's obviously a funny guy.

1345
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:18,070
And they put together this movie,
they did it through Indie Gogo,

1346
01:24:18,071 --> 01:24:21,070
which is some sort of a crowd funding,

1347
01:24:21,190 --> 01:24:25,030
a deal where you get money from people,
you know, and the, it's the public,

1348
01:24:25,031 --> 01:24:27,130
the public just gives money.
And you raised how much money?

1349
01:24:27,650 --> 01:24:30,430
I've got a few million,
a few million dollars to make this movie.

1350
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:35,080
And then we had like people
from then we had like sponsors,

1351
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,660
people that are in the community
that believed in the product,

1352
01:24:37,690 --> 01:24:41,980
like Gerber knives, who I'm sponsored
by, um, weapons manufacturers.

1353
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:44,740
We had like people that make,
um,

1354
01:24:45,010 --> 01:24:49,240
Hazmat suits a coffee maker.
Awesome. And they're like,

1355
01:24:49,241 --> 01:24:53,320
we just want this movie to be made.
And then people in Hollywood wanted,

1356
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,520
when they saw that we were like breaking
the mold because Hollywood is stuck.

1357
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:02,110
It's a cesspool of inhumanity
and selfishness and greed.

1358
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:05,020
That's what that industry
is, that it's, it's,

1359
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:10,140
it's damn near eval when everybody that
has been suffered has been suffering by

1360
01:25:11,201 --> 01:25:13,990
that.
The Organization of what Hollywood is,

1361
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:19,110
saw that a bunch of veterans that
didn't give anything and we're like,

1362
01:25:20,231 --> 01:25:21,041
we're gonna make a movie.

1363
01:25:21,041 --> 01:25:23,980
And it's going to be the most offensive
movie and everybody in this whole city,

1364
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:28,180
Hollywood is going to hate it. They
started helping us to like, wait,

1365
01:25:28,181 --> 01:25:31,420
it takes a few hundred
thousand to rent a red camera.

1366
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,910
We'll give you three for you to use.

1367
01:25:33,911 --> 01:25:38,911
The whole time we had guys that
were like $2,000 a day type,

1368
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:43,480
um, directors and directors of photography
that would step up and be like,

1369
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:46,780
I'm just going to volunteer my time
for three weeks. And you're like,

1370
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:51,840
so we can't pay you the 50 grand for a
week that you normally make or the for

1371
01:25:52,931 --> 01:25:56,860
the, for the shot. And
they're like, it's cool. Yeah.

1372
01:25:57,220 --> 01:26:00,190
So there is something, when you were
telling me about the movie today,

1373
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:04,130
this is what I think about

1374
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:04,963
what you told me.

1375
01:26:05,420 --> 01:26:10,420
There is something about special
operations community that is very secret.

1376
01:26:14,590 --> 01:26:17,620
It is something that has never been
revealed to the public view. It,

1377
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:22,570
it is something that is outside. It's
even beyond top secret. This is cla.

1378
01:26:22,610 --> 01:26:25,910
Highly classified information
in a special operations can.

1379
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:26,661
We might have to kill you.

1380
01:26:26,661 --> 01:26:31,550
Echo Charlie and what it is and it's
something that I seriously have never seen

1381
01:26:31,551 --> 01:26:32,384
come out.
The public,

1382
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:35,420
you guys talk about missions they've done
but no one has ever talked about this

1383
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:40,421
fact and that is that the
special operations community
has an insane sense of

1384
01:26:42,801 --> 01:26:45,650
humor,
insane and it,

1385
01:26:45,651 --> 01:26:50,180
the reason it doesn't get released is
because it's in my belief it is not

1386
01:26:50,181 --> 01:26:55,181
previously been and any way
remotely acceptable by the human,

1387
01:26:55,851 --> 01:26:56,690
by the normal people,

1388
01:26:56,691 --> 01:27:00,830
by the populous and what you told me
that some of the scenes you told me about

1389
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:04,250
today,
they are going to shock.

1390
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:09,560
They are going to shock and everybody
from SPEC ops and most guys in the

1391
01:27:09,561 --> 01:27:11,630
military going to look at him and they're
going to laugh and they're going to,

1392
01:27:11,780 --> 01:27:12,800
they're going to think it's funny.

1393
01:27:13,730 --> 01:27:17,270
They're going to be laughing so hard
and just going to seem normal to us.

1394
01:27:17,271 --> 01:27:19,190
It's going to be seeing older than
me. I'll be like, oh yeah, classic.

1395
01:27:19,191 --> 01:27:22,820
Of course you're doing that,
but I think like you said,

1396
01:27:22,940 --> 01:27:26,120
I mean Hollywood is going to
be beside themselves. They are.

1397
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:30,590
They are going to be completely beside
themselves. This may start a revolution.

1398
01:27:30,860 --> 01:27:35,140
I hope so. This may start
a revolution and I, I, I,

1399
01:27:35,780 --> 01:27:40,670
this may start a revolution with what you
told me about it today and I know that

1400
01:27:40,671 --> 01:27:43,760
everybody that's us in this podcast is
going to go seek gonna go see this thing

1401
01:27:43,761 --> 01:27:47,780
immediately and I think
it's going to be phenomenal.

1402
01:27:47,870 --> 01:27:50,660
So I'm looking forward to it

1403
01:27:52,430 --> 01:27:53,121
when it comes out.

1404
01:27:53,121 --> 01:27:56,420
The movie is called Range 15 and
it's going to be in general release.

1405
01:27:56,421 --> 01:27:56,840
It's gonna be

1406
01:27:56,840 --> 01:28:00,260
the nurse. Yeah. Yeah. June,
June 15th so the premiere,

1407
01:28:00,261 --> 01:28:03,380
is it the Military Gi film festival.
Memorial Day weekend.

1408
01:28:04,130 --> 01:28:07,280
And that's going to be in Washington DC.

1409
01:28:07,370 --> 01:28:09,260
And then two weeks later
is the wide release.

1410
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:12,230
Right now we're in eight or 900 theaters.

1411
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:16,730
That's just gonna keep going and growing.
That's awesome.

1412
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:21,350
PDS stop using them.
Yeah,

1413
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:24,270
pretty straight forward.
I hate him.

1414
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,560
I get a lot like

1415
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:32,960
you have a big Mesomorph Physique,
right?

1416
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:36,440
And somebody looks at you, they're
like, oh man, look at that big old guy.

1417
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,740
You know what, what Roids
does he use? It's like,

1418
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:46,100
it's all hard work. I've been an athlete
since I was six years old. You know,

1419
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:47,900
my dad was an Olympic level athlete.

1420
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:52,960
My brother is like 10 times the athlete
that I am. My sister was, she's, you know,

1421
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:56,720
she was, she started an athlete
even before we were, um,

1422
01:28:58,450 --> 01:28:59,890
like throw stones at me.

1423
01:29:00,140 --> 01:29:05,140
You sought a tests every week to military
test has all the time still to the

1424
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:09,990
day. Like I just get tested. Um, last
month I got tested like nine times.

1425
01:29:10,900 --> 01:29:14,700
I've always been clean.
I will always be clean.

1426
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:16,130
Yeah.

1427
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:20,330
And just for those of you that don't know
that for those of you that aren't MMA

1428
01:29:20,331 --> 01:29:24,460
fans, you fall a lot of guys
that weren't clean. Yeah.

1429
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:28,370
And that's used.
You know,

1430
01:29:28,371 --> 01:29:31,040
I've since been in the
academic community and,

1431
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:34,340
and sparring a lot of guys
and fighting a lot of guys.

1432
01:29:34,670 --> 01:29:36,490
I've gone with guys and,

1433
01:29:36,590 --> 01:29:41,120
and just so everybody understands
when someone goes on steroids,

1434
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:47,330
you can feel it 100%. You can
absolutely feel it. They work,

1435
01:29:47,420 --> 01:29:51,540
they work, they work, they work,
they make you stronger. They make,

1436
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:56,270
they make a cover. A couple of faster.
And so the fact that you've gone in the,

1437
01:29:56,330 --> 01:30:00,530
in the cage on multiple occasions and
Farc guys that had that massive advantage

1438
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:05,480
and you've beaten him,
uh, awesome, awesome work.

1439
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:08,680
And it's a bummer that, that,
that's out there. Yeah. With that

1440
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:16,680
self respect, integrity. Yeah. You have
more of an outspoken opinion about it,

1441
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,080
but say then like the next guy.
Yeah. I mean, so I've been,

1442
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:23,340
I've been a professional
athlete for 14 years. Um,

1443
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:29,180
like the pride peak of guys
dripping anabolic steroids.

1444
01:30:29,610 --> 01:30:32,220
Like, I mean, not like
I used in fight camp.

1445
01:30:32,221 --> 01:30:37,221
I mean like they took hypodermic needles
and shoved them into their eyeballs

1446
01:30:38,070 --> 01:30:42,330
right before the fight type fights. You
know, the vendor delay Silva like Jewish,

1447
01:30:42,331 --> 01:30:44,460
like he's up on the sh the ring screaming,

1448
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:48,120
and he probably hasn't even remembered
like the last four days because he's been

1449
01:30:48,121 --> 01:30:51,760
in a steroid rage leading up to
his fight. That was the, that,

1450
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:56,820
that is the era of MMA that I
came from. Right. And, um, my,

1451
01:30:56,821 --> 01:31:01,460
so my entire career has been that, and
I'm not bitter that like, you know, I,

1452
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:04,030
I fought in lost titles.
Um,

1453
01:31:06,990 --> 01:31:07,711
and yeah,

1454
01:31:07,711 --> 01:31:11,010
maybe they would have gone differently
had I cheated or they weren't cheating,

1455
01:31:11,490 --> 01:31:13,530
but that's not what it's about to me.
It's,

1456
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:17,340
I've been a martial artist
since I was since I was a kid.

1457
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:23,090
So a martial artist has to do with ethics
and integrity and hard work and you're

1458
01:31:24,391 --> 01:31:28,680
like the pillars of what being a martial
artist is and every one of these guys

1459
01:31:28,770 --> 01:31:33,770
spits in the face of what I think
the sport is supposed to personify.

1460
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:41,120
All the beauty that exists in martial
arts is stripped away every time one of

1461
01:31:42,121 --> 01:31:43,620
these guys test positive.

1462
01:31:45,390 --> 01:31:49,560
That's why. Yeah. That's,
uh, I'll leave it at that.

1463
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:51,400
I'll leave it at that.

1464
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:53,093
Okay.

1465
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:55,713
While we're on it,

1466
01:31:55,900 --> 01:32:00,850
the next question is why
not make one UFC run? Mm,

1467
01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:06,070
I do it. Yeah. Are there, are
you gonna fight again? What's,

1468
01:32:06,071 --> 01:32:08,200
are you on the schedule?
Are they calling you

1469
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:10,220
post to deploy

1470
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:15,060
in mid May and then at
the beginning of June?

1471
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:18,270
So I know I'm gonna leave
in mid to late May and

1472
01:32:18,490 --> 01:32:22,250
nope. Again, I got to break some stuff
down for some civilians here, right?

1473
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:24,060
Yeah.

1474
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:27,720
Tim who's doing all this stuff,
we sit in the room with me right now,

1475
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:31,590
who's got done doing a photo shoot today,
who's making movies?

1476
01:32:32,100 --> 01:32:37,100
He's going on deployment overseas
to go hunt down and kill bad guys

1477
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:42,630
in a matter of months. I'm retired. Right?

1478
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:46,500
He's still doing it and he's doing all
this other stuff and he's fighting for

1479
01:32:46,501 --> 01:32:49,590
the UFC. Now the UFC, I mean,

1480
01:32:50,530 --> 01:32:51,030
yeah,

1481
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:55,020
you should be the absolute
poster boy for the UFC,

1482
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:57,090
for the love of God.

1483
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:58,953
Okay.

1484
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:02,630
Sorry for interrupting you. Okay. So
you're going to go on deployment. Yeah.

1485
01:33:02,900 --> 01:33:04,040
For your nation.

1486
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:09,670
Um, and so my, one of my management, uh,

1487
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:15,030
told them that I get back on this date
and from this date until this date,

1488
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:20,320
which is when I leave again, I'll be
100% down to fight anybody they say.

1489
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,760
So one last UFC run,

1490
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:29,440
I wouldn't even limit it to last.
The I'm ranked whatever,

1491
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:33,160
six in the war, seventh or sixth or
fifth in the world right now. To me,

1492
01:33:33,161 --> 01:33:36,460
I'm a fight away from a title and um,
and I think I can

1493
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:42,410
beat everybody above me.
And I think you can too.

1494
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:46,760
Yeah. Uh, so let's hope
that the folks at the UFC

1495
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:53,330
pay attention to this. I mean, you got
a guy that's a veteran that's a hero,

1496
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:56,720
that's a hard worker,
that's never let you guys down.

1497
01:33:56,721 --> 01:33:59,930
Pop and positive that's
trained in his ass off.

1498
01:34:01,540 --> 01:34:03,490
And you know what,
besides all that,

1499
01:34:03,491 --> 01:34:08,491
he's getting ready to deploy again
so that you can have the damn UFC.

1500
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:15,310
How about when he gets back, you tell
him, how much time do you need my brother,

1501
01:34:16,240 --> 01:34:19,840
you t you tell us when you want to
fight and, and who you want to fight.

1502
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:23,920
If I was Dana White, I'd be like,
Oh, you know what, this whole,

1503
01:34:24,130 --> 01:34:28,810
this whole UFC schedule is
based on Tim Kennedy. I like,

1504
01:34:28,811 --> 01:34:33,811
that's who we based the UFC schedule sound
of that not on what some other person

1505
01:34:35,711 --> 01:34:37,480
that's not ever served.

1506
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:42,880
So hopefully Dana White, if you're
listening, my name is Jocko.

1507
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:44,260
Give me a shout.

1508
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:46,990
I'll lay this out for you and explain
to you how this needs to at work.

1509
01:34:49,720 --> 01:34:54,310
Let's do this. Loan it. Yes, seriously.

1510
01:34:56,710 --> 01:34:57,543
All

1511
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:04,380
importance of recovery within
your training program. Cheers.

1512
01:35:05,120 --> 01:35:07,670
And this is, by the way, this
is from a sore necks, you know,

1513
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:10,350
the guys that make weight racks.
Yeah.

1514
01:35:10,690 --> 01:35:14,080
Well, you know, for, for
recovery be important.

1515
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,840
You have to have done
the hard work to need it.

1516
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:20,510
So I think a lot of people focus
on recovery all the time. Um,

1517
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:25,830
when they seriously, uh,
I, I can't do that today.

1518
01:35:25,831 --> 01:35:26,740
I'm on recovery day.

1519
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:32,110
I gotta gotta cry cryotherapy or ice
bath or get a massage or acupuncture,

1520
01:35:32,111 --> 01:35:36,370
you know, like bitch,
go train hard, you know,

1521
01:35:36,371 --> 01:35:40,480
like these callouses, I cut
off, you know, like weekly.

1522
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,030
It's from hard work, you know, and,

1523
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,810
and I think recovery is
as important as training,

1524
01:35:47,170 --> 01:35:52,170
but first the training has to be there
and it has to be hard enough for it to

1525
01:35:52,781 --> 01:35:54,340
warrant needing recovery.

1526
01:35:55,530 --> 01:35:58,020
Yeah. Now, I would say when, when
I'm, when I was training fighters,

1527
01:35:58,021 --> 01:36:00,230
I don't do it a lot anymore,
but when I was trained UFC fighters,

1528
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:05,100
it was so obvious when they
were overtrained like they'd
go from the, you know,

1529
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:08,670
they be giving me a hard time on the
mat or whatever and all of a sudden I'm

1530
01:36:08,671 --> 01:36:12,000
just annihilated and I go,
yeah, hey day off mango,

1531
01:36:12,030 --> 01:36:17,010
eat two steaks tomorrow and just relax
and easy. But you know, some guys,

1532
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:19,740
oh I needed a couple of days off.
You don't need a day off.

1533
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:22,240
I think it has more to do with
lifestyle than recovery. You know,

1534
01:36:22,241 --> 01:36:26,770
like when people are like, I am just not
being able to put that, get the output,

1535
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:30,190
the volume that I need to do for work.
Let's talk about your life. You know,

1536
01:36:30,191 --> 01:36:33,580
like we, y'all chasing pussy last
night. Oh you were? You were,

1537
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:37,150
you were at a strip club. Is
that glitter shut? Get Out, get,

1538
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:41,470
what have you eaten this
week? Tell me, show me your
diet. Did you even have a log?

1539
01:36:41,471 --> 01:36:45,400
No, you don't have a log. Get
Out. You know? Well, how much
did you sleep last night?

1540
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:50,170
Oh, you don't know cause what
you drank get out. You know,

1541
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:54,100
like when was the last time you had to
drink? Oh, last night. Get Out. You know,

1542
01:36:54,110 --> 01:36:56,190
stop talking to me about recovery.
If you don't get it,

1543
01:36:56,191 --> 01:36:58,120
a lifestyle that's conducive to training,
you know,

1544
01:36:58,121 --> 01:37:00,640
like you want to talk about healthy
lifestyle, get eight hours of sleep.

1545
01:37:01,950 --> 01:37:05,980
Well yeah, I know. Yeah. Hey
Jocko. Doesn't sleep a lot.

1546
01:37:06,520 --> 01:37:10,840
That's all right. That's all right. Eat
real food. Stop putting crap in your body.

1547
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:14,500
Stop drinking. You don't. You
won't drop your testosterone.

1548
01:37:14,501 --> 01:37:16,900
You were talking about these guys
are having huge problems to stop.

1549
01:37:16,990 --> 01:37:21,550
One stop using steroids to stop
drinking. You know, for me,

1550
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:27,100
sex day, everyday get eight
hours of sleep. Work my ass off.

1551
01:37:27,130 --> 01:37:31,120
I think that a man for a real athlete,
man or woman,

1552
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:33,040
they have to go to bed tired.

1553
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:38,410
I love that feeling like
you are exhausted. You see
that bed and you were like,

1554
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:42,610
fuck you cannot mean to me.
Can I make it? You know,

1555
01:37:42,611 --> 01:37:44,410
can I make it from the shower to bed?
Yeah,

1556
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:46,390
that's what you're supposed to feel like.

1557
01:37:46,440 --> 01:37:47,970
We've talked about that
on here and that's,

1558
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:50,550
that's one of my favorite
feelings in the world

1559
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:54,680
of I get to the end of the night and
I'm barely hanging on through dinner.

1560
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:59,290
By the time I get done with dinner,
I'll just, Oh God, I can't wait to crow.

1561
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:03,600
Wife starts talking. You're like,
Baby Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah Wah.

1562
01:38:03,720 --> 01:38:06,360
You hear the words, but I don't know
what you're saying. Yeah. You know,

1563
01:38:08,310 --> 01:38:12,270
so I, yeah, that's,
that's great input. Sleep,

1564
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:15,450
eat right. It's, you can work, man.

1565
01:38:15,451 --> 01:38:18,640
Humans can do a lot of
the body is so adaptive.

1566
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:22,830
So you've got people that can run ultra
marathons and he got people that can

1567
01:38:22,940 --> 01:38:27,750
deadlift thousands of pounds the,
and we're the same species. Right.

1568
01:38:28,140 --> 01:38:28,381
You know,

1569
01:38:28,381 --> 01:38:33,090
we have people that can like paint the
Mona Lisa and there's people that can go

1570
01:38:33,091 --> 01:38:35,810
and murder villages,

1571
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:38,840
same species,
you know,

1572
01:38:38,841 --> 01:38:43,220
like it is an adaptive thing as
long as you train it properly.

1573
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:44,833
Yeah.

1574
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:53,100
Next question. What are the, what
are the best qualities, SLAs, skills?

1575
01:38:53,130 --> 01:38:57,840
A person needs to be a great soldier.
Slash. Fighter. And are these the same?

1576
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:07,370
I think that there are some qualities
in each that compliment each other.

1577
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:10,760
Um,
for example,

1578
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:13,940
the regimented schedule of the military

1579
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:20,200
does good things for somebody that wants
to aspire to be a fighter because most

1580
01:39:20,201 --> 01:39:25,201
fighters are selfish little pricks that
are super lazy and they don't understand

1581
01:39:26,471 --> 01:39:27,310
what it takes.

1582
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:32,260
Dedication wise to little
things like setting your alarm,

1583
01:39:32,830 --> 01:39:37,270
being on time to work out, writing
a journal as to what you're eating.

1584
01:39:37,810 --> 01:39:42,550
I'm not chasing pussy all night long and
that you should go to bed like those.

1585
01:39:42,640 --> 01:39:46,120
That's discipline. That's, that's
what that is. That's that word. Um,

1586
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:50,800
and a lot of military, not all guys, but
a lot of the military teaches discipline.

1587
01:39:51,190 --> 01:39:55,840
So that is a characteristic that would
compliment somebody that aspires to be a

1588
01:39:55,841 --> 01:40:00,700
fighter. And then fighters, you know, like
yes. Obviously you're learning skills,

1589
01:40:00,701 --> 01:40:05,170
technical skills that
could be life saving. Um,

1590
01:40:05,410 --> 01:40:08,590
you know, just like you getting
comfortable with sweating,

1591
01:40:08,591 --> 01:40:13,240
you're getting used to hard work and you
know, so some of those things are nice,

1592
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:16,960
but um,
yeah.

1593
01:40:16,990 --> 01:40:19,180
So there's some things that that do well.

1594
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:23,440
I think being a good soldier can make you
a better fighter and some things about

1595
01:40:23,441 --> 01:40:25,330
being a good fighter can
make you a better soldier.

1596
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:27,530
Yeah. I think, uh,

1597
01:40:28,070 --> 01:40:33,070
for me the biggest quality that would
transfer both back and forth soldier

1598
01:40:33,291 --> 01:40:33,681
fighter,

1599
01:40:33,681 --> 01:40:36,470
and I'll go ahead and throw one more on
there and that's been in a leadership

1600
01:40:36,471 --> 01:40:37,304
position,

1601
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:42,640
but to me it's humility and I think what
makes a soldier of fighter a leader the

1602
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:49,100
most important quality that they can have,
his humility,

1603
01:40:49,101 --> 01:40:54,101
because the minute that you're not humble
is minute that you stop training as

1604
01:40:55,601 --> 01:40:58,150
hard as you can. So the
minute you say, you know what,

1605
01:40:58,151 --> 01:41:00,220
I don't need to do that
extra workout today.

1606
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:02,950
That's a lack of humility because
you're thinking, oh, I already got this,

1607
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:06,580
I got this in the bag from a
leadership position, same thing.

1608
01:41:06,581 --> 01:41:07,900
I don't really do train my guys hard.

1609
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:11,890
I don't need to show up earlier than my
guys because they already respect me. No,

1610
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:17,140
you need to earn that respect every day.
And so for me,

1611
01:41:17,141 --> 01:41:20,110
always humility is the most important

1612
01:41:22,130 --> 01:41:26,570
characteristic of a person because
you're not also not learning what's,

1613
01:41:26,571 --> 01:41:29,190
you're not humble. I don't need, I don't
need to roll today. I'll read the whole,

1614
01:41:29,191 --> 01:41:33,380
I didn't need to get on the pads today.
How did you swing that kettle bell today?

1615
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:34,550
I'm already good.

1616
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:39,380
Get humble yet humble or
you're gonna get humbled,

1617
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:45,290
dude. Boom. That's ranger rupture. Sorry.

1618
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:48,300
Let me, let me put this in my phone
real fast. It'll be recorded too.

1619
01:41:48,301 --> 01:41:51,530
When you can refer it back to you. I don't
want you to keep it. I want to keep it.

1620
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:55,110
Okay.
We got all kinds of tee shirts,

1621
01:41:55,111 --> 01:41:59,810
sayings that come out of the podcast
each time. Be Humble or get humbled.

1622
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,830
Take the high road or the high road
of Tq. Yeah, that's another good one.

1623
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:11,330
Saved. Okay. All right.
Humility right there.

1624
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:15,390
Last learning from external
social thievery of his, um,

1625
01:42:15,530 --> 01:42:18,350
intellectual property.
I didn't trademark it yet.

1626
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:20,570
I'm sure you'll cut me up.

1627
01:42:20,571 --> 01:42:25,010
Giant fat check for the thousands and
thousands of tee shirts that gets sold

1628
01:42:25,011 --> 01:42:28,010
with that on it. Uh, okay. Last question.

1629
01:42:28,011 --> 01:42:31,610
And I think the reason this question is
in here is because a lot of people that

1630
01:42:31,611 --> 01:42:34,610
listen to this podcast,
they're trying to get better,

1631
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:37,910
try to improve themselves,
they're trying to do good and we all,

1632
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,910
and we got people of all ages.

1633
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:44,750
This one in particular says if giving
a high school graduation speech,

1634
01:42:44,751 --> 01:42:49,700
what would you advise 18 year olds
navigating their first, their next steps?

1635
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:54,260
Would you tell an 18 year old, oh man, um,

1636
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:58,280
be humbler gambled. Damn. I know, dude,

1637
01:42:58,281 --> 01:43:01,860
we need to make a t shirt
that says no, I am, um,

1638
01:43:05,960 --> 01:43:07,880
you don't have another way that
this question gets phrased.

1639
01:43:08,150 --> 01:43:10,070
And from what the story you told tonight,

1640
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:13,790
what would you tell yourself if you
could tell your own 18 year old self,

1641
01:43:13,791 --> 01:43:15,530
what would you tell yourself?

1642
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:22,760
Do something that you don't
know if you can accomplish.

1643
01:43:24,890 --> 01:43:29,210
If I'm going to climb a mountain,
yeah, I could go up to, you know,

1644
01:43:29,360 --> 01:43:31,250
mission St Louis Obispo,

1645
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:35,960
which is like a 2000 foot mountain and
I'm pretty confident I could claim that,

1646
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:38,030
you know,
um,

1647
01:43:39,530 --> 01:43:44,360
Mount Whitney without some training.
Honestly, we've kind of challenging.

1648
01:43:45,320 --> 01:43:49,430
Um, you know, obviously a k Everest
Dif, different beasts could do it.

1649
01:43:50,630 --> 01:43:51,463
Do,

1650
01:43:52,940 --> 01:43:53,780
do that,

1651
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:58,810
do that thing that you don't know if you
can do stop being afraid of hard work.

1652
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,620
That's the thing that's gonna

1653
01:44:05,390 --> 01:44:07,490
really determine success or failure.

1654
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:13,000
One is your desire to actually do it
and then to the commitment that it will

1655
01:44:13,971 --> 01:44:15,770
take to achieve it.

1656
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:21,000
Stop being scared.
Go and do it.

1657
01:44:22,740 --> 01:44:23,573
That's what I'd say

1658
01:44:25,290 --> 01:44:27,660
my statement.

1659
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:29,380
Yeah.

1660
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:30,760
And I put it right on top of that.

1661
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:37,140
I would say that not only do you want
to stop being scared and do that thing

1662
01:44:37,331 --> 01:44:39,520
that you don't know if you can do or not,

1663
01:44:39,521 --> 01:44:43,630
but you know what you gotta do is you've
got to start taking the steps now.

1664
01:44:45,490 --> 01:44:47,140
Because when you're 18 years old,

1665
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:51,930
your life seems like it's going to last
forever. And I will tell you right now,

1666
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,620
it's not gonna last forever

1667
01:44:55,570 --> 01:45:00,010
in those years go by like a summer's Day.

1668
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:02,440
And the next thing you know,
you look up

1669
01:45:03,970 --> 01:45:08,970
and you're 36 years old or you're
44 years old and that time's gone.

1670
01:45:11,081 --> 01:45:15,400
You cannot get it back.
You cannot get time back.

1671
01:45:17,450 --> 01:45:20,510
So those dreams that you have,

1672
01:45:21,230 --> 01:45:22,850
those goals that you have,

1673
01:45:23,030 --> 01:45:26,570
don't put them off another second one,

1674
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:29,930
not one second.
Get on them

1675
01:45:32,390 --> 01:45:37,340
and go out and make them happen.
Starting right now.

1676
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:46,530
Yeah. Like you got anything else for
the night? Tana? Mike Schur suspended.

1677
01:45:46,531 --> 01:45:51,120
She can't drop them. But if you
could, that's what I would've done.

1678
01:45:51,121 --> 01:45:53,940
I just be like,
I'm out.

1679
01:45:55,800 --> 01:46:00,600
You got anything else?
Dude, this is awesome.

1680
01:46:00,960 --> 01:46:05,060
Thanks man. Thanks for coming on.
You're inspiring. Preciate it, you're,

1681
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:09,510
you're inspiring to all nations.
Uh, Echo. You've got anything?

1682
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:13,470
I thought it was interesting how
a lot of the stuff, actually,

1683
01:46:13,471 --> 01:46:18,471
most of the stuff that Tim was talking
about was like what we were just kind of

1684
01:46:18,781 --> 01:46:22,360
recently talking about in terms
of the reading stuff. Yeah.

1685
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:27,030
The stop drinking stuff. The, um,
obviously the hard work stuff or whatever.

1686
01:46:27,031 --> 01:46:29,190
But it was, it was, I
thought that was interesting.

1687
01:46:29,820 --> 01:46:32,220
So I subscribed to this idea of like,

1688
01:46:32,221 --> 01:46:35,520
I prefer a dangerous
freedom to peaceful slavery.

1689
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:39,900
And the only reason that that you
can have that is from individual

1690
01:46:39,901 --> 01:46:43,620
responsibility for you to have freedom.
It's, there's not this construct.

1691
01:46:43,621 --> 01:46:48,621
You actually have to take the work and
do the work that's associated with it and

1692
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:49,880
see what I mean?

1693
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:54,880
He's laughing right now because one of
my sort of mantras in life is discipline

1694
01:46:56,971 --> 01:47:00,570
equals freedom. And the more discipline
you have, the harder you work,

1695
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:03,630
the more effort you put into it,
the more freedom you're going to have.

1696
01:47:04,410 --> 01:47:07,230
And so as you're
describing this philosophy,

1697
01:47:07,380 --> 01:47:10,520
it's something that we
literally say on every, it's a,

1698
01:47:10,590 --> 01:47:13,310
it's a chapter in the book that I
read what I just said. Like whoa.

1699
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:16,790
Everything you're saying is like locking
in exactly with like, Whoa, whoa.

1700
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:21,030
He's been saying Amen.
Jocko. Amen. You, it,

1701
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:23,790
we actually have a shirt,
one of the two only two shirts we have.

1702
01:47:23,791 --> 01:47:27,400
One is discipline equals freedom.
You don't be humble or get humbled

1703
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:33,440
for ranger up to make. Thank
you. What about what else
on it? Oh yeah. On it. Yeah.

1704
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:38,880
You know all about [inaudible] trainer.
I train there two days a week. Utilize,

1705
01:47:39,250 --> 01:47:43,170
I utilize their self. What
do you use? Um, shroom tech.

1706
01:47:43,500 --> 01:47:47,130
See she room, I swear. Like, um,

1707
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:51,600
so I'm like a pretty sight. I
think I'm a scientific guy. Um,

1708
01:47:51,601 --> 01:47:55,080
so when I'm using something
I'll have like measurable,

1709
01:47:55,320 --> 01:48:00,000
tangible numbers.
I can do x number of reps,

1710
01:48:00,001 --> 01:48:01,500
reps or rose,

1711
01:48:01,501 --> 01:48:06,390
like how many calories can I burn and
10 minutes on shroom tech or off shroom

1712
01:48:06,391 --> 01:48:10,470
tech, all things being the same, same
day of the week. Same. Pretty much diet,

1713
01:48:10,471 --> 01:48:14,610
same similar weight. Um, it's
more what am on trim tech.

1714
01:48:15,450 --> 01:48:17,670
I don't know if it's placebo.
I know when I go in and I roll,

1715
01:48:18,030 --> 01:48:21,130
there's nights where I'm
like tuckered out. Um,

1716
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:23,550
and then there's nights where I'm
lunchroom tech and I'm just like,

1717
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:26,730
I want another round. Anybody else got
another round? And that's what to say,

1718
01:48:26,731 --> 01:48:31,260
the later rounds, you really feel it as
the rounds go on. Any other so on it?

1719
01:48:31,830 --> 01:48:35,640
Yeah. If you want to get, um,
shroom tech or Alpha brain,

1720
01:48:36,050 --> 01:48:41,040

1721

1729
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:16,180
Ah, yeah. It's hard not to do Amazon now.

1730

man. Do that. Right.

1731
01:49:21,390 --> 01:49:24,510

I have one question.

1732
01:49:24,511 --> 01:49:29,511
Send it Brian Stann in
you 2016 is it too late?

1733

are about to be distributed to a bunch

1734
01:49:35,161 --> 01:49:38,430
of bitches.

1735
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:44,330
24 2016 for 2020 I'll have to meet with

flood in there somewhere too.

1739
01:49:58,250 --> 01:50:02,000

Wait, seriously though.

1741
01:50:05,720 --> 01:50:09,080
Appreciate sweet sharing with
everybody and most of all,

1742
01:50:09,110 --> 01:50:13,910
thank you for your service to this nation
can never thank you enough for what

1743
01:50:13,911 --> 01:50:14,744
you've done.

1744
01:50:15,410 --> 01:50:19,910
If you want to connect with any of us
on the Inter webs echos at Echo Charles.

1745
01:50:20,510 --> 01:50:25,510
Tim is at Tim Kennedy MMA and I am at
Jocko Willink and all the troopers are out

1746
01:50:28,881 --> 01:50:31,970
there that are listening to this.
Thanks for listening

1747
01:50:33,710 --> 01:50:37,580
to those of you that aren't on the front
lines of the battlefield overseas right

1748
01:50:37,581 --> 01:50:39,590
now,
serving in our military.

1749
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:43,400
Thanks for taking the fight to the enemy,

1750
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:49,340
to the police law enforcement
firefighters that are here state side.

1751
01:50:49,640 --> 01:50:52,640
Thank you all for
protecting the home front

1752
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:59,640
and for all the other troopers out there
in the world on your job site or in

1753
01:50:59,641 --> 01:51:04,641
your office or in your manufacturing
line or sitting in your cubicle out there

1754
01:51:05,880 --> 01:51:07,320
grinding away.

1755
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:14,040
I want you to remember that the grind

1756
01:51:15,540 --> 01:51:17,430
is how you sharpen the ax

1757
01:51:19,730 --> 01:51:24,730
and it's the toil that makes
the man so keep grinding.

1758
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:33,760
They keep living and go to
sleep later and wake up earlier.

1759
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:36,500
Work hard,

1760
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:41,620
and play even harder and have fun while
you're doing both and squeeze every

1761
01:51:43,490 --> 01:51:45,890
minute out of every day

1762
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:50,580
and make every second count.

1763
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,210
And the best way to do that

1764
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:01,100
is to go out there,
get after it.

1765
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:05,890
So until next time,

1766
01:52:06,490 --> 01:52:11,490
this is echo and Tim and Jocko out.
