eighty years ago we thought that the

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449
eighty years ago we thought that the
 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.140
eighty years ago we thought that the
entire universe consists of what we know

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150
entire universe consists of what we know
 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.009
entire universe consists of what we know
today as our Milky Way galaxy which made

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
today as our Milky Way galaxy which made
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.470
today as our Milky Way galaxy which made
sense at the time our our Milky Way

galaxy is a huge place our Milky Way

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310
galaxy is a huge place our Milky Way

light-years so if you shined a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
light-years so if you shined a
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.700
light-years so if you shined a
flashlight from one end of the Milky Way

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710
flashlight from one end of the Milky Way
 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.300
flashlight from one end of the Milky Way
traveling at 186,000 miles per second it

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310
traveling at 186,000 miles per second it
 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.030
traveling at 186,000 miles per second it
still takes 100,000 years for that

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040
still takes 100,000 years for that
 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.670
still takes 100,000 years for that
flashlight beam to finally reach the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680
flashlight beam to finally reach the
 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:44.190
flashlight beam to finally reach the
other side of our Milky Way galaxy

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:44.200
 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.740
being so big it's not surprising we

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750
being so big it's not surprising we
 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.300
being so big it's not surprising we
thought our Milky Way was the universe

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:51.310
thought our Milky Way was the universe
 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.190
thought our Milky Way was the universe
but we now know that it's only one of

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:54.200
but we now know that it's only one of
 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.369
but we now know that it's only one of
about 100 billion other galaxies in the

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379
about 100 billion other galaxies in the
 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.880
about 100 billion other galaxies in the
cosmos so many galaxies in fact that if

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890
cosmos so many galaxies in fact that if
 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.600

they suddenly turned into peas they fill

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610

a Sports Arena

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810
 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.280
and in each of these galaxies there are

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290
and in each of these galaxies there are
 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.710
and in each of these galaxies there are
tens even hundreds of billions of stars

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720
tens even hundreds of billions of stars
 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.230
tens even hundreds of billions of stars
all together it adds up to a universe

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
all together it adds up to a universe
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.050
all together it adds up to a universe
with more stars than most of us can

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
with more stars than most of us can
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.780
with more stars than most of us can
imagine how fast is space for an example

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790
imagine how fast is space for an example
 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.870
imagine how fast is space for an example
that might make sense come to the beach

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880
that might make sense come to the beach
 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.270
that might make sense come to the beach
think of the grains of sand and every

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
think of the grains of sand and every
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.430
think of the grains of sand and every
handful I pick up I've got more than 8

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440
handful I pick up I've got more than 8
 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.640
handful I pick up I've got more than 8
million grains of sand

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650
 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.740
and all the planet we think there one

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750
and all the planet we think there one
 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.450
and all the planet we think there one
quadrillion grains of sand

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460
 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.219
but there's still nothing compared to

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229
but there's still nothing compared to
 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.990
but there's still nothing compared to
space we know now that there are about

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000
space we know now that there are about
 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.770
space we know now that there are about
200 billion galaxies in each galaxy it's

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780
200 billion galaxies in each galaxy it's
 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.920
200 billion galaxies in each galaxy it's
home to 200 billion stars so it really

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930
home to 200 billion stars so it really
 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.460
home to 200 billion stars so it really
is true the space is more vast with more

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470
is true the space is more vast with more
 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.010
is true the space is more vast with more
stars than there are grains of sand on

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020
stars than there are grains of sand on
 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.660
stars than there are grains of sand on
all the beaches of planet Earth

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670
all the beaches of planet Earth
 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.750
all the beaches of planet Earth
that's amazing
