00:00:14.668 --> 00:00:16.778
A couple of years ago I started using Twitter,

00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:19.884
and one of the things that really charmed me about Twitter

00:00:19.884 --> 00:00:22.097
is that people would wake up in the morning

00:00:22.097 --> 00:00:24.356
and they would say, "Good morning!"

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:25.410
which I thought,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.523
I'm a Canadian,

00:00:26.523 --> 00:00:27.331
so I was a little bit,

00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:29.100
I liked that politeness.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.663
And so, I'm also a giant nerd,

00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:33.080
and so I wrote a computer program

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.501
that would record 24 hours of everybody on Twitter

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:37.825
saying, "Good morning!"

00:00:37.825 --> 00:00:40.038
And then I asked myself my favorite question,

00:00:40.038 --> 00:00:41.677
"What would that look like?"

00:00:41.677 --> 00:00:44.982
Well, as it turns out, I think it would look something like this.

00:00:44.982 --> 00:00:47.045
Right, so we'd see this wave of people

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:50.490
saying, "Good morning!" across the world as they wake up.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.284
Now the green people, these are people that wake up

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.359
at around 8 o'clock in the morning,

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:57.455
Who wakes up at 8 o'clock or says, "Good morning!" at 8?

00:00:57.455 --> 00:00:58.314
And the orange people,

00:00:58.314 --> 00:01:01.893
they say, "Good morning!" around 9.

00:01:01.906 --> 00:01:04.751
And the red people, they say, "Good morning!" around 10.

00:01:04.751 --> 00:01:08.062
Yeah, more at 10's than, more at 10's than 8's.

00:01:08.062 --> 00:01:09.189
And actually if you look at this map,

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.122
we can learn a little bit about how people wake up

00:01:11.122 --> 00:01:12.397
in different parts of the world.

00:01:12.397 --> 00:01:13.742
People on the West Coast, for example,

00:01:13.742 --> 00:01:15.095
they wake up a little bit later

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:18.060
than those people on the East Coast.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.418
But that's not all that people say on Twitter, right?

00:01:20.418 --> 00:01:22.758
We also get these really important tweets, like,

00:01:22.758 --> 00:01:27.627
"I just landed in Orlando!! [plane sign, plane sign]"

00:01:27.627 --> 00:01:31.145
Or, or, "I just landed in Texas [exclamation point]!"

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:33.419
Or "I just landed in Honduras!"

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:35.559
These lists, they go on and on and on,

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:37.432
all these people, right?

00:01:37.432 --> 00:01:40.169
So, on the outside, these people are just telling us

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:42.538
something about how they're traveling.

00:01:42.538 --> 00:01:44.340
But we know the truth, don't we?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.241
These people are show-offs!

00:01:46.241 --> 00:01:50.435
They are showing off that they're in Cape Town and I'm not.

00:01:50.435 --> 00:01:53.087
So I thought, how can we take this vanity

00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:54.883
and turn it into utility?

00:01:54.883 --> 00:01:58.304
So using a similar approach that I did with "Good morning,"

00:01:58.304 --> 00:02:00.563
I mapped all those people's trips

00:02:00.563 --> 00:02:02.655
because I know where they're landing,

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:03.725
they just told me,

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:04.956
and I know where they live

00:02:04.956 --> 00:02:08.968
because they share that information on their Twitter profile.

00:02:08.968 --> 00:02:12.300
So what I'm able to do with 36 hours of Twitter

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.221
is create a model of how people are traveling

00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:18.239
around the world during that 36 hours.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.725
And this is kind of a prototype

00:02:19.725 --> 00:02:22.631
because I think if we listen to everybody

00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:25.389
on Twitter and Facebook and the rest of our social media,

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.278
we'd actually get a pretty clear picture

00:02:27.278 --> 00:02:30.518
of how people are traveling from one place to the other,

00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:33.688
which is actually turns out to be a very useful thing for scientists,

00:02:33.688 --> 00:02:37.426
particularly those who are studying how disease is spread.

00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:39.613
So, I work upstairs in the New York Times,

00:02:39.613 --> 00:02:40.722
and for the last two years,

00:02:40.722 --> 00:02:42.823
we've been working on a project called, "Cascade,"

00:02:42.823 --> 00:02:45.472
which in some ways is kind of similar to this one.

00:02:45.472 --> 00:02:47.694
But instead of modeling how people move,

00:02:47.694 --> 00:02:49.862
we're modeling how people talk.

00:02:49.862 --> 00:02:53.040
We're looking at what does a discussion look like.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.893
Well, here's an example.

00:02:54.893 --> 00:02:57.708
This is a discussion around an article called,

00:02:57.708 --> 00:02:59.717
"The Island Where People Forget to Die".

00:02:59.717 --> 00:03:01.359
It's about an island in Greece where people live

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.429
a really, really, really, really, really, really long time.

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:05.492
And what we're seeing here

00:03:05.492 --> 00:03:07.414
is we're seeing a conversation that's stemming

00:03:07.414 --> 00:03:10.452
from that first tweet down in the bottom, left-hand corner.

00:03:10.452 --> 00:03:12.965
So we get to see the scope of this conversation

00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:15.133
over about 9 hours right now,

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:17.483
we're going to creep up to 12 hours here in a second.

00:03:17.483 --> 00:03:19.802
But, we can also see what that conversation

00:03:19.802 --> 00:03:21.604
looks like in three dimensions.

00:03:21.604 --> 00:03:24.908
And that three-dimensional view is actually much more useful for us.

00:03:24.908 --> 00:03:26.197
As humans, we are really used to things

00:03:26.197 --> 00:03:28.099
that are structured as three dimensions.

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.778
So, we can look at those little off-shoots of conversation,

00:03:30.778 --> 00:03:33.340
we can find out what exactly happened.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.243
And this is an interactive, exploratory tool

00:03:35.243 --> 00:03:37.777
so we can go through every step in the conversation.

00:03:37.777 --> 00:03:39.143
We can look at who the people were,

00:03:39.143 --> 00:03:40.203
what they said,

00:03:40.203 --> 00:03:41.312
how old they are,

00:03:41.312 --> 00:03:42.479
where they live,

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.471
who follows them,

00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:45.950
and so on, and so on, and so on.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.832
So, the Times creates about 6,500 pieces of content every month,

00:03:50.832 --> 00:03:52.490
and we can model every single one

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.222
of the conversations that happen around them.

00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:55.670
And they look somewhat different.

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.837
Depending on the story

00:03:56.837 --> 00:03:59.564
and depending on how fast people are talking about it

00:03:59.564 --> 00:04:01.399
and how far the conversation spreads,

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:05.617
these structures, which I call these conversational architectures,

00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:08.072
end up looking different.

00:04:08.072 --> 00:04:10.174
So, these projects that I've shown you,

00:04:10.174 --> 00:04:12.538
I think they all involve the same thing:

00:04:12.538 --> 00:04:14.613
we can take small pieces of data

00:04:14.613 --> 00:04:16.178
and by putting them together,

00:04:16.178 --> 00:04:18.414
we can generate more value,

00:04:18.414 --> 00:04:20.517
we can do more exciting things with them.

00:04:20.517 --> 00:04:22.721
But so far we've only talked about Twitter, right?

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:24.686
And Twitter isn't all the data.

00:04:24.686 --> 00:04:25.888
We learned a moment ago

00:04:25.888 --> 00:04:27.136
that there is tons and tons,

00:04:27.136 --> 00:04:29.360
tons more data out there.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.449
And specifically, I want you to think about one type of data

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.391
because all of you guys,

00:04:34.391 --> 00:04:35.988
everybody in this audience, we,

00:04:35.988 --> 00:04:37.628
we, me as well,

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.174
are data-making machines.

00:04:40.174 --> 00:04:42.708
We are producing data all the time.

00:04:42.708 --> 00:04:44.913
Every single one of us, we're producing data.

00:04:44.913 --> 00:04:47.220
Somebody else, though, is storing that data.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.758
Usually we put our trust into companies to store that data,

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:55.290
but what I want to suggest here

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.064
is that rather than putting our trust

00:04:57.064 --> 00:04:58.799
in companies to store that data,

00:04:58.799 --> 00:05:00.487
we should put the trust in ourselves

00:05:00.487 --> 00:05:02.406
because we actually own that data.

00:05:02.406 --> 00:05:04.273
Right, that is something we should remember.

00:05:04.273 --> 00:05:07.200
Everything that someone else measures about you,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.311
you actually own.

00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:10.478
So, it's my hope,

00:05:10.478 --> 00:05:12.668
maybe because I'm a Canadian,

00:05:12.668 --> 00:05:14.399
that all of us can come together

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:18.185
with this really valuable data that we've been storing,

00:05:18.185 --> 00:05:21.063
and we can collectively launch that data

00:05:21.063 --> 00:05:23.904
toward some of the world's most difficulty problems

00:05:23.904 --> 00:05:27.019
because big data can solve big problems,

00:05:27.019 --> 00:05:28.654
but I think it can do it the best

00:05:28.654 --> 00:05:31.524
if it's all of us who are in control.

00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:33.026
Thank you.
