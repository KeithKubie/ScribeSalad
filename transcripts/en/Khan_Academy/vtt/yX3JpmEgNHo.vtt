00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.180
Part d, find the average rate of change of
f on the interval from x is greater than

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.590
or equal, negative four is less than or
equal

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.100
to x, which is less than or equal to
three.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.920
So really the interval that they've
depicted right over here.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.360
And then they say there's no point c
between in that interval for

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.350
which f prime of c is equal to the average
rate of change.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.490
Explain why the statement does not
contradict the Mean Value theorem.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.620
Fascinating.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.840
Alright.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.520
Let's do this first part first.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.730
The average rate of change of f on the
interval.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.270
Sounds like a very fancy thing, but the
average rate of change on the interval

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.492
is really just a slope of the line that
connects the end points of the interval.

00:00:38.492 --> 00:00:41.060
So these, this right over here, those are
the end

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.990
points, and let's figure out the slope of
that line.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.630
So, going we, going from this point to
that point, our change

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.820
in x, we do this in a color that you're
likely to see.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.430
Our change in x over here, our change in
x, change in x,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.820
is equal to 7.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.920
And you can get that by taking 3 minus
negative 4 or

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.670
you could literally just count, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.060
That's our change in x.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.350
And our change in y, when we, when we run
over 7, when we go 7

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.540
to the right, our change in y, our change
in y is equal to negative 2.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.780
We went from negative 1 to negative 3 is
equal to negative 2.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.580
So, slope, slope, which is change in y
over change in x, rise over run.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.080
Is equal to 7 over negative 2, or well
actually let me, the other way around.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.230
The change in y is negative 2 over 7.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.040
So negative two 7s and that's all it is.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.200
Now you could, you could kind of.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.620
Think of it in, in, kind of a more

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.050
fancy sense, but you're gonna get the
exact same answer

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.110
if you said, oh well look, you know, the
average,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.170
the average rate of change of f on the
interval.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.560
Well, the rate of change of f is f prime,
f prime of x.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.600
That is the rate of change of f at any
point x.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.190
And so if you want to find the average
value

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.090
of this over the interval, you would
integrate it from

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.680
our starting point, from negative 4 to 3
dx, and

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.900
then you would divide it by your change in
x.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.930
So then you would divide it by, you would
have it over 1 over 7.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.350
Over 1 over 7.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.450
But then this, this part right over here
is just going to

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.130
be the same thing as f of 3 minus f of 4.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.700
And then this over here you have a 7 in
the denominator.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.290
So this is really just your change in x.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.268
This is your change in x which is, which
was by definition

00:02:35.268 --> 00:02:38.940
or how we, how we actually set up this
average right over here.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.020
And this over here is really just your
change in y.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.110
So it really is just a slope between the
end points.

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.680
So, we did the first part.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.840
Our average rate of change of f on the
interval is negative two 7s.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.910
And then let's think about the second
part.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.290
You see there is no point c in that
interval.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.440
For which f prime of c is equal to the
average rate of change.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.980
Explain why this statement does not
contradict the Mean Value Theorem.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.520
So the Mean Value Theorem, just as a
little bit of a review, as a

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.050
little bit of review, it says that if we
have some type of an interval.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.650
If you have an interval.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.590
So, let me draw some axes right over here.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.550
If you have an interval.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.230
Let me draw an interval like this.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.720
And over that interval you have a
differentiable function.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.800
You have a differentiable function, so
maybe my function looks like this.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.470
It says at least, there is at least one
point c on that interval

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.830
where the derivative at that point c is
equal to the average rate of change.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.500
So the way I've drawn it right over here,
the average rate of

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.440
change of this function, I'll do it in
magenta, is this right over here.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.100
And the Mean Value Theorem says, is it, if
this

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.210
is deferentiable, there's at least one
point c in this interval.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:52.630
Where I have the same slope.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.390
Where the tangent line has the same slope.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.800
Where the derivative is the same as the
slope, as that average slope.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.450
And you can see here, is probably right
over here you have

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.330
one of those points and actually we
probably have multiple of them.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.210
We probably have another point right over
here that's

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.600
like that, and then another point there
that's like that.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.680
And if you think about it, it's kind of.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.620
It's kind of intuitive that at some point,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.700
you know, here we're, we obviously have a
larger

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.800
slope and over we have a smaller slope and

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.269
since our, since it's differentialable,
our derivative is continuous.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.410
So at some point, at some point the slope

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.150
has to get to exactly what the average
slope is.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.320
Now, let's think about our little

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.540
conundrum with this question right over
here.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.510
Why is there not a point c for which f

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.020
prime of c is equal to the average rate of
change?

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.020
You can even verify that for yourself
because

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.470
from negative 4 to 0 our slope is
positive.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.460
We have a positive slope here, and then
the slope just jumps down to negative 2.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.690
It just jumps down to negative 2 which is
a much more negative slope than this.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.970
So, it never goes to negative 2 7s, and
the reason is that.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.440
This is not a differentiable function at x
is equal to 0.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.600
It is not differentiable at x equals 0.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.920
Our slope jumps here and because it's

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.140
not differentiable the Mean Value theorem
doesn't apply.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.010
Now you can imagine if this was
differentiable, if this

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.400
did have a continuous derivative, then you
would find a point.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.680
So if this looks something like this
instead, I'll continue it over here.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.540
If it looks something like this instead

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.020
where it was, it had a continuous
derivative

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.970
then there would be a point where the
slope was the same as the average slope.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.310
Maybe it would have been right over there.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.880
So it's really because, it's really
because

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.040
f is not differentiable over the entire
interval.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.380
It does not have a continuous derivative.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.630
The derivative jumps from a, from a
positive value approaching 0 here

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:42.400
and it jumps just straight down to
negative 2 right over here.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.839
It doesn't go continuously through all the
values in between.
