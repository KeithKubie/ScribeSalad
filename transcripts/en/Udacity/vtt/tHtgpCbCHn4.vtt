Would you say there's a steep
learning curve after learning one

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.580
to moving on to your 2nd or do concepts
kind of crossover between that?

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.165
&gt;&gt; Yeah concepts definitely crossover
because all the Frameworks are trying to

00:00:10.165 --> 00:00:11.380
accomplish the same thing.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.500
So if you figure out to do
one thing in one Framework,

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.440
when comparing it to the next
Framework you can be like okay,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.130
I know in Angular, I can do x,
y, and z like this.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.890
And if you know this Framework
the first thing you look for

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.790
is like okay, how do I do x, y,
and z in this Framework now?

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.520
And it's pretty straightforward and
luckily these Frameworks are very

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.460
competitive so
they try to compete with each other.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.530
So they set their
documentation up like that.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.740
Like hey coming from Android check it
out this is how you do this in Angular.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.480
Or hey coming from React,
this is how you do it in this Framework.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.900
So you can definitely bring stuff over
and I know from experience that works

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.740
because I actually tried to learn to
React while I was learning Angular and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.030
I just didn't get it.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.790
I was like this is kind of crazy.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.080
But after I mastered Angular I
went back to React and

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.530
I built a couple apps in a day.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.240
So it was pretty straightforward
after that once you learn one they're

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.065
all just the same.

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:55.730
because it's not so much the syntax and
how their Framework does it,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.870
it's what the Framework
is trying to accomplish.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.720
And you notice that all Frameworks
are trying to accomplish the same thing.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.250
So once you know that you're good.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.910
&gt;&gt; Okay so
what is some advice that you have for

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.730
students just diving into
the world of Frameworks?

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.660
&gt;&gt; Like I said there's
two steps of learning.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.430
There's the practical side where
you just you know how to use it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.630
very very well.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.840
You might not know what those
methods and functions and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.440
objects as you interact are doing,
but you know the result of them so

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.780
you know how to use it very well.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990
So I would say,
focus on that practical side.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.080
A lot of people want to
dive right in and

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.040
try to understand how all of it's
working, the internals and stuff.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.895
It's actually very scary if you do
it that way, especially Angular.

00:01:28.895 --> 00:01:30.640
Angular is one of the scariest
Frameworks on the inside.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.650
It is almost like magic, at first.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.010
So I would not recommend trying to
figure out how Angular works internally,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.920
at least, not yet.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.300
But instead, get very very good at using
Angular, the tools that it provides,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.590
and the only way to do that
is just build a lot of stuff.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.260
Start off with a small app that
teaches you one example and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.800
then eventually go up to bigger
apps that maybe work with servers.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.810
And eventually you've built four or
five, six things that you can say,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.990
hey, I've learned all
the concepts of Angular and

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.030
you feel pretty comfortable using it.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.870
And once you get there,
then maybe if you're up for

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.540
it, jump into how it actually works
on the inside which is only going to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.910
enhance your skills on
the practical side.
