00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.260
The School of Life had to open in Germany.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.940
There were so many reasons:

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.760
Because Germany invented our favourite word:

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.140
"World-weariness"

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.180
And our next favourite word:

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.440
"Tired of Life"

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.000
Because a single country doesn’t produce the greatest philosophers on earth by mistake.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.040
Schopenhauer

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.020
Nietzsche

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.800
Kant

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.420
Hegel and Heidegger

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.820
were not a coincidence.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.420
Because Berlin, where our branch is located,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.800
is the most attractively liveable city in Europe.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.060
Because we found a team of the very best thinkers and teachers

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.640
and an equally nice location.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.680
Because philosophy just sounds better in German.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.440
Here is a lovely one from Nietzsche:

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.820
"No winner believes in luck."

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.740
We also like this one from Schopenhauer:

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:10.740
"All our unhappiness comes from our inability to be alone."

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.040
Because Germans think nothing of chatting over large themes

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.160
that other nationalities would think too heavy or big.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.440
It’s normal to ask what someone’s Weltanschauung might be.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.020
Germans also have a word:

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.540
Abgrundanziehung = Abyss-Attraction

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.760
which is as profound as it is dark.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.840
Because Germany produced our favourite painter:

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.900
Caspar David Friedrich

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.200
Because The School of Life’s HQ is steps away from some of the most delicious schnitzel in the world

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.480
Because Berlin is THE place to go and see our favourite old architect

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.900
Karl Friedrich Schinkel

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.980
can admire

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.000
Because Germany is the land not first and foremost of cars or high tech engineering,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.660
but of philosophy,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.000
intellectual exploration

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.660
and friendship.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.160
Please come to see us at our new HQ,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.740
located in Prenzlauer Berg, Lychener Str. 7, 10437 Berlin.
