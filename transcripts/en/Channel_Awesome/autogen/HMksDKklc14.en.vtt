creativity but I realize uh when you

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:01.340
creativity but I realize uh when you
 

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.000
creativity but I realize uh when you
have the speed of that going when you're

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.010
have the speed of that going when you're
 

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.940
have the speed of that going when you're
constantly moving at that speed gravity

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:06.950
constantly moving at that speed gravity
 

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.710
constantly moving at that speed gravity

like them sliding down the cliff uh so

00:28:09.370 --> 00:28:09.380
like them sliding down the cliff uh so
 

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:11.350
like them sliding down the cliff uh so
anytime there's just they're straight on

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360
anytime there's just they're straight on
 

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.419
anytime there's just they're straight on
fighting it's not very interesting but

00:28:13.419 --> 00:28:13.429
fighting it's not very interesting but
 

00:28:13.429 --> 00:28:15.159
fighting it's not very interesting but
anytime they have a different scenario

00:28:15.159 --> 00:28:15.169
anytime they have a different scenario
 

00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:17.370

doing kung fu that'd be cool because Ava

00:28:22.779 --> 00:28:22.789
doing kung fu that'd be cool because Ava
 

00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:24.190
doing kung fu that'd be cool because Ava
put a lot of work and effort into it and

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:24.200
put a lot of work and effort into it and
 

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:27.310
put a lot of work and effort into it and
B it's really there it's amazing to

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:27.320

watch it because you know it's not an
 

00:28:29.179 --> 00:28:31.389
watch it because you know it's not an
illusion they're really fighting and

00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399
illusion they're really fighting and
 

00:28:31.399 --> 00:28:33.370

you're watching a cartoon when you see

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:39.200
you're watching a cartoon when you see
 

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.169
you're watching a cartoon when you see
this it's not there and you know it's

00:28:41.169 --> 00:28:41.179
this it's not there and you know it's
 

00:28:41.179 --> 00:28:44.230
this it's not there and you know it's
not there so you have to make up for

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240
not there so you have to make up for
 

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:46.120
not there so you have to make up for
that by giving creative scenarios and

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.130
that by giving creative scenarios and
 

00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:48.639
that by giving creative scenarios and
the cliff was a creative scenario and it

00:28:48.639 --> 00:28:48.649
the cliff was a creative scenario and it
 

00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:51.519
the cliff was a creative scenario and it
was so creative that the illusion works

00:28:51.519 --> 00:28:51.529
was so creative that the illusion works
 

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:52.659
was so creative that the illusion works
better because they're constantly going

00:28:52.659 --> 00:28:52.669
better because they're constantly going
 

00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:54.320
better because they're constantly going
downhill so it can mask

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:54.330
downhill so it can mask
 

00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.840
downhill so it can mask
ah the fact that they don't have the

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:56.850
ah the fact that they don't have the
 

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:59.380
ah the fact that they don't have the
weight down and they don't have the

00:28:59.380 --> 00:28:59.390
weight down and they don't have the
 

00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:04.190
weight down and they don't have the
gravity down of it so the action for the

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200
gravity down of it so the action for the
 

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:08.600
gravity down of it so the action for the
most part is very boring but there's one

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:08.610
