00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.169
- Let me show you,

00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:05.687
why this Bangkok street
food stall is so famous.

00:00:05.687 --> 00:00:08.642
Look at this food, it looks unbelievable,

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.836
and the portion sizes are huge.

00:00:10.836 --> 00:00:13.253
It looks absolutely stunning.

00:00:16.487 --> 00:00:20.154
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.467
Micah, is your mouth
watering for some crab?

00:00:27.655 --> 00:00:28.667
I think it is.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:29.500
Hey everyone,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.991
it's Mark Wiens in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:33.588
We are on our way to go eat at this

00:00:33.588 --> 00:00:35.701
awesome-looking street-food stall.

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:37.786
Ying, what's the name of the stall?

00:00:37.786 --> 00:00:39.466
- Nhong Rim Klong.

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.144
- Nhong Rim Klong.
- Aha.

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:43.977
- OK, that's the name.

00:00:44.826 --> 00:00:47.851
This place has been getting very popular,

00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:51.202
and has been really shared a
lot on social media, lately,

00:00:51.202 --> 00:00:54.238
in Bangkok and in Thailand.

00:00:54.238 --> 00:00:57.121
And, you will see that
the food looks awesome,

00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:00.859
and so I'm very excited
to go check it out, today.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.682
- [Ying] He looking at microphone, Mark.

00:01:02.682 --> 00:01:03.697
- [Mark] He's looking at your what?

00:01:03.697 --> 00:01:04.530
- [Ying] Microphone.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.536
- [Mark] The microphone?

00:01:05.536 --> 00:01:06.486
- [Ying] Yeah.

00:01:06.486 --> 00:01:10.653
(playfully talks in foreign language)

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:14.782
(upbeat techno music)

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:31.175
- We made it to Ekkamai,

00:01:31.175 --> 00:01:33.574
that wasn't too bad of a drive.

00:01:33.574 --> 00:01:35.594
And, what soi is it on, Ying?

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:36.866
- [Ying] 21.

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:38.433
- 21.

00:01:38.433 --> 00:01:42.183
OK, so we gotta go down
the street to Soi 21.

00:01:43.467 --> 00:01:46.080
I'm not sure exactly where we'll park,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.975
but we'll try to find a
parking, and then walk there.

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:51.142
We made it to Soi 21, and,

00:01:51.983 --> 00:01:54.660
it's gonna be a very, much better idea

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.623
to take public transportation,
take a taxi here.

00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:00.844
Parking was a bit of a mission impossible,

00:02:00.844 --> 00:02:02.761
but we finally made it.

00:02:12.822 --> 00:02:16.237
We made it to the
restaurant, Micah is here.

00:02:16.237 --> 00:02:19.503
It is situated next to a canal,

00:02:19.503 --> 00:02:22.498
which is not the cleanest
canal that I've ever seen.

00:02:22.498 --> 00:02:24.864
And then they are cooking right there,

00:02:24.864 --> 00:02:26.518
and they have a few tables set up,

00:02:26.518 --> 00:02:28.751
and then I've also heard
that a lot of people

00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:29.848
order takeaway.

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.582
They hire motorbike drivers to come here,

00:02:31.582 --> 00:02:33.956
and wait in line to place their orders.

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:37.419
But luckily we got here pretty
early, it's about 10:45 a.m.

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:39.182
before the main lunch rush.

00:02:39.182 --> 00:02:40.932
And Ying is,

00:02:41.931 --> 00:02:44.365
let's zoom in on Ying.

00:02:44.365 --> 00:02:47.424
She is right there,

00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:48.747
putting in our order.

00:02:48.747 --> 00:02:50.752
Even though there's not a
lot of people sitting here,

00:02:50.752 --> 00:02:52.255
a lot of people pre-order,

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.436
and so they got a lot of orders to make.

00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:56.960
But she is just flying on that wok,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.999
you can here the wok
clanking, and actually,

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.592
this is just an awesome street-food stall.

00:03:02.592 --> 00:03:05.067
It is literally, they are,

00:03:05.067 --> 00:03:07.542
the restaurant and all
the cooking in the kitchen

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:11.116
is on top of a bridge that
goes across the canal.

00:03:11.116 --> 00:03:15.283
And then, the sink is absolutely classic.

00:03:16.314 --> 00:03:20.314
The sink just runs straight
into the canal, and,

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:24.896
along with the smell of the canal,

00:03:24.896 --> 00:03:27.170
it's overpowered by the wonderful smell

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.824
of frying garlic and
chilies, and that crab,

00:03:30.824 --> 00:03:33.008
and all the seafood that she's cooking.

00:03:33.008 --> 00:03:35.468
They are known here especially
for their seafood dishes,

00:03:35.468 --> 00:03:39.192
especially their crab, shell less crab,

00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:42.492
and that is an entire
wok-full of shell less crab,

00:03:42.492 --> 00:03:46.225
and she just added a bunch
of eggs, and so many, good.

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:49.006
If you just stand here, that aroma,

00:03:49.006 --> 00:03:51.850
pouring out of the wok is just beautiful,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.109
and she is an amazing chef.

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:55.430
She's even talking on the cellphone,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.158
multitasking as she's cooking.

00:03:58.158 --> 00:03:59.825
Some serious skills.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.477
(chef talking on cellphone)

00:04:45.455 --> 00:04:48.108
Micah's sleeping through
this entire experience.

00:04:48.108 --> 00:04:49.191
Hello, Micah.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.537
(Ying speaking in foreign language)

00:05:01.908 --> 00:05:05.945
That was about a 45 minute
wait, but let me show you

00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:10.122
why this Bangkok street-food
stall is so famous.

00:05:10.122 --> 00:05:13.278
Look at this food, it looks unbelievable,

00:05:13.278 --> 00:05:15.861
and the portion sizes are huge.

00:05:17.414 --> 00:05:19.873
Even photos do not do justice,

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:22.728
how beautiful this food is here.

00:05:22.728 --> 00:05:24.351
Normally, if Ying and I go to eat

00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:25.789
at a street-food restaurant like this,

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.075
we can easily eat like 4 to 8 dishes,

00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:31.931
between the two of us, so
we order 4 dishes here.

00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:33.395
These are monstrous.

00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:35.967
And just the ingredients that they use.

00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:39.602
At the front over here,
this one is tom yum talay.

00:05:39.602 --> 00:05:41.983
It's a mixture of seafood tom yum.

00:05:41.983 --> 00:05:44.369
I love how they put on
just a whole handful of

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:45.711
just not even chopped cilantro,

00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:49.730
just whole cilantro and
dried fried chilies,

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:51.287
which are just crushed on top.

00:05:51.287 --> 00:05:52.776
That is looking wonderful.

00:05:52.776 --> 00:05:56.418
Let me just go ahead and taste that broth.

00:05:56.418 --> 00:05:57.760
Ying has been tasting the broth,

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.010
and she says it is awesome.

00:06:07.515 --> 00:06:09.557
That is so sour,

00:06:09.557 --> 00:06:12.640
it will almost make your eyes squint.

00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:17.578
The depth of seafoody flavor
in there is awesome as well,

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.564
and you can taste the
dried chilies in there,

00:06:19.564 --> 00:06:22.383
as well as a refreshing cilantro taste.

00:06:22.383 --> 00:06:24.918
This is the smallest plate
of food we have here,

00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:26.371
and this one is goong tod kratiem,

00:06:26.371 --> 00:06:28.613
which is shrimp fried with garlic.

00:06:28.613 --> 00:06:29.604
It is a little bit oily,

00:06:29.604 --> 00:06:31.218
there's a little bit of a pool of oil,

00:06:31.218 --> 00:06:35.139
but then it's just topped
with a bunch of crispy garlic,

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:37.658
and these are kinda curled up.

00:06:37.658 --> 00:06:41.491
Let me pick up all of
these guys onto my rice.

00:06:42.691 --> 00:06:44.446
You can smell that garlic.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.550
What I like to do to take of the tails,

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.243
is kind of poke it with my fork,

00:06:48.243 --> 00:06:50.532
and then go in with my
spoon at the very end there,

00:06:50.532 --> 00:06:53.139
so that hopefully it releases.

00:06:53.139 --> 00:06:55.073
Oh no, that didn't work at all.

00:06:55.073 --> 00:06:57.740
OK, there we go. Slide that off.

00:07:08.142 --> 00:07:12.225
That entire shrimp just
tasted like fried garlic.

00:07:13.936 --> 00:07:17.375
And it's so meaty and a little bit oily,

00:07:17.375 --> 00:07:19.035
but really, really fragrant.

00:07:19.035 --> 00:07:22.284
Yeah, that shrimp is also like a,

00:07:22.284 --> 00:07:24.351
it's very muscular indeed.

00:07:24.351 --> 00:07:26.415
This is one of their
signature dishes here.

00:07:26.415 --> 00:07:29.278
It's called 'kahla pli
pad napla lea neux pu',

00:07:29.278 --> 00:07:32.803
and it's cabbage on the
bottom which she stir-fried,

00:07:32.803 --> 00:07:35.329
and then there is some kind of

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:39.661
signature mixture of crab meat,

00:07:39.661 --> 00:07:43.205
plus maybe egg, plus,
I'm not sure what else,

00:07:43.205 --> 00:07:44.955
but this is just,

00:07:46.121 --> 00:07:47.909
what a beautiful pile of food this is.

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:50.959
And, I think maybe get some of this crab,

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:53.474
with a piece of the cabbage.

00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:55.219
And these are just
whole sheets of cabbage,

00:07:55.219 --> 00:07:56.302
look at that.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.750
I think you just gotta
go in for the whole bite.

00:08:10.784 --> 00:08:13.195
That's like half-cooked scrambled eggs,

00:08:13.195 --> 00:08:16.630
with little nuggets of
crab meat, mixed all in,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.914
and then with crisp,
lightly wilted cabbage,

00:08:19.914 --> 00:08:22.331
to give it a fresh crispness.

00:08:24.053 --> 00:08:28.493
It's another spicy dish, or
a very really flavorful dish,

00:08:28.493 --> 00:08:31.287
but it's so rich and so good.

00:08:31.287 --> 00:08:33.174
Oh, that egg and crab.

00:08:33.174 --> 00:08:34.919
And then the final dish that we ordered,

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.510
and this dish looks like
it's gonna be my favorite,

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:38.604
even from just looking at it,

00:08:38.604 --> 00:08:40.591
is Pad Khi Mao Buu,

00:08:40.591 --> 00:08:44.758
and 'pad khi mao' is a
pretty well-known Thai dish.

00:08:45.943 --> 00:08:50.115
It translates to "drunken
stir-fried crab",

00:08:50.115 --> 00:08:53.477
and there is just massive
ingredients in here.

00:08:53.477 --> 00:08:54.646
You can see all of the crab meat,

00:08:54.646 --> 00:08:56.566
there's basil in here,
there's Kaffir lime leaves,

00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:59.203
there are egg plant, there are shallots,

00:08:59.203 --> 00:09:00.593
maybe those are onions,

00:09:00.593 --> 00:09:03.256
there's just chilies
mixed in this whole dish,

00:09:03.256 --> 00:09:06.547
and it looks absolutely stunning.

00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:08.875
Is there anything else
down here that I missed?

00:09:08.875 --> 00:09:10.428
It's just a solid plate.

00:09:10.428 --> 00:09:13.324
Oh, lots of slices of
grachai, which is finger root,

00:09:13.324 --> 00:09:15.174
in here as well.

00:09:15.174 --> 00:09:17.091
Put this on to my rice.

00:09:30.118 --> 00:09:32.201
That's the ultimate dish.

00:09:33.926 --> 00:09:38.004
Even like, literally before I even chewed,

00:09:38.004 --> 00:09:39.753
before I even closed my mouth,

00:09:39.753 --> 00:09:41.417
I could taste that sweet basil,

00:09:41.417 --> 00:09:44.033
just overwhelming my mouth.

00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:46.199
And then the grachai, that gingery flavor,

00:09:46.199 --> 00:09:49.902
you've got the nuggets
of stringy, sweet crab,

00:09:49.902 --> 00:09:51.158
and then you can also really taste

00:09:51.158 --> 00:09:52.188
the Kaffir lime leaves in there,

00:09:52.188 --> 00:09:55.105
giving it a citrusy flavor as well.

00:09:56.275 --> 00:09:57.804
OK, moving back over to the Tom Yum,

00:09:57.804 --> 00:09:59.490
I'm gonna mix it up.

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:00.780
Oh, there's fish in here.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.113
Look at that nugget of fish.

00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:15.764
That tom yum is stunning.

00:10:18.878 --> 00:10:21.530
The restaurant is packed
now, all of the seating.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.349
And I found that Micah,

00:10:23.349 --> 00:10:24.932
she starts to get really restless

00:10:24.932 --> 00:10:27.500
when you sit for too long, and this bag,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.709
I have to stand up and eat, but perfect.

00:10:29.709 --> 00:10:33.335
Look at the standing table
they have, perfectly.

00:10:33.335 --> 00:10:36.085
This food is absolutely stunning.

00:10:44.132 --> 00:10:45.726
I am absolutely stuffed right now,

00:10:45.726 --> 00:10:49.258
and I think having Micah on my stomach,

00:10:49.258 --> 00:10:51.510
reduces my stomach space
because he kind of,

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.538
presses against my stomach.

00:10:53.538 --> 00:10:55.779
I've got a little bit left to finish,

00:10:55.779 --> 00:10:59.004
and then we had to take the
fried shrimp with garlic

00:10:59.004 --> 00:11:02.282
and a little bit of
that tom yum back home.

00:11:02.282 --> 00:11:04.755
So Ying is getting takeaway, she's outside

00:11:04.755 --> 00:11:06.599
packing it in a bag at the front there,

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:08.897
cos these portions are gigantic.

00:11:08.897 --> 00:11:11.208
If you come here, I think it looks like,

00:11:11.208 --> 00:11:13.409
you could easily have just one plate,

00:11:13.409 --> 00:11:15.090
order one plate of food,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.680
especially the pad khi mao was gigantic.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:20.316
The other dishes were not as big,

00:11:20.316 --> 00:11:22.542
but you could literally come
here, order pad khi mao,

00:11:22.542 --> 00:11:24.731
and share between two people.

00:11:24.731 --> 00:11:27.729
That was absolutely
sensational if you wanna have

00:11:27.729 --> 00:11:32.207
some awesome street food
crab, giant portions,

00:11:32.207 --> 00:11:35.405
and it's not a cheap street
food stall to eat at.

00:11:35.405 --> 00:11:39.953
You do pay, I think it's
about 200 baht per plate,

00:11:39.953 --> 00:11:43.117
which is five or $6, so it's not cheap,

00:11:43.117 --> 00:11:45.846
but for the ingredients
and the amount of crab

00:11:45.846 --> 00:11:48.853
that you're gonna eat, it is impressive.

00:11:48.853 --> 00:11:52.399
This is an amazing street food stall.

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:55.022
But definitely get here early
because it's packed now,

00:11:55.022 --> 00:11:56.846
and you have to wait in line.

00:11:56.846 --> 00:11:57.988
If you come right at lunch time,

00:11:57.988 --> 00:11:59.644
you gotta wait in line, maybe, they said,

00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:01.975
they were saying 2 hours now to wait.

00:12:01.975 --> 00:12:05.458
So that was a very
successful food journey,

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:07.022

00:12:30.647 --> 00:12:34.314
