00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.900
Pat: Welcome. On behalf of Authors
at Google, it is my privilege

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.367
to introduce philosopher and author
Rebecca Newberger Goldstein today.

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:09.800
Among her many honors,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.133
Ms. Goldstein became a MacArthur
Foundation Fellow in 1996.

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:15.867
In awarding her her prize,

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:20.033
MacArthur Foundation described
her work in the following words,

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:24.166
Rebecca Goldstein is a writer whose
novels and short stories dramatize

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:26.033
the concerns of philosophy

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:30.166
without sacrificing the demands
of imaginative storytelling.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:34.166
Her books tell a compelling story as
they describe with great compassion

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:38.333
and originality the interaction
of mind and heart.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:42.233
In her fiction, the characters
confront problems of faith:

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.567
religious faith and faith in an ability

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:47.300
to comprehend the mysteries
of the physical world

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.333
as complimentary to the moral
and emotional states of being.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:54.300
Goldstein's writings emerge as brilliant
arguments for the belief

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.133
that fiction in our time
may be the best vehicle

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:02.233
for involving readers in questions
of morality and existence.

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:04.834
Currently, she is a research associate
in the Department of Psychology

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:06.567
at Harvard University.

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.700
Ms. Goldstein is here today
to talk about her latest book

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.266
"36 Arguments for the Existence
of God: A Work of Fiction".

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:15.233
Following the talk,

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:17.600
we will have a Q&amp;A session

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.867
and if you can remember our world
audience and speak up that'll help

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:27.467
and now, please join me in welcoming
Rebecca Newberger Goldstein.

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:31.834
[applause]

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:37.834
Rebecca Goldstein: Thank you, Pat,
for the introduction

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:43.266
and thank you who've
come to hear a novelist.

00:01:43.266 --> 00:01:46.900
That means a lot to me actually.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.767
I take novel writing very seriously

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:59.133
and I think that is in fact a way of
exploring deepful, solvable questions.

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:05.800
This particular novel is one that
is devoted to the long standing,

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.266
the latest installment,

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:13.700
of the long standing debate
between religion and science,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.967
faith and reason.

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:23.600
It's about those who call themselves
the new atheists and a lot of others

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.100
and it takes place over the course of one
week with many incursions from the past.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.233
Just like the debates themselves,

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:37.967
the voice of this novel is
often very noisy and raucous

00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:44.200
and there are many large
and assertive personalities.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.066
There is, for example,

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:53.066
an extreme distinguished professor
of Faith, Literature, and Values,

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:54.800
that is his actually title.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.700
Extreme, distinguished,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.834
that was the only way that
the university could lure him there

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:03.700
and he actually constitutes
a department of one.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.166
He is very, very happy about this,

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:07.934
he doesn't have to deal
with any colleagues

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:11.333
and if he calls a faculty meeting,

00:03:11.333 --> 00:03:21.233
he can boycott it and there's a woman
who is a anthropologist

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:26.834
and her Amazonian hunter gatherers
have dubbed her with a word

00:03:26.834 --> 00:03:30.600
that means a whole lot of woman,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.033
and there's a very small
mathematical genius,

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:39.033
mathematical geniuses tend
to populate my fiction.

00:03:39.033 --> 00:03:44.033
This one is the son of a Hasidic rebbe,

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:50.100
that is a kind of very insular sect
of extremely Orthodox Jews

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.300
and the title of rebbe, head honcho,
is hereditary

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.633
so he's destined to be
the rebbe himself someday

00:04:01.633 --> 00:04:04.467
and he is six years old.

00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:09.367
He sees the numbers and
he thinks that they're angels.

00:04:09.367 --> 00:04:12.700
Lots and lots of characters
in this book

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.767
and though it's actually
a very boisterous book,

00:04:15.767 --> 00:04:24.767
it starts very quietly and I'm going to
read to you from the quiet beginning

00:04:24.767 --> 00:04:28.967
from a sort of condensed
version of the first chapter

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:32.433
which is called "The Argument
from the Improbable Self".

00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:36.967
All of the chapters in
there are thirty six of them

00:04:36.967 --> 00:04:41.033
have names like the argument
from something weird.

00:04:41.033 --> 00:04:45.000
The argument from the New York Times
or the argument from dapple things.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.100
There is actually also an appendix
which is non fiction and sets forth;

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:53.734
I think of it as non-fiction,

00:04:53.734 --> 00:04:58.767
it sets forth thirty-six arguments
for the existence of God.

00:04:58.767 --> 00:05:04.667
Some of which are quite common and
some of which my character makes up

00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:10.767
and all the arguments have rebuttals
and they are all laid out in an analytic way

00:05:10.767 --> 00:05:13.834
and with flaws exposed.

00:05:13.834 --> 00:05:16.734
Anyway, I'm going to read to you from

00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:20.400
"The Argument from
the Improbable Self".

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.166
" Something shifted,

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:26.400
something so immense
you could call it the world,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.233
call it the world.

00:05:28.233 --> 00:05:32.166
The world shifted catching
lots of smart people off guard,

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:37.066
churning up issues you had thought had
settled forever beneath the Earth's crust.

00:05:37.066 --> 00:05:39.033
The more sophisticated you are,

00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:41.533
the more annotated your mental life,

00:05:41.533 --> 00:05:44.500
the more taken a back
you are likely to feel,

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.834
seeing what the world's lurch
has brought to light.

00:05:47.834 --> 00:05:52.100
Thrusting up beliefs and desires you had
assumed belonged to an earlier stage

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.200
of human development.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.533
What is this stuff you ask one another
and how can it still be kicking around

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:01.066
given how much we already know?

00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:05.467
It looks like the kind of relics that
archeologists dig up and dust off,

00:06:05.467 --> 00:06:08.834
speculating about the beliefs
that once had animated them

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:11.667
to the best that they can
be reconstructed.

00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:13.100
Gone as they are now,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.033
those thrashings of proto
rationality and mythical,

00:06:17.033 --> 00:06:19.567
magical hypothesizing

00:06:19.567 --> 00:06:21.934
and nearly forgotten.

00:06:21.934 --> 00:06:27.166
Now it's all gone unforgotten and minds
that have better things to think about

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:30.433
have to divert precious
neuronal resources

00:06:30.433 --> 00:06:34.967
to figuring out how to knock
some sense back into the species.

00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:39.066
It's a tiresome proposition having to
take up the work of the Enlightenment

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:40.767
all over again

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:43.166
but it's happened on your watch.

00:06:43.166 --> 00:06:46.100
You ought to have sent up a balloon
now and then to get a read

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.867
on the prevailing cognitive conditions.

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:52.333
The Thinks watching out
for the Think Nots.

00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:57.834
Now you've gone and let the stockpiling
of fallacies reach dangerous levels

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:04.834
and the mass weapons of the illogic are
threatening the survivability of the globe.

00:07:04.834 --> 00:07:07.767
None of this is particularly
good for the world

00:07:07.767 --> 00:07:11.000
but it has been good for Cass Seltzer.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.400
That's what he's thinking
at this moment

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.233
gazing down at the frozen river

00:07:15.233 --> 00:07:19.934
and regarding the improbable
swerve his life has lately taken.

00:07:19.934 --> 00:07:25.200
He's thinking his life has gotten better
because the world has gone bonkers.

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.600
He's thinking zealots proliferate
and Seltzer prospers.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.400
It's 4:00 AM and Cass Seltzer
is standing on Weeks Bridge,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.533
the graceful arc that spans the Charles
River near Harvard University,

00:07:38.533 --> 00:07:40.900
staring down at the river below,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:46.033
which is in the rigor mortis of
late February in New England.

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:49.333
The whole vista is deserted
beyond vacancy,

00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:53.633
deserted in the way of being
inhospitable to human life.

00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:56.467
There's not a car passing
on Memorial Drive,

00:07:56.467 --> 00:08:00.200
and the elegant river dorms
are darkened to silent hulks,

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:06.000
the most hyper kinetic of undergraduates
sedated to purring girls and boys.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.700
It's not like Cass Seltzer to be
out in the middle of an icy night,

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:13.967
lost in thought while losing
sensation in his extremities.

00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:16.533
Excitement had gotten the better of him.

00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:19.700
He had lain in his bed for hours,
mind racing,

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.633
until he gave up and crawled out
from under the luxe comforter

00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:26.600
that his girlfriend Lucinda Mandelbaum
had brought with her

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.300
when she moved in with him recently.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.667
This comforter has pockets
for the hands and feet

00:08:32.667 --> 00:08:37.767
and a softness that's the result of
impregnation with aloe vera.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.900
As a man,
Cass had been skeptical,

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.500
but he's become a begrudging
believer in Lucinda's comforter,

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.633
and in her Tempur Pedic pillow, too,

00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:50.533
suffused with the fragrance
of her coconut shampoo,

00:08:50.533 --> 00:08:53.734
making it all the more remarkable
that he'd forsake his bed

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:57.066
for this no man's stretch
of frigid night.

00:08:57.066 --> 00:08:59.967
Rummaging in the front closet
for some extra protection,

00:08:59.967 --> 00:09:03.000
he had pulled out
a long forgotten item,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.367
the tricolor scarf that
his ex-wife, Pascale,

00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:10.066
had learned to knit for him
during the four months

00:09:10.066 --> 00:09:12.500
when she was recovering from aphasia,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.200
four months that had produced,

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.066
along with other shockers,

00:09:16.066 --> 00:09:20.200
an excessively long French flag
of a wool scarf,

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.333
which he wound seven and
a half times around his neck

00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:28.300
before heading out into the dark
to deal with the rush in his head.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.567
Lucinda's away tonight,

00:09:29.567 --> 00:09:33.100
away for the entire bleak week to come.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.333
Cass is missing Lucinda in his bones,

00:09:36.333 --> 00:09:41.400
missing her in the marrow that's
presently crystallizing into ice.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.033
She's in warmer climes,

00:09:43.033 --> 00:09:45.533
at a conference in Santa Barbara

00:09:45.533 --> 00:09:50.333
on 'Non-Nash Equilibria
in Zero-Sum Games.'

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:55.333
Among these equilibria is one that's
called the 'Mandelbaum Equilibrium,'

00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:59.834
and it's Cass' ambition to have
the Mandelbaum Equilibrium

00:09:59.834 --> 00:10:04.867
mastered by the time he picks her
up from the airport Friday night.

00:10:04.867 --> 00:10:07.433
Technically,
Lucinda's a psychologist,

00:10:07.433 --> 00:10:08.867
like Cass,

00:10:08.867 --> 00:10:11.500
only not like Cass at all.

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:15.367
Her work is so mathematical that
almost no one would suspect it

00:10:15.367 --> 00:10:18.200
has anything to do with mental life.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.800
Cass, on the other hand,

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.333
is about as far away on the continuum as
you can get and still be in the same field.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:30.500
He's so far away that he is
knee-deep in the swampy humanities.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.667
For close to two decades

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:37.266
Cass Seltzer has all but owned
the psychology of religion,

00:10:37.266 --> 00:10:40.533
but only because nobody else wanted it,

00:10:40.533 --> 00:10:42.767
but now things had happened.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:46.333
Fundamental and fundamentalist things,

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:50.734
and religion as a phenomenon
is on everybody's mind.

00:10:50.734 --> 00:10:55.133
And among all the changes that
religion's new towering profile

00:10:55.133 --> 00:10:56.600
has wrought in the world,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.300
which are mostly alarming
if not downright terrifying,

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:05.834
is the transformation in
the life of one Cass Seltzer.

00:11:05.834 --> 00:11:07.300
First had come the book,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.400
which he had entitled The Varieties
of Religious Illusion.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.266
The book had brought Cass
an indecent amount of attention.

00:11:15.266 --> 00:11:16.533
Time Magazine,

00:11:16.533 --> 00:11:19.834
in a cover story on the so called new atheists,

00:11:19.834 --> 00:11:22.367
had singled him out as
the only one among them

00:11:22.367 --> 00:11:26.934
who seemed to have any idea of
what it feels like to be a believer

00:11:26.934 --> 00:11:32.033
and it ended by dubbing him
'the atheist with a soul'.

00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:33.834
Next had come the girl,

00:11:33.834 --> 00:11:37.900
although that designation hardly
does justice to the situation,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.200
not when the situation stands for
the likes of Lucinda Mandelbaum,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.367
known in her world as
'The Goddess of Game Theory.'

00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:48.066
And now, only today,

00:11:48.066 --> 00:11:51.033
as if his cup weren't
already gushing over,

00:11:51.033 --> 00:11:54.633
had come a letter from Harvard,

00:11:54.633 --> 00:11:59.834
laying out its intention of luring him
away from Frankfurter University,

00:11:59.834 --> 00:12:03.367
located in nearby Weedham,
Massachusetts.

00:12:03.367 --> 00:12:09.900
Cass has the letter on him right
now baring the insignia of Veritas,

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.033
zippered into an inside
pocket of his parka,

00:12:13.033 --> 00:12:16.133
insulating him against the cold.

00:12:16.133 --> 00:12:20.333
The night is so frigid that everything
seems to have been stripped bare

00:12:20.333 --> 00:12:22.934
of superfluous existence,

00:12:22.934 --> 00:12:26.300
reduced to the purity of abstraction.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.633
Cass has the distinct impression that
he can see better in the sharpened air,

00:12:30.633 --> 00:12:33.967
and takes off his glasses and
of course can hardly see a thing

00:12:33.967 --> 00:12:36.700
past the nimbus phantom
of his own breath.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.734
But then he stares harder and
it seems that he can see better,

00:12:41.734 --> 00:12:45.166
that the world has slipped
into sharper focus.

00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:48.600
It's only now that he catches
sight of this spectacle

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.467
that the extreme cold has
created in the river blow,

00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:56.133
frozen solid except where its
forced through the three arches

00:12:56.133 --> 00:12:59.033
of the bridges substructure,

00:12:59.033 --> 00:13:04.166
creating an effect that could
reasonably be called sublime,

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:06.266
and in the Kantian sense:

00:13:06.266 --> 00:13:11.700
not cozily beautiful, but touched
by a metaphysical chill.

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:16.066
The quickened water has sculpted
three immense and perfect arches

00:13:16.066 --> 00:13:17.834
into the solid ice,

00:13:17.834 --> 00:13:21.700
soaring fifty or sixty feet to their apices,

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.700
sublime almost as if by design.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.700
Standing dead center on Weeks Bridge,

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.767
in the dead of winter in the dead of night,

00:13:31.767 --> 00:13:35.100
staring down at the sublime formation,

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:40.100
Cass is contemplating the strange
thing that his life has become.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.367
To him.

00:13:41.367 --> 00:13:44.400
His life has become strange to him.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.433
He feels as if he's wearing
somebody else's coat,

00:13:47.433 --> 00:13:50.567
grabbed in a hurry
after a boozy party.

00:13:50.567 --> 00:13:54.300
He's walking around in someone
else's bespoke cashmere

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:57.133
while that guy's got Cass's
hooded parka,

00:13:57.133 --> 00:14:03.300
and only Cass seems to
have noticed the switch.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:11.133
What has happened is that Cass Seltzer
has become an intellectual celebrity.

00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:15.300
He's become famous
for his abstract ideas.

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.100
And not just any old abstract ideas,

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.667
but atheist abstract ideas,

00:14:20.667 --> 00:14:21.834
which makes him,

00:14:21.834 --> 00:14:24.100
according to some of the latest polls,

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:28.934
a spokesperson for the most
distrusted minority in America,

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:34.934
the one that most Americans are least
willing to allow their children to marry.

00:14:34.934 --> 00:14:36.834
This is a fact.

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:41.300
Studies have found that a large
proportion of Americans rate atheists

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:46.533
below Muslims, recent immigrants,
gays, Jews, and Communists

00:14:46.533 --> 00:14:50.533
in quote 'sharing their vision
of America' un-quote.

00:14:50.533 --> 00:14:56.333
Cass Seltzer has become the unlikely
poster boy for this mistrusted group.

00:14:56.333 --> 00:15:02.900
His is a good face for counteracting the
fallacy of equating godlessness with vice.

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:07.166
Cass' fundamental niceness
is written all over him.

00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:09.367
He's got a strong jaw,

00:15:09.367 --> 00:15:12.934
a high ovoid forehead from
which his floppy auburn hair

00:15:12.934 --> 00:15:15.200
is only just slightly receding,

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.400
and the sweetest,

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.333
most earnest smile this side
of Oral Roberts University.

00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:24.600
The atheist with a soul.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.667
Cass always smiles at
the absurdity of the phrase.

00:15:28.667 --> 00:15:31.633
But which is the more absurd element?

00:15:31.633 --> 00:15:34.533
The truth is, and what's
the good of a man contemplating

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:40.200
an inhumanly frozen world at 4 a.m.
if no truth-telling ensues,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:45.400
that Cass is somewhat at a loss
to account for what he's done.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:51.834
How to explain those 36 Arguments for
the Existence of God (see Appendix),

00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:56.533
all of them formally constructed
in the preferred analytic mode,

00:15:56.533 --> 00:16:02.266
premises parading with military precision
and every shirking presupposition

00:16:02.266 --> 00:16:05.967
and sketchy implication
forced out into the open

00:16:05.967 --> 00:16:09.734
and subjected to rigorous inspection.

00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:13.667
Cass had started out with all the standard
arguments for God's existence,

00:16:13.667 --> 00:16:17.233
the ones discussed in philosophy
classes and textbooks:

00:16:17.233 --> 00:16:19.500
The Cosmological Argument (#1),

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.600
The Ontological Argument (#2),

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.834
The Classical Teleological Argument (#3A),

00:16:24.834 --> 00:16:27.667
the arguments from Miracles,
Moral Truths,

00:16:27.667 --> 00:16:32.367
and Mysticism (#11, 16,
and 22, respectively),

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:34.800
Pascal's Wager (#31) ,

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:39.533
and William James' Argument
from Pragmatism (#32).

00:16:39.533 --> 00:16:41.967
He had analyzed the new
batch of arguments

00:16:41.967 --> 00:16:46.200
recently whipped up by the intelligent
design crowd, to wit,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.567
The Argument from Irreducible
Complexity (#3B),

00:16:49.567 --> 00:16:55.100
The Argument from the Paucity
of Benign Mutations (# 3C),

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.300
The Argument from The Original
Replicator (#3D),

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.367
The Argument from The Big Bang (#4),

00:17:01.367 --> 00:17:06.300
The Argument from the Fine-Tuning
of the Physical Constants (#5),

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:11.533
and The Argument from the Hard
Problem of Consciousness (#12).

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:13.567
But he had gone beyond these too,

00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:17.266
attempting to polish up into
genuine arguments

00:17:17.266 --> 00:17:19.867
those religious intuitions and emotions

00:17:19.867 --> 00:17:22.467
that are often powerfully evocative

00:17:22.467 --> 00:17:27.433
but too sub-syllogistic to be regarded
as actual arguments.

00:17:27.433 --> 00:17:30.834
He had tried to capture under
the net of analytic reason

00:17:30.834 --> 00:17:34.600
those fleeting shadows cast
by unseen winged things

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:39.400
darting through the thick foliage
of the religious sensibility.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.767
So, for example,

00:17:40.767 --> 00:17:46.433
he had formulated the Argument
from the Improbable Self (#13).

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:51.834
Struggling to squeeze into precision the
sense of paradox that he knows too well,

00:17:51.834 --> 00:17:56.433
the flailing attempt to calm
the inside outside vertigo

00:17:56.433 --> 00:18:00.166
to which he's given at odd
moments in his life

00:18:00.166 --> 00:18:05.800
but which he can always reliably
bring upon himself by staring too long

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:12.633
at the improbable fact of his being
identical with himself.

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:14.934
If somebody hasn't personally experienced

00:18:14.934 --> 00:18:18.200
this particular kind of
metaphysical seizure

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.367
then it's hard to find the words
to give a sense of what it's like.

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:25.100
Cass had experienced it even as a boy,

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.433
lying in bed and thinking his way into
the sense of the strangeness

00:18:29.433 --> 00:18:33.400
of being just this.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.266
Cass had had the lower bunk bed.

00:18:35.266 --> 00:18:39.400
Both he and Jesse, his younger brother,
had wanted the higher bunk,

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.533
but, as usual,

00:18:40.533 --> 00:18:44.800
Jesse had wanted what he wanted so
much more than Cass had wanted it,

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.533
with a fury of need that was
exhausting just to watch,

00:18:48.533 --> 00:18:50.767
that Cass had let it go.

00:18:50.767 --> 00:18:53.767
Lying there awake on his lower bunk,

00:18:53.767 --> 00:18:59.667
Cass would think about being
himself and not being Jesse.

00:18:59.667 --> 00:19:01.133
There was Jesse,

00:19:01.133 --> 00:19:03.166
and here was Cass.

00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:05.667
But if someone else were
looking at the two of them,

00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:07.033
Jesse there,

00:19:07.033 --> 00:19:08.400
Cass here,

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.200
how could that person tell that he, Cass,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.900
was Cass here and not Jesse there?

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.333
If it got switched on them,

00:19:16.333 --> 00:19:17.734
everything the same about them,

00:19:17.734 --> 00:19:21.934
the body and memories and sense
of self and everything else,

00:19:21.934 --> 00:19:27.133
only now he was Jesse here
and there was Cass there,

00:19:27.133 --> 00:19:29.000
how would anybody know?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.166
How would he know,

00:19:30.166 --> 00:19:31.500
how would Jesse?

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:35.700
Maybe a switch had already happened,
maybe it happened again and again,

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.266
and how could anybody tell?

00:19:38.266 --> 00:19:43.166
The longer he tried to get a fix
on the fact of being Cass here,

00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:46.834
the more the whole idea of
it just got away from him.

00:19:46.834 --> 00:19:48.834
If he tried long enough to grasp it,

00:19:48.834 --> 00:19:52.133
then he could get the fact
of being Cass here

00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:57.333
to just blank out of existence and
then come dribbling weakly back in,

00:19:57.333 --> 00:20:01.934
like a fluorescent fixture
flickering on and off toward death.

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:04.433
He would get the sense of
having been shot out of himself

00:20:04.433 --> 00:20:06.000
and now was someone

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.066
who was regarding his being
Cass Seltzer

00:20:09.066 --> 00:20:12.433
as something like his being
in the sixth grade,

00:20:12.433 --> 00:20:15.700
just something about him
that happened to be true.

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:21.533
Who was that Other that he was who
was regarding his being Cass Seltzer

00:20:21.533 --> 00:20:24.934
as if he didn't have to be Cass Seltzer?

00:20:27.834 --> 00:20:34.400
The sense of giddiness induced by these
exercises could be a bit too overwhelming

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:37.834
for a kid in a lower bunk bed.

00:20:37.834 --> 00:20:41.533
It could be a bit overwhelming still.

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:44.533
'Here I am,' Cass is saying,

00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:50.500
standing on Weeks Bridge and talking
aloud into the sublimely indifferent night.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:56.033
Cass knows he needs to tamp down his
tendencies toward the transcendent.

00:20:56.033 --> 00:20:59.967
It isn't becoming in America's
favorite atheist,

00:20:59.967 --> 00:21:03.233
who is, at this moment,
Cass Seltzer,

00:21:03.233 --> 00:21:05.767
who is, somehow or other,

00:21:05.767 --> 00:21:09.200
just this here.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.400
'Here I am.'

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.533
How can it be that,
of all things,

00:21:13.533 --> 00:21:15.567
one is this thing,

00:21:15.567 --> 00:21:17.934
so that one can say,
astonishingly,

00:21:17.934 --> 00:21:20.600
in the right frame of mind,
it is astonishing,

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.033
with the metaphysical
chill blowing in from afar,

00:21:24.033 --> 00:21:26.867
'Here I am.'

00:21:26.867 --> 00:21:30.500
When you didn't force yourself to
think in formal reconstructions,

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:33.300
when you didn't catch these
moments of ravishments

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.600
under the lens of premises
and conclusions,

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.100
when you didn't impale them
and label them,

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:41.500
like so many splayed butterflies,

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:48.133
bleeding the transcendental
glow right out of them, then what?

00:21:48.133 --> 00:21:52.700
It's even hard at a time like this to resist
the shameful narcissistic appeal

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:57.367
of reasonings like The Argument
from Personal Coincidences (#8)

00:21:57.367 --> 00:22:00.967
and The Argument from
Answered Prayers (#9)

00:22:00.967 --> 00:22:05.233
and The Argument from
A Wonderful Life (#10).

00:22:05.233 --> 00:22:09.734
William James had rebuked the quote
'scroundel logic' un-quote

00:22:09.734 --> 00:22:15.166
that calculates divine provenance from
one's own little goody bag of gains,

00:22:15.166 --> 00:22:18.867
and Cass couldn't agree more
with the spirit of James,

00:22:18.867 --> 00:22:20.567
but here it is,

00:22:20.567 --> 00:22:22.200
his bulging goody bag,

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:26.367
and call him a scoundrel for being
personally grateful to the universe

00:22:26.367 --> 00:22:29.900
when at this same moment that
he is standing on Weeks Bridge

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:33.767
and tossing hosannas out into
the infinite universe,

00:22:33.767 --> 00:22:36.800
there are at this same time
multitudes of others

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.266
whose lives are painfully
constricting with misfortunes

00:22:40.266 --> 00:22:46.233
that are just as arbitrary and undeserved
as his own expansive good luck,

00:22:46.233 --> 00:22:50.000
but Cass Seltzer does feel grateful.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.667
At moments like this could Cass
altogether withstand the sense that,

00:22:54.667 --> 00:22:56.467
hard to put it into words,

00:22:56.467 --> 00:22:59.734
the sense that the universe is personal,

00:22:59.734 --> 00:23:03.600
that there is something personal
that grounds existence and order

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.734
and value and purpose and meaning,

00:23:06.734 --> 00:23:11.233
and that the grandeur of the personal
universe has somehow infiltrated

00:23:11.233 --> 00:23:14.467
and is expanding his own small person,

00:23:14.467 --> 00:23:18.266
bringing his littleness more
into line with its grandeur,

00:23:18.266 --> 00:23:21.800
that the personal universe has
been personally kind to him,

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.767
gracious and forgiving,
to Cass Seltzer,

00:23:24.767 --> 00:23:27.066
gratuitously, exorbitantly,

00:23:27.066 --> 00:23:28.967
divinely kind,

00:23:28.967 --> 00:23:31.000
and this despite Cass' having,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.834
with callowness and
shallowness aforethought,

00:23:33.834 --> 00:23:39.033
thrown spitballs at the whole
idea of cosmic intentionality?

00:23:39.033 --> 00:23:41.300
No, that doesn't capture it either.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:45.967
Those words are far too narrowed
by Cass' own particular life,

00:23:45.967 --> 00:23:48.667
when what it is he could feel,

00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:49.734
has felt,

00:23:49.734 --> 00:23:51.767
might even be feeling now,

00:23:51.767 --> 00:23:55.200
has nothing to do with the contents
of Cass' existence,

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.367
but rather with existence itself.

00:23:58.367 --> 00:24:02.900
This, this, this,

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.700
what?

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:11.200
This expansion out into the world
which is a kind of love, he supposes,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.400
a love for the whole of existence,

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.166
that could so easily well up
in Cass Seltzer at this moment,

00:24:17.166 --> 00:24:20.433
standing here in the pure
abstractions of this night

00:24:20.433 --> 00:24:23.433
and contemplating the strange
thisness of his life

00:24:23.433 --> 00:24:25.934
when viewed sub specie aeternitatis,

00:24:25.934 --> 00:24:28.533
that is to say from the vantage
point of eternity

00:24:28.533 --> 00:24:32.967
which comes so highly recommended
to us by Spinoza.

00:24:32.967 --> 00:24:40.400
Here it is then: the sense that existence
is just such a tremendous thing,

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.834
one comes into it, astonishingly,

00:24:42.834 --> 00:24:45.934
here one is,
formed by biology and history,

00:24:45.934 --> 00:24:47.467
genes and culture,

00:24:47.467 --> 00:24:50.033
in the midst of the contingency
of the world,

00:24:50.033 --> 00:24:53.700
here one is, one doesn't know how,
one doesn't know why,

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:58.300
and suddenly one doesn't know where
one is either or who or what one is either,

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.033
and all that one knows is
that one is a part of it,

00:25:01.033 --> 00:25:03.700
a considered and conscious part of it,

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:08.000
generated and sustained in existence
in ways one can hardly comprehend,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.967
all the time conscious of it,
though, of existence,

00:25:10.967 --> 00:25:12.100
the fullness of it,

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.467
the reaching expanse and
pulsing intricacy of it,

00:25:15.467 --> 00:25:20.100
and one wants to live in a way that
at least begins to do justice to it,

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:25.000
one wants to expand one's reach of it
as far as expansion is possible

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.700
and even beyond that, to live one's life
in a way commensurate

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:31.734
with the privilege of being
a part of and conscious of

00:25:31.734 --> 00:25:36.200
the whole reeling glorious
infinite sweep,

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.533
a sweep that includes,
so improbably,

00:25:39.533 --> 00:25:43.767
a psychologist of religion
named Cass Seltzer,

00:25:43.767 --> 00:25:46.066
who moved by powers beyond himself,

00:25:46.066 --> 00:25:50.100
did something more improbable than
all the improbabilities constituting

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.767
his improbable existence
could have entailed,

00:25:52.767 --> 00:25:55.633
did something that won him
someone else's life,

00:25:55.633 --> 00:25:56.533
a better life,

00:25:56.533 --> 00:25:58.000
a more brilliant life,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.600
a life beyond all the ones he had wished
for in the pounding obscurity

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.433
of all his yearnings,

00:26:04.433 --> 00:26:06.967
because all of this,

00:26:06.967 --> 00:26:08.834
this,

00:26:08.834 --> 00:26:10.467
this,

00:26:10.467 --> 00:26:12.333
couldn't belong to him,

00:26:12.333 --> 00:26:16.533
to the man who stands on Weeks Bridge,
wrapped round in a scarf

00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:22.400
his once-beloved ex-wife Pascale had
knit for him for some necessary reason

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.967
that he would never know,

00:26:23.967 --> 00:26:27.033
perhaps to offer him some protection
against the desolation

00:26:27.033 --> 00:26:29.800
she knew would soon be his,

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.033
and was,

00:26:31.033 --> 00:26:33.967
but is no longer,

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:37.200
suspended here above sublimity,

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.166
his cheeks aflame with
either euphoria or frostbite,

00:26:42.166 --> 00:26:47.800
a letter in his zippered pocket
with the Imprimatur of Veritas

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.667
and a Lucinda Mandelbaum
with whom to share it all."

00:26:52.667 --> 00:26:54.033
Thank you.

00:26:54.533 --> 00:27:00.300
[applause]

00:27:01.166 --> 00:27:02.300
So,

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:06.567
that's what an atheist
with a soul looks like.

00:27:06.567 --> 00:27:07.967
Are there any questions?

00:27:16.533 --> 00:27:18.233
&gt;&gt; I'll ask a question.
Rebecca: Thank you.

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:22.834
&gt;&gt; Can I go to the podium?

00:27:27.133 --> 00:27:27.800
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:27:37.233 --> 00:27:38.033
&gt;&gt; Hello.
Rebecca: Hi.

00:27:39.233 --> 00:27:45.333
&gt;&gt; The Existence of God seems
more semantic then substantive

00:27:45.333 --> 00:27:48.400
and that the definition of God or

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.900
cosmic intentionality is watered down .

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.800
The real interesting point there as well,
that God must exist.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.233
The real question is: What is God?

00:28:01.233 --> 00:28:04.166
Not does God exist?
Does that make sense?

00:28:04.166 --> 00:28:09.967
Rebecca: That makes total
sense so in this very active,

00:28:09.967 --> 00:28:14.033
contemporary debate between
so called new atheists

00:28:14.033 --> 00:28:16.767
or just atheists and believers,

00:28:16.767 --> 00:28:20.633
what's the substance here?

00:28:20.633 --> 00:28:23.433
When people declare themselves
as atheists,

00:28:23.433 --> 00:28:28.500
what are they denying the existence of?

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.000
Just about anything can
be defined as God,

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.567
including as my heroes
Spinoza defined it,

00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:37.100
the final theory of everything.

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:41.533
The theory that's going to explain
why the laws of nature

00:28:41.533 --> 00:28:45.500
are the laws of nature and why
they had to be realized in this world

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.700
so what's the substance of
calling yourself an atheist?

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.500
And I think here's-
here is what they have in mind,

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.066
or what we have in mind,

00:28:56.066 --> 00:28:57.367
when we deny.

00:28:57.367 --> 00:29:02.133
It's the notion of a transcendent being,

00:29:02.133 --> 00:29:06.000
something that exists outside
of the laws of nature,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.133
outside of space and time,

00:29:08.133 --> 00:29:09.266
matter and energy,

00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:13.133
and that willed the world into existence,

00:29:13.133 --> 00:29:20.734
willed the laws of nature to be the
ones that they are and moreover,

00:29:20.734 --> 00:29:25.867
laid down the laws of morality,

00:29:25.867 --> 00:29:32.900
just grounded the difference between
right and wrong and moreover,

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.834
whose purpose is meant
to be our purpose.

00:29:36.834 --> 00:29:42.734
That we're meant to understand
our own lives in terms of the purpose

00:29:42.734 --> 00:29:48.100
of this transcendent moral creator.
So that's the idea.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:53.066
When people, I think,
are denying the existence of God,

00:29:53.066 --> 00:29:57.567
they're denying the existence
of that ontology.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.633
&gt;&gt; Umm,

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:11.633
it sounds like when you talk about
God moreover you say

00:30:11.633 --> 00:30:17.934
that God is definitely a subset of,
we're told personal gods.

00:30:17.934 --> 00:30:21.633
Gods that have a set of
characteristics of a person

00:30:21.633 --> 00:30:25.233
having will or intention or thought

00:30:25.233 --> 00:30:33.934
and excluding other forms of
God that are more exotic.

00:30:33.934 --> 00:30:42.200
And I think that there are a handful of
religions where their concept of god

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.133
is actually making it mostly exotic,

00:30:45.133 --> 00:30:56.767
so it sounds like this is more or less
related about Western religion

00:30:56.767 --> 00:31:01.300
and its values as opposed to
something worldwide.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:08.367
Rebecca: Yeah. So it really is about this
contemporary debate that's going on,

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:10.266
you know?
That it's suddenly,

00:31:10.266 --> 00:31:15.700
and it's quite interesting to a philosopher
to have this sort of philosophical discussion,

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.333
that you talk about in
your philosophy classes

00:31:18.333 --> 00:31:27.333
suddenly taken over the public square to
be so much involved in public discussion

00:31:27.333 --> 00:31:33.367
so it's really about that debate
and the denial of

00:31:33.367 --> 00:31:38.000
that particular very Western
conception of God.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.767
And all of the 36 arguments that
are in the appendix worked out

00:31:42.767 --> 00:31:45.567
and I tried to give them
the best form possible

00:31:45.567 --> 00:31:48.667
because it's no good
to rebut arguments

00:31:48.667 --> 00:31:50.633
unless you make them
the very best possible

00:31:50.633 --> 00:31:53.934
so I really try to work them up
as well as I can.

00:31:53.934 --> 00:31:56.834
They are all, except for one, #35,

00:31:56.834 --> 00:32:01.967
but all the other ones are for
the notion of a transcendent God,

00:32:01.967 --> 00:32:03.867
a very Western notion of God.

00:32:03.867 --> 00:32:12.500
The kind of God that the popular
monotheistic religions recognize:

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.133
Christianity, Judaism, and Islam

00:32:16.133 --> 00:32:20.967
so it's really that conception and these are
arguments for the existence of that God.

00:32:20.967 --> 00:32:26.834
The one exception is #35 which is
the Argument for Spinoza's God

00:32:26.834 --> 00:32:31.400
and that's basically an argument
for a nontranscendent God.

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.367
It's a god who is imminent in the world

00:32:34.367 --> 00:32:38.367
and who is basically identical to
the final theory of everything

00:32:38.367 --> 00:32:40.533
so that's the one exception.

00:32:40.533 --> 00:32:46.867
That's the more exotic God and that one
has also played a role in Western culture,

00:32:46.867 --> 00:32:48.433
Western history of ideas,

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:50.867
so I include it,
but yeah,

00:32:50.867 --> 00:32:54.333
it's not-, it's about this debate
going on now

00:32:54.333 --> 00:32:58.900
and therefore it's about
the Western conception of God.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.066
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:33:00.066 --> 00:33:02.066
Rebecca: Thank you.

00:33:12.133 --> 00:33:16.500
&gt;&gt; So it makes a lot of sense that your
protagonist is a psychologist because,

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:23.266
so instead the key question is why do people
buy into this mythology kind of thinking

00:33:23.266 --> 00:33:29.667
when the rationale doesn't sway
them or whatever

00:33:29.667 --> 00:33:31.867
and they keep going that way

00:33:41.567 --> 00:33:45.266
Rebecca: I would love to hear
you explain it and see

00:33:45.266 --> 00:33:49.800
how close it is to Cass'
explanation of why.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.800
&gt;&gt; Umm, well,

00:33:58.433 --> 00:34:01.000
it seems to me it's a cult curiosity

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:09.467
and it's obviously selected once a
species gets past a certain point where

00:34:09.467 --> 00:34:19.500
knowing how becomes
a survival advantage

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:28.333
so it's a set of genes that
cause one to instinctually

00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:37.734
and I'm using the word
instinct highly,

00:34:37.734 --> 00:34:42.900
they manifest themselves
as a feeling of discomfort

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:47.633
when confronted with answers with
the good book in front of questions

00:34:47.633 --> 00:34:51.066
which you don't have answers.

00:34:51.066 --> 00:34:59.633
It's the otherside of
the exploratory instinct,

00:34:59.633 --> 00:35:02.000
of curiosity,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.467
so something as important
as what happens after death.

00:35:09.467 --> 00:35:14.033
The absence of an answer
to that question produces

00:35:14.033 --> 00:35:33.000
such an uncomfortable feeling because
of your inherited called species memory.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.367
It causes such an uncomfortable
feeling that it can't be tolerated

00:35:36.367 --> 00:35:42.633
so answers must be invented rather
than saying, "Gee, I don't know."

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.066
Rebecca: I think that's actually
a large part of that

00:35:47.066 --> 00:35:51.133
and so many of the arguments
in the appendix

00:35:51.133 --> 00:35:59.533
are this is an irresolvable dilemma.

00:35:59.533 --> 00:36:04.033
This is the argument for free will and
the argument of survival after that

00:36:04.033 --> 00:36:06.266
and just a bunch of arguments.

00:36:06.266 --> 00:36:08.166
The arguments for moral truths

00:36:08.166 --> 00:36:14.000
and things that we don't quite
have a clear cut, not quite

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.333
well we don't have a clear cut
answer to,

00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:20.967
and it's a kind of substitution
of one mystery for another

00:36:20.967 --> 00:36:24.467
so we'll bury this mystery
and the mystery of God

00:36:24.467 --> 00:36:27.266
and that this will provide an answer.

00:36:27.266 --> 00:36:35.667
I think that that's part of that and either
Cass or I call it the Ontological Urge.

00:36:35.667 --> 00:36:39.166
I don't remember if it was
his term or mine.

00:36:39.166 --> 00:36:41.433
If I actually invented a piece
of it in the book

00:36:41.433 --> 00:36:45.767
but in any case one of us calls it
this Ontological Urge.

00:36:45.767 --> 00:36:48.200
You know, here we are,
you know?

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:53.200
And we are capable of self consciousness,

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:56.700
of forming an idea of ourselves
and of the universe

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:57.967
and trying to,

00:36:57.967 --> 00:37:02.633
and of asking these questions about
the universe and our relationship to it

00:37:02.633 --> 00:37:09.133
and wanting answers and the intolerability
of the lack of answers

00:37:09.133 --> 00:37:13.567
that are forthcoming really does sit
very, very uncomfortably

00:37:13.567 --> 00:37:15.567
and I think that's also part of it.

00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:17.233
That's part of it but I think there's more.

00:37:17.233 --> 00:37:21.767
One of the things that Cass thinks
as a psychologist of religion

00:37:21.767 --> 00:37:29.467
is that the religious impulse
the religious reaction is complicated

00:37:29.467 --> 00:37:40.000
so that for example some of our
inherited feelings of disgust

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.433
also finds an outlet
in the religious emotions.

00:37:45.433 --> 00:37:57.567
The notion of spiritual purity is a way
of also doing justice to this notion

00:37:57.567 --> 00:38:00.233
of disgust which has great survival value.

00:38:00.233 --> 00:38:04.467
We feel disgust at things that
carry germs or whatever

00:38:04.467 --> 00:38:08.900
and it becomes, given the kinds
of abstract makers that we are,

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.800
it becomes more abstract

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:13.633
and so there is a notion
of the body itself being

00:38:13.633 --> 00:38:17.767
impure of other people
being carriers of impurity.

00:38:17.767 --> 00:38:21.734
This too finds an outlet in
certain religious emotions.

00:38:21.734 --> 00:38:25.033
Tribalism finds who we can trust,

00:38:25.033 --> 00:38:26.667
who are those that share our values,

00:38:26.667 --> 00:38:29.100
finds an outlet in religious emotions.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:32.266
It's complicated so there's
certainly the ontological origins.

00:38:32.266 --> 00:38:36.166
So many of the actual arguments
for the existence of God

00:38:36.166 --> 00:38:39.333
that Cass explores in his appendix.

00:38:39.333 --> 00:38:47.967
It's actually the appendix of his book deal
with this discomfort that you have located

00:38:47.967 --> 00:38:50.867
when answers are not forthcoming

00:38:50.867 --> 00:38:55.200
but to get back to the question
that he's a psychologist of religion,

00:38:55.200 --> 00:39:03.734
I've been asked quite a few times
why has new atheism emerged recently,

00:39:03.734 --> 00:39:06.433
in basically the last ten years.

00:39:06.433 --> 00:39:08.233
There have been these big books,

00:39:08.233 --> 00:39:11.667
I mean Dennett and Dawkins
and Sam Harris

00:39:11.667 --> 00:39:14.734
and Christopher Hitchins
and many others.

00:39:17.233 --> 00:39:18.900
Why now?

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:24.700
And I think part of it is
the obvious answer, what,

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:35.200
the violence that has occurred in more
extreme and zealot forms of religions

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.133
so it's not just this cozy,

00:39:37.133 --> 00:39:42.967
sweet little thing but it's the more violent
and virulent forms that have emerged

00:39:42.967 --> 00:39:49.500
but also I do think the progress
that's been made in psychology,

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:51.467
in particular in evolutionary
psychology,

00:39:51.467 --> 00:39:56.667
we've already been sort of throwing off
some sort of evolutionary psychological

00:39:56.667 --> 00:40:01.333
explanations for religion so when
you want to argue against something,

00:40:01.333 --> 00:40:06.633
it's never enough to just show
that the arguments don't work,

00:40:06.633 --> 00:40:07.934
that they fail,

00:40:07.934 --> 00:40:15.266
but the next part of it is to show why people
would nevertheless continue to believe

00:40:15.266 --> 00:40:20.367
and evolutionary psychology has
now been able to tackle that

00:40:20.367 --> 00:40:22.700
and give us answers to that.

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:27.467
That's a very, for those of you
who read David Hume,

00:40:27.467 --> 00:40:31.066
who is a great hero to
free thinkers everywhere,

00:40:31.066 --> 00:40:35.900
his way of arguing against a position
is always first you show

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.066
there's no argument for it.

00:40:38.066 --> 00:40:41.800
The arguments fail the cause of the idea
of necessary connection for example,

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.433
that he went after in a big way,

00:40:43.433 --> 00:40:46.767
and then the second half
is to turn to psychology.

00:40:46.767 --> 00:40:49.934
You find this move all the time
in David Hume and to say,

00:40:49.934 --> 00:40:54.633
"Look, here is why nevertheless we
have an almost irresistible impulse

00:40:54.633 --> 00:40:55.934
to believe in this thing."

00:40:55.934 --> 00:40:57.066
He didn't have, of course,

00:40:57.066 --> 00:41:01.100
evolutionary psychology at his
disposal in the 18th century,

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.767
but that's that kind of mood so yeah,

00:41:03.767 --> 00:41:08.166
I made my guy a psychologist
of religion

00:41:08.166 --> 00:41:12.800
because that's where the second
half of this kind of argument

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:15.800
is coming from and if you
actually look at those

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:21.066
who have been at the forefront of
arguing atheism, this pushback,

00:41:21.066 --> 00:41:27.867
it's coming from people in evolutionary
biology or evolutionary psychology

00:41:27.867 --> 00:41:33.400
and I think that it's a measure of the
strength of the behavioral sciences.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:38.000
That they now have something to say
about the psychology of religion.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.266
It's the second half of that argument

00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:44.667
so that's why he's a psychologist
of religion.

00:41:51.066 --> 00:41:53.166
&gt;&gt; When Voltaire had said,

00:41:53.166 --> 00:41:56.533
"If God did not exist,
that man would have to invent him."

00:41:56.533 --> 00:41:58.400
in less sexist form,

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.000
I think that he was trying to say
we are constantly seeking a way

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.800
to explain the unexplainable

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.667
and I just wondered if you were
familiar with this book called

00:42:07.667 --> 00:42:09.600
"Why God Won't Go Away"

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.467
and talking about the biological
basis of beliefs

00:42:12.467 --> 00:42:15.133
and some of the experiments
you're just referring to

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:17.400
evolutionary biology and psychology

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.133
some of the experiments that were
done with near death experiences

00:42:20.133 --> 00:42:23.967
where people had a religious
experience also on psychedelics

00:42:23.967 --> 00:42:27.533
and various other things
and they were finding that

00:42:27.533 --> 00:42:30.600
there is a biological basis for
why people believe these things

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:34.734
but there was another explanation
other than deities and gods.

00:42:34.734 --> 00:42:39.300
I wonder if you are familiar with his
work and if it influenced you work.

00:42:40.233 --> 00:42:42.567
Rebecca: I don't know that
particular work.

00:42:42.567 --> 00:42:48.166
I did read a lot about experiments of
this sort and explanations of this sort.

00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:54.567
I will read this work now
but it is too late,

00:42:54.567 --> 00:42:59.266
you might say [laughing] but
I think we have it covered.

00:42:59.266 --> 00:43:01.700
But,

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.567
I mean, clearly,
here's one of the things.

00:43:05.567 --> 00:43:07.734
In that first chapter,

00:43:07.734 --> 00:43:13.567
I sort of show you going through
a kind of spiritual experience

00:43:13.567 --> 00:43:18.934
and it is the kind of experience
that Spinoza talks about,

00:43:18.934 --> 00:43:20.867
this intellectual love of God,

00:43:20.867 --> 00:43:28.834
but you nevertheless resist trying to
explain this experience in religious terms,

00:43:28.834 --> 00:43:34.500
in terms of that transcendent other thing
that you are confronting in this experience.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:37.567
You stop with existence itself.

00:43:37.567 --> 00:43:42.233
What a tremendous thing
existence itself is

00:43:42.233 --> 00:43:48.066
and even sometimes a kind of
gratitude that I think we've all felt.

00:43:48.066 --> 00:43:51.200
I know in studying physics,

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:55.500
I was always overwhelmed
that the laws of physics

00:43:55.500 --> 00:44:00.467
are just so beautiful and you feel
this sort of something,

00:44:00.467 --> 00:44:03.934
or mathematical proof
or music or art.

00:44:03.934 --> 00:44:07.400
This something that
takes you out of yourself

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.533
and you feel your own smallness
in relation to the grandeur

00:44:11.533 --> 00:44:15.333
and you almost can get
swallowed up in it and it's grand,

00:44:15.333 --> 00:44:16.800
it's marvelous.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.000
It's a kind of feeling of transcendence.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.934
I think for some reason that evolutionary
psychologists have not yet

00:44:23.934 --> 00:44:26.967
been able to explain
we have this capacity

00:44:26.967 --> 00:44:31.033
and in fact creativity
gives us this capacity.

00:44:31.033 --> 00:44:34.066
It's an intensifying of this feeling.

00:44:34.066 --> 00:44:39.300
I think good things come from this,
romantic love can give it to one too

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.967
and good things can sometimes
even come from romantic love.

00:44:42.967 --> 00:44:45.667
I hear tell, no

00:44:45.667 --> 00:44:55.934
It is very natural to put that into religious
terms I think as a kind of metaphor,

00:44:55.934 --> 00:45:02.900
and even Cass says that this
universe has been exorbitantly,

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:03.967
gratuitously,

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:05.767
divinely kind.

00:45:05.767 --> 00:45:08.133
It's very, very easy to,

00:45:08.133 --> 00:45:11.834
that's the vocabulary that
we have available to us

00:45:11.834 --> 00:45:13.700
that we've sort of inherited,

00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:17.266
And, so it's very, very, easy
to slip into that metaphor

00:45:17.266 --> 00:45:20.800
and then to be mislead
by I think one's metaphor

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.667
and that's a kind of Vickensteinian
notion that you know

00:45:23.667 --> 00:45:25.567
you can be misled by your metaphors.

00:45:25.567 --> 00:45:26.800
It fits in certain ways,

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.000
it doesn't fit in other ways,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.734
that's why it's a metaphor

00:45:29.734 --> 00:45:34.100
but you get misled and you go off
in these other directions.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:40.867
I tend to think of a lot of
religiosity as that,

00:45:40.867 --> 00:45:45.433
being misled by one's metaphors.
However,

00:45:45.433 --> 00:45:48.133
I shouldn't be saying what I think,

00:45:48.133 --> 00:45:49.867
Cass thinks.

00:45:49.867 --> 00:45:54.934
The wonderful thing about writing
novels rather than philosophy

00:45:54.934 --> 00:45:57.500
is I don't have to defend the views.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.367
It's my character but yes,

00:46:01.367 --> 00:46:07.934
he does feel that so when he gets
carried off by these experiences,

00:46:07.934 --> 00:46:14.100
he nevertheless will resist the urge
to go one step beyond

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:21.333
and see this as an experience
and evidence for God.

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:26.233
&gt;&gt; So this is a little bit related
to what you've been saying.

00:46:26.233 --> 00:46:30.066
So most of the conversation we've been
having here is about the arguments for

00:46:30.066 --> 00:46:34.300
and against God and why they have
to know and all that kind of stuff.

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:36.333
Why is it that you decided to
write this novel

00:46:36.333 --> 00:46:40.233
instead of writing varieties
of religious allusion?

00:46:40.233 --> 00:46:44.834
I assume it's not just so you can
back away from the arguments?

00:46:44.834 --> 00:46:46.934
Rebecca: Well, I am a coward
[laughs]

00:46:46.934 --> 00:46:52.800
but I do sometimes go on the line
and stand by my beliefs.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.033
I got very, my last book,

00:46:55.033 --> 00:46:57.700
in fact my last two books,
had been nonfiction.

00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:00.734
One was on Godel's Incompleteness
Theorems;

00:47:00.734 --> 00:47:03.500
"Incompleteness: The Proof
and the Paradox of Kurt Godel"

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:06.000
and then the next one was on Spinoza,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.266
"Betraying Spinoza: The Renegade Jew
Who Gave Us Modernity"

00:47:09.266 --> 00:47:13.066
and both of those books are
in fact parts of series

00:47:13.066 --> 00:47:14.934
and I'd been asked to write
about them so

00:47:14.934 --> 00:47:19.367
I wrote about them.

00:47:19.367 --> 00:47:25.834
Partly as a result of publishing
the Spinoza book,

00:47:25.834 --> 00:47:31.233
I got very drawn into this new debate
between atheists and believers

00:47:31.233 --> 00:47:35.000
and drawn into the movement
of the new atheists.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.066
Spinoza is really,

00:47:36.066 --> 00:47:38.033
he's a hero to free thinkers,

00:47:38.033 --> 00:47:43.333
so I got invited to give talks
to organizations,

00:47:43.333 --> 00:47:47.433
associations of pro science,

00:47:47.433 --> 00:47:48.567
pro reason,

00:47:48.567 --> 00:47:53.600
sometimes more or less
anti religious groups

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:58.533
and I'm on Sam Harris's board
for The Reason Foundation.

00:47:58.533 --> 00:48:06.100
I just, as a result, got drawn into this
and it interested me very much

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:12.233
but I felt that something was
being left out of the discussion.

00:48:12.233 --> 00:48:15.834
There is something about,

00:48:15.834 --> 00:48:20.633
part of these differences
of opinion have to do

00:48:20.633 --> 00:48:25.600
with very different experiences
of the world,

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:28.934
or sometimes very much the same
sort of experiences

00:48:28.934 --> 00:48:32.934
but different language that
you're putting to this experience

00:48:32.934 --> 00:48:35.700
and so for religious people,

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:39.300
sometime it seemed that those
who were denying God

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:43.066
or denying any kind of
spiritual expansion,

00:48:43.066 --> 00:48:47.867
any kind of transcendence so it seemed
to me important to present an atheist

00:48:47.867 --> 00:48:51.166
who is very capable of
this sort of experience,

00:48:51.166 --> 00:48:56.533
and on the other side among those
whom I very much agree with in fact,

00:48:56.533 --> 00:48:58.200
the new atheists,

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:05.400
sometimes a tendency to not do
justice to the complexity

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:12.734
of the religious emotion and that
it has to do with other things,

00:49:12.734 --> 00:49:14.300
why is this sentence not coming out?

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:18.500
It has to do with things other
than the belief in God

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:24.934
and demonstrating the fallacies in these arguments often don't do anything at all.

00:49:24.934 --> 00:49:28.300
It has to do sometimes with
these existential dilemmas

00:49:28.300 --> 00:49:30.734
that one simply cannot tolerate.

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:37.767
It has to do with often feelings
of affinity with certain people

00:49:37.767 --> 00:49:41.467
or with family loyalties
or a certain narrative.

00:49:41.467 --> 00:49:51.066
It's a complicated business and whenever
I feel like some philosophical issue

00:49:51.066 --> 00:49:56.300
is very tied in with different ways
of experiencing the world,

00:49:56.300 --> 00:49:59.633
I always get driven to write a novel.

00:49:59.633 --> 00:50:01.567
I mean, almost against my will

00:50:01.567 --> 00:50:05.667
because it seems to me that is
what the novel is made for.

00:50:05.667 --> 00:50:09.934
It's made for exploring how the world
feels to different characters.

00:50:09.934 --> 00:50:12.734
That's how you create
a character in a novel.

00:50:12.734 --> 00:50:14.467
It's really a world view

00:50:14.467 --> 00:50:18.400
and of what the world feels like
to each of these characters

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:23.200
and so since this debate seemed
to me the more I got into it,

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:29.400
the more it seemed to me that it had
a lot to do with just world's colliding.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.734
The world is simply very, very different
for these different people

00:50:32.734 --> 00:50:34.500
and they are talking past each other

00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:38.567
and sometimes agreeing
more than they realize.

00:50:38.567 --> 00:50:45.567
I'd have to write a novel about it and
also another thing that I'm committed to,

00:50:45.567 --> 00:50:47.800
again it's a very Spinozist idea,

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:54.767
is that cognition and emotion are not
as separated from each other

00:50:54.767 --> 00:51:00.133
as we in Western philosophy
have assumed.

00:51:00.133 --> 00:51:08.266
That there is a way of experiencing
emotionally certain truths

00:51:08.266 --> 00:51:14.033
that gives it a kind of substance
and makes it one's own in a way

00:51:14.033 --> 00:51:17.367
that pure cognition doesn't

00:51:17.367 --> 00:51:23.000
and this kind of Tony Damasio's
view of what is the book,

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.633
searching for Spinoza,
looking for Spinoza,

00:51:25.633 --> 00:51:30.133
Tony Damasio, a neuroscientist
who says it's coming out of his labs,

00:51:30.133 --> 00:51:35.266
verification of this Spinozistic view
that the emotions and the intellect

00:51:35.266 --> 00:51:38.266
are not as separated
as we've assumed

00:51:38.266 --> 00:51:43.033
and what you can do in a novel that
you are simply not allowed to do

00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:47.834
in analytic philosophy is infuse emotions

00:51:47.834 --> 00:51:54.633
and to show how these intellectual views
are also connected with the emotional life

00:51:54.633 --> 00:51:58.400
and you simply can't do that in the kind
of philosophy in which I'm trained

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:06.000
so I do it in novels and
it actually can bring the reader,

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.834
give the reader a participation in a
emotion that they would normally not have

00:52:12.834 --> 00:52:19.066
so I've actually had some of my friends
from the atheist movement say that

00:52:19.066 --> 00:52:22.000
they just really never even knew what it
felt like when people are talking about,

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:27.767
when they are talking about spiritual
experiences and now they know.

00:52:27.767 --> 00:52:34.233
Somehow going through it with
Cass in his very secular way

00:52:34.233 --> 00:52:35.800
gave them some sort of understanding

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:41.066
of what it would be like to be drawn out of
yourself in this kind of transcendent way,

00:52:41.066 --> 00:52:51.934
so that for me is great validation
of the power of fiction.

00:52:51.934 --> 00:52:54.433
We're done.

00:52:54.433 --> 00:52:58.834
