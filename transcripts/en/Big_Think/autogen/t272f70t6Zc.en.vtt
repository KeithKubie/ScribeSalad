00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.750
I have thought a lot about that but

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760
I have thought a lot about that but
 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.910

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560
and that's what makes it so remarkable
 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.410

essence of Nietzsche's philosophy this
 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.640

people grow and develop in a linear time

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250
people grow and develop in a linear time
 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.729
people grow and develop in a linear time
fashion how you have an adolescence at a

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739
fashion how you have an adolescence at a
 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.280
fashion how you have an adolescence at a
certain age and you start to develop

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290
certain age and you start to develop
 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.920
certain age and you start to develop
adulthood and you start to mature but I

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930
adulthood and you start to mature but I
 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.860
adulthood and you start to mature but I
think the movie shows that it is the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870
think the movie shows that it is the
 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.830
think the movie shows that it is the
repetition of days itself which pushes

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840
repetition of days itself which pushes
 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.559
repetition of days itself which pushes
us forward in our own maturation as we

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569
us forward in our own maturation as we
 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:04.210
us forward in our own maturation as we
start to encounter the same things over

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220
start to encounter the same things over
 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.550
start to encounter the same things over
and over again and so there's an element

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560
and over again and so there's an element
 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.620
and over again and so there's an element
of truth to the fact that we are

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630
of truth to the fact that we are
 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.210
of truth to the fact that we are
repeating the same day over and over

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220
repeating the same day over and over
 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.059
repeating the same day over and over
again but I think the biggest thing that

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069
again but I think the biggest thing that
 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.460
again but I think the biggest thing that
that affects people is the fact that

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470
that affects people is the fact that
 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.589
that affects people is the fact that
phil is presented with the exact same

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599
phil is presented with the exact same
 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.080
phil is presented with the exact same
day and the very first time he's

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090
day and the very first time he's
 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.120
day and the very first time he's
presented with it it's probably the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130
presented with it it's probably the
 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.199
presented with it it's probably the
worst day of his life and by the end of

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209
worst day of his life and by the end of
 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.270
worst day of his life and by the end of
the movie we see that the it's the exact

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280
the movie we see that the it's the exact
 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.890
the movie we see that the it's the exact
same day but somehow this is probably

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900
same day but somehow this is probably
 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.020
same day but somehow this is probably
the best day of his life it's the day he

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030
the best day of his life it's the day he
 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.670
the best day of his life it's the day he
