&gt;&gt; JEFF: Hi. My name is Jeff. I'm an Android
engineer working on applications. I want to

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.110
tell you about my favorite features of the
Android phone. My first favorite feature is

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.759
the favored types of contacts. It shows you
at the top of your contacts that are starred

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.109
and then below, the ones you frequently contacted.
Then if you go to the contacts tab and you

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.990
want to find someone, say Will, you can just
type on the keyboard and it will filter down

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.359
and show you that person. Another neat thing
about the contacts tab is you can change the

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.910
group that you're displaying. So if you have
a group setup in Gmail, you can go here, you

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.930
can select the group, and it will only show
you people who are in that group. Another

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.810
feature I really like is if you press the
green button twice, it calls back the last

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:41.620
person you talked to.
