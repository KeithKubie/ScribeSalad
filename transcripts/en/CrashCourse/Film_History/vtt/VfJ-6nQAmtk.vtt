Hello, I'm Craig and this is Crash Course Film History.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.460
Gone are the days when the only way to experience
film was buying a ticket at your local theater.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.120
Instead, you can watch almost anything you
want, whenever you want, wherever you want.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.500
Film studios have made much of their back
catalogs available to the public, with things

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:18.910
like DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, or online streaming
services.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.440
And you can screen movies on TVs, computers,
tablets, phones, and even some watches…

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.440
if you squint really hard.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.640
Home video transformed the film industry,
and the ways we find and consume motion pictures.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:41.440
[Opening Music Plays]

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.280
True home movies – films you can watch at

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.220
home – didn’t exist until the invention
of 8mm film in the mid-1930s.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.980
The first standard 8mm film stock was actually
made from 16mm film with extra sprocket holes

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.210
down the side.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.589
Filmmakers would run a 16mm film strip through
a camera once to expose one half of the frame,

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.200
and then run it in the other direction to
expose the other half.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.600
Then, during processing, they split the strip
down the center, creating two 8mm film strips

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.860
that could be spliced together.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.460
...it's just a lot of work.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.990
Compared to traditional 35mm film, 8mm film
was more portable and much less expensive

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.170
to buy and develop.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.610
But it had one major drawback: When 8mm film
was projected on a big screen, the image quality

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.810
couldn’t hold a candle to 35mm.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.500
Most home movie makers weren’t projecting
their films onto giant screens, though.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.079
Instead, they would just hang up a sheet or
use a plain wall.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.799
And for that, 8mm film did the trick.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.920
In the 1950s and ‘60s, as the American middle
class expanded after World War II, 8mm film

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.220
cameras became more common.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.659
Chances are, there’s some grainy, unsteady
footage of your family’s old vacations,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.040
birthdays, weddings, or other special occasions
tucked away in an attic somewhere.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.900
Who's attic? My attic?

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.340
Now, what really brought home movies into
the mainstream was the advent of home video

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.340
technology.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.430
And Betamax – or Beta for short – was
one of the world’s first.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.939
Invented in Japan and introduced to the United
States in 1975, Beta could record audio and

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.060
video signals to a magnetic tape, much like
the ones in audio cassettes.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.159
You see, video technologies record break up
recorded images into a whole bunch of horizontal

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.159
lines of visual information.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.229
To save space and produce a clear picture,
early home video technologies used an interlaced

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.829
format to compress the signal.

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.340
In interlaced formats, when a video is played
back, it displays sets of every other horizontal

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.400
line in a given image, leaving the others
blank.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.280
Each of these sets is called a field.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.620
First, a field with the odd-numbered lines
is shown, then an even one.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.120
Odd, even, odd even...

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.180
Odd, even, odd even oddevenoddeven.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.790
If you speed up that process until you’re
flashing alternating fields 25 or 30 times

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.620
a second, your eye doesn’t distinguish between
the lines.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.340
Instead – thanks to the Phi Phenomenon – you
see a moving image.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.819
While interlaced video allowed for some pretty
clear pictures, it doesn’t handle fast motion

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.879
very well, and the image tends to blur or
strobe.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.400
It also gets weird around plaid or striped
shirts.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.090
Now, Beta’s main competition was another
Japanese technology called the Video Home

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.210
System or VHS.

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.290
It was essentially the same idea as Beta,
except it was lighter, cheaper, and one cassette

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.819
could hold a two-hour movie.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.840
So in the ensuing “video format wars,”
Beta couldn’t compete.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.200
By 1980, the VHS format dominated 60 percent
of the U.S. market.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.720
I think my grandfather died in the video format wars.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.420
And that market was getting bigger and bigger!

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.440
As more home video technologies were emerging
and dropping in price, an enormous, untapped

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.670
revenue stream opened up for the Hollywood
studios.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.010
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, more people
began buying Video Cassette Recorders or VCRs.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.570
Not only could these devices play home movies
recorded with consumer video cameras, but

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.220
they could also record TV programs and play
videotapes of feature films.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.140
Suddenly, people could watch Hollywood movies
at home whenever they wanted.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.020
Kind of.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.120
At first, it was way too expensive for the
average consumer to buy a video cassette

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.120
of a Hollywood film.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.819
The studios charged between 80 and 90 dollars per tape! ...WHAT!?!?!

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.650
But rental chains could buy them in bulk,
and rent them out to the general public for

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.650
a few dollars a night.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.650
Plus late fees.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.129
These rental chains – places like Blockbuster
Video or Hollywood Video – along with independent

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.230
mom-and-pop stores, flourished throughout
the 1980s and ‘90s.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.380
Film studios started going through their film
libraries and releasing old movies on home

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.720
video formats as well as new ones, making
money hand over fist.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.410
As this new home video market matured in the
1980s, a number of film companies decided

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.470
they could bypass the theatrical distribution
system altogether and market their films straight

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.470
to the consumer.

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.129
The most successful direct-to-video films
fell into a few main categories: inexpensive

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:09.630
action movies, steamy thrillers, sequels to
successful theatrical films, and family films

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.500
– both animated and live-action.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.890
Like low-budget B-movies, direct-to-video
films were often viewed as cheap knock-offs,

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.519
as opposed to “real” movies that played
in movie theaters.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.110
Movies like Nail Gun Massacre, Death Spa,
or Rock ‘n’ Roll Nightmare were pretty

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.830
terrible, but offered a bit of good schlocky
fun.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.790
Direct-to-video also gave film franchises
who were dragging a bit at the box office

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.290
a chance to stay alive with cheaper budgets.

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.280
Beethoven, I’m looking
at you.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.720
Not the composer, the movie about a dog.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.220
Now, back in the late ‘70s, as the first

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.620
consumer home video formats were coming out,
LaserDisc also emerged.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.580
Rather than recording images on magnetic tape,
LaserDisc was an optical format, which encodes

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.190
binary data with a laser.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.300
It’s a technology that eventually led to
CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray Discs.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.900
Even though the picture quality was superior
to either Beta or VHS, LaserDisc

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.560
was ultimately doomed.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.670
The discs themselves were cumbersome and fragile,
the players were expensive, and you couldn’t

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.140
record TV shows on them.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:02.350
But by the time Digital Video Discs, or DVDs,
arrived in 1995, consumers were primed for

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.380
a technological revolution.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.190
See, in 1987, Paramount Pictures tried an
experiment.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.950
They offered the VHS cassette of Top Gun for
just 30 dollars instead of 80 or 90.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.060
And it was a runaway hit.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.040
...who knew people liked to pay less for things?

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.620
Almost immediately, other studios followed
Paramount’s lead.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.770
And by the early 1990s, people could afford
to build their very own home video libraries.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.190
One issue with VHS tapes is that they degrade
over time.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.060
The more you watch them, the more the actual
tape wears down,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.380
eventually rendering them un-viewable.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:29.100
...like me!

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.680
In part, that's because VHS is an analog

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.240
technology, while DVD is digital.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.580
Both analog and digital technologies transmit
information, usually through electric signals.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.320
One of the main differences is that analog
technologies translate information into electric

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.221
pulses of varying amplitudes, while digital
technologies translate information into a

00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:49.190
binary format made of ones and zeros, which
represent discrete amplitudes.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.721
DVDs, like most digital technologies, don’t
degrade like VHS tapes.

00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:55.260
The ones are always ones, and the zeroes are
always zeroes.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.080
So, the signal will always look the same.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.700
Unless you’re at your parents’ house where
it will always look green and squished.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.220
C’mon mom and dad, fix your tv settings!

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.280
The durability of DVDs, mixed with an impressive
increase in storage capacity, made them an

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.500
extremely attractive upgrade from video cassettes.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.320
With all that extra storage space, home video releases could come with all kinds of fun extras.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.200
Like: trailers for other movies, alternate
cuts and deleted scenes, isolated scores,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.960
commentary tracks where the filmmakers could
talk about making the film, and closed captioning

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.570
that could be turned on or off.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.390
Along with new releases, distribution companies
could repackage their old libraries with DVD

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.710
special features and make even more money!

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.250
These days, newer technologies have started
to replace DVDs.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.640
Like Blu-ray Discs and Blu-ray Players, which were first made available to the public in 2006.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.480
Like DVDs, Blu-rays are a digital optical
storage device.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.750
But unlike DVDs, they can hold full high-definition
– and ultra-high-definition – video signals.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.650
Now, when we talk about standard-, high-,
and ultra-high-definition video, we’re talking

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.970
about those horizontal lines that make up
the image.

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:49.510
The more lines, the clearer the image – up
to a point.

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:53.580
We label the level of definition each signal
has with the number of horizontal lines, like

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:54.980
720 or 1080.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.260
That number is then followed by an ‘i’
or a ‘p’, indicating if the video fields

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.940
are interlaced or progressive.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.440
Developed as an alternative to interlaced
video, the progressive scan format flashes

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.340
all the horizontal lines of picture information,
instead of alternating sets of lines.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.590
Everything from the camera to the television
requires a much larger bandwidth to handle

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.460
progressive scan, but any motion on screen
appears smoother and more realistic.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.560
...Like this.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.480
So, standard-definition video has 480 horizontal

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.920
lines per image and is interlaced, so you’ll
see it written as 480i.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.300
Broadcast high-definition refers to video
signals that have 720 lines per image, either

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.660
interlaced or progressive.

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.770
High-definition, or HD, has 1080 lines, either
interlaced or progressive.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:38.020
And ultra-high definition, also sometimes
known as 4K, boasts a whopping 2160 lines!

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:39.650
That's a lot of lines!

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.980
Most Hollywood films shot digitally are being
filmed in 6k and and even 8k…

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.160
that’s a lot of k!

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.700
And when we're talking about 'k' we're talking about these lines... vertical lines.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.160
Today, we think of Blu-rays as the main high
definition discs on the markelt.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.720
When they were first being sold in 2006, though,
they came in second to their competition:

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:57.100
the HD-DVD.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.820
The home video industry split between the
two formats, with companies like Sony, Panasonic,

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.950
Samsung, and Dell advocating for Blu-rays,
while Toshiba, Microsoft, and Intel supported

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:05.960
HD-DVDs.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:10.210
For two years the conflict hamstrung the industry,
until Sony decided to incorporate a Blu-ray

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:13.430
Player into the Playstation 3. Very clever, Sony.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:17.620
That was seen as the turning point in the
“HD format wars,” and by 2008 we stopped

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.630
making HD-DVDs altogether.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:22.160
My Grandmother died in the HD Format Wars.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.220
And the newest frontier in home video formats

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:26.420
is the 4K Ultra-HD Disc.

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.120
You just need a new player and a 4K TV to
watch one.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.580
But if you're watching this video 5 years from now, we sound very old.

00:08:32.580 --> 00:08:36.640
Now, the other technological and cultural
revolution in home video was streaming services,

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.560
which did away with physical discs entirely.

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:43.431
Today, streaming services like Netflix, Hulu,
Amazon, YouTube, iTunes, and Vimeo distribute

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.160
films and television programs directly to
consumers.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.660
YouTube? Never heard of it.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.260
They’re even making their own original content.

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.030
Netflix and Amazon produced and distributed
TV series and films that have won the highest

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.280
awards at the Emmys, Golden Globes, and Oscars!

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.800
These services also provide non-traditional
and independent filmmakers with a more level

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.180
playing field when it comes to distributing
their unique visions.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.560
There are some drawbacks to streaming distribution.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.800
You need a robust, consistent Internet connection to watch anything.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.240
Not to mention, the content you’re looking
for may not always be available, unless you’ve

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.520
purchased and downloaded it.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.400
And even then, you still don’t have a physical
copy to keep on your bookshelf.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.180
Or sell later on Craigslist to make some money.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.050
That said, there have never been so many
ways for films to find an audience.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.280
You just have to look beyond the multiplex!

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.560
Don't look behind the multiplex. There's dumpsters back there.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.380
And where the future of home video will take
us is anyone’s guess.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.430
This is Crash Course Film History not Film
Future… so we’re not going to try.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.960
But I bet it’ll be awesome.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:36.630
Today we talked about 8mm film as the origin
of home video distribution.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.410
We traced the development of the home video
market from Beta and VHS all the way to 4K

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.410
Ultra-HD.

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.130
And we looked at the impact of streaming services
on the production and distribution of films,

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.280
television, and other audio-visual content.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.340
Next time, we’ll take a step back and look
at some unusual and captivating film movements

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.450
from around the world.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.860
Crash Course Film History is produced in association
with PBS Digital Studios.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.280
You can head over to their channel to check
out a playlist of their latest amazing shows,

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.640
like Infinite Series, Art Assignment, and Above the Noise.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.830
This episode of Crash Course was filmed in
the Doctor Cheryl C. Kinney Crash Course Studio

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:09.100
with the help of these video format warriors, and our
amazing graphics team is Thought Cafe.
