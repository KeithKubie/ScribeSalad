[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.950
is a very interesting developer
community--

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.225
I'm glad somebody has asked
this question I think--

00:00:13.225 --> 00:00:14.786
This is where the
magic happens--

00:00:14.786 --> 00:00:16.805
This is primarily a question and
answer show, so if any of

00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:18.400
you out there would like
to ask questions--

00:00:24.352 --> 00:00:28.010
DANNY HERMES: Hi, everybody,
Welcome to our most recent

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.590
edition of the Content
API for Shopping

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.400
community, office hours.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.210
This week it's more of
a fireside chat.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.810
As you know, I'm Danny Hermes,
developer programs engineer on

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.950
the shopping team.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.020
I have a special guest here
with me today, Andrew

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.780
Lamonica, one of the lead
engineers at Zazzle.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.350
Maybe the lead engineer at
Zazzle And also, my new

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.730
teammate, Burcu Dogan--

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.450
I believe is how it's
pronounced.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.780
BURCU DOGAN: Yes,
you are right.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.870
And I will be replacing
Danny shortly.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:59.440
DANNY HERMES: Yes.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.050
And we'll talk a bit about that
at the end, after Andrew

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.360
does his demo.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.420
And for the last introduction,
I'll let

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.060
Amanda introduce herself.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.970
AMANDA SURYA: I'm Amanda
Surya, and I lead the

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.080
developer relations for
our commerce products.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.930
And thanks for joining us, and
thank you, Andrew, for coming

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.310
to our office today
to talk to us.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.090
So I guess we can get started
with talking about Zazzle.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.950
Do you want to tell us what
Zazzle is, Andrew?

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.950
ANDREW LAMONICA:
So Zazzle is--

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.830
Zazzle.com is a custom
products marketplace.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.450
We're based here in
the Bay Area.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.280
People can take pictures or
graphics that they've created

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.130
and upload them to Zazzle and
create mugs, or t-shirts, or

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.000
iPhone5 cases, or
postage stamps.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.100
And then you just buy them
and we send them to you.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.070
One of the neat features of
Zazzle is that it's also a

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.900
marketplace.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.790
So if you have some good content
that you want to share

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.060
with the rest the world and
make royalties on, you can

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.500
post it for sale and when
somebody buys it, we'll pay

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.110
you a royalty and handle all the
logistics of shipping and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.410
manufacturing and customer
support.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.340
AMANDA SURYA: That
sounds awesome.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.870
ANDREW LAMONICA: That's the
run down of Zazzle.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.090
DANNY HERMES: Cool.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.400
ANDREW LAMONICA: I could
give a quick--

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.490
AMANDA SURYA: Yeah, we'd
love to see it.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.740
ANDREW LAMONICA: A quick
overview of the site.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.930
You can see here many of the
things that you can create.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.170
This is actually only a
small subset of them.

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.370
And, you know, shirts and
stickers and water bottles and

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.940
all sorts of fun stuff.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.290
You can also do searches for
content that has been provided

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.910
by other people.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.860
I just did a search for
Google Doodles here.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.320
Google is one of the companies
that actually

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.600
provides content to Zazzle.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.380
We have companies,
in addition to

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.730
individuals, who upload content.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.530
So you can buy some Google
Doodles on a t-shirt, or a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.810
sticker, or a mug,
or something.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.920
DANNY HERMES: I kind of want
to buy the Sesame Street

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.490
Google Doodle.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.265
AMANDA SURYA: I know, right.

00:03:11.265 --> 00:03:11.970
DANNY HERMES: I had
no idea I could.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.250
AMANDA SURYA: I love that.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.370
ANDREW LAMONICA: It's probably
on there somewhere.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.220
Actually, this is not a super
good example, but some

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.540
products that are provided
are even customizable.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.550
So you can add extra
text to them.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.133
I think I totally spelled
that wrong, but

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:36.950
it might still work.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.530
No, it did not.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.290
DANNY HERMES: What
did you type in?

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.020
ANDREW LAMONICA: I tried to type
Mickey Mouse Shirt, but--

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.270
DANNY HERMES: Gotcha, gotcha.

00:03:48.155 --> 00:03:50.220
ANDREW LAMONICA: That should
be pretty safe.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.890
AMANDA SURYA: So how many
different types of products

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.100
that you can print?

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.750
ANDREW LAMONICA: Actually, I'm
an engineer at Zazzle, so

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.220
unfortunately I'm not up on the
latest count, but I would

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.100
guess about 100.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.980
It becomes a much larger number
if you count individual

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.220
SKUs of shirts.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.540
You can buy smalls, or green,
or the silver version, or

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:15.790
something like that.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.576
So you can also customize
products and buy them so you

00:04:23.576 --> 00:04:25.380
can put your name on it or
something like that.

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.540
I'm totally not that familiar
with my own website.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.780
DANNY HERMES: That's OK.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.840
ANDREW LAMONICA: So, the reason
I'm here today is

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.340
Zazzle actually uses the
Google Shopping API.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.590
DANNY HERMES: Yes.

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.970
You guys obviously have a pretty
sweet website that

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.310
you're showing.

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.400
And you have, from what I know
in the outside world, a pretty

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.870
loyal following and also some
other casual users that make

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.280
your user base pretty big.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.130
So, as Andrew said, we invited
him here for a reason.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.770
And it wasn't just to sell
Zazzle, we wanted to talk to

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.180
him about engineering.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.290
So, Andrew, if you'd like, could
you give us maybe a bit

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.180
about what the history is with
you guys sending product data

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.490
to Google, whether
it's through the

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.190
Content API or for others?

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:25.210
And also, your use of the API,
with all the data you guys

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.110
have from your large user base,
how that gets used, and

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.490
how this has helped
you or hurt you?

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.900
Whatever you want
to lay on us.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.250
ANDREW LAMONICA: So, as I
mentioned before, Google has a

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.330
marketplace.

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.310
And it's a very low
bar to entry.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.450
So people can just upload a
picture, they don't have to

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.970
pay any money, they don't
have to do too much

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:47.650
just to get up there.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.960
Which means we consequently have
millions and millions and

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.320
millions of products that
we then want to

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.840
provide people to buy.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.840
And so we have a lot of
channels to get that

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.620
information out there.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:07.280
And Google Shopping offers us
a couple of good channels.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.890
One of which is it integrates
pretty well with AdWords and

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.590
with the Google Affiliate
Network, which is display

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.690
advertising.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.930
And it also powers the
Google Shopping sites

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.680
in the various countries.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.370
I forgot to mention earlier
that Zazzle is in 17

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.080
countries, so we have lots
of content and lots

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.760
of different languages.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.890
DANNY HERMES: I've never
been to 17 countries.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.780
ANDREW LAMONICA: Well,
me either.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.900
AMANDA SURYA: Some day, Danny.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.760
DANNY HERMES: Some day.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.680
ANDREW LAMONICA: So when we
first started out with Google

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.750
Shopping, we didn't contact
Google or anything, we just

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.275
signed up and we just
started uploading--

00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:44.950
AMANDA SURYA: Feeds.

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:49.450
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yeah, feeds.
gzipped XML files with the

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.950
maximum number of products--

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:56.100
which I think is, that's
changed over the years.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.760
DANNY HERMES: I think 20 megs
is the max now, it's not the

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.580
number of products.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.120
ANDREW LAMONICA: Oh really?

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.550
DANNY HERMES: Yeah.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.870
ANDREW LAMONICA: So anyway, we
started with that and that

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:11.215
worked for some applications.

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.290
It was kind of limited though
in several ways.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.910
And one of the things early on
that was a problem was, we had

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.040
lots of different accounts
because we had different

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.900
stores in different countries.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:28.400
And that was fixed when Google
contacted us-- or we contacted

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.770
them or something-- about
multi-client accounts, which

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:33.670
is what we're doing now.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.390
We basically have one of
those for each country.

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.290
Not one multi-client account,
but one sub-account, which is

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.830
really helpful because, as
I'll mention later, when

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:48.210
debugging it's nice to have
everything in one place.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.430
Recently though--

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.800
maybe a year, year and a half
ago-- we switched to the

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:02.990
Content for Shopping API which
actually solved a lot of

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:06.940
important problems for us
over just uploading

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:10.240
giant gzipped XML files.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.950
Probably the biggest one was
that our content was sort of

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:16.390
perpetually out of date.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:24.280
We were doing one big upload
of every file every day.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:30.120
And that meant that the minimum
turnaround time--

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.000
well actually, there could be
the maximum turnaround time

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.510
would be 24 hours.

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.169
So you could upload a product
and then something about that

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:41.650
product changed, and Google
wouldn't know about it for

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.950
some time after that.

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:45.190
AMANDA SURYA: And as a
marketplace, you had a lot of

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:46.730
price changes, I'm sure.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:48.640
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yes, so another
thing I didn't mention

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.850
about Zazzle is that when you
post a product for sale, you

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.220
get to set the price.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.610
And you're even offered the
opportunity to change that

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.480
price, along with just about
everything else about the

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.040
product except for the physical
picture itself.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:06.390
So you can change the keywords,
or the title, or the

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:13.330
description, and all of that
content needed to be given to

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:14.710
Google as soon as possible.

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:18.640
Especially the price, because
when the price changes, it's

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.900
against Google's terms of use
if you're showing the wrong

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.590
price for a product
on your website.

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:26.900
Or showing a different price
from what you saw

00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.810
upload in the feeds.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.140
DANNY HERMES: And you'd probably
rather not have that

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:29.780
anyway, right?

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.020
You're

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:30.330
ANDREW LAMONICA: No.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.260
It's also a bad experience
for the customer.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.420
They think they're paying--

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.830
they click on a link that says
$25 and it's $22, and they're

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:38.700
scratching their heads.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.930
DANNY HERMES: They don't
know who to be mad at.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:41.060
ANDREW LAMONICA: And they
don't know, did

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:41.890
this product change?

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:42.940
Am I not in the right place?

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:47.780
I wanted the one that was $25.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.660
So Content for Shopping solved
that problem immediately.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:57.010
Overnight, when we started
uploading changes to the

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.230
products as they came
in, you no longer

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.390
have the price problem.

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:02.540
DANNY HERMES: Do you find a
lot of the updates you're

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:06.390
sending fall into the express
pipeline where you're only

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:09.640
changing availability, price,
and things like that, to where

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.400
they'll make it into
the index faster?

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:14.900
ANDREW LAMONICA: So
actually, yes.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.080
I don't have the numbers on that
but a lot of the changes

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:22.150
that we really care about are
the high availability ones.

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.160
Another feature of Zazzle is,
since we're a marketplace, we

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.710
don't actually look at every
product that everybody uploads

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:28.710
all the time.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.590
And sometimes after a day or so,
someone will notice that a

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:37.710
product is a copyright
violation, or for some reason

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:40.600
it's bad quality and it needs
to be taken down, or it's

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.740
miscategorized or mislabeled.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.760
I think somebody tried to
sell an iPhone case

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.340
as an iPhone once.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.540
They just made it look like it
was an iPhone that was--

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.720
and they set the price
and everything.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.580
It's very complicated,
but we need to take

00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:57.710
those products down.

00:10:57.710 --> 00:11:01.940
And those we can tell Google
about it right away as well.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:06.070
I'm assuming delete is high
availability, but if it's not,

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.420
we also set it as
out of stock.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:12.180
Those two things should take
it out of Google quickly.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.430
Removal of content, and also the
other thing was, it's very

00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:21.890
nice for a site like Zazzle
that deals with a lot of

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.840
trending content, to
be able to get

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.630
things up there quickly.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:31.330
You don't want the "Don't Tase
Me, Bro" t-shirt to come out

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:35.080
two weeks after the video,
because by then no one will

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.500
even know what you're
talking about.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.414
DANNY HERMES: Assuming everyone
watching does know.

00:11:40.414 --> 00:11:43.260
I do, but I don't know about
everyone on the internet.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:44.720
ANDREW LAMONICA: I'm not
even sure I remember.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.570
I'm pretty sure there was some
video related to somebody

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.460
being tased, and it was funny
for about two weeks.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.810
But, yes, so that kind
of content needs

00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.930
to be uploaded quickly.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.550
And the Content for Shopping API
gives us the opportunity

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.350
to do that, whereas the big
feed files really didn't.

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.560
Especially because one of the
most time consuming parts of

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.810
uploading the big feed was
picking products to upload.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:20.570
Also another thing that this
saved us, I mentioned that it

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:22.720
was very time consuming to pick
what products to upload,

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:28.660
it was also very hardware
intensive to pull all of that

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:32.590
data out of our data store
in one big batch

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:33.720
and then upload it.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.870
So the Content for Shopping API
lets us do only a subset.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:41.150
And I actually-- before I came
here today-- looked at the

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.400
numbers and I believe that,
even though we're getting

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.780
faster turnaround time and
changing up our feed more

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:52.450
frequently, we are sending a
tenth as much data as we would

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.530
with the big feed files.

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:55.160
AMANDA SURYA: That's
pretty awesome.

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.700
ANDREW LAMONICA: So we got a lot
of advantages and we saved

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.530
resources on probably both sides
of that transaction.

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:01.540
DANNY HERMES: Network
resources if

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:02.520
nothing else, right?

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.130
Even if you don't think
about hardware.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.000
ANDREW LAMONICA:
It's actually--

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.970
one drawback that I've not
encountered recently but I

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:14.070
encountered early on, is that
it actually does take more

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:17.700
bandwidth to send the Content
for Shopping request than it

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:27.350
does to send a giant gzipped
file, but it's so much less

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.780
data that you end up saving
in the long run.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.940
DANNY HERMES: So you're talking
in total length of the

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.300
connection or in
something else?

00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:36.780
ANDREW LAMONICA:
Just in bytes.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:37.240
DANNY HERMES: Really?

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:37.520
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yeah.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:38.550
DANNY HERMES: Wow!

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:41.245
The payloads are big
because of the spec

00:13:41.245 --> 00:13:42.130
and things like that.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:47.440
ANDREW LAMONICA: There's extra
metadata and there's also--

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.140
I suspect there's a way to fix
this, but I haven't found a

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:52.900
good way to upload
gzipped content.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.300
So even though I'm doing
batch requests--

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:54.570
DANNY HERMES: Yeah.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:56.220
It took me a really long
time to get it working.

00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:01.440
It's some header iteration that
you have to get perfect.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.650
But if you get the headers
right it's

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.480
actually not too bad.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.100
We can maybe start a post on
the forum and it's your

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.790
question and I'll post an
answer with the header.

00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:14.030
Somebody actually asked
something about this a few

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.590
months ago.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:14.980
And we--

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:15.220
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yeah,
I saw that.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.270
And I tried to reproduce his
solution it was unsuccessful.

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.000
DANNY HERMES: So maybe we'll
do a deeper down into it.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.400
ANDREW LAMONICA: That
would be good.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.220
Great.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.760
I'm not sure that the bandwidth
expense is the

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:29.530
biggest thing right now, but
it's definitely nice to be

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.900
able to contract those.

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.020
And I assume you can send larger
batches if they're

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.770
gzipped as well, right?

00:14:36.770 --> 00:14:37.140
DANNY HERMES: Yup.

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:39.750
One meg is a hard cap no matter
what's in the payload.

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:44.060
It's not like unzipped one meg
or anything like that.

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.290
For those who aren't familiar,
batch requests are limited.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:49.660
You can put as many products
as you want so long as the

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:54.750
payload doesn't exceed
one megabyte in size.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:56.010
Anyhow, sorry to interrupt.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:05.900
ANDREW LAMONICA: I briefly
mentioned the one drawback--

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:06.300
DANNY HERMES: Feel free.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:07.220
Lay into us.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:07.820
That's all right.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.090
Let's hear it.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:09.500
ANDREW LAMONICA: There's a
couple other small drawbacks

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.000
that I put in my notes here.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.440
Actually, these are mostly
related to complexity.

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:18.300
The Content for Shopping API is
a more complex system and

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:21.860
will require a little bit more
concentration from the

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:27.260
developers than just creating
a giant file and FTPing it.

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.130
The things on my list include
authentication, which is

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.980
certainly more complicated.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.400
We are still using ClientAuth,
and I understand

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.970
that is going away.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.120
So we're going to have to make
that transition to OAuth soon.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:46.230
But even ClientAuth, if you
don't use a library from

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:48.450
Google, can be some
extra work.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.470
DANNY HERMES: Sure.

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.360
Parsing the initial response
back, and getting the correct

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.120
token, and things like that.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:01.230
ANDREW LAMONICA: Another thing
is that it's not ideal for

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:03.600
massive changes.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.180
I think this is mentioned on
the forum, maybe a couple

00:16:07.180 --> 00:16:09.320
times, people saying I
want to change every

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.490
product in my feed.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:17.870
All 100,000, 200,000, 500,000,
and I'm getting timeouts, or

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:19.300
slow down, or errors.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.870
And that's a problem that we
have had very rarely because

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.910
we've optimized the selection
process to minimize the number

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:30.540
of changes made.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:34.190
But if we ever had a big change
like discontinuing a

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:38.490
product, or changing the prices
on everything, or

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:42.740
something like that, I could
see where that might take

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:46.800
several days to actually upload
rather than the file.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.750
DANNY HERMES: I did the math
once and it came out to like

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:49.370
four hours.

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:50.745
On a million products--

00:16:50.745 --> 00:16:51.030
ANDREW LAMONICA: Really?

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.800
DANNY HERMES: But--

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.820
ANDREW LAMONICA: That's
pretty good.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.050
DANNY HERMES: But six million
we just made it to a day, so

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:00.020
maybe I should redo the math.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.560
ANDREW LAMONICA: It might just
be my programming ability.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.000
I haven't quite made it.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.500
I'm multi-threading but maybe
there's some more I could do

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.575
there to get the requests
in there faster.

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:13.990
Although it is nice to just not
have to worry about it to

00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.560
a certain extent.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.990
Once you have the system in
place to update products as

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:22.829
they change, people can make
business decisions to change

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:27.430
products all the time, and those
changes will trickle

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:29.120
into Google.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.340
So I'm not sure that I would
even do a big file upload if I

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.780
had a massive amount
of changes to do.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.710
I might just let things be out
of date for however many hours

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.630
it took to get it there.

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:47.180
The biggest technical
challenge--

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.810
it wasn't really a technical
challenge-- but the biggest

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:54.100
complexity in this system over
the file uploads has got to be

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:58.610
the 30 day time limit.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.920
DANNY HERMES: I'll let
you explain this, but

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.250
this is true for both.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:03.080
ANDREW LAMONICA: It is true.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.470
So it's actually, in both cases,
any product that is not

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.490
updated within 30
days is ejected

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:13.200
from Google's Shopping.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.150
DANNY HERMES: Expired.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:15.400
ANDREW LAMONICA:
Expired, yeah.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.480
So with feed files it's very
easy to think about this,

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:24.100
because if you upload a feed
file every 30 days, or less

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.530
than every 30 days, then
you know that every

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:29.660
product will be safe.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.130
In fact you can kind of--
although I'm sure that there's

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:33.940
a little bit of variance here--
you can kind of just

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.350
assume that whenever you
uploaded the file, every

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.320
product will expire 30
days from that time.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.055
DANNY HERMES: Unless
you explicitly set

00:18:39.055 --> 00:18:40.670
an expiration date.

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:41.170
ANDREW LAMONICA: That's true.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:43.790
You can set a shorter
expiration date.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.670
With the Content for Shopping
API you don't want to upload

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.810
every product, every day,
because that would sort of

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:50.600
defeat the purpose.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.880
DANNY HERMES: And
waste resources.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.290
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yes.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:57.570
So you need to keep track
of when you have

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.410
updated which products.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:03.880
At least that's the way we
solved that problem.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:07.210
Whenever a product is updated,
for whatever reason, either

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:10.980
because it was selected to be a
product given to Google, or

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.250
because it was removed, or
because it's a brand new

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:16.760
product, or something
like that.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:21.780
Or something changed about it,
like the price, we upload that

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:25.730
product to Google, and we keep
track of the timestamp of when

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.940
we uploaded it.

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.230
We also--

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:32.160
and I believe right
now we're using 25

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.320
days just to be safe--

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.790
any product it has not been
uploaded in the last 25 days

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:42.160
is uploaded again.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.460
We have this constant running.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.690
And that's why it's 10%.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.910
It would probably be a lot
smaller if it weren't for the

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:51.340
products being refreshed
periodically.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.960
I understand the need for the
refresh, but that's certainly

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.860
something that you have to think
about when you decide to

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:04.170
do Content for Shopping
API versus feeds.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.550
DANNY HERMES: Sure.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:09.070
BURCU DOGAN: Could you please
give us a little bit more

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.880
detail about your existing
infrastructure?

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.460
ANDREW LAMONICA: Sure.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.170
Right now what we do is--

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.980
We already have an existing
infrastructure on Zazzle to

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.610
notify various interested
modules

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:27.570
about changes to products.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.920
So I hooked into that
infrastructure.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:34.130
And it's not like in line with
the website, but it's just a

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.160
little bit offline
from the website.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.560
So when a product changes, or is
deleted, or something like

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:46.280
that happens, this module is
notified of that change.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:55.100
And I batch up those changes
into Google API batch requests

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.980
and send them across.

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:58.890
And then I get some
feedback on those.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:03.490
And I actually do track the
feedback, both in log files

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:09.710
and I also think I keep one
result for each product, which

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:13.350
helps me know when there are
products that are being

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:16.340
rejected for some reason
or something else.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:19.090
I can decide what to do
with those later.

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:24.550
I can either remove them, or I
can fix them, or I can notify

00:21:24.550 --> 00:21:26.600
content review that this
is a bad product, or

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:27.610
something like that.

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:29.760
DANNY HERMES: So what you're
saying is, for developers out

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.390
there who aren't doing it, you
should be logging at least the

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:35.720
most recent response from the
API so you can go back in and

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.500
play doctor, and figure
out what went wrong.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.890
Why that product got sick.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:40.700
Is that what you're saying?

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.800
ANDREW LAMONICA: I am.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.050
Yes.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.390
You can also--

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.760
AMANDA SURYA: Pro
tip [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.690
DANNY HERMES: Pro
tip from a pro.

00:21:49.690 --> 00:21:51.190
In my opinion.

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.720
ANDREW LAMONICA: You can do what
probably most people do

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:58.150
because Google has such great
tools online to see your

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.860
requests and to see
what has failed.

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.020
You can use that as
a double check.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.630
But it's probably good--

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.360
especially if you have a very
large catalog, more products

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.920
than can be uploaded to Google
under your agreement--

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.940
It's a good idea to check to
see what's happening with

00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.210
those products because it's
certainly not worthwhile to

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:20.300
send the same product that's
going to fail again, and

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.510
again, and again.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.890
You want to take that out, or
take that whole class of

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.480
products out.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.480
And this is probably going to
become more important with the

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.860
AdWords transition because the
AdWords rules are much more

00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.540
strict about what you can
and cannot include.

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:40.870
At least from what I've noticed,
we have a higher

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:42.510
percentage of--

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:43.250
DANNY HERMES: Disapprovals.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.980
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yes,
disapprovals in AdWords than

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:48.030
we ever had with just Content
for Shopping.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:53.090
So Slowly we will work through
those and say, well you can't

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:57.760
do this, you can't do that,
you can't say this word.

00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.220
I know, originally, I had some
people who are putting all

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:03.340
capital titles in there
and other things like.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:04.290
DANNY HERMES: What's
the rule in AdWords

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:05.570
about exclamation points?

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:06.550
You only get one.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.580
Isn't there something
like this?

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.710
ANDREW LAMONICA: You only get
one exclamation point?

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.880
DANNY HERMES: Somebody on the
AdWords DevRel team was

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.660
telling me about this
a couple weeks ago.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.410
ANDREW LAMONICA: That's
a good thing to know.

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.010
I'll probably have to deal
with that one, too.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.265
Some people are very excited
about their t-shirts.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:24.540
The API dashboard--

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:27.010
which I guess you're going
to show that later--

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.500
DANNY HERMES: We'll be talking
about it in a sec.

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.420
ANDREW LAMONICA: Is
really good for

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.890
finding systemic problems.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.490
DANNY HERMES: That's the
word I was thinking of.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:37.570
Maybe I just psychically
put it in your head.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:38.490
ANDREW LAMONICA: And
I have used that.

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.980
I have actually encountered
problems before, where I just

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:44.250
looked at the dashboard
and I knew there

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.250
was something wrong.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:48.350
I had a problem a few months ago
where we were sending too

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.600
many requests.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:52.460
I was confident that the number
that was being sent

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.130
every day was higher
than it should be.

00:23:54.130 --> 00:23:56.240
And it turned out that there was
a problem with the way we

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.630
were deleting products, where
we were deleting them but we

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:01.365
weren't remembering that
we were deleting them.

00:24:01.365 --> 00:24:03.720
So we tried to delete it again,
and we tried to delete

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.070
it again, and we ended
up with a--

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.210
DANNY HERMES: Bunch of 400s.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.330
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yeah,
basically.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:12.540
Google would send back the
response saying product not

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.980
found and I saw that
right in the thing.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:18.580
That that number was
also going up.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.190
And that seemed kind of like
a very good clue to

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.110
what was going on.

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.952
DANNY HERMES: Awesome.

00:24:22.952 --> 00:24:24.250
Awesome use case.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:30.330
AMANDA SURYA: Do you 100% use
Content API for Shopping now

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:34.290
or do something still go
back to the feeds?

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.390
ANDREW LAMONICA: We haven't
uploaded significant feed

00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:42.470
files since we switched over
to the Content for API.

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:46.110
I do occasionally upload a feed
file to check things.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:50.250
I have some test products
that I upload.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:54.650
There's some sort of
undocumented components, like

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:59.630
what happens to text tags that
aren't in the official spec.

00:24:59.630 --> 00:25:01.910
And I want to make sure that
those are doing what I think

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:02.910
they're doing.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.160
There's also--

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:11.120
Google Affiliate Network has a
lot of custom tags, and it's

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.390
nice to be able to, in addition
to sending those

00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.950
Content for Shopping, but it's
nice to be able to upload some

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.220
test products offline, not
through the main system.

00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:25.050
And then ask them, did
you get the products.

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.270
AMANDA SURYA: So mainly
for testing.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:27.530
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yeah.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:33.020
I haven't used it for sending
day-to-day products, and

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.380
there's a good reason
for that.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:42.730
The expiration model on those
is kind of confusing.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:45.850
Because when you upload
a file with a lot

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:48.660
of products it appears--

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:50.140
you guys can correct me
if I'm wrong on this--

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.220
It appears that Google still
treats that as individual

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.990
update requests over a period
of time after you've

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.620
uploaded the files.

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.000
Maybe it's an hour, or maybe
it's just 10 minutes, maybe

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.620
it's five minutes, but during
that time if you do some other

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.140
update request in the Content
for Shopping API, you could

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:09.390
totally lose that.

00:26:09.390 --> 00:26:10.720
So you--

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.420
DANNY HERMES: Race condition.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:12.060
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yeah,

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.000
basically it's a race condition.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.010
That's a programmer's term
for basically two things

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.820
happening at once.

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.050
So when those two things happen
once, the outcome is

00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:23.800
unclear and it's better
to not send the same--

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:26.270
if you are going to separate it,
you need to send different

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:30.500
products, so you're sure that
they don't overlap and don't

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.420
enter into any of these
race conditions.

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.630
You were going to ask
another question.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:35.510
DANNY HERMES: I was?

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.680
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yeah, but I
kind of waylaid you there.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:39.480
DANNY HERMES: No.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.890
I was going to comment.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.970
You were saying sometimes you
use feeds to test stuff out.

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:47.570
The interactive demo can also be
a great tool to test stuff

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:49.850
out if you're sending individual
products or

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:52.680
relatively small payloads that
you can type by hand.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.280
But if you'd rather use--

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.480
ANDREW LAMONICA: I actually
have done that.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:01.020
And I actually do both because
the syntax is subtly different

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.290
between the feeds and the
Content for Shopping API.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.850
There are some different
namespaces and a couple of

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.040
things like that.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:13.570
I also use the really great
structured content API demo

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.160
page to test things.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.880
Especially when I run into some
problem that is a mystery

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.440
to me, like a single request
failing for reasons unknown.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.570
I'll put that put that
in there or I'll

00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:26.320
type it from hand.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.830
And then what I'll do
is I'll just remove

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.480
stuff until it works.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.620
And then I know what--

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:32.390
DANNY HERMES: Binary search
for dummies, right?

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.110
ANDREW LAMONICA: That's a
terrible way to debug, but

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:42.530
it's very effective
on obscure bugs.

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:45.230
I would recommend everybody
try that page.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:49.820
It's a little bit weird with
the multi-client accounts.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.500
You have to be careful about the
ID number because as soon

00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.610
as you log in it resets
the ID number

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:59.210
back to the main account.

00:27:59.210 --> 00:28:00.400
Which is inevitably--

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.780
DANNY HERMES: The ID of the
authenticated user.

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:05.240
ANDREW LAMONICA: And that is
never the account that you

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.850
want to upload products to.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:10.980
DANNY HERMES: You're not allowed
to anyway, right?

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.990
ANDREW LAMONICA: That's
caught me a few times.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.710
I submit and it's like access
denied or something.

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:15.930
I'm like, I don't understand
what's going on here, but then

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:19.460
I realize that it just
change the number.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:24.140
Until you guys get an
opportunity to fix this, you

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.010
should probably log in and
then type the number in.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:27.720
DANNY HERMES: Yup.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.920
And for those who are unfamiliar
with the debug tool

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.860
he was talking about or the demo
tool he's talking about

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:38.600
right now, I'm going to be
posting a link in the actual

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.970
description on YouTube.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:45.480
Just wait until this video
actually ends up in the final

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.530
published mode and
it'll be there.

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:49.310
Do you have anything else you'd
like to add before I

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.370
start to demo?

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.060
ANDREW LAMONICA: No.

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:51.930
DANNY HERMES: OK.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.760
So I've got a very short
demo for everyone.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.630
Andrew was talking about
the debug tool.

00:28:57.630 --> 00:29:00.640
A tool which is nice for
systemic errors.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.430
And for the typical user who
doesn't have an MCA, this

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:05.850
change doesn't affect you.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.200
But for people who are managing
lots of accounts,

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.190
this is a change which can
be pretty helpful.

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:15.280
So I've got my sub
account here.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:18.600
I'm logged in as an
owner of the MCA.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:20.570
So you see here, here's
the parent MCA.

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:22.800
Actually let me zoom a bit.

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.320
So you see here is the parent
MCA name, and then my sub

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.490
account name, Dangoog, I'm Dan,
I work for Goog, right.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.720
So I click the API Dashboard
tab and I

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.800
go see my API Dashboard.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:37.000
I have Flash disabled
by default, so

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.980
let me enable that.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.090
And you see here, by default,
my dashboard tells

00:29:42.090 --> 00:29:44.920
me I have 21 errors.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.920
And that actually is conditional
on a setting that

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:51.150
these are requests
that I have made.

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.720
But if we were to go to the
user setting, we would see

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:58.840
that other than the owner of
the MCA there's also some

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.190
owners or users affiliated just
with the sub account who

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:03.670
could also make requests.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:08.030
So, prior to this, I wouldn't
have actually been able to see

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.320
these requests and all.

00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.900
These are erroneous requests
I've made as the parent

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:14.640
account on behalf of
the child account.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.890
And before this feature launched
I could only see

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.620
those requests within
the dashboard

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:21.450
of the parent account.

00:30:21.450 --> 00:30:23.010
But now I can see them
on the dashboard

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:24.120
for the child account.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.030
But what's more, I can also
say all requests targeting

00:30:28.030 --> 00:30:28.660
this account.

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.240
So instead of just the requests
that I've made, I can

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.190
also see other erroneous
requests.

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.550
So when I load up this map--

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.230
these are all from
earlier today.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.540
Sorry I didn't have time
to get the data in.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.450
The future just launched
today.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:43.180
But we see this number--

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.000
let me zoom even
more if I can.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.700
No, I'm at max zoom.

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.590
For those who can't see, if it's
not a good enough zoom on

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.400
the picture, there are now 41
errors instead of the 21.

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.400
So me and one of
my teammates--

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.570
actually our technical
writer for our team--

00:30:58.570 --> 00:31:02.590
we did a bit of demo with some
errors to actually preload

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.560
this dashboard.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:06.110
And so she actually made
20 more errors.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:09.170
And so we actually see, if
we want to see all errors

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.640
affecting his account, we can
see the ones I made but we can

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.130
also see the ones
everyone made.

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:16.560
So that's the feature that
launched, and I'm happy to

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.210
announce it.

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:20.290
We will be sure to update some
of the documentation in the

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.300
Merchant Center and maybe even
have a blog post for those who

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:27.330
are interested in having
this in written form.

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.140
So before we go to the
moderator queue--

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.160
I haven't had a chance to look
at it yet, but Amanda is going

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.910
to read it to us--

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:37.850
I'd like to outline some changes
around this team and

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:40.720
this particular biweekly
hang out.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.250
So as you may have heard from
Burcu, or if some of you are

00:31:44.250 --> 00:31:47.690
just general Google Developers
Live fans, you may have

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:51.210
noticed that I've been doing a
lot of App Engine Hangouts

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:52.910
with the App Engine team.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.810
And I also did one with
the YouTube team on

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:56.710
behalf of App Engine.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:00.020
And I'm going to moving full
time over to App Engine.

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:04.060
And Burcu is going to be taking
my place full-time.

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.290
And she's going to be working
closer with the ads folks than

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:10.740
I was, which is obviously going
to benefit everyone.

00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.230
But she's also going to be
physically closer to the API

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:15.620
engineering team, which I think
is also going to be a

00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:17.030
huge benefit to everyone.

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:21.170
So I'm sad to go, but I'm
excited for new things.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:23.930
And before we jump on the
moderator, I'll give Burcu a

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:28.525
chance to talk a bit about
herself, and tell you guys--

00:32:28.525 --> 00:32:32.710
BURCU DOGAN: This is actually
my second week at Google.

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:34.480
DANNY HERMES: Third.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.410
BURCU DOGAN: Yeah, third.

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:39.180
I've been working as a software
engineer for six

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:45.710
years and I worked on very
diverse fields, from telecoms,

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:52.050
to mobile, from maps, to
gamification, and this is

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:54.860
going to be a great challenge
for me as well.

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.490
So I'm very glad to be here.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:05.210
I hope that developer community
will grow because

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:08.200
there are a lot of things
coming interesting.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.390
And I'm taking Danny's
place, but--

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:17.155
DANNY HERMES: So I think she's
probably more than capable.

00:33:17.155 --> 00:33:18.350
I think--

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.280
BURCU DOGAN: What would you
like to add, Danny?

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.560
DANNY HERMES: That
she will probably

00:33:21.560 --> 00:33:22.830
embarrass me as an engineer.

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:24.530
She's phenomenal.

00:33:24.530 --> 00:33:27.025
You guys are being left
in great hands.

00:33:27.025 --> 00:33:28.540
BURCU DOGAN: Thank you, Danny.

00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:33.560
AMANDA SURYA: And with the team
changes, we might also

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.550
change the structure
of this show.

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.420
And that's still being
worked out.

00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:42.820
Stay tuned for updates.

00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:44.230
DANNY HERMES: Usually we
announce the next one.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:45.830
We're not sure when the
next one will be.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:49.300
We'll certainly still do them,
but every two weeks, the

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.170
frequency may change.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:53.440
And I guess with that, I'll let

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.940
Amanda go to the moderator.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:56.770
What are we looking at?

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.170
AMANDA SURYA: So, we have
a couple of questions.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:05.390
The first question, if products
are submitted via the

00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:09.270
Content API are the same
requirements for showing tax

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:13.530
and shipping enforced
as with feeds?

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:14.070
DANNY HERMES: Sure.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.590
Good question.

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:21.010
Andrew wants to answer, but
I'll answer this one.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:24.920
You can think of feeds files and
the Content API as sort of

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.219
doors to the same house.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:30.560
The data ends up in the same
place and, as a result, has

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:33.620
the same requirements.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.300
So if you're not going to
include tax and shipping,

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.409
either with feeds files or the
API, it has to be an account

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:40.270
level setting.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.929
And that's always the same.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:45.489
So the spec is not any different
for what actually

00:34:45.489 --> 00:34:46.409
needs to be in your data.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:48.060
Like I said, doors to
the same house.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.600
Once it gets in, it goes through
the same sort of

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.920
validation, though the
synchronicity of this

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.240
validation is very different.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:03.600
And in cases like the express
pipeline for the Content API

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:06.620
which allows changes to make it
into Google Search Index in

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.040
a matter of minutes rather than
a matter of hours, the

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:11.840
Content API is clearly
superior.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.800
What's next question?

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.010
AMANDA SURYA: All Right.

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:16.035
So this is more for Zazzle.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:23.460
So this person--

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:28.020
frustrated but hopeful,
that's his user name--

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.720
he's curious about how
Zazzle uses the API.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:40.160
Especially around filtering
junk content, or queries.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.850
How do you make sure that--

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:44.030
I guess you're also marketplace,
right--

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:47.620
so how do you make sure that
the content that you're

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:53.090
uploading, the products that
you're uploading to Google is

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:56.740
following the terms
of service.

00:35:56.740 --> 00:35:58.660
ANDREW LAMONICA: This is
actually probably one of the

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:05.040
most complicated parts of the
feed program that we employee.

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.830
Especially because Google is
not the only place that we

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:10.160
send product data too, and
everybody has slightly

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.410
different rules.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:17.470
There's some kind of basic
rules that are built into

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.020
Zazzle already that we follow.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:26.210
For example, Zazzle users are
allowed to give their product

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:30.110
a maturity rating, and we use
that to make sure that we

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:34.160
don't send adults only products
or something like

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.990
that to Google.

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:42.590
We also have our own content
review team that works on

00:36:42.590 --> 00:36:46.450
making sure the copyright
things are followed.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:49.140
BURCU DOGAN: They are doing
this by hand or--

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:52.250
ANDREW LAMONICA: They have a
whole workflow by themselves.

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:55.570
They have scripts, and they do
it by hand, and they have some

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.240
automated suggestions,
and things like that.

00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:05.020
But I hooked into that system as
well to make sure that I'm

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:09.760
not selling anything that
we think is not good.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.110
But then I also just
have some rules.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.810
Google frowns on all
capital titles, so

00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:20.630
I've just remove that.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:24.300
Yes I also frown on those.

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:27.880
I have not used to the
new API for finding--

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.350
DANNY HERMES: Data
quality feed?

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:30.840
ANDREW LAMONICA: Data quality
issues, but I've use the

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:33.640
website sort of informally to
go on there and look and see

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.420
what's been rejected
programmatically and then I

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:42.000
just apply those rules to
my selection process.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.840
I believe I mentioned earlier
that one of the most time and

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:49.430
resource consuming parts is
selecting the products.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.940
One of the reasons is because
we need to check those

00:37:51.940 --> 00:37:57.030
products for potential problems
like all capital

00:37:57.030 --> 00:38:02.550
titles, or bad words, or too
short, the title could be too

00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:05.300
short, description could be
too long, or it could have

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:11.030
some kind of weird XML in it
that maybe Google doesn't want

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.260
to display on their site.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.930
so it's a pretty manually
implemented process.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:20.480
And it's different for
every feed consumer.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:24.545
AMANDA SURYA: And how about
on the Google side, Danny?

00:38:24.545 --> 00:38:24.800
Any insight?

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:26.250
DANNY HERMES: As for what?

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.430
AMANDA SURYA: There's
a lot of filtering.

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:29.885
BURCU DOGAN: Data quality
and relations.

00:38:29.885 --> 00:38:32.520
AMANDA SURYA: Data quality,
signals--

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.930
DANNY HERMES: So what
in particular are

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.660
you hoping I'll share?

00:38:36.660 --> 00:38:38.940
ANDREW LAMONICA: Please give
us a list of words that we

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.940
cannot use.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:40.940
AMANDA SURYA: Not that.

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.900
DANNY HERMES: As far as things
like that, we have

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.850
some tools in place.

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:46.600
So the great thing--

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.190
I say this a lot.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:50.450
I kind of feel like a broken
record-- but the great thing

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:54.440
about the API is that we
have two stages of

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:55.630
validation for the data.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:59.660
One is the initial stage to make
it into the house, but

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:01.990
then from there you
have to make it

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:03.060
further into the house.

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.190
So the first stage of validation
is like, the

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:10.160
payload you send is valid XML,
or all the required attributes

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.690
are sent, things like this.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:16.220
But there are more complex
things that

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:17.190
happen after the fact.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:18.130
So we have two stages.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.250
First stage, we'll just say
immediate rejection.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:24.200
You didn't send a required
element, you didn't provide a

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.710
title that was long enough, you
didn't actually send XML,

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:32.870
right, or something that our
parsers understand as XML.

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.860
But then there's a second stage
which will check for

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.430
other things like bad words, or
certain things that maybe

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:41.300
we don't want to display,
or websites they

00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.010
don't actually work.

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.150
For your case, since you
guys are hosting all

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.560
content, is the case?

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:52.050
So when you're checking quality
data for users, they

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:55.000
upload content, but after
they've uploaded, you host it.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.280
So you don't have the
same sort of issue.

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:00.630
You're not going to check
against yourself for the

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:03.280
quality of a webpage,
but these are issues

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.300
that we deal with.

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.960
Whether it's API or not,
either way we're

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:08.550
dealing with this.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:12.370
Is that what you were
hoping I would say?

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:15.360
AMANDA SURYA: Well that's pretty
much it in terms of the

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.330
questions in the moderator.

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:19.510
DANNY HERMES: So I think
we'll wrap up.

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:22.460
Amanda, I think maybe you had a
public service announcement

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.630
that you wanted to make.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:24.350
AMANDA SURYA: Yes.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:27.040
Our team is hiring.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.220
If you're interested--

00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:29.476
ANDREW LAMONICA: So Is ours.

00:40:29.476 --> 00:40:31.460
DANNY HERMES: No, seriously.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.560
AMANDA SURYA: If you're
interested in joining in our

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.940
team, you can check out
our job openings at

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.920

DANNY HERMES: OK.

What about Zazzle's
job openings?

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.950
ANDREW LAMONICA: I bet it's
slash jobs, but I'm going to

00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:44.490
be kind of dumb--

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:45.900
DANNY HERMES: Let me
see, I'll race you.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:51.780
ANDREW LAMONICA: Yup.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.200
That is a really ugly
page, but--

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:54.870
DANNY HERMES: Whatever,
it'll work.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:56.750

not going far.

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.050
Thank you everybody.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:11.840
BURCU DOGAN: Thank you.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.090
AMANDA SURYA: Bye-bye.
