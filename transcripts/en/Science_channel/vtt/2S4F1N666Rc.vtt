00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:04.000
♪♪

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.934
THE BOMB SUIT CAN
WITHSTAND A BLAST FROM UP

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:09.501
TO 5 KILOGRAMS OF C4
FROM 3 METERS AWAY.

00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:11.434
ONE OF THE KEY INGREDIENTS
THAT GOES INTO A BOMB SUIT

00:00:11.434 --> 00:00:12.934
IS A MATERIAL CALLED KEVLAR.

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:16.000
KEVLAR IS AN EXAMPLE OF
A SUPER-STRONG ARAMID POLYMER.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.701
IT'S MADE BY
MANIPULATING MOLECULES

00:00:17.701 --> 00:00:19.834
SO THAT THEY BOND TOGETHER
IN PARALLEL LINES,

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:22.067
FORMING AN INCREDIBLY
STRONG MATERIAL.

00:00:22.067 --> 00:00:23.367
IT TAKES A GREAT DEAL OF ENERGY

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:25.334
FOR A PROJECTILE TO PASS
THROUGH THE FABRIC

00:00:25.334 --> 00:00:26.834
BECAUSE THE POLYMER MOLECULES

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:28.667
ARE EXTREMELY HARD
TO PUSH APART.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:30.667
A PROJECTILE HAS
ITS ENERGY STOLEN FROM IT

00:00:30.667 --> 00:00:32.534
AS IT TRIES TO FIGHT
ITS WAY THROUGH.

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:34.567
Narrator: ANOTHER CRUCIAL
LAYER OF PROTECTION

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:35.834
IS THE BLAST PLATE.

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:38.334
IF THERE IS A BOMB
THAT EXPLODES IN FRONT OF YOU,

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:40.334
THERE'S A SHOCK WAVE
THAT COMES OUT FROM IT.

00:00:40.334 --> 00:00:42.033
AND THIS BLAST PLATE
WILL PROTECT YOU.

00:00:42.033 --> 00:00:45.100
THE BLAST PLATE IS MADE OF STEEL
AND IS CANTILEVERED

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.667
SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE FLEXIBILITY

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:48.501
IN BENDING OVER
TO REACH THE BOMB.

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:50.834
AN ILL-FITTING SUIT
COULD INHIBIT YOUR FLEXIBILITY.

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:53.234
AND YOU NEED TO BE
REALLY FLEXIBLE AND NIMBLE

00:00:53.234 --> 00:00:55.667
TO DO THE DELICATE TASK
OF DEACTIVATING A BOMB.

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:57.434
THE OUTER LAYER'S
CALLED THE CARRIER.

00:00:57.434 --> 00:00:58.834
AND IT'S MADE OF NOMEX,

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:00.434
WHICH IS
A FIRE-RETARDANT POLYMER.

00:01:00.434 --> 00:01:02.734
IT'S ANOTHER ARAMID POLYMER
LIKE KEVLAR.

00:01:02.734 --> 00:01:04.701
BUT INSTEAD OF BEING
RESISTANT TO PUNCTURE,

00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:05.968
IT'S RESISTANT TO HEAT.

00:01:05.968 --> 00:01:08.601
Narrator: NOMEX IS A VERY POOR
CONDUCTOR OF HEAT

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.334
AND WILL NOT MELT OR DRIP.

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:12.601
ALTHOUGH IT WILL IGNITE,
IT TAKES ABOUT TWICE

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.667
AS LONG AS COTTON TO CATCH FIRE.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:15.968
AND WHEN THE HEAT IS REMOVED,

00:01:15.968 --> 00:01:17.467
IT IMMEDIATELY STOPS BURNING.

00:01:17.467 --> 00:01:19.567
THESE BOMBS SUITS ARE OBVIOUSLY
BULKY, AS THEY SHOULD BE.

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:21.133
YOU'RE TRYING NOT
TO GET BLOWN UP.

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:22.801
AGAIN, THAT'S
THE ESSENTIAL THING

00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.801
WITH THESE BOMBS SUITS --
DON'T GET BLOWN UP.

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:27.033
SINCE THE SUITS WEIGH
AROUND 70 POUNDS,

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:28.601
E.O.D. TECHNICIANS
HAVE TO BE TESTED

00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:30.534
TO PROVE THEY CAN
CARRY THE WEIGHT.

00:01:30.534 --> 00:01:32.033
I WOULD TOTALLY
TRY ON A BOMB SUIT.

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:33.701
I WOULDN'T GO NEAR
ANY BOMBS IN IT,

00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:35.434
BUT I WOULD
DEFINITELY TRY ONE ON.

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:37.601
I SHARE MY BOMB SUIT
WITH EVERYBODY ON MY TEAM,

00:01:37.601 --> 00:01:39.434
WHICH IS USUALLY
TWO TO THREE OTHER PEOPLE.

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:40.567
YOU SWEAT A LOT.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.334
Haislip: UH, ON THE OTHER HAND,

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:45.067
IF A GUY HAD BEEN
WEARING IT OUT IN THE SUN,

00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:47.734
I'D REALLY HAVE TO LIKE HIM
TO PUT THAT SUIT ON.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:51.467
ONE THING THAT'S INTERESTING
ABOUT A BOMB-SUIT GLOVE,

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:52.667
WHEN YOU FIRST SEE IT,

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:54.100
YOU'RE LIKE,
"OH, IS THAT INVISIBLE?"

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.767
AND, NO, NO. THEY JUST DON'T
WEAR GLOVES A LOT OF THE TIME.

00:01:56.767 --> 00:01:58.767
LIKE, WHAT IS UP WITH THAT?

00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:01.000
Narrator: THAT'S BECAUSE,
WHEN IT COMES TO BOMB DISPOSAL,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.767
DEXTERITY WITH YOUR HANDS
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:08.000
THERE ARE SOME BOMB-SUIT GLOVES.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.300
BUT FOR THE MOST PART,

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.834
YOU WANT PRECISION
OVER PROTECTION.

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:14.167
HAVING DEXTERITY
IS MORE IMPORTANT

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:16.501
THAN PROTECTING YOUR DIGITS
FROM A BLAST

00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:18.501
BECAUSE, THE MORE DEXTERITY
THAT YOU HAVE,

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:20.968
THE LESS LIKELY IT IS
THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A BLAST.

00:02:20.968 --> 00:02:22.601
I THINK IF I HAD AN ACCESSORY
ON A BOMB SUIT

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:24.234
IT WOULD JUST BE, LIKE, A BUTTON

00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:26.067
THAT'S JUST A PORTAL INTO SPACE
AND TIME

00:02:26.067 --> 00:02:27.400
TO GET ME OUT OF THE SITUATION

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.467
AND DOING SOMETHING
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT.
