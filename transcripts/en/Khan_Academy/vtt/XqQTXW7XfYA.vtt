00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.550
Let's say I have 3 chairs.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.210
They'll just be
blanks: 1, 2, and 3.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.210
3 chairs, and I have 7 people.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.310
I'll call them people A, B,
C, D, E-- how many is that?

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.630
That's 5-- F, G.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.420
So we have 7 people and what
I want to know is how many

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.400
different ways can these 7
people sit in these 3 chairs?

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.850
Well, before anyone sits down
if we just pick a chair, these

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.620
are just arbitrary labels for
the chairs, but let's start at

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.310
the left with chair number one.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.760
If no one is sitting down, how
many different people could

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.130
sit down in chair one?

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.310
Well, 7 people are standing up,
no one is sitting in any of the

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.480
chairs, so 7 different people
could sit in chair one.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.070
So there are 7 possibilities
for chair one.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.880
So 1 of those 7 possibilities
is going to sit

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.400
down in chair one.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.060
So how many people are
left to sit in chair two?

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.960
Well, 1 less than 7, right?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.310
6 people are going to be
left to sit in chair two.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.130
And then of course, if 2 people
are already sitting down, how

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.480
many people are left to
sit in chair three?

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.690
Well, there's going to
be 5 possibilities.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.640
So a way to think about it, for
each of these possibilities,

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.940
there are 6 possibilities in
this chair and 5 possibilities

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.980
in that chair for
each of those 6.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.760
So you would multiply all
of the possibilities.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.830
Hopefully that
makes some sense.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.320
We'll try it out
with some examples.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.140
So the total number of
possibilities in this

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.170
case is 7 times 6 times
5, and what is that?

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.500
6 times 5 is 30.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.950
30 times 7 equals 210.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.700
There's 210 possibilities.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.470
That's a lot of possibilities.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.000
Let's do a slightly
smaller example.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.530
I mean we don't have to
do people in chairs.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.770
Let's say we have cups.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.880
And I'll do the cups
in a different color.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.560
So this is 1 cup, cup one.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.300
And then I have cup two.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.720
And then I have 3 balls.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.610
I have a magenta ball, I
have a brown ball, and

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.180
I have a yellow ball.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.570
And I want to know, how many
different ways can I put these

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.620
3 balls into these 2 cups?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.820
Well, assuming that I haven't
put any of the balls into any

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.130
of the cups as yet, how many
balls-- well, let's just

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.750
start with cup two.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.410
I just want to show you that
you don't have to start at the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.620
cup that happens to be labeled
number one sitting on the left.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.380
If we haven't put any balls
into any of the cups, how

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.790
many can we put in cup two?

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.280
Well, there's 3
possibilities, right?

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.720
And for each of those
3 then, how many can

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.750
we put into cup one?

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.240
Well, we would've put 1 into
here, so there will be 2

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.300
left to put into cup two.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.480
So it'd be 3 times 2
possibilities, which

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.420
is equal to 6.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.560
And let's see if we
can draw them out.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.010
Let me number these cups
because it's going to be

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.820
too difficult to keep
switching colors.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:10.690
So let's say this
is A, B, and C.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.440
I'm going to show you that
there are 6 ways of putting

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.040
these 3 balls into
these 2 cups.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.460
So it could be A in cup
one, B in cup two.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.770
It could be B in cup
one, A in cup two.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.740
Right, you could
just switch them.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.740
So we actually care which
ball goes into what cup.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.670
Not just is a ball in a cup.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.870
It could be A with C.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.800
A in cup one, C in cup two.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.270
It could be C in cup
one, A in cup two.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.390
And then finally, you
could just have B and C.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.530
B in cup one, C in cup two.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.780
Or C in cup one, B in cup two.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.440
And notice, if we just cared
which of the balls were picked,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.890
but we didn't care whether they
were in cup one or cup two, we

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.270
could get rid of this bottom
line and there would be 1/2

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:05.180
as many ways to place them.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.480
But when we care where the
balls are-- we care whether

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.340
they're in cup one or cup two,
or in this case we care if

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.530
they're in seat one,
two, or three.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.170
The ways in which we're
ordering, we call

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.730
these permutations.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.060
And up here, the way we would
write this permutation, we

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.050
would say, well, how many ways
can we fit 7 people into 3

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.970
chairs if we care about what
chair they're sitting in?

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.900
So we could write that as 7
people-- and the p isn't

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.650
for people, it's for
permutations-- into 3 chairs.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.560
And another notation for it,
you write a big P and you

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.380
say, how many ways can I
put 7 things into 3 spaces?

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.220
Or it could be written as,
how many ways could you put

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.100
7 things into 3 spaces?

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.060
And in this case, we
got the answer is 210.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.790
And actually, it
will always be 210.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.920
And I'll show you
why in a second.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.160
How would we write this?

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.990
Well, this would be--
I'll do it in green.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.520
We had 3 things and we
put it into 2 spaces.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.690
So 3 things into 2 spaces.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.770
That's the same thing as 3
things into 2 spaces, which

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.160
is equal to 3 things
into 2 spaces.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.850
I'm just showing you the
different notations, and we

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.480
figured out that that was 6.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.230
Let's see if we can figure
out a general formula if

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.700
we wanted to evaluate nPk.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.805
How many ways can we fit
n things into k spaces?

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.740
So if we think about it,
let's just use some analogy.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.940
We'll have k spots, so it'll
be 1 spot, 2 spots, 3 spots,

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.980
all the way to k spots.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.790
In the first spot there's n
possibilities, just like we

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.670
did in the last two examples.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.580
There's n possibilities there.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.980
Then, since 1 person or 1 thing
will be placed in spot one,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.300
there's going to be n minus 1
possibilities for spot two.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.660
And similarly, n minus 2
possibilities for spot three.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.360
And then, we could follow that
pattern all the way, and how

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.855
many possibilities are there
going to be for spot k?

00:06:24.855 --> 00:06:28.520
Well in everything it's n
minus 1 thing less than the

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.690
spot number in our case.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.150
I mean I guess we could have
started with spot 0, but this

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.550
is better because we actually
numbered all the way to k.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:42.270
So it will be n
minus k minus 1.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.400
And that might seem
complicated, but

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.000
it makes sense.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:55.350
When we did 7 things into 3
spots we went 7 times 6 times--

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.130
we literally put in the top
three of you could almost

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:01.800
say from the factorial.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.140
7 factorial will be
7 times 6 times 5.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.330
I think this will help.

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.750
If this was just 3 was so
7 times 6 times 5 times 4

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.350
times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.650
That's 7 factorial.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.660
But we only took the first
3 of the factorial.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.110
And similarly, 6-- well,
6 is also 3 factorial.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.410
But another way you could view
it is we only took the first 2

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:28.130
of 3 factorial So what we're
saying here is we just take

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.230
the first k of n factorial.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.010
So is there any easy
way to write that?

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:40.480
To write the first
k of n factorial.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.040
Why sure.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.020
We could write it as n
factorial and the formula's

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.170
almost harder than
what it's saying.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.370
We could write it as n
factorial-- it;s a lower

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:58.920
case n-- n factorial over
n minus k factorial.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.930
Let's see if that works.

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.000
Well, what's going to happen?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.010
So in this case, n
factorial was 7.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.760
So it was 7 times 6
times 5 times 4 times

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.020
3 times 2 times 1.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.890
And then what was n
minus k factorial?

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.480
Well, in our example, k
was the number of spots,

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.650
and there were 3 spots.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.440
So 7 minus 3 is 4,
so 4 factorial.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.590
4 times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:30.460
And of course,
this will cancel.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.080
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.940
This will cancel with this,
and so you're just left with

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:41.090
the first 3 of 7 factorial.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:46.590
The 3 largest components
of 7 factorial.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.740
I always rederive this because
all I think of is what

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:50.460
we did originally.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.500
I was like, oh, OK.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:55.530
If we're doing permutations,
I just start the factorial

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:56.760
until I run out of spots.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.310
I do 7 times 6 times 5.

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:01.290
And let's see if it
works out here too.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:05.450
So what is 3 factorial because
we have 3 different things?

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:10.820
3 factorial over-- and
then 3 minus 2 factorial.

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.190
Well, that's just 1 factorial.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:22.300
So it becomes 3 times
2 times 1 over 1.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:25.680
And of course, the 1's cancel
out and we got the 3 times 2.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.890
Hopefully that make sense.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:31.050
A lot of people, they learn the
permutation notation and they

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.370
say, oh, that's n factorial
over n minus k factorial, where

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:37.450
n is the number of things I
need to place and n minus

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.630
the whole thing factorial.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:42.200
And k is the number
of spots I have.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.210
And they just memorize it.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:49.330
But all this is saying is you
start doing the n factorial,

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:53.320
but you only do the first 3
components of the factorial.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.810
And it makes sense just from
how we started off the video.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:58.950
If you 7 things, well, 7 things
could go here, 6 things could

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.740
go here, 5 things
could go here.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.580
