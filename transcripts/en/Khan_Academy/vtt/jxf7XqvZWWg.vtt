00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:02.430
Let's do another example,
and this time we're

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.080
going to rotate our function
around a vertical line that

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.994
is not the y-axis.

00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:08.410
And if we do that--
so we're going

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.300
to rotate y is equal
to x squared minus 1--

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.800
or at least this
part of it-- we're

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.670
going to rotate it
around the vertical line

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.660
x is equal to negative 2.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.520
And if we do that, we
get this gumball shape

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.880
that looks something like this.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.463
So what I want to
do is I want to find

00:00:21.463 --> 00:00:23.840
the volume of this
using the disc method.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.730
So what I want to do is
construct some discs.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.860
So that's one of the
discs right over here.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.240
It's going to have some
depth, and that depth

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.230
is going to be dy
right over there.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.930
And it's going to have
some area on top of it

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.210
that is a function of
any given y that I have.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:48.950
So the volume of a
given disc is going

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.660
to be the area as
a function of y

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.399
times the depth of
the disc times dy.

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.690
And then we just have to
integrate it over the interval

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.340
that we care about, and we're
doing it all in terms of y.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.090
And in this case, we're
going to integrate

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.892
from y is equal
to-- well, this is

00:01:03.892 --> 00:01:05.850
going to hit-- this
y-intercept right over here

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.480
is y is equal to negative 1.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.610
And let's go all the
way to y is equal to,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.470
let's say y is equal
to 3 right over here.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.580
So from y equal negative
1 to y equals 3.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.080
And that's going to
give us the volume

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.010
of our upside-down
gumdrop-type-looking thing.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.880
So the key here, so
that we can start

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.520
evaluating the double
integral, is to just figure out

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.520
what the area of each of these
discs are as a function of y.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.960
And we know that area
as a function of y

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.760
is just going to be pi times
radius as a function of y

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.550
squared.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.860
So the real key is, what is
the radius as a function of y

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.200
for any one of these y's?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.486
So what is the radius
as a function of y?

00:01:56.486 --> 00:01:58.110
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.510
What is this curve?

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.226
Well, let's write it
as a function of y.

00:02:01.226 --> 00:02:03.600
If you add 1 to both sides--
and I'm going to swap sides,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.980
so you'll get x squared
is equal to y plus 1.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.180
I just added 1 to both sides
and then swapped sides.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.980
And you get x is equal
to the principal root

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.662
of the square root of y plus 1.

00:02:15.662 --> 00:02:20.120
So this we can write as x-- or
we can even write it as f of y

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.780
if we want-- f of y is equal
to the square root of y plus 1.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.940
Or we could say x is equal
to a function of y, which

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.726
is the square root of y plus 1.

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:34.380
So what's the distance
here at any point?

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.640
Well, this distance-- let
me make it very clear.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.730
So it's going to be
our total distance

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.020
in the horizontal direction.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.810
So this first part as we're--
and I'm going to do it

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.270
in a different
color so we can see.

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.600
So this part right
over here is just

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.454
going to be the value
of the function.

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:52.870
It's going to give
you an x value.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.950
But then you have to add another
2 to go all the way over here.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.080
So your entire radius
as a function of y

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.875
is going to be equal to the
square root of y plus 1.

00:03:05.875 --> 00:03:08.620
This essentially will give
you one of these x values when

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.430
you're sitting on this curve,
this x as a function of y,

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.100
it'll give you one
of these x values.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.534
And then from that, you
add another 2, so plus 2.

00:03:17.534 --> 00:03:19.950
Another way of thinking about
it, you get an x value here,

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.070
and from that x value
you subtract out x

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.102
is equal to negative 2.

00:03:26.102 --> 00:03:28.060
And when you subtract x
is equal to negative 2,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.370
you're adding 2 here.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.230
But hopefully, this
makes intuitive sense.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.600
This is the x value-- let
me do this in a better

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.940
color-- this right over here,
this distance right over here,

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.280
is the x value you
get when you just

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.595
evaluate the function of y.

00:03:41.595 --> 00:03:43.220
But then if you wanted
the full radius,

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.470
you have to go another
2 to go to the center

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.460
of our axis of rotation.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.070
Once again, if you just take
a given y right over there,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.210
you evaluate the y,
you get an x value.

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.480
That x value will just
give you this distance.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.490
If you want the full distance,
you have to subtract negative 2

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.200
from that x value,
which is essentially

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.530
the same thing as adding
2 to get our full radius.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.310
So our radius as a function of
y is this thing right over here.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.380
So substituting
back into this, we

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.190
can now write our definite
integral for our volume.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.329
The volume is going to be
equal to the definite integral

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:24.800
from negative 1 to 3 of pi
times our radius squared dy.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.390
So I can write the
pi out here-- we've

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.420
done this multiple times--
times radius squared--

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:35.770
so it's going to be square root
of y plus 1 plus 2 squared--

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.830
that's our radius-- times dy.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.010
So we've set up the
definite integral.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.130
And now we just have
to evaluate this thing.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.310
And I'll save that
for the next video.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.150
And I encourage you to
try this out on your own.
