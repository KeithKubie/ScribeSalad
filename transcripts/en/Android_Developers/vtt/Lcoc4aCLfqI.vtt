[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:08.702
VICTOR TSARAN: Hello, everyone.

00:00:08.702 --> 00:00:09.880
AUDIENCE: Hi!

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.760
VICTOR TSARAN: Fabulous.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.990
My name is Victor Tsaran.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.570
I'm an Android accessibility
technical program manager,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.490
and we're super happy that you
decided to spend the next 40

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.910
minutes of your time
at this conference

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.190
with us learning about
accessibility and about

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.170
related work we do at Google.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.730
So thank you for
that, and that's cool.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.780
So why we're here today--

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.000
in this session, we
would like to showcase

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.120
how access to surrounding
environment, information,

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.510
and technology can empower
people with disabilities

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.100
to be productive and
independent in their lives.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.200
According to World
Health Organization,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.780
there's over one billion people
with disabilities in the world.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.270
That's nine zeros.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.560
150 million of these people
have difficulty performing even

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.390
the most basic of daily tasks.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.230
For example, some of
us take for granted

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.550
picking up a glass of water,
or walking out of the house

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.090
to your favorite
restaurant, or listening

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.410
to a video on YouTube,
or finding something

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.170
in a low lighting conditions.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.460
For other people, these tasks
aren't so easily achievable.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.800
Technology has an amazing
power to change that.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.340
In fact, if you think
about it, for millennia,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.480
humanity has been developing
low and high tech gadgets.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.520
I'll give you a few
examples-- wheel.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.060
Sorry, no Nobel
Prize for this one,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.570
but fire, clock,
typewriter, smartphone.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.840
All of these things we have been
creating so that we can improve

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.145
the quality of our lives.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.780
For some people, this
is just to improve

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.060
the quality of their lives.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.770
Yet for others, like for
people with disabilities,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.060
these gadgets, these new
technical advancements,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.040
made it possible, in many cases,
enabled to live their lives.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.900
I, for example, being
completely blind,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.070
could not do my work at Google
without assistive technology

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.830
or computers or other tools that
help me to do very basic things

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.270
in my life--

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.050
paying bills, taxes,
what have you.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.350
So in this case,
again, technology

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:47.630
is just super
important, and today, we

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.440
would like to talk to you
about some of that technology.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.710
Now, some of you
probably in the audience

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.340
have experienced low
lighting conditions,

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.770
where you were trying
to find something,

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.210
or how about a
shaky train, where

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.626
you were trying
to read something,

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:05.900
the book that you'd
been waiting for so long

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.120
to pick up and read.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.230
Many things, right?

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.610
You might remember
discomfort and frustration

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.340
that you find yourself grappling
with when finding yourself

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.420
in such circumstances.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.050
You probably wouldn't want
discomfort and frustration

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.480
to be companion for
the rest of your life,

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.510
but unfortunately for many
people with disabilities,

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.650
it is.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.780
They have to live with this.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.310
Now, technology, as
I mentioned before,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.360
has an amazing power
to change, if not

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.910
all of that, then certainly
a lot of these things.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.340
We at Google actually create
some of that technology.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.730
I think we know something
about technology at Google.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.720
We create that
technology, and since we

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.090
create that technology,
we feel like we have you

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.660
here for that purpose,
so we can tell you

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.310
about things we create.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.200
Over the last year,
we've been working

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.960
hard on creating
some of the new tools

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.700
to help people
with disabilities,

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.890
but also create new APIs and
frameworks to help developers

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.310
like you to create
more accessible apps

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.570
and more inclusive products.

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.960
With that, I would like to
invite Brian to talk to you,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.020
to kick off our marathon
and to talk about--

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.502
well, where is Brian?

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:31.710
BRIAN KEMLER: I'm right here.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.400
VICTOR TSARAN: Oh, you're here.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.790
BRIAN KEMLER: I'm here.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.890
VICTOR TSARAN: All right.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:35.580
Here's-- here goes Brian.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.720
Welcome, Brian.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.510
BRIAN KEMLER: Thank you, Victor.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.380
Thank you, everybody.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.010
My name is Brian Kemler,
and I'm a product manager

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.170
on Android Accessibility.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.810
I'm excited to discuss
our new accessibility

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.840
services and the APIs
that make them possible.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.870
Now, let's dive
in and discuss how

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.140
we're innovating in this space.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.130
First, I'm going to talk about
what we're doing in Android P

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.190
to make hearing conversations
a little easier.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.860
Listening is difficult even in
a quiet field with no background

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.920
noise and a large set of
ears, but the everyday reality

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.420
is we live, work, and
play with an increasing

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.280
amount of environmental noise.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.500
In fact, unwanted sound
is one of the most common

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.990
environmental problems.

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.510
It's not only annoying,
but it prevents us

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.880
from understanding our
colleagues, friends,

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.400
and loved ones.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.700
No matter how well
we can hear, most of

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.820
us can relate to the following
acoustically challenging

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.770
situations--

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:54.230
listening to your dinner
date in a loud restaurant,

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.670
trying to listen to a caller
in a loud airport lounge,

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:04.320
listening to our presenter
who is speaking too softly,

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.930
like me right now.

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.750
One could think about
environmental noise

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.840
as a form of
situational disability,

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.810
but what if you could
turn down the noise

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.700
and boost the signal
on your smartphone

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.640
so you would never
miss the conversation?

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:29.610
Now you can, because today we're
introducing Sound Amplifier.

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.760
Sound Amplifier is a new
accessibility service

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.170
that helps users focus on
real world conversations using

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.690
only an Android smartphone
and a set of headphones.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:46.110
Users can tune hundreds
of personalized levels

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:48.330
to optimize their
listening experience

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.820
to the current environment.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.000
Its two sliders, for
loudness and tuning,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.930
dynamically adjust
over 100 audio presets

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.520
in the background.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.370
The settings can then
be independently applied

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.110
to each ear.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.800
Adjusting them provides
ambient sound--

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.790
improves ambient sound quality
in a vast array of scenarios,

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.430
including enhancing sound in
loud, distant, or far away

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:23.640
spaces, increasing the volume
of somebody who speaks softly,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.340
turning up the TV
to a volume that's

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.420
understandable and acceptable
for everybody in the room.

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.910
Now, I'm going to
briefly explain

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.390
how it was built using the new
dynamics processing effect.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.430
Sound Amplifier was built on the
new dynamics processing effect

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.190
in Android's audio framework.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.280
The effect is based on a
four-stage signal processing

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.140
architecture.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.630
Stage one is pre-equalization.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.240
You could think about
the pre-equalizer

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.880
as a programmatic way to
adjust any audio frequency.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.020
Think bass to treble and
everything in between.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:11.010
Stage two is a
multi-band compressor.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.860
The multi-band compressor
is the keystone

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.620
of the dynamic
processing effect.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.640
It adjusts soft sounds
and adjusts down loud

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:24.660
sounds to provide a much
better listening experience.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.270
Stage three is
post-equalization.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.300
Similar to the first stage,
it allows you to fine tune

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.650
any audio frequency.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:38.370
Lastly, stage four, the limiter,
prevents additional gain

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.539
above a developer designated
threshold, which prevents

00:08:42.539 --> 00:08:45.450
loud or unwanted noises.

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:48.600
We're going to be doing a
number of demos and a deep dive

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.290
on the dynamics processing
effect and Sound Amplifier

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:56.200
Thursday at 3:30 on Stage
5, so please join us there

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.050
if you want to learn more.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:02.260
Switching topics,
I'm going to discuss

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.220
what we're doing to make Android
easier for users with mobility

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.960
and dexterity challenges.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.270
For example, we're going to
do a little empathy exercise.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.280
So first, I'm going
to ask everybody

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.025
to take out their phones.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.919
All right, now, I want
everybody to take a screenshot.

00:09:24.919 --> 00:09:25.960
This does have a purpose.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.510
Take a screen shot, please.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:34.770
After you've done that, I
want you to do it again,

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.430
but I want you to do
it with just one hand.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.960
Screenshot-- screenshot
on your phone.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:49.870
Not quite as easy,
is it, with one hand?

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.550
For tens of millions of users.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.730
This is their everyday reality.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.700
These might be users with
tremors or limited hand

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:58.630
strength.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.900
For them, simple tasks,
such as holding the phone,

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.750
pressing hardware buttons,
or performing gestures,

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:09.760
can be difficult, painful,
and time consuming.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.850
Accessibility service--
Accessibility Menu

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.040
is a new accessibility
service to make

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.220
common interactions
easier for users

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.080
with physical disabilities.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.540
In the US alone,
this is a population

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.950
of over 75 million users.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:31.280
Accessibility Menu simplifies
the following functions--

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.890
hardware shortcuts including
power off, lock screen,

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.980
take screenshot,
and volume control;

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.980
gestures like swipe
up and swipe down

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.660
for recent apps, notifications,
and quick settings.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.280
It'll also allow you
to invoke the assistant

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:53.140
or go directly to Accessibility
Settings instantly.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:57.340
Further, we designed it with
very large touch targets

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.660
located at the
bottom of the screen.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.980
This facilitates reachability
for those with smaller hands

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.630
or limited reach.

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:08.020
It works in both portrait
and landscape mode.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.740
Lastly, Accessibility
Menu is built on top

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.600
of our accessibility framework.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.330
We added two new APIs for
screenshot and lock screen,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.660
so developers can
start using it today.

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.900
So now, I'm going to
pass the baton over

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.960
to Patrick to talk a
little bit about vision.

00:11:29.532 --> 00:11:30.990
PATRICK CLARY:
Cool, thanks, Brian.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:35.850
All right, hello, everyone.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:37.130
My name's Patrick Clary.

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.520
I'm a product manager on
Accessibility at Google,

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.190
and I'm very excited
today to announce,

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.860
for the very first
time here at I/O,

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.995
a new app coming to the
Play Store called Lookout.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.820
So Lookout is a
new app for users

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.980
who are blind and low vision,
and it'll be useful for them

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:01.720
in certain situations where
they require help from others.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.840
So for example,
one of these users

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.852
might be entering a new
space for the first time.

00:12:06.852 --> 00:12:08.310
They might not know
if other people

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:10.530
are present in that space.

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:13.650
They might need assistance--
for example, finding a chair

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:16.870
or reading the office directory.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.350
Another example is
when a user is cooking.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.180
They might need assistance
reading a recipe

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.220
or locating different
ingredients.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.170
So the goal of Lookout is to
leverage a user's smartphone

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.860
to make these physical spaces
and others more accessible

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.910
to these users who are blind
or have vision impairments.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:39.000
You can think of Lookout
as a personal guide that

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.630
sees the world and speaks
items of importance

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:44.762
that it detects in
the environment.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.750
So when a user downloads
Lookout and opens the app,

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.030
this is what they'll see.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.920
They'll see a mode
selection where

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.110
they can pick between
four different modes,

00:12:56.110 --> 00:13:02.840
and at launch, we'll support
Work and Play, Home, Scanning,

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.300
which is for scanning long
form text, and Experimental.

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.150
These allow users
to actually specify

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:13.430
the activity they
are partaking in

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:17.700
and fine-tunes Lookout to
provide more relevant results.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.830
So after selecting
a mode, a user

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.680
will be presented with
a live view, which

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:27.150
we'll speak items of
importance as they're detected.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.790
Next, I'd like to roll
just a short video that

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.790
profiles one of our testers,
who's an artist up in San

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:36.200
Francisco, and describes the
impact that an app like this

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:36.700
can have.

00:13:39.448 --> 00:13:40.370
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.170
- My first experience
with the Labyrinth

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:45.170
was this amazing
piece of canvas art

00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:46.880
that we're being
allowed to walk on kind

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.670
of in this swirling
choreography.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:53.270
I was so excited to
experience this new thing.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.890
My name is Mia Scott.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.180
I am a theater and
art instructor.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.720
I was born visually impaired.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.600
I kind of see like an
impressionist painting.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.040
I'm often scootching around,
working with my supplies,

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.960
and they don't always end
up where I want them to be.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.967
And I can't find the scissors.

00:14:11.967 --> 00:14:12.800
[BEEPING OF THE APP]

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.670
- Scissors at 12 o'clock.

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.770
- Both as an artist and a
teacher, building a labyrinth

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:20.960
was the next step
for me, to invite

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:24.950
people to have a physical
experience with art

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:27.960
and not just observe it.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.180
Very much in our
lives, we're invited

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:35.460
to watch or listen instead
of witnessing or doing.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.300
[BEEPING OF THE APP]

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:37.628
- Lavender at 12 o'clock.

00:14:44.102 --> 00:14:45.596
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:14:48.594 --> 00:14:50.510
PATRICK CLARY: So that
gives you a little idea

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.540
of the type of experience
that Lookout can provide.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:54.980
So when we were
building Lookout,

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.220
we focused on what we
called a passive experience,

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.550
and we imagined users using
it by wearing their Android

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:07.160
device in a lanyard like this
or perhaps in a shirt pocket.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.580
Now, this is a big objective of
ours, this passive experience.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.010
We don't want to force the
user to interrupt the activity

00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:14.430
they're engaging with.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:16.580
For example, if the
user is cooking,

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:18.890
they can remain engaged
in that activity

00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:20.930
without having to
take out their device

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:23.320
and interact with the screen.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.870
So while wearing
the phone, Lookout

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:29.140
provides these useful hints
about what the user is holding

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.110
in front of them, and
to facilitate this,

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.840
we've designed a set
of external controls.

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.940
So as you may have
noticed in the video,

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.740
a user can actually
knock on the device

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.350
to begin the recognition, this
live recognition that Lookout

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:42.342
provides.

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:44.800
And they can do other things
like cover the camera to pause

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.542
recognition or use
the fingerprint sensor

00:15:47.542 --> 00:15:48.625
to change different modes.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.070
So let me tell you a little
bit about how this works.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:58.180
So first, Lookout will collect
live imagery of the scene

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.580
around the user,
and then we'll run

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:03.220
a series of machine
learning recognizers

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:07.350
to detect things like barcodes,
detect if people are present,

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.250
detect objects, and
read text in the scene.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.520
The next thing we do is
score these items, first

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.320
based on a personalization
model and the mode

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:19.170
that the user has chosen.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:21.750
This way, we only speak the
relevant and important items

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:22.806
to the user.

00:16:22.806 --> 00:16:24.180
This is important
because, as you

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:25.800
can imagine, in
a standard scene,

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.900
there could be many
things we want to--

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.250
we can detect.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:30.960
However, we only
want to tell the user

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.000
about the important
things based on what

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.220
we know about the context
that they're currently in.

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.740
It's important to note
that we do most of this

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:42.500
all on the device, so
that latency is low,

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.450
and you can actually
use this app completely

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.164
without an internet connection.

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.430
So that's Lookout,
an app for users

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:57.200
who are blind and
low vision that

00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.420
harnesses the power
of machine learning

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.120
to provide relevant results
about physical spaces

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.710
around them.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.560
It's coming to the Play Store
for users in the US on Pixel

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.130
devices very soon this summer.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.950
And we'll also start rolling
out to trusted testers,

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:14.420
so if you'd like
to test this app,

00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.869
go to google.com/accessibility
and sign up to be a trusted

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:19.310
tester.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.010
You can come to our sandbox
to see a demo as well.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:24.514
So next, I'll hand
it over to Maya,

00:17:24.514 --> 00:17:26.930
who'll talk about what we're
doing in the cognitive space.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.010
MAYA BEN-ARI:
Thank you, Patrick.

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:37.020
Hi, I'm Maya Ben-Ari,
and I'm a product manager

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:40.380
on Android framework.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.200
A year ago, we launched
a service called Select

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.930
to Speak, target at user
with difficulties of reading.

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.910
Select to Speak allows
user to select and--

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.420
on the screen, and the
text will be read aloud.

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.970
Today, we're happy
to announce that we

00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:02.910
added OCR capability to Select
to Speak in camera and picture.

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:06.480
This makes text even
more accessible.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:10.950
User can simply select
text using the camera

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:15.780
or in the picture, and the text
will be highlighted and read

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:16.720
aloud.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:18.990
Now, I want to show
you a brief demo.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.700
For that, I'm actually
going to go off the stage.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.350
I'm going to open my camera.

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.570
Can my camera be shown?

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:38.330
Here you go.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:43.790
So this is the live camera view,
and this is the regular camera.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.720
And I have here the
Accessibility button.

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.440
I have here the Accessibility
button here in the corner.

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.080
I'm going to turn it on.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.045
And next, I'm going
to select the text.

00:19:00.171 --> 00:19:01.920
CELL PHONE VOICE:
Select to Speak with OCR

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:04.860
is available in
Android P Beta today.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.730
Please try it out.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.750
MAYA BEN-ARI: Thank you.

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:21.654
Now, back to the stage,
and where's my clicker?

00:19:21.654 --> 00:19:23.440
Here you go, clicker.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.640
So it's available in
Android P Beta today.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.970
It's going to come soon
to the general beta.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.425
We'd love to have your feedback.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:38.640
Now, I'm going to talk a
bit about Android framework,

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.280
and our goal in the Android
Accessibility framework

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.730
is to help get rid
of the assumptions

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:46.890
that device are built on.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:50.790
For example, not all users can
interact with the touch screen

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.970
or with the standard UI
or even hear the sounds

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.010
that the device is producing.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.980
Now, we're supporting
this goal in two ways.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:02.200
The first one is
we're developing

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.870
APIs for apps and services
to make it easier to support

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.970
wide range of audience.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:11.850
And second, we are implementing
accessibility features

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.190
into the framework.

00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:19.190
Now, I will talk about
three new API addition

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.180
to enable developers to make
their app more accessible,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.690
and the first one
is add a pane title.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.390
So first, let me start
with, what is a pane?

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:33.410
A pane is a section of the
window that these visually

00:20:33.410 --> 00:20:35.990
distinct for user with--

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.790
which is visually
distinct for user,

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:41.030
and change it like
a window changes.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:43.100
An example of the
pane, you can see here

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.820
in the Quick Setting and
the notification shade.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.910
Prior to Android P,
Accessibility Services

00:20:49.910 --> 00:20:53.120
could not easily determined
when panes on the screen

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.630
had been updated.

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:59.120
In Android P, we added an
attribute called Accessibility

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:00.430
Pane Title.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.350
Now, Accessibility
Services are automatically

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:08.030
notified to changes
to the pane so user

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:11.210
get more granular
information about what

00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:15.530
has changed with minimal
input from app developer.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:20.340
So please do add a
title to your pane.

00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:24.230
The second API is called
an Accessibility Heading.

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.000
This is an attribute
so developer

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.750
can mark whether something is
a heading inside their app,

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:36.050
and this is intended for
apps with text heavy views.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:38.870
This will allow TalkBack to a
user who cannot see the screen

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:42.710
to navigate more efficiently
between different heading

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:48.490
inside their app without force
listening to the whole text.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.870
And the last API is
we add the ability--

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:58.500
we basically-- the last API is
for setting what is focusable,

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.900
and that API is
designed to control

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.740
the grouping of the content.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.950
For example, let's say that
you have sports scores,

00:22:07.950 --> 00:22:13.140
and you want to ensure that
the number goes with the team

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.770
instead of TalkBack reading
all the teams and then all

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.700
the numbers, which can be very
confusing for the users who

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.470
cannot see the screen.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:25.470
Now, you can use
Screen Reader Focusable

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:29.670
to improve how screen
readers group the content.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:33.060
And by the way, we're also
updating our documentation

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.610
for Accessibility
Focus and Grouping,

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.670
so please check it out,
the Accessibility Section

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:40.275
in developer.android.com.

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.040
Now, I'm going to talk about
three new additional features

00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.440
coming to the Android framework.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.690
The first one is
Adjust Vibration.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:58.630
This is a new setting for
users with dexterity issues

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.620
to adjust the ringer
notification vibration and also

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.470
the touch sensitivity.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:10.240
The second setting is
called Remove Animation,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:14.200
as some users find
animation distracting,

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:19.820
so we basically just added a
new setting to turn those off.

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:28.210
And the last feature is, a year
ago, we launched the Volume Key

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.860
Accessibility Shortcut.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:35.110
So basically, to toggle on and
off Accessibility Services,

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.760
you need to long press, for
three seconds, the volume keys.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.220
Now, we did two changes to
that one based on the feedback.

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:45.130
The first one, we
added new setting

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.440
that you can toggle
on and off, which

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.170
is Color Correction
and Coloring Version.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:52.660
And the second one is
we reduced the time

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:56.170
to activate from three
seconds to one second

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.560
after the initial activation.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:07.350
In the next section,
I'm going to talk

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.800
about testing for accessibility
and its importance

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.870
for everything that
we build into the OS.

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:18.150
We see the power of the
Accessibility Services

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.450
in the app ecosystem, and
we want that ecosystem to be

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:23.235
as accessible as possible.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:29.460
Now, there are multiple ways to
test including manual testing

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.170
and automated testing.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:33.810
In general, we found
the combination of both

00:24:33.810 --> 00:24:36.990
could provide you a better
coverage for your app.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.570
Next, I'm going to cover
different testing tools

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:44.250
and how those can be integrated
to cover accessibility--

00:24:44.250 --> 00:24:46.020
to discover
accessibility issues.

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:54.180
First, let me talk a little
bit about manual testing.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:57.240
This is the most reliable
way to understand

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.230
how your products are
used by different users

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:03.300
with disabilities.

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:07.740
What you need there is you
need to turn on TalkBack

00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:11.010
or Switch Access with
your app because you

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:14.370
want to be in the
shoes of the user

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:18.400
to feel how it is to run
an Accessibility Service.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.110
However, we are aware that
manual testing takes time,

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.260
and you cannot test for
every change that you make

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.500
into the app, and for
that, we also provide--

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.055
there is also automated testing.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.840
We develop Android
Accessibility Testing Framework,

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:41.310
also shortly called
ATF, to quickly identify

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:46.560
common accessibility issues
early in the development cycle.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.100
ATF is an open source
library, which we already

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:55.500
integrated into Espresso and
Roboelectric Testing Framework

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.410
so you can leverage your
existing test to identify

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.280
accessibility issues.

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:07.410
ATF 3.0 is now
available on GitHub.

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.080
Next, we have two
automated tools

00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.290
that integrate Accessibility
Testing Framework--

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:16.640
Play Pre-Launch Report
and Accessibility Scanner.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.680
In Play Pre-Launch Report,
we're making it even easier

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.570
to get accessibility
tests resolved

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:33.260
by integrating those directly
into the developer console.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.450
Now, first, what is
Play Pre-Launch Report?

00:26:36.450 --> 00:26:39.810
This is an automated
testing solution,

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:43.470
which calls apps on
multiple physical devices

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:46.860
and detects issues the developer
can fix before reaching

00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:50.280
their end users,
including recognizing

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.820
crashes and performance issues.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.860
The tool runs automatically
on all APK published

00:26:56.860 --> 00:26:59.580
to the alpha and beta channel.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.980
Now, Play Pre-Launch--

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:06.255
Play Pre-Launch Report also
include accessibility tests.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:12.940
This is yet another
example how we

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.020
integrate our core
accessibility testing library.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.010
As Play Pre-Launch Report calls
your app, as in this example--

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:22.750
this is a cooking app.

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:26.740
In each step, it will launch
accessibility tests including

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:30.490
contrast ratio, touch target
size, missing labels, and so

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:31.090
on.

00:27:31.090 --> 00:27:33.670
And the test result will
be automatically integrated

00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:35.560
into the test report.

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:40.030
This will provide the developer
an opportunity to fix those--

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:42.250
to fix those before their
app launches and make

00:27:42.250 --> 00:27:44.770
their app more accessible.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:51.520
Lastly, I'll mention
Accessibility Scanner,

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.610
which is an app that suggests
accessibility improvement

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:58.360
for Android apps utilizing
Accessibility Testing

00:27:58.360 --> 00:27:59.620
Framework.

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:03.730
And we're very happy
that up until today,

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:07.260
Accessibility Scanner
discovered more than three

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.370
and a half million opportunities
for improving accessibility

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:12.970
in apps--

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.150
for improving
accessibility apps.

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:17.820
So big shout out for
Accessibility Scanner.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:23.930
A new version of
Accessibility Scanner

00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:27.710
is available today with
additional accessibility

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.100
checks, such as Traversal
Order for Screenwriter,

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.130
an inferent element
for accessibility.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.430
We also improve the UI
for contrast suggestion.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:41.780
And finally, we also are
allowing changes for threshold

00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:45.120
for contrast ratio
and touch target size.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.210
So to download
Accessibility Scanner,

00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:52.150
please go to
g.co/accessibilityscanner.

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:55.670
To sum up this section, we
talked about manual testing,

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:59.810
and we showed a number of
tools to help automate testing.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:04.580
But the most successful projects
incorporate both manual testing

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:06.950
and automated
testing, so please,

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.800
do try out the
different tools and do

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:14.870
develop a testing strategy for
accessibility for your app.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.880
Now, another vital
piece of the puzzle

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.340
is to understand
the user experience

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:22.080
and your user needs,
and with that said,

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.190
I will hand it off to Melissa
to talk about user research.

00:29:30.884 --> 00:29:32.300
MELISSA BARNHART:
Thank you, Maya.

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:35.400
My name's Melissa Barnhart,
and I'm a user experience

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.110
researcher on Android.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.180
So now that we've
gotten a sneak peek

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:42.790
at the accessibility features
and services coming in Android

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.000
P, I'd like to
talk about the role

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.240
of user research and the
design and development process.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:54.840
But first, what exactly
is user research?

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:59.070
User research focuses on
understanding user behaviors,

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.050
needs, and motivations.

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:03.990
It is the process of
understanding the impact

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.385
of design on an audience.

00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:12.100
So as technologists, we may
think we know what's best

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.860
for our users, but
oftentimes, we don't.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:18.760
The user is truly the
expert in their experiences.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.760
By seeking to understand
user behaviors, needs,

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.270
and motivations, we start
to challenge our assumptions

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:27.160
and reshape our perspectives.

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:30.910
Why do it?

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.190
Why do we do user research?

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.940
You may have heard the stat that
nine out of 10 startups fail,

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:40.450
but you may not know that the
number one reason for failure

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:43.580
is lack of a market
need for a product.

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:47.710
So in those situations, people
design and develop products,

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:49.570
then look for an
audience who might

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:51.580
be interested in using them.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.730
User research advocates
for the opposite.

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:58.810
By putting users first,
you can validate your ideas

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:00.700
and inform your
product's direction.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.190
Hopefully, you're thinking,
great, but when do I get

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.910
started?

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:10.600
And the short answer is now.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.190
User research involves
a set of practices

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:17.000
that runs along your existing
product development cycle,

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.010
helping you make
decisions at each stage.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:23.000
So methods like field
studies, interviews,

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.220
or competitive
analysis can help you

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.980
explore a specific
area of technology

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.680
and uncover opportunity areas.

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.990
Once you've decided
what you want to build,

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.270
and you have a
prototype, methods

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.510
like cognitive walkthroughs,
usability tests,

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:40.880
or participatory
design exercises

00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:44.340
can help you make
important design decisions.

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.640
And once your product
is out in the market,

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.140
methods like log analysis,
diary studies, or surveys

00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:54.290
can help you evaluate
its performance.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:58.070
And if you don't have a lot of
time or experience, that's OK.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:02.270
Just take a few hours
and talk to a few users.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.400
Jacob Nielsen of the
Nielsen Norman Group

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:08.690
found that the best results come
from small affordable studies

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.400
with no more than five users.

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:17.280
So now, I'd like to
show you how Android

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:22.210
uses user research to improve
our accessibility offerings.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.790
Let's take the example of
TalkBack vibration feedback.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:27.480
TalkBack, the Google
screen reader,

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.060
uses vibration
feedback by default.

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:32.250
We knew that some
people turned this off,

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.630
and we wanted to know why.

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:38.190
Why do some people turn it
off while others leave it on?

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.800
Are there situations
where vibration

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:45.270
is more or less useful, and
does the pattern or intensity

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.370
of the vibration
make a difference?

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:50.520
Good research starts with
good research questions.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:56.210
Because we were
interested in perceptions

00:32:56.210 --> 00:32:59.940
of vibration feedback, we
started with user interviews.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.880
We asked screen reader
users questions like,

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:05.010
do you use vibration feedback?

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:06.360
Why or why not?

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.950
Have you ever turned it off?

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:09.150
When did you turn it off?

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:11.820
And how would you describe
the intensity of vibration

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.990
on your phone?

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:16.260
Is it too high, too
low, or just right?

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.980
After getting a sense of
the participants' needs,

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:21.810
we prompted them to
compare vibration feedback

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.610
across a range of
Android phones.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.910
So these tasks added a usability
component to our study.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.410
In this research, we
validated a real need

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:36.060
for vibration feedback.

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.040
We learned that
vibration provides

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.170
valuable navigational
information

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.780
to visually impaired
users, especially

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.670
in noisy environments
when they may not

00:33:44.670 --> 00:33:48.220
be able to hear spoken
feedback on their device.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:51.850
We also learned that the more
distinct the vibration pattern,

00:33:51.850 --> 00:33:53.500
the more useful.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.520
Finally, we learned that
users wanted the ability

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.190
to adjust vibration
intensity according

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:01.440
to their personal preferences.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.800
So in Android P, we're
giving up greater control

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:07.260
to the user over
vibration feedback.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:11.850
Anyone will be able to go to
their Accessibility Settings

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:15.449
and increase, decrease,
or disable vibration,

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:16.989
and this is just the beginning.

00:34:16.989 --> 00:34:19.710
We will continue to make
improvements in this area

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:22.060
as we further research.

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:24.179
So now, we're going to
hand it over to Victor

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:27.270
for some final
announcements and resources

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:28.439
to help you going forward.

00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:37.030
VICTOR TSARAN: Thanks,
Melissa, for highlighting

00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:39.219
the importance of
use of research

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:41.590
in the product
decisions we make--

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:43.670
super important, as
you have seen already.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:53.270
Well, next, we couldn't just
let you go without a few more

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.699
announcements, could we?

00:34:55.699 --> 00:34:59.700
First, I'd like to announce
that Voice Access--

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.650
the accessibility service that
helps someone with dexterity

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:07.730
issues to use their
Android phone completely

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:12.320
through their voice just
simply issuing voice commands.

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.140
Voice Access is
graduating from beta.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:20.480
After months of user research,
development iterations,

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.910
we're finally ready to
launch it and give it to you.

00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:31.840
Coming soon, this summer,
with new UI enhancements,

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:34.340
better Assistant integration--
and by Assistant,

00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:38.240
I mean Google Assistant,
just to be sure--

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.270
coming with Google
Assistant UI, and more

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.310
improved interaction overall.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.880
So lookout for Voice Access.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.860
The next thing I'd like
to let you know about

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.820
is that we decided
to package a lot

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:55.820
of our accessibility
services that you commonly

00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.970
find built into
an Android device

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:04.220
into a single package we call
Android Accessibility Suite.

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.370
Some of the services include
TalkBack screen reader

00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:09.500
for people who are blind
and vision impaired;

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.170
Switch Access, a
software that allows

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:15.290
people with physical impairments
to use their device with just

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:17.920
a single button or
a single switch;

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:23.630
Select to Speak that Maya
just demoed a few minutes ago;

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:28.100
and Accessibility Menu that
Brian also showcased earlier;

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.660
and more to come.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.170
We hope that with a new
Android Accessibility Suite,

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:37.010
other accessibility
services, not just TalkBack,

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:39.620
will be more discoverable
in the Play Store,

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:42.620
as well as this will
become a platform

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:47.300
for new future accessibility
services we will be developing.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.920
But enough about us.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.932
I think its time to talk
about you a little bit.

00:36:55.932 --> 00:36:57.140
I think you deserve it, guys.

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.560
You build a lot of
the cool stuff, too.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:06.170
Last evening, we announced
Google Play Awards,

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.880
and I just would like
to give a shout out

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:12.470
to a few amazing developers
that have been working

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:16.250
on stuff or apps to make our
ecosystem better and more

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:17.230
accessible.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:20.990
First, our winner is Be My Eyes.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:24.260
Be My Eyes is a
cross-platform solution

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.960
that connects
people who need help

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.520
with people who are willing
or excited to give that help.

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:34.610
The way this service works
is that someone who is blind

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:40.130
or who needs help requests
it by declaring themselves

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:43.380
as a person who needs help, and
then people on the other end

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:45.170
can sign up as volunteers.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:49.680
And when such help request
comes, they get notification.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.850
Then they pick up
the video link,

00:37:52.850 --> 00:37:56.150
and then they can help
somebody in real time.

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:57.560
So Be My Eyes--

00:37:57.560 --> 00:38:00.210
check it out on the Play Store.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:04.340
The next one I'd like to
mention is the OpenSesame.

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.400
Now, OpenSesame is already
known to some people who

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.630
have been with us during
various Google I/O events

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:11.960
and otherwise.

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:15.470
The coolness of OpenSesame
accessibility solution

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.870
is that it allows people
to control their Android

00:38:17.870 --> 00:38:21.260
device by just looking at it.

00:38:21.260 --> 00:38:22.250
It's amazing.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:27.360
So check out OpenSesame, and
the link is on the screen.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:30.690
The last but not least, I'd like
to mention, we really, really,

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:32.840
really care about Game
because, while it's

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.290
an important aspect
of computing to be

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:40.100
productive and independent, it's
just as important to have fun.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.620
And so one of our
yesterday winners

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:47.570
is a company from New Zealand
called Audio Game Hub,

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:51.050
and what they've created
is an experience for anyone

00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:55.160
to be able to play audio
games with their eyes closed.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.560
So you only rely on
your ears and then

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:00.560
you play all kind
of funky games.

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.060
I'm not going to
name those games.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.547
I hope you'll go
to the Play Store

00:39:03.547 --> 00:39:04.880
and check them out for yourself.

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:12.020
And I'd like to leave
you with a few resources.

00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:14.750
We already mentioned
Accessibility Scanner.

00:39:14.750 --> 00:39:17.510
Please download it.

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:19.860
Test with Accessibility Scanner.

00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:22.790
The website where you can find
all of the best accessibility

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:25.210
practices for
Android development,

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:29.810
g.co/androidaccessibility,
and of course, user research.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:31.940
And last but not
least, of course, we

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.330
have lots of sessions for you to
explore here at the Google I/O.

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:37.910
It's a great opportunity
just for you to meet us,

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.550
for us to meet you, so
that we can together

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:44.240
create a more friendly and
more accessible and inclusive

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.380
ecosystem.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:49.085
Thank you for coming here today.

00:39:49.085 --> 00:39:53.197
