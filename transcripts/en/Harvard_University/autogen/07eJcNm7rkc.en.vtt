humanistic perspective I would say it's

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:46.219
humanistic perspective I would say it's
 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.939
humanistic perspective I would say it's
really very simple to simply engage the

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949
really very simple to simply engage the
 

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:52.450
really very simple to simply engage the
people that you work with that you sell

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460
people that you work with that you sell
 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.320
people that you work with that you sell
to that you supply from really your

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330
to that you supply from really your
 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.939
to that you supply from really your
stakeholders in some meaningful way in a

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949
stakeholders in some meaningful way in a
 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.100
stakeholders in some meaningful way in a
discourse where you listen and where

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110
discourse where you listen and where
 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.719
discourse where you listen and where
they feel empowered that's when they

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729
they feel empowered that's when they
 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:08.950
they feel empowered that's when they
feel the dignities and some were

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960
feel the dignities and some were
 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.110
feel the dignities and some were
inherently protected that's when Trust

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120
inherently protected that's when Trust
 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.079
inherently protected that's when Trust
gets built and that's when you typically

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:14.089
gets built and that's when you typically
 

00:05:14.089 --> 00:05:15.519
gets built and that's when you typically
get information about what is the right

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:15.529
get information about what is the right
 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:18.309
get information about what is the right
thing to do so you build healthier

00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319
thing to do so you build healthier
 

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.499
thing to do so you build healthier
organizations simply through talking

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509
organizations simply through talking
 

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:24.399
organizations simply through talking
with people and listening to them in a

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409
with people and listening to them in a
 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:28.179
with people and listening to them in a
mindful way without preconceived notions

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:28.189
mindful way without preconceived notions
 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:30.939
mindful way without preconceived notions
about how they can be useful to you but

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949
about how they can be useful to you but
 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.579
about how they can be useful to you but
also how you as an organization or a

00:05:33.579 --> 00:05:33.589
also how you as an organization or a
 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:35.790
also how you as an organization or a
manner can be useful to them in a mutual

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800
manner can be useful to them in a mutual
 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.939
manner can be useful to them in a mutual
giving and taking a manner so I think

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949
giving and taking a manner so I think
 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:41.409
giving and taking a manner so I think
there are lots of things that go into

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419
there are lots of things that go into
 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.290
there are lots of things that go into
creating an ethically healthy

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300
creating an ethically healthy
 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.629
creating an ethically healthy
organization and they're clearly certain

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639
organization and they're clearly certain
 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.649
organization and they're clearly certain
things that you can't have in place to

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659
things that you can't have in place to
 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.540
things that you can't have in place to
create an ethically organization healthy

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550
create an ethically organization healthy
 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.429
create an ethically organization healthy
organization so for example if the

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:54.439
organization so for example if the
 

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:56.909
organization so for example if the
leadership is not ethically grounded

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919
leadership is not ethically grounded
 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.670
leadership is not ethically grounded
that's certainly a problem if people

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680
that's certainly a problem if people
 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.989
that's certainly a problem if people
don't have a clear sense the purpose of

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:01.999
don't have a clear sense the purpose of
 

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:04.949
don't have a clear sense the purpose of
the organization it's clearly a problem

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:04.959
the organization it's clearly a problem
 

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:07.959
the organization it's clearly a problem
but I think that probably the most

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:07.969
but I think that probably the most
 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.889
but I think that probably the most
important thing to keep in mind is to

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:11.899
important thing to keep in mind is to
 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:13.719
important thing to keep in mind is to
ensure that the people in the

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729
ensure that the people in the
 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.059
ensure that the people in the
organization feel that their

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:16.069
organization feel that their
 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:19.659
organization feel that their
contributions are valued that they're

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:19.669
contributions are valued that they're
 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.149
contributions are valued that they're
being listened to that they're being

00:06:22.149 --> 00:06:22.159
being listened to that they're being
 

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:27.790
being listened to that they're being
recognized for their work and the reason

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800
recognized for their work and the reason
 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.619
recognized for their work and the reason
I say that is that if people don't feel

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629
I say that is that if people don't feel
 

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:31.449
I say that is that if people don't feel
recognized if they don't feel that

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:31.459
recognized if they don't feel that
 

00:06:31.459 --> 00:06:33.850
recognized if they don't feel that
they're being listened to if they don't

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860
they're being listened to if they don't
 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.439
they're being listened to if they don't
feel feel that their work is being

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:35.449
feel feel that their work is being
 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.670
feel feel that their work is being
valued then it becomes very difficult to

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680
valued then it becomes very difficult to
 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.129
valued then it becomes very difficult to
have a sense that what the organization

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:42.139
have a sense that what the organization
 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.649
have a sense that what the organization
doing is somehow worthwhile and worth

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:44.659
doing is somehow worthwhile and worth
 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:46.889
doing is somehow worthwhile and worth
pursuing and supporting and when that

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:46.899
pursuing and supporting and when that
 

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:49.899
pursuing and supporting and when that
feeling is lost and I think that opens

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:49.909
feeling is lost and I think that opens
 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:50.800
feeling is lost and I think that opens
up the possibility

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810
up the possibility
 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.720
up the possibility
for a lots of unhealthy and unethical

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:52.730
for a lots of unhealthy and unethical
 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.550
for a lots of unhealthy and unethical
behaviors in the context of the

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560
behaviors in the context of the
 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.650
behaviors in the context of the
organization so what's the most

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660
organization so what's the most
 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.270
organization so what's the most
important key to developing ethically

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280
important key to developing ethically
 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.150
important key to developing ethically
healthy organizations I think there's at

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:01.160
healthy organizations I think there's at
 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.400
healthy organizations I think there's at
least two components first there has to

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410
least two components first there has to
 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.070
least two components first there has to
be a very clear statement by the

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080
be a very clear statement by the
 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.110
be a very clear statement by the
organization what its purposes and

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120
organization what its purposes and
 

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.480
organization what its purposes and
values are I think it's a very soft

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.490
values are I think it's a very soft
 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.340
values are I think it's a very soft
thing to consider but I think it's

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:12.350
thing to consider but I think it's
 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.200
thing to consider but I think it's
incredibly important for getting into

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:14.210
incredibly important for getting into
 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.030
incredibly important for getting into
everyone's mind around the organization

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040
everyone's mind around the organization
 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.220
everyone's mind around the organization
you know what our standards what our

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:18.230
you know what our standards what our
 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.440
you know what our standards what our
objectives you know what are the things

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:20.450
objectives you know what are the things
 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:21.940
objectives you know what are the things
I can be held accountable to what are

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:21.950
I can be held accountable to what are
 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:23.140
I can be held accountable to what are
the things i can hold other people

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:23.150
the things i can hold other people
 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.570
the things i can hold other people
accountable to and a statement it could

00:07:25.570 --> 00:07:25.580
accountable to and a statement it could
 

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.360
accountable to and a statement it could
be that simple a statement of values

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:27.370
be that simple a statement of values
 

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.620
be that simple a statement of values
gets everyone on the same page i think

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.630
gets everyone on the same page i think
 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:31.719
gets everyone on the same page i think
creates a common framework then the

00:07:31.719 --> 00:07:31.729
creates a common framework then the
 

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:33.129
creates a common framework then the
second question I think is much more

00:07:33.129 --> 00:07:33.139
second question I think is much more
 

00:07:33.139 --> 00:07:34.960
second question I think is much more
difficult question which is how do you

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:34.970
difficult question which is how do you
 

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.629
difficult question which is how do you
actually credibly enforce how do you

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:37.639
actually credibly enforce how do you
 

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:40.570
actually credibly enforce how do you
credibly disseminate and incredibly

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580
credibly disseminate and incredibly
 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.730
credibly disseminate and incredibly
organized the organization to live up to

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:42.740
organized the organization to live up to
 

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:44.860
organized the organization to live up to
these values some of this can be very

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:44.870
these values some of this can be very
 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.110
these values some of this can be very
mundane and as simple as how do we

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120
mundane and as simple as how do we
 

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.820
mundane and as simple as how do we
account for things how do we allow

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:48.830
account for things how do we allow
 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.400
account for things how do we allow
people to cooperate you know how do we

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:51.410
people to cooperate you know how do we
 

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.969
people to cooperate you know how do we
coordinate actions second you know if

00:07:54.969 --> 00:07:54.979
coordinate actions second you know if
 

00:07:54.979 --> 00:07:56.080
coordinate actions second you know if
people don't live up what's the

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:56.090
people don't live up what's the
 

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.960
people don't live up what's the
procedures for trying to remedy that

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:57.970
procedures for trying to remedy that
 

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.640
procedures for trying to remedy that
this can be informal but as long as

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:00.650
this can be informal but as long as
 

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:01.480
this can be informal but as long as
there are there are some structures

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:01.490
there are there are some structures
 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.340
there are there are some structures
where people understand not only these

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:03.350
where people understand not only these
 

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:04.690
where people understand not only these
are our values and these are what we're

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:04.700
are our values and these are what we're
 

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.520
are our values and these are what we're
about but I actually think the

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:06.530
about but I actually think the
 

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:08.260
about but I actually think the
organization can help us realize those

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:08.270
organization can help us realize those
 

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.670
organization can help us realize those
and when we deviate there's someone I

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680
and when we deviate there's someone I
 

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.130
and when we deviate there's someone I
can talk to I can blow the whistle or I

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:12.140
can talk to I can blow the whistle or I
 

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:13.900
can talk to I can blow the whistle or I
can talk to someone informally or I can

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:13.910
can talk to someone informally or I can
 

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.450
can talk to someone informally or I can
you know have some response it's going

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:16.460
you know have some response it's going
 

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.440
you know have some response it's going
to go up the chain and things are

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:17.450
to go up the chain and things are
 

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.880
to go up the chain and things are
actually going to change the end of the

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:18.890
actually going to change the end of the
 

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.100
actually going to change the end of the
day so I think those two components a

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.110
day so I think those two components a
 

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.930
day so I think those two components a
clear sense of mission in an

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:22.940
clear sense of mission in an
 

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.120
clear sense of mission in an
organization and the actual structures

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.130
organization and the actual structures
