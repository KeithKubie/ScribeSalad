00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:06.710
Hi.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.200
I'm Diane Solinger, and I
am the manager of the

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.800
GooglersGive team.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.340
GooglersGive is the team that
helps you give and volunteer

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.470
as Googlers.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.190
And last fall we started-- or
actually, last November-- we

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.340
started thinking about how we
can bring Googlers together

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.430
around causes in thematic areas
of social interest.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.700
And we launched the first hunger
campaign, hunger and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.530
poverty alleviation, in
November of last year.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.920
It brought together about 6,000
Googlers via a quiz

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.250
about learning about the issues
around hunger and then

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.270
giving and volunteering

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.260
opportunities around the world.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.500
So we decided let's look at
Earth Day and the environment.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.930
We know Googlers are very, very
concerned about the state

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.280
of our planet and are trying
to find ways to make a

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.350
difference.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.050
And in particular, what we've
seen is a strong interest in

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.270
wildlife, wildlife preservation,
conservation.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.470
And so the theme for the
environment campaign really

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.120
took that turn and that twist.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.459
The environment campaign
actually ends today.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.660
And so this is the capstone
event of the environment

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.280
campaign that launched
on Earth Day.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.320
The next big thing coming up is
GoogleServe, which will be

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.710
June 7 through 14.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.040
And I saw philanthropy
on the [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.660
And I don't know if our

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.860
wonderful ambassador [? Erin ?]

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.560
had something to do with
that or somebody

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.720
else here at YouTube.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.020
But there's a great story of
some of the things that people

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.510
did in GoogleServe last year.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.000
And we hope that you participate
in volunteering

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.930
for a GoogleServe project coming
up June 7 through 14.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.320
Today, we're here to
really focus on

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.370
the environment campaign.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.940
We're really lucky to have an
eminent expert in wildlife

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.220
conservation and preservation in
Peter Knights from WildAid.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.470
We're going to start with
a short video to

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.920
kind of set the context.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.810
The way it's going to go today
is we're going to have a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.210
little visual and then have a
little talk and then a little

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.380
visual and a little talk.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.230
And then we'll end it
with questions and

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.160
answers from you.

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.830
So with that, let's roll the
first video from WildAid to

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:04.720
set the stage.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:19.400
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.890
-You don't have to be the
world's fastest man to beat a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.140
speeding bullet.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.990
Support conservation, and we
can save our big cats.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.368
When we all come together--

00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:33.236
-We can do anything.

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:33.710
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.950
DIANE SOLINGER: WildAid is a
perfect fit for YouTube.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.990
This is what they do to get the
message across about what

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.900
we can do to save endangered
species around the world.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.610
And as I said, we're really,
really lucky to have Peter

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.090
Knights here, the executive
director of WildAid.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.880
Peter and I were talking a
little bit over lunch.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.230
What a background you have.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.990
Let's explain to the group why
you are the executive director

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.200
of WildAid and what
WildAid does.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.400
PETER KNIGHTS: Last man
standing, basically.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.375
But I started off my career
originally I was an economist.

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:01.040
I went to London School
of Economics.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.050
And I left university, and I
didn't know what I wanted to

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.140
do when I grew up.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.560
And I knew that I didn't want
to dedicate my life just to

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.350
making money.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.580
Big mistake but--

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.230
with hindsight.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.930
But really, my ambition has
always been to try and leave

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.430
the world a tiny bit
better off when I

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.760
leave than when I joined.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.530
And I believe the environment is
one of the areas where, no

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.800
matter who you are or where you
are or how much money you

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.320
have, we all share the
same environment.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.880
We all stand to lose
elephants.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.440
We all have to breathe
the same air.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.160
And I think if ever we're going
to learn how to work

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.720
together, as opposed to fight
each other and compete, it's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.900
going to be through
the environment.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.740
So that's why I decided
to do this.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.930
And the first thing that I got
involved with was Greenpeace.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.830
And through that, I met some
people from an organization

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.190
called the Environmental
Investigation Agency.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.880
And they specialized in doing
undercover investigations of

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.350
illegal wildlife trade.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.610
So we would create
fake companies,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.830
fake business cards.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.820
It was faxes in those days, not
internet, to date myself.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.000
And we would try and infiltrate
the illegal

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.750
wildlife trade to find
out what was going.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.270
And then using extremely badly
hidden cameras, we would film

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.910
people and put that on
television to try and move

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.630
governments forward to
try and stop some of

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.930
these abuses of wildlife.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.080
And then from that, I got to
work in 40-odd countries

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.790
worldwide on different illegal
wildlife problems.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.000
And a lot of the work
led to Asia.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.180
And in Asia what we found was
that people just didn't

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.130
understand the problem.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.480
So it wasn't that people were
maliciously didn't care about

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.130
rhinos or elephants or
bears or sharks.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.680
They just didn't associate
these products

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.060
with the actual animals.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.910
Nor were they aware that these
animals were becoming

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.800
endangered, driven by the trade
in their body parts.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.200
So it became clear that what
was needed was a massive

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.770
education and awareness
campaign.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.000
And hence we started
to work with media.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.730
And environment is often
very bad news.

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.660
And people can only take
so much bad news.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.780
So what we try and do through
our campaigns is to keep these

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.170
issues interesting, exciting,
not hopeless.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.290
Because I don't believe any of
these things are hopeless.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.720
And very often, environmental,
you go, my god, I want to

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.230
shoot myself after I
heard that story.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.250
But in actual fact,
there is hope, and

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.280
there is a way forward.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.590
And that's been the spirit of
the campaigns, using not only

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.270
athletes but also
celebrities--

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.650
Jackie Chan has been with us
for a number of years doing

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.270
projects, and people
like Yao Ming and

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.720
influential business leaders--

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.160
to get the message over.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.660
So asking people from China to
talk to Chinese rather than us

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.020
as Americans talking
to the Chinese.

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.390
DIANE SOLINGER: And so WildAid
has certain focus areas for

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:40.280
your programs.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.780
And explain what those are
and why you chose those.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.670
PETER KNIGHTS: Well, we take a
couple of different questions,

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:48.570
and we ask what do we do
and what don't we do.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.630
The first thing, is somebody
else doing it?

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.910
In which case we're like, fine,
we don't need to do it.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.640
But secondly is also
can we make an

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.900
impact on those issues?

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.900
And so, most recently, we've
spent a lot of time working on

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.090
the shark fin soup issue and
sharks, and what are, to me,

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.500
one of the biggest environmental
disasters going

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.640
on, up to 73 million sharks
killed a year

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.100
for shark fin soup.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.510
And this is an industry which
used to be very small, and it

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.380
was very high end.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.100
So it used to be very limited.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.000
And with the economic growth in
China, in particular, we've

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.840
just seen this business
explode.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.170
And sharks are very slow
reproducing animals.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:25.350
They're not designed really to
be preyed on by other animals.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.350
They're usually top
of the food chain.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.880
And human beings have come
in as a super predator.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.540
And it's been pretty
disastrous to shark

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.240
populations.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.380
And even to the extent in
Chinese, the shark fin soup is

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.380
called fish wing soup.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.440
People don't even know it's
coming from sharks, let alone

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.460
the biology of sharks which
makes them so vulnerable.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.720
So that's been a major campaign
we've been working

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.690
on, recently with some pretty
significant success in that.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.000
DIANE SOLINGER: Shall
we show the--

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.380
PETER KNIGHTS: Sure.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.630
DIANE SOLINGER: --shark
fin video?

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.910
PETER KNIGHTS: Cue it up.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.840
That's perfect.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.870
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.120
-What if you could see how
shark fin soup is made?

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:01.930
If you could see how each year
up to 70 million sharks are

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.355
killed to end up in soup,
could you still eat it?

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.850
A third of all shark species
are nearly extinct.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.260
But we can help save them.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.080
-Remember, when the buying
stops, the killing can too.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.480
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.830
DIANE SOLINGER: So that's Yao
Ming, great Chinese and an

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.220
American icon from the
Houston Rockets.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.870
But that's in English.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.240
How does that translate back?

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.890
PETER KNIGHTS: Well, everything
we do, anything you

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:34.490
see today has been
done in Mandarin.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.200
And the first ad you saw with
Maurice Greene, that was in

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.390
the lead up to the 2008
Beijing Olympics.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:45.640
So we recruited by the end 20
Olympic gold athletes, themed

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:49.440
it around the Olympics, and
managed to get out a massive

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.160
campaign around the Olympics in
China, which obviously the

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.660
Olympics is probably one of the
biggest events to happen

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.050
in China ever.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:59.550
And we got conservation, little
piece of it, which was

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.460
by using the heroes that were
there, we got the message over

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.100
hopefully in an interesting and
inspiring way that wasn't

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.460
seen as being sort of critical
or punitive.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.060
It's saying, hey, we've all got
to solve this together.

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.800
And that's partly the spirit
of the Olympics.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.620
So we tried to embody
that around then.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.700
Yao has been a major
spokesperson on

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.160
the shark fin campaign.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.270
As you say, he's a huge star,
in more sense than one--

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.570
DIANE SOLINGER: He is.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.850
PETER KNIGHTS: --in China.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.070
Having traveled around Africa
with him last year, I can tell

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.930
you being seven foot six is not
easy, especially when you

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:31.990
have to get into small planes
and things like that.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.770
But he's a fantastic guy,
and very smart.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.740
He's now actually doing
a history degree.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.399
I don't know how many
professional athletes after

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:41.549
their career go back and do
college again, but that's the

00:08:41.549 --> 00:08:42.799
kind of guy he is.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:45.120
And he's been fantastic as a
spokesperson for the campaign,

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.220
and obviously hugely influential
in China.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.780
DIANE SOLINGER: How has the
shark fin campaign made a

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.290
difference?

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:52.450
What's the before and after,
and is it still running?

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.270
PETER KNIGHTS: It's
still running.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:56.160
I mean, somebody once said, a
very wise man once said, in

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.850
the environment, our victories
are temporary and our losses

00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:59.490
are permanent.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.760
And I think that's very true.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.560
So we can never give
up these things.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.450
But we've seen consistently all
around the world how we've

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.440
been able to reduce shark fin
consumption by about a third.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.790
We were sued in Thailand by
the shark fin traders for

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:13.790
cutting their business by 50%.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.790
And most recently in 2012, the
Chinese government actually

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.300
banned shark fin from state
banquets, which is very

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.200
significant.

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.830
And the data we're getting back
now is that in 2012, the

00:09:23.830 --> 00:09:26.795
shark fin trade was reduced
between 50% and 70%--

00:09:26.795 --> 00:09:27.090
DIANE SOLINGER: That's
tremendous.

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.250
PETER KNIGHTS: --in China, which
is talking really tens

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.020
of millions of sharks.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.800
And we're getting messages back
from the field saying

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.760
that fisherman aren't going
out to catch the sharks

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.210
anymore because it's
not economic.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:36.860
The fuel costs are too much.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.970
So that's the goal
in all these.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.140
DIANE SOLINGER: This is
where you're economics

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.040
degree came in handy.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.720
PETER KNIGHTS: I did remember
little bit of economics.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.800
Some of it stayed there.

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.450
DIANE SOLINGER: Nice.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:47.160
PETER KNIGHTS: And what's really
different about WildAid

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.320
in our approach is most efforts
in conservation are

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.160
supply side.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.970
They're about trying to protect
the species in the

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.850
wild or study the species
or pass laws.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.030
Nobody was looking
at the demand.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:02.350
And my economics tell me if you
don't address the demand,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.610
all you're necessarily going to
do by greater protection is

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.490
probably push up the price.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:10.150
And so, if you could reduce the
demand at the same time,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.850
you reduce the economic
incentive to do the activity.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.380
Then that's got to be the
only-- frankly the only

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.580
long-term solution to this.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.810
And I think a lot of people
thought it may be impossible

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:20.830
to affect the demand.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.740
But what we've done is we've
used exactly the same tools

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.780
that a commercial company would
use to promote a product

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.690
to stigmatize a product.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:34.400
So we've used top athletes,
movie stars, et cetera, as our

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.600
spokespeople just as a brand
might use a celebrity

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:38.570
spokesperson.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.720
We've used high-end advertising
techniques.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.760
We've use billboards,
television.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.600
And we've been lucky enough in
China to have the support of

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.560
the Chinese government.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.170
So all this stuff goes
out on state TV.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.110
And in the United States,
you know public service

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.720
announcement, you have to
be up at 3:00 AM in the

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.830
morning to see it.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:54.470
But in China, we've been getting
these slots out.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.440
Like that slot with Yao
Ming has been out

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.740
at 7 o'clock primetime.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.460
And somebody commented they've
seen it countless times.

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.670
So actually, in China, we're
able to get these out at the

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:06.590
same kind of level as a
commercial company would.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.250
So we are able to influence
a lot of different people.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.930
And when I go to China, I see
our ads in the back of the

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:14.570
taxi when I get out
of the airport.

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:15.670
We see them in the airports.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.570
We see them on the national
television.

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:18.870
DIANE SOLINGER: How have you
managed to have that great

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.100
relationship with
the government?

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.980
PETER KNIGHTS: Well, I think
first of all, the Chinese

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:26.410
government wants to do
the right thing, a

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:27.080
lot of these things.

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:29.790
It doesn't always get there,
as many governments don't.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.110
But they want to do
the right thing.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:32.700
And they've been--

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.800
last year we had over $200
million worth of free media

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.860
space from China.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.900
And I'd be surprised if
we could ever get

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:40.950
that in the US, but--

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.830
So there is a desire from people
in China to want to do

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.560
something about this.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.440
A lot of people know
this is an issue.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.330
You've got to remember with
something like rhino horn, for

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:52.170
example, this is a minuscule
proportion of people in China

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:53.790
that would consume rhino horn.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:55.160
The vast majority--

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.840
we just did a survey and 95%
of people in China said the

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.440
government should do more
to help rhinos, and

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.680
the same with elephants.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.700
So as people get the education,
the awareness,

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.340
there's been a tremendous
affinity, I think, in China.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.510
The people want to do
the right thing.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:09.990
They want to be on
the right side.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.970
And it's really just been
catalyzing that action.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:15.650
DIANE SOLINGER: Let's turn
the conversation to

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:16.590
elephants for a minute.

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.990
We'll run a short video on
elephants, I believe, and then

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.710
we'll talk a little bit about
that and the demand for ivory.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:23.187
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:23.187 --> 00:12:26.049
-Bigger.

00:12:26.049 --> 00:12:28.532
Stronger.

00:12:28.532 --> 00:12:31.295
And more domineering
than any other.

00:12:31.295 --> 00:12:33.980
Elephants are the centers
of the animal kingdom.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:37.320
But unfortunately today,
they're under attack.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.730
Tens of thousands are being
killed each year just for

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:41.570
their ivory.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:45.260
So please, support conservation
and never buy

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.670
products made from ivory.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:51.983
Because when the buying stops,
the killing can too.

00:12:51.983 --> 00:12:53.370
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.200
So NBA's tremendously
powerful in China, a

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.100
very popular sport.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:13:00.430
And with the elephants, I think,
we really look back as

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.500
to it was the first thing
I really kind of

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.500
worked on back in 1989.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.680
And we were in a crisis with
elephants back in 1989.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.680
And some people are too young to
remember this, but prior to

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.290
1989, ivory trade was legal

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.810
internationally around the world.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.450
And under a system of regulated
trade, the elephant

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:23.240
numbers fell from 1.2 million
to 600,000 in 20 years.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:25.620
And so this regulated trade was
actually enabling massive

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.730
illegal activity to go on
through laundering processes.

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:31.200
And in 1989, there was
an international

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.560
ban on ivory trade.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.000
Essentially overnight, because
of all the publicity and the

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.110
awareness, the market in the
United States and Europe,

00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:40.060
which were significant markets,
collapsed completely.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.430
And for about 15 or 20 years,
the African elephant was

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.190
actually doing fine.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:44.680
It was actually recovering.

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.370
And then from about 2006, 2008
onwards, first of all, they

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.060
allowed illegal sale of ivory
from Africa to China.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.360
And then we just saw
the poaching

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.600
going through the roof.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:59.150
And the two major factors I can
identify are, one, there

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.560
is a much greater Asian, and
particularly Chinese, presence

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.840
in Africa now doing many
construction projects.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.240
So in some ways the market
has come to Africa.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.800
But also the growth of the
Chinese economy has meant many

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.320
more people can afford it.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.550
And these are people that back
in 1989 didn't have access to

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.870
international media and
certainly didn't have access

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.450
to the kind of money
to buy ivory.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.470
So you've got a new
wave of consumer--

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.700
DIANE SOLINGER: New consumers.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.060
PETER KNIGHTS: --if you like.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:22.630
DIANE SOLINGER: Yeah.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.230
PETER KNIGHTS: --which
is now driving

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:25.750
this poaching academic.

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:29.570
And so, again, every time I've
seen these poaching things get

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.165
bad, it correlates with
an expansion in

00:14:32.165 --> 00:14:33.890
the consuming market.

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:38.160
So back in the 1970s and '80s,
there was a market for rhino

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.560
horns as dagger handles
in the Yemen.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.900
And when there was the oil
boom of '73 and a lot of

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:45.770
Yemenis working the Saudi
oil fields, suddenly

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.720
that market went up.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.630
So when it gets back to it to
me, it's all about economics.

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:50.930
It's not about biology.

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:52.150
And unfortunately, it's
not about laws.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.100
It's about economics.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:53.510
And the only--

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.850
DIANE SOLINGER: Well, it's
making things that people

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:58.730
think are prized and special
or elite when you have the

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:59.920
economic power to buy that.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.410
You have to, like you said,
stigmatize them and make them

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:03.370
not cool anymore.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:03.950
PETER KNIGHTS: Exactly.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:08.160
Because 15 years ago, the only
people in China able to afford

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:10.830
shark fin soup would be
government officials, frankly.

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.340
Now there are many
more people.

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:14.970
I mean we did a survey, and it
looked like up to 100 million

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:17.200
people in China were consuming
shark fin soup.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.520
So although this is a
traditional product, it was

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.760
never traditional to consume
on these levels.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.060
And that's the essence of most
of these problems is these are

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:27.910
things which have some cultural
history, but were

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:28.965
always done on a tiny scale.

00:15:28.965 --> 00:15:30.710
It was the thing kings
and lords could do.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.450
And now it's everyone
can do it.

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.640
And it's much easier to ship
things around the world now,

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.410
globalization.

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.810
People FedEx some of these
things sometimes, scarily.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:45.030
So we've got to cope with a new
era, and media is part of

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.980
coping with that era, I think.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:47.950
DIANE SOLINGER: Right.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.971
How do you see these
things picked up?

00:15:50.971 --> 00:15:56.750
With the ivory trade you've
seen through the media

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:59.120
campaign you're making a big
difference in that, but how

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.420
does that get spread outside
of the channels that you're

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.900
using, the traditional
media channels--

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.005
YouTube, here we are--

00:16:06.005 --> 00:16:08.590
how do these stories get spread
more and more so it

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:10.160
becomes this ubiquitous
thought?

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.430
We don't do this.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:12.250
I don't buy that.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.500
PETER KNIGHTS: No,
and it does.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.260
It's always interesting.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.750
We did a lot of work,
conventional media, with Yao,

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.250
for example.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.130
We do a press conference.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.170
By serendipity, there's a few
things that happened in the

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:26.720
history that kind of played into
our hands in some ways,

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.440
but Yao Ming's first team was
called the Shanghai Sharks.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.810
And when he retired, he bought
the Shanghai Sharks.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:34.660
So we had Yao saves the
sharks, literally and

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.002
metaphorically.

00:16:36.002 --> 00:16:40.500
But every time we've done this,
there's an explosion of

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.270
activity on the micro blogs in
China, which is one of the

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.610
premium mediums.

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:47.290
My understanding is one of the
big differences in China

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:50.070
between social media is a lot
of it is cellphone based.

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:53.010
A lot of people still don't
have good internet

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.290
connections.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:58.170
And also this tends to be like
the micro blog, some extended

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.030
Twitter type thing, which
gets the word out.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:02.670
And so, we've had an
overwhelmingly positive

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.770
reaction from the younger
audience.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:10.520
And how that feeds back I've
seen so many times is that CNN

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.910
did a piece on the shark
fin campaign.

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:13.650
And they had the shark fin
traders, I've been in the

00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.440
business for 50 years,
and my future's

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.420
never looked so gloomy.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:18.920
And it said at the end, but he
doesn't eat shark fin soup

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.050
anymore, because his
grandchildren

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.270
asked him not to.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.480
So even the guy selling it
will not eat it anymore

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.480
because of the influence
of his grandchildren.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.830
And so I think social media
is very, very important.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.070
We tend to seed things through
conventional media,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.680
particularly because if you
get on CCTV1, you have the

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.420
weight and support of the
government implicitly.

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.960
So that means everyone knows
like, OK, so the government's

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:41.500
on board with this.

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.530
And the interesting thing I find
in China is that although

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.780
people talk about political
censorship and things, on the

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.290
environment, there's been a
fantastic amount of debate.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.510
And the government seems to have
decided the environment

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.480
is a legitimate place
for people to

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.160
express their feelings.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.510
And so you see a lot of quite
critical pieces on the

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.250
environment in China, and
largely through social media.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:04.260
So we do have pretty good
relationships with [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.640
.com over there.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.910
It has covered our Yao Ming
story exclusively,

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:08.860
and helps with that.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.810
Also QQ, which is the instant
messaging, who, I think, has

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.490
something like 700 million
subscribers

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.120
or some crazy number.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.940
And we have a microsite
on their website.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.590
So we're going to be using
social media more and more as

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:22.230
we've been able to build
up our staff presence.

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.980
But it's very important.

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:27.160
And everything I see is an
incredible support for these

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:28.810
movements on the internet.

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:30.470
DIANE SOLINGER: And you
mentioned China, and when we

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.630
were talking earlier, if you're
not playing in China

00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:35.830
given the new consumer market,
you really aren't going to

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:36.760
address this at all.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.870
But what are other countries
or other parts of the world

00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:41.310
that WildAid is really taking
a deep dive into?

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:42.610
PETER KNIGHTS: Well, we've
done a lot of work

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.000
consistently in Southeast
Asia.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.970
And again, one of the other
things that gives me hope is

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.250
we did a lot of work with the
rhinos, for example, in

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.940
Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore
when those countries

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.220
where the problems, because
that's where the money was.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:59.620
And the Clinton administration
sanctioned Taiwan over rhino

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:00.580
horn trade.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:03.210
And for 20 years, the rhinos
were doing well, and they were

00:19:03.210 --> 00:19:04.080
increasing.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.710
So we did manage to basically
suppress and close down the

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.210
market in Singapore, Hong
Kong, and Taiwan.

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.860
But a new market emerged,
which was

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.290
Vietnam now and China.

00:19:13.290 --> 00:19:15.880
And so we've got to go around
and redo that same job again

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:16.710
now with these new countries.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:18.690
But I look back and
I say, look, this

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.200
worked for 20 years.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.650
Because some people say, well,
you know what, bans don't

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:23.640
work, and it doesn't happen.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.490
It's like, bans without
education don't work.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:28.360
If people understand why
something is banned and

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.460
they're sympathetic to
it, then a ban can

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.170
be very, very effect.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.370
DIANE SOLINGER: Well, it's just
like telling somebody you

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:35.750
can't have that, and then you
want it more sometimes maybe.

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:36.210
PETER KNIGHTS: Potentially.

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:37.510
It all depends on the process.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.880
DIANE SOLINGER: If they
understand why--

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.665
PETER KNIGHTS: Exactly.

00:19:39.665 --> 00:19:41.990
And the process for the ivory
trade ban was that it had

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.770
international media.

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.520
Everyone was seeing poached
elephants everywhere.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.180
And everyone was like, oh,
this really sucks.

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.720
I didn't realize that's
how ivory comes.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.950
They don't do it anymore.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:52.610
So we've seen successful periods
of conservation with

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.070
both the elephants and rhinos.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:55.450
And then we've seen
when a new market

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:57.830
emerges, it causes problems.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.460
So you kind of have to
counter those things.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.500
So Southeast Asia has been
very important to us.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.380
We've done campaigns.

00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.390
You know, you may have heard a
couple of years ago here we

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.255
got shark fin banned
in California.

00:20:07.255 --> 00:20:07.930
DIANE SOLINGER: Right.

00:20:07.930 --> 00:20:09.580
PETER KNIGHTS: And people said
at the time, well, California

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:11.350
is a relatively small market.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.010
And my argument was, yes,
but you know what?

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:14.600
It's a very influential
market.

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.090
And people look to California
to see what are the new

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.380
environmental things
that are happening.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.870
And I'm pretty certain that
that California ban was

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:23.260
influential in those people
giving up shark fin

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:26.940
in China, as well.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.630
DIANE SOLINGER: So talk
about rhinos a bit.

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.010
Let's run the rhino PSA.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.896
And this one might be a little
sensitive for people, to just

00:20:34.896 --> 00:20:36.784
let you know.

00:20:36.784 --> 00:20:37.190
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:37.190 --> 00:21:05.721
-[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:21:05.721 --> 00:21:06.220
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:06.660
DIANE SOLINGER: I love it.

00:21:06.660 --> 00:21:08.460
When buying stops, the
killing stops.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.590
It's a great tag line.

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:10.160
PETER KNIGHTS: Very
simple idea.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:14.150
In Chinese, it's actually just
no buying, no killing.

00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:17.980
And I actually was in China
recently with a very senior

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:19.370
government official, and
he said to me, he

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:19.940
said, you know what?

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.580
Because of all this stuff,
everybody in

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.050
China knows your slogan.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.820
I said, well, that's very, very
kind of you, but I don't

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:27.230
really think that's the case.

00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:29.000
And he called over the waiter,
and he said, what's the slogan

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.515
about conservation?

00:21:29.515 --> 00:21:31.170
And the waiter trots
out this slogan.

00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:34.420
And one of my other colleagues
was right out in this sort of

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:37.050
very rural area, and she said,
oh, I saw you're Yao Ming

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:37.860
thing going out there.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.460
So the Chinese government's
distribution network reaches

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.000
everybody through CCTV.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.800
And they've been one of our main
sponsors and supporters.

00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.450
And people now are using the
slogan without saying anything

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:49.580
about WildAid, which is great.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.960
So Chinese TV was saying,
when the buying stops,

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.840
the killing can too.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.410
It's become bit of a mantra,
which is fantastic.

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:57.340
DIANE SOLINGER: It's
not about WildAid.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.130
It's about getting--

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.580
PETER KNIGHTS: Absolutely.

00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:58.780
And that's--

00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.080
DIANE SOLINGER: --it to stop.

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.630
PETER KNIGHTS: --always what we
said right from the start

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.480
is like when we got all this
free media space and things.

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.010
First of all, we didn't even
have a name on it, because we

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.040
said it's not about us.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:07.600
It's not about us.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:08.630
It's not about branding.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:09.790
This is not about us
raising money.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:11.560
It's about attitudinal change.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:14.550
And so, I think that's been key
to what we've been able to

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.540
do is we have been prepared to
say, we'll step back as an

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.760
organization--

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.170
suicide for fundraising
probably, but in terms of

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:23.980
getting people to accept the
ideas as their own and they'll

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.950
participate, and definitely
the right way to go.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:27.390
DIANE SOLINGER: Well, you're
building a social movement,

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:29.050
not just building an
organization, and that's a

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:31.805
bigger mission, right?

00:22:31.805 --> 00:22:34.450
PETER KNIGHTS: Yeah.

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:37.700
DIANE SOLINGER: I'm naive
on rhino horn.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.330
What is it used for?

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:41.850
PETER KNIGHTS: Well, it's been
used in traditional medicine

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.720
as a fever reducer as part
of traditional medicine.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.380
And a lot of people say, well,
traditional medicine, BS.

00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:51.550
There is a lot of traditional
medicine which has roots.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:52.930
I mean a lot of Western medicine
is derived from

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.640
natural sources.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.040
But with rhino horn, it has
been thoroughly tested.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:01.560
And the only property it's been
seen to have is in very

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.160
large quantities it reduces
fever mildly.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.380
So the pharmaceutical companies
in the West decided

00:23:06.380 --> 00:23:09.075
there's nothing really worth
pursuing in here.

00:23:09.075 --> 00:23:11.240
But that was the traditional
use.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.610
But what we find now-- we've
just done a survey, so I can

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:17.130
say this with some authority--
that people believe that it

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.200
can be an aphrodisiac.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.495
They believe in some
cases it's a

00:23:20.495 --> 00:23:22.160
hangover cure in Vietnam.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.030
So we've actually gone-- and
some people even believe it

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:24.700
cures cancer.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.310
And basically, rhino
horn is carotene.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.490
It's what you're fingernails
are made of.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.490
It's what your hair
is made of.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:30.740
It's actually made of
compressed, matted hair.

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.570
And so, there's an element
of snake oil

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:36.270
in all of this stuff.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:40.300
And again, this is sort of
when you're talking about

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:43.530
faith-based medicine, it's quite
hard to get around that.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:45.205
So we don't usually take
it on by saying,

00:23:45.205 --> 00:23:46.570
oh, it doesn't work.

00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:48.760
We usually try instead to appeal
to people's better

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.580
sense of look at what you're
causing to happen.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:56.440
And that rhino there, Thandi,
the story now is that because

00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.060
if you shoot a rhino,
there's a gunshot.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.920
And what they've been doing
now is using tranquilizer

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:04.750
darts which are silent, cutting
the face off the rhino

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.480
while it's still alive just
to get these horns.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.160
And they could actually take
the horn off and leave the

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.800
rhino alive.

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.296
But they want to get every bit
of rhino horn so they take the

00:24:14.296 --> 00:24:15.010
whole face off.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:18.090
And Thandi is actually one of
the few rhinos that survived

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:18.840
that process.

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.968
But it's horrible
what's going on.

00:24:20.968 --> 00:24:22.920
DIANE SOLINGER: Right.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.690
And explain the habitat
for the rhino.

00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:26.795
Where does Thandi live?

00:24:26.795 --> 00:24:29.070
PETER KNIGHTS: Thandi lives
in South Africa.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.770
For most endangered species,
the biggest

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.340
threat is habitat loss.

00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.130
They're running out of space.

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.350
Human beings are taking over
the land for agriculture.

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.780
With rhinos, there
is absolutely

00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.460
no shortage of habitat.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.280
We could quite easily
accommodate

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.080
300,000 or 400,000 rhinos.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.020
And yet, there's about 27,000,
30,000 left just

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.360
because of the horn.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:49.100
So there's no shortage.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:51.810
And the last rhino in Vietnam
was poached in

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:53.210
2011, I think it was.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:54.220
DIANE SOLINGER: No more there?

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:54.410
PETER KNIGHTS: No more.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.530
Well, most of the Asian rhinos,
they're down to like

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.870
50 or 100 of the two
species now.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:01.670
Having said that, the white
rhino, which Thandi is one of

00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:05.060
them, came back from 50
individuals to 22,000.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.360
So again, this is a
reason for hope.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.950
When they're not being poached
for their horn, we can bring

00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.670
them back into significant
numbers.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:15.370
So we really do have to
address this problem.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.100
Otherwise, we won't succeed.

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.820
But I'm optimistic that if we
can address the trade issue, a

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.850
lot of these animals can
bounce back to decent

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:25.000
populations.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.840
DIANE SOLINGER: We touched on
a few of the animals that

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:29.720
you're working to try to
bring awareness to.

00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:32.190
What other areas of
focus do you have?

00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:33.040
PETER KNIGHTS: We're
working on tigers

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.280
and a few other species.

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.500
But as an organization, we're
actually starting work on

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.170
climate change as well.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:42.160
Because what we're about is
behavior change, communication

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:44.810
for behavior change, attitudinal
behavior change.

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:47.240
And many of these animals will
be threatened by climate

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.820
change, as well as us
in different ways.

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:52.240
And because of our presence
in China as well as our

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.010
connections to China.

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:55.480
In fact, the Chinese government
came to us-- a very

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.400
senior person in China came to
us and said, we love what

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.850
you're doing with wildlife
trade, but our bigger problem

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:01.340
is climate.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.530
Will you help us work
on the climate?

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:03.980
So--

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.780
DIANE SOLINGER: Similar form
of campaign structure?

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:06.500
PETER KNIGHTS: Exactly.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.030
Same kind of campaign to
sensitize people in China to

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:11.570
what they can do about
mitigating climate change.

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:16.210
And I said, you know, wow,
yes, we'd love to.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.000
Its hard for us to finance
it because we're

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:18.880
not from that world.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.500
But basically, the techniques
we have I think are

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:22.480
applicable.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.590
And so we just starting
that campaign now.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:26.750
And the government's giving
us full backing.

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:30.080
And then the other area we work
on is marine protection.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:31.480
And again, we looked
at what are the

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.060
gaps, what's not happening.

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:36.340
And we've been, I think,
instrumental on trying to use

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:39.050
new technology to protect
marine areas.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.900
And the biggest challenge for
this thing, one is resources.

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.552
But the Galapagos Marine Reserve
we work in, it's the

00:26:44.552 --> 00:26:47.390
size of New York state,
massive area.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:51.020
Boats are slow, very expensive
to maintain, believe me.

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.790
Ever want to lose money,
buy yourself a boat.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.150
Maintenance, fuel, et cetera,
is very expensive.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.950
But the new technology is
getting beyond that.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:00.700
So one of the things we're
employing is satellite vessel

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.610
monitoring.

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.120
So this uses satellite to
basically track the boats in

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:06.870
the same way that air traffic
control uses transponders.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.290
So you can see what the
boat is, how fast

00:27:08.290 --> 00:27:09.970
it's going, what direction.

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:13.920
And now, we don't need a big
boat to be out at sea trying

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.720
to find these people.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.420
We have them on a
radar screen.

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:19.290
And basically, you can even
program it so that it

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.310
recognizes fishing behavior.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:22.420
A boat does a certain thing
when it fishes.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.820
It stops, it puts out a line.

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.630
There's a pattern.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:27.440
So we actually have a situation
now where a guy in

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:29.480
Galapagos is basically sitting
at a computer screen.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.900
He can be enjoying a beer in
the bar, and his cell phone

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:34.650
will tell you, oops, we've
got a problem.

00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.890
And you can see exactly where
it is, what's going on.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:38.620
You send a small boat
to intercept it.

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:40.900
So you're literally saving
millions of dollars a year and

00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:42.520
having really good coverage.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.540
And so now what we see in
Galapagos is right around the

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:46.290
border of the marine reserve,
all these fishing boats are

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.330
queued up, literally
on the border.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:49.810
You can draw the border of
the marine reserve by

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:50.300
where the boats are.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:51.350
DIANE SOLINGER: They know
they can't come in.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.300
PETER KNIGHTS: They know
they can't come in.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.060
If they come in, they're
going to get caught.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.590
So that's making marine
protection of these areas more

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.550
and more affordable.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.656
And even technology like drones
is being used in this

00:28:00.656 --> 00:28:01.410
sort of stuff now.

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.730
So suddenly marine protected
areas, which really are the

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:04.910
poor cousin.

00:28:04.910 --> 00:28:07.320
You know, a national park system
is the backbone of

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.570
conservational land.

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:11.110
DIANE SOLINGER: But it's such
an arbitrary line, right.

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.210
Who's out there policing it?

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.100
PETER KNIGHTS: Well,
that's it.

00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.920
But we got to get more-- right
now, it's about 1% of the

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.600
world's oceans are marine
protected areas.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.400
And it needs to be more
like 10 or 15.

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.040
But one of the arguments
against it was we can't

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:22.490
protect it.

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:23.500
We can't enforce it.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.396
New technology is helping
to solve that.

00:28:25.396 --> 00:28:28.640
DIANE SOLINGER: That's
fantastic.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.500
Want to go ahead and roll
your movie trailer?

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.620
PETER KNIGHTS: Sure.

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.070
DIANE SOLINGER: OK.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.070
Let's roll that.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.950
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:50.018
-[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:28:50.018 --> 00:28:52.855
-I almost travel all over the
world doing my professional

00:28:52.855 --> 00:28:57.030
basketball career, but
never on Africa.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:01.086
-Houston Rockets select Yao
Ming from Shanghai, China.

00:29:26.484 --> 00:29:28.300
-They have a unique
culture here.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:32.560
They have a unique understand
living with all living things.

00:29:54.208 --> 00:29:56.440
-The poachers chopped
off the face and

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.890
removed all the tusks.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:00.230
-They get close to herd,
and then they just

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:03.610
opened up and shoot.

00:30:03.610 --> 00:30:05.240
-This is where they hacked
away the face.

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.580
-Since 2008 or so, there's been
a massive epidemic of

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:15.490
poaching of ivory in West
Central and East Africa and of

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:17.320
rhinos down here in
South Africa.

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.680
-The poaching right now is the
worst that it's been since the

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.520
ivory trade ban came
in in 1989.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.010
-They said they miss two
rhinos every 18 hours.

00:30:28.010 --> 00:30:30.290
-They've arrested people
with AK-47s.

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.210
-There are helicopters
involved.

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:33.780
They've got dart guns.

00:30:33.780 --> 00:30:35.400
They've got night-vision
goggles.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.770
-China is driving the illegal
trade in ivory more than any

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:41.940
other country in the
world at this time.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.920
You have unprecedented wealth,
and middle class people who

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:47.920
could never afford
ivory in the past

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.310
are suddenly consumers.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:52.380
-People in China were not aware
that these beautiful

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:55.692
items that they bought, each one
was causing the death of

00:30:55.692 --> 00:30:56.670
an elephant.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.650
-They are not just these big
prehistoric creatures.

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:01.810
They actually have
personalities.

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:02.556
They feel pain.

00:31:02.556 --> 00:31:03.250
They feel distress.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:04.530
They feel fear.

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.427
-When you touch a tusk like
that, just only that big, you

00:31:07.427 --> 00:31:11.760
feel that it's just an animal
at age maybe five

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.880
or six years old.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.518
It really makes you feel
sad about a lot of it.

00:31:16.518 --> 00:31:20.270
-The scary thing is at this
point in time, there's no end

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:20.739
in sight.

00:31:20.739 --> 00:31:25.992
-If we talk about 23,000 rhino,
that'll be gone in a

00:31:25.992 --> 00:31:26.468
flash.

00:31:26.468 --> 00:31:31.210
-When you kill elephants, you're
killing our livelihood.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:34.650
-We have to understand, we
share this world with all

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:36.400
living things on this planet.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.750
-It was amazing that this man
who is so highly respected in

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:47.756
his own community is prepared
to put his name through this

00:31:47.756 --> 00:31:48.217
crisis.

00:31:48.217 --> 00:31:50.070
-The incredible support
that it's gotten.

00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:53.230
Had maybe 100 different
celebrities that have carried

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.130
this message.

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.530
The support of the Chinese
government has been critical.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.883
Having the support of the
Chinese media has been

00:31:58.883 --> 00:31:59.750
absolutely phenomenal.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.920
-When the buying stops,
the killing can too.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.160
-On the streets, hundreds of
millions of people in China

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.790
and beyond for this film is part
of what is already the

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:09.740
largest wildlife awareness
program ever.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.224
-We are going to name
[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:12.224 --> 00:32:15.760
because we want you to be
our elephant defender.

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.175
-Just think, about three weeks
ago the elephant still running

00:32:18.175 --> 00:32:20.110
and playing with others.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.670
I believe that people who have
seen those pictures will

00:32:22.670 --> 00:32:23.810
remember it.

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:24.978
That's why we're here for.

00:32:24.978 --> 00:32:25.954
Film this.

00:32:25.954 --> 00:32:27.906
Bring it back to home.

00:32:27.906 --> 00:32:30.824
Show it to everybody, and show
everybody the reality.

00:32:30.824 --> 00:32:32.760
-It's a bad nightmare
all over.

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:35.180
It's horrific, but I do believe
it can be stopped.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.060
-I just hope we can keep this
land still peaceful.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:42.290
Full of life, there's all
people here and animal.

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:45.406
So we can come back one day,
say, there's still hope here.

00:33:01.054 --> 00:33:01.543
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:01.543 --> 00:33:04.410
DIANE SOLINGER: He is
tremendous in that.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:06.190
It is a huge battle that
he's taken on.

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:09.005
And he's going home and
sharing the story.

00:33:09.005 --> 00:33:10.520
And he's going to make
a huge difference.

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.730
And this whole campaign
is amazing.

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:14.580
So this is the trailer
that you have.

00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.840
How long is the full
documentary?

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.180
PETER KNIGHTS: Haven't
made it yet.

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.240
DIANE SOLINGER: You haven't
made it yet?

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:18.740
It's almost there.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.050
PETER KNIGHTS: Still trying
to raise the money for it.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:20.560
No.

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.080
We hope to get it out by
January next year.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:28.290
And CCTV looks like they're
going to take it on and do a

00:33:28.290 --> 00:33:30.600
one hour special on elephants
and one on rhinos.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.660
And when we did his blog on that
trip, it got a million

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.910
followers, which was great.

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:39.795
We don't normally do long-format
documentaries.

00:33:39.795 --> 00:33:41.870
But in this case because
Yao had retired, he had

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:42.500
the time to do it.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:44.680
And I've always wanted
to take either him or

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.530
Jackie Chan to Africa.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.640
One, for them to fall in love,
as everybody does that goes on

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:50.870
these trips.

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.420
But secondly, to see it from a
Chinese perspective and then

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.470
to be able to articulate.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:57.100
So now, when Yao talks to
people-- and he's actually a

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.880
National People's Congress
member now, as well.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.800
So he may even be moving
legislation on this forward,

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.870
which is great.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.280
You know to speak from their
own personal experience.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.250
And you can't go out there and
see the stuff that we have to

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:11.820
see without it moving you.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.580
And we hope that we can
bring this back.

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:16.179
I think it's probably going to
be the first time you've had a

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:19.389
Chinese protagonist on a
documentary like this.

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.400
And that's important too,
because we want people to

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.550
aspire to being like Yao,
helping the animals.

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:28.570
And too often, you see
criticism of China

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:29.440
environmentally.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.929
And the reality is there's a lot
of quite good things going

00:34:31.929 --> 00:34:33.199
on in China.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:34.510
And people need encouragement.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:36.179
When they're doing stuff,
they need encouragement.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:39.820
And so I hope that Yao
would inspire others.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.420
And certainly, he was inspired
by Jackie Chan in that

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:42.150
campaign before.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:43.350
So that was nice.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.679
That was sort of a generation
handover.

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:46.489
We hope we can keep
to doing that.

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.480
DIANE SOLINGER: Well, and the
idea that I find so compelling

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:51.540
is that the message is clear.

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:54.010
And there's an actionable step
that somebody can do.

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:55.570
It's don't buy that.

00:34:55.570 --> 00:34:56.840
Make that decision.

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:57.840
You're a consumer now.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.980
Make this choice.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.420
So we've seen that work.

00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.520
You mentioned the younger
generation affecting and

00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.320
causing behavioral change in
older generations, as well.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:11.100
Remember back even back
in the smoking area.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.270
PETER KNIGHTS: Smoking's the
classic example where kids

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:14.350
have influenced the parents.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.700
DIANE SOLINGER: I used to go
around and tell my grandpa,

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:16.790
you know, cut it out.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:17.675
And so--

00:35:17.675 --> 00:35:19.040
PETER KNIGHTS: It's
hard to argue.

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:22.570
DIANE SOLINGER: Yeah it
does float back up.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:23.430
It's terrific.

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:25.160
Thank you for sharing
how you're doing it.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.970
And this is a different way
than a lot of wildlife

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.630
organizations are attacking
these problems.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.400
I mean it is bold.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.630
It's in your face.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.090
But it's giving you something
that you can do.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.420
You can make a choice.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.400
And interesting way of doing it,
but what you're saying is

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.250
you're doing it differently
than others on purpose,

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:43.500
because you're dealing with the
consumer side, with the

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.370
buyer side.

00:35:44.370 --> 00:35:46.570
And most are dealing with
the other side.

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:48.520
So I think together, you know,
put it together, what a

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:52.450
powerful opportunity to really
save some of the world's most

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.822
precious species.

00:35:54.822 --> 00:35:58.310
I'd like to open it up to some
questions from the folks here

00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:59.470
at YouTube.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:01.870
Anybody have anything they'd
like to ask Peter?

00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:03.610
AUDIENCE: So I'm very impressed
with all the work

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:04.400
that you've done.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.200
And I was curious more about how
it sounded like a lot of

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.930
the problems were more reactive
in terms of like

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:13.820
here's a problem.

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:14.920
Let's go and fix it now.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:17.910
And then it would come
back and do it again.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:21.480
How are you leveraging
technology to be a bit more

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.720
proactive about future problems
that can arise?

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.540
PETER KNIGHTS: To be honest, the
problem is not predicting.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:30.080
The problem is getting
work financed.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.350
And so, we only just started the
elephant-rhino campaigns

00:36:34.350 --> 00:36:36.550
because I've only just
got it financed.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:40.440
And I can tell you right now
that every species that's in

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.210
trade should have some
type of campaign

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.380
like this, in my opinion.

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:48.220
And the sharks, to a large
degree, not many sharks are

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.720
classified as endangered yet.

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.020
They're all heading that way.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.480
So in many ways that was our
predictive campaign, was to

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.120
say if we don't carry
on like this.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.130
The other element that
was predictive

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:57.500
is working in China.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:02.470
And there isn't another China
in terms of wildlife

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:03.320
consumption.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.900
There are smaller countries,
like some of the Southeast

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.520
Asian countries, which
will grow, like

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.470
Vietnam's come out there.

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:12.530
But the problem with being
predictive in this business,

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:16.630
unfortunately, is resources.

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:19.290
We're having a hard time funding
this now, because it's

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:19.990
not conventional.

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:21.710
It's not the conventional
approach.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:25.820
So there's probably between $50
and $100 million spent at

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.730
the supply end for rhinos
or elephants every year.

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:31.540
And until recently, there's
been nothing

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:32.260
spent on the demand.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.260
And then now there's about
$300,000 or $400,000.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.700
So it's been very hard to even
be on the crisis, let alone

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:39.670
ahead of the curve on this.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:42.770
But my dream for all this,
and now many other--

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:47.490
I was in DC yesterday, and the
Fish and Wildlife Service

00:37:47.490 --> 00:37:49.330
there, they were all talking
about demand reduction now.

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:50.250
So it's starting to become more

00:37:50.250 --> 00:37:52.160
mainstream in people's thinking.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:54.770
And so I'm hopeful that going
forward we can have something

00:37:54.770 --> 00:37:57.880
which is much more proactive
and more predictive.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.990
So when the International
Endangered Species List,

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:04.380
[INAUDIBLE], puts a species on
that list, in my opinion there

00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:07.350
needs to be a campaign
to publicize that.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.550
And that would be my goal
is to have these kind of

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.000
campaigns running all of the
places they need to be

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.700
running, but also to be looking
at what's the next

00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.150
problem going to be and
let's head it off.

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:19.270
Having said that, I do think
that the campaign--

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:21.580
we featured many different
animals and I think--

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:23.210
it's almost like a brand.

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:26.620
You're trying to go beyond
the individual message.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.800
So now the slogan, I hope with
the elephant campaign, people

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:32.390
be like, well, this is
just like the sharks.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:35.630
These animals have been killed
for pretty senseless use.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:37.960
And there's too many
people buying it.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.190
As you say, the reaction's
the same.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:41.340
Don't buy it, or tell other
people not to buy it.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:43.950
So I hope we're being somewhat
predictive in terms of now

00:38:43.950 --> 00:38:46.680
setting a precedent out there
where other species come up.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.760
People are already, OK, we
recognize this problem.

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.080
We know what we have
to do about it.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.980
AUDIENCE: I would imagine that
really looking at partnerships

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:58.280
with technology companies to
leverage technology to

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.840
predicting fever outbreaks and
looking for technology

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.050
partners to scale--

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:06.480
PETER KNIGHTS: I'm not sure the
prediction thing is that

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.120
complicated.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:09.890
I could tell you now the
countries that-- you just look

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:11.300
at where the economics
are going.

00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.580
And so you look at any country
that's rising economically

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.650
that has some history of this
use, and you say, that may be

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:17.680
a problem for us.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:20.510
Where I think technology and
the companies can help is

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:22.620
getting the message out and
getting the message out

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:23.170
creatively.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:24.705
I mean we were talking
before about--

00:39:24.705 --> 00:39:27.020
we actually did a PSA
competition in China.

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.600
And like a million people voted
on the competition.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.610
But maybe we could do something
with YouTube about

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:34.300
how would you get this message
over and use that.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.640
And can we make it go viral?

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.450
And I think there's tremendous
usage there.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:41.640
And then similarly with some
of the technology on the

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.650
marine protected areas.

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:44.760
Again, I know Google's
funded some work

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.300
on drones, for example.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:48.760
There's definitely a good
connection there.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.870
But I think from my point of
view, it's how can we use

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:53.480
social media to get the message
out wider and more

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:55.945
consistently and make some
of these things go viral?

00:39:55.945 --> 00:39:56.400
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:56.945
Thank you.

00:39:56.945 --> 00:39:57.735
PETER KNIGHTS: Thank you.

00:39:57.735 --> 00:40:00.000
AUDIENCE: You mentioned earlier
that anyone who

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.070
actually goes to these
environments and sees what's

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:06.370
happening can't help but be
moved by what they're seeing.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:08.760
I realize that there are a lot
of limitations to getting

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:09.640
people actually there.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.810
It's very costly and
all that stuff.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:12.254
PETER KNIGHTS: Especially
when you're seven

00:40:12.254 --> 00:40:13.100
foot six, as well.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:13.760
I can tell you.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:15.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:19.370
But are there any, I guess,
organizations that instead of

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.860
having people, tourists, going
out on safaris, going out

00:40:21.860 --> 00:40:24.060
instead and trying to help
with organizations like

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.040
WildAid or other non-profits.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.170
PETER KNIGHTS: There are some
that do that for on the ground

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:29.350
conservation projects.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.800
I mean, if it was us, I'd have
to call it something like

00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:33.550
holidays from hell.

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:35.370
Believe me, you don't want to
stand next to a rotting

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:36.620
carcass of an elephant.

00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.450
It's not very pleasant.

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:40.020
Emotionally as well, it's
pretty draining, I

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:40.510
have to tell you.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:41.970
But yes.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.560
There are a number of
organizations that do

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.230
volunteers.

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.200
So Save the Elephants
you saw there.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.510
They have volunteers come and
help them work out there.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.130
And there's actually---

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:51.130
DIANE SOLINGER: Strong partner
for you, correct?

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.010
PETER KNIGHTS: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:56.260
And, there's a guy who should
be in the film called Simba

00:40:56.260 --> 00:41:00.160
who is Chinese even though
he has a Swahili name.

00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:03.980
And he has Chinese--

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.730
normally children of quite
wealthy Chinese-- come out and

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.440
volunteer on his project, which
again is a great way of

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:11.400
seeding back the message and
getting it back there.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:14.740
And I think increasingly what
we're seeing now is there's

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:16.750
going to be tremendous
interest from China.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:19.250
There's tremendous economic
interest from China in Africa.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.180
It's the biggest investor
in Africa now.

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:26.170
And as we say to people
sometimes, why by an ivory

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:28.520
carving when for less money you
can take your whole family

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:29.930
out and see a live
elephant, have an

00:41:29.930 --> 00:41:32.060
experience of a lifetime?

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.850
Because part of the other thing
we want to do with this

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.810
film is to explain to people
that you don't need to be

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:39.090
scared of going to Africa.

00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:40.250
It's a pretty safe place.

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.110
And you're not going to come
down with dengue fever the

00:41:42.110 --> 00:41:43.910
first day you arrive and
things like that.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:46.480
And so to encourage more and
more people from China to go

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.260
to Africa and see
for themselves.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:53.300
DIANE SOLINGER: And Google has
a huge emerging market effort

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:56.990
in trying to help people with
their economic prosperity and

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.770
be entrepreneurs and put their
businesses online.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:04.100
And as we do that in our role,
we just kind of wonder how do

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:08.020
we do that and help people in a
really socially responsible

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:11.020
way as they become new consumers
and build those

00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.740
economic kind of prosperities
in their countries, making

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:17.500
sure that this is part of
the conscience somehow.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:17.740
It's something maybe
we can do.

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:18.770
PETER KNIGHTS: It's all
about awareness.

00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:20.830
And it's also about just trying
to make these things

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:21.800
fashionable, if you like.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.560
Because somebody said, what
are you trying to do?

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.080
It's like I'm trying to brand
conservation in China.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.270
The conservation is just like a
Nike or something like that,

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:31.590
that it's something that
people aspire to.

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:32.340
They have a good feeling.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:34.060
It's not just about saying
don't buy it.

00:42:34.060 --> 00:42:37.770
It's about saying I want to
be on Yao Ming's side.

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.410
I want to be part of his team,
and things like that.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:41.830
And I think that's
very important.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:43.610
And from what we've seen so far,
particularly the social

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.910
media, there was an internet
survey done.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:49.460
27,500 people said ban
the shark fin and

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.740
400 people said don't.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.985
So particularly the young
communities, there's a strong,

00:42:53.985 --> 00:42:55.800
strong feeling for this stuff.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.560
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:43:00.630
You mentioned that there
is that, I guess, shark

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:04.610
fishermen's trade union or trade
organization that kind

00:43:04.610 --> 00:43:05.820
of sued you.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:09.190
In the United States, there's
a lot of media that kind of

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:11.570
attacks people who try
to get the message

00:43:11.570 --> 00:43:13.100
out on climate change.

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.740
I was wondering do you see that
often in other types of

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.460
conservation, like maybe
traditional medicine, like

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.550
some sort of trade organizations
or something?

00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:21.050
PETER KNIGHTS: Yeah.

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.660
Traditional medicine isn't
very well organized.

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.810
The shark fin traders
who tried to sue us.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:28.680
And again, they were pretty
stupid frankly, because

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.780
ultimately the whole campaign
just kept the campaign alive.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.040
It was in the news every
day in Thailand.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.930
And it became more of a
self-fulfilling prophecy than

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:37.690
shutting us up.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:39.380
And in the end, the judge found
that everything we said

00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:40.310
was accurate.

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:41.910
So it didn't really
do them very good.

00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:45.900
But US is obviously probably
the most litigious place on

00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:46.380
the planet.

00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.540
But yeah.

00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:48.750
And you see that here--

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:51.230
I think the debate, the sort
of gag orders on food, on

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.720
commenting on food.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.170
We're the democratic country.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:58.180
And ironically, in China, the
shark fin traders, I was told,

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.570
went to the government and said,
oh, these people are

00:44:01.570 --> 00:44:03.345
attacking our business, and you
should close them, and Yao

00:44:03.345 --> 00:44:04.220
Ming shouldn't be involved.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:06.140
And the government said,
actually, it's up to Yao Ming.

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:09.280
If he wants to be involved,
that's fine.

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.240
Also ironic that the images that
we have, the hard images,

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.050
which you do have to show.

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.496
The amount of people that have
come up to me and said I don't

00:44:15.496 --> 00:44:17.480
eat shark fin soup any more
because I saw how they were

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.990
killing the sharks.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:20.540
It's very, very powerful
to show that.

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.020
We wouldn't be able to
show that on US TV.

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.320
It would be censored or cut.

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:25.290
Because if you've got blood or
anything with animals, they

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.700
don't-- they'll show you all
kinds of horrible things in

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:30.800
movies, but when it comes to
anything nasty happening to

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:32.700
animals, there's big
restrictions on it.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.650
In China, they haven't.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:36.210
They've showed that footage even
at prime time and haven't

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.992
really culled back, which,
again, is encouraging.

00:44:39.992 --> 00:44:44.890
DIANE SOLINGER: What about
labeling of products?

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:47.020
Is that something that
you're seeing?

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:50.680
Remember that the no animal
testing type of

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:51.530
stuff or you know?

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:52.480
PETER KNIGHTS: It's starting.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:55.020
All the trends that happen over
here are starting to take

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.050
on in China.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:58.250
And so, for example, one of the
things we're trying to do

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:00.630
on climate change is they have
an energy labeling scheme with

00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:02.820
like rating for appliances.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:06.140
And there's one problem in that
when they did the scheme

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:07.850
originally, they didn't
calibrate it properly.

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:09.930
So we've got to try and work
with the government to get it

00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.020
recalibrated.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:13.010
But then there's been
no promotion of it.

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:15.430
So they've got compulsory energy
labelling, but nobody's

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:16.890
gone out and said, this is
why you should use it.

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:21.050
Or what I want to do is say
you'll save this much money by

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:23.430
buying this unit, and
things like that.

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:24.670
So yeah.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:27.530
All that stuff is-- everything
we do here is in China now.

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:30.660
China is so changed since
I've been working there.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.910
So much of what's going on
in China is cutting edge.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:35.630
I was speaking to somebody
from James Cameron's

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:36.510
organization yesterday.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:39.800
They've got a big studio they're
building in China, 3D.

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.760
And I think China is a pretty
sophisticated place in many

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:45.350
ways now and in many different
places, and I think one of

00:45:45.350 --> 00:45:47.450
most capable countries in
the world, frankly.

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:50.370
And I think if we can get them
on this, then I think they can

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:53.930
solve this problem
pretty quickly.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:54.130
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:55.366
PETER KNIGHTS: Hi.

00:45:55.366 --> 00:45:57.600
AUDIENCE: So it sounds like
WildAid is very focused on

00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:00.290
conservation and on endangered
species.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:03.090
And I don't know much about it
yet, but I recently learned

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:09.130
that China also has bear farms
and they use bear materials

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:10.290
for various medical uses.

00:46:10.290 --> 00:46:13.380
And I was wondering what's your
opinion on the need to

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:15.950
publicize animals that aren't
necessarily endangered but

00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:17.360
maybe should be wild.

00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:19.080
They are mistreated.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.050
And people still aren't aware
of what happens to the

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:23.720
products that they receive.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.710
PETER KNIGHTS: Yeah, the bears
is an interesting one.

00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:28.080
I actually filmed those bear
farms back in-- oh my god, I

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.970
don't want to date
myself here--

00:46:28.970 --> 00:46:30.420
1995.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.190
And the one thing about bear
gall is this is the one that

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:35.010
really works.

00:46:35.010 --> 00:46:37.150
This is actually something
that has properties.

00:46:37.150 --> 00:46:40.200
And what we've done in Western
medicine is we've taken that

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:43.180
property, which is a unique
acid which occurs in bear

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.860
bile, and we synthesized it.

00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.870
And we can make them like
we can make aspirins.

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:48.630
And that's the steps they
haven't made in China.

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:50.745
They've gone halfway, which is
to mechanize the process,

00:46:50.745 --> 00:46:53.420
which is to put these bears
into these horrible farms

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.640
where literally these
bears are in a cage

00:46:55.640 --> 00:46:56.930
the size of the bear.

00:46:56.930 --> 00:47:00.020
And daily, they will milk
the bile from them.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:03.711
And we have done some
work on that.

00:47:03.711 --> 00:47:06.390
There's more sensitivity to
that, funnily enough, because

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:09.590
it is seen as a part of
traditional medicine, and for

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:11.925
a lot of people in China, the
only medicine system is

00:47:11.925 --> 00:47:12.870
traditional medicine.

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:14.880
So the government is very,
very defensive

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:16.310
of traditional medicine.

00:47:16.310 --> 00:47:20.380
But what we've tried to do
with that is work with

00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.940
traditional medicine
practitioners who will say

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.490
there's alternatives within
traditional medicine.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:25.260
There's other things
you can use

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.270
within traditional medicine.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:28.220
Because a lot of people use
traditional medicine because

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:29.500
it's cheap.

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:31.200
The irony with these endangered
species products,

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.410
they're very expensive.

00:47:32.410 --> 00:47:34.240
So that is another campaign.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.990
Again, it's part
desensitization.

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:38.130
It's taken off in China now so
there's opposition within

00:47:38.130 --> 00:47:41.050
China itself to the whole
bear farming industry.

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:43.690
But that's still one
that's out there.

00:47:43.690 --> 00:47:46.910
They also have tigers in tiger
farms, as well, nearly 10,000

00:47:46.910 --> 00:47:48.120
tigers in tiger farms.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.100
And there was a big move to
try and legalize tiger

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.850
products from these
tiger farms.

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:55.390
And working with Jackie Chan and
Yao and people like that,

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:58.410
we were able to head that
one off at the pass.

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:00.480
Because the danger is with these
things is, particularly

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.610
with traditional medicine, is
a belief that part of what

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:05.640
you're doing is you're getting
the power of the animal.

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.695
And so even though you might
have farm tigers, a farm tiger

00:48:09.695 --> 00:48:11.460
is not the same as
a wild tiger.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:13.670
So what you may be doing is all
you're doing is creating a

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:14.340
mass market.

00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:15.970
There's still the market for
the high end stuff that's

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:17.930
still there, which you
may be promoting.

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:19.750
So we've done some
work on bears.

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:22.750
I'd like to do some more work
one bears in the future.

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:24.260
And the Asiatic bears
are endangered.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:28.072
There's only about
50,000 left.

00:48:28.072 --> 00:48:30.310
DIANE SOLINGER: You had another
question next to you?

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:31.220
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:35.080
I was just wondering, from all
of your experiences, what has

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:38.010
surprised you?

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:38.640
PETER KNIGHTS: What
has surprised me?

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.950
Good or bad?

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:41.790
AUDIENCE: Whichever.

00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:45.570
PETER KNIGHTS: Well, I mean, I
think on the bad side, I think

00:48:45.570 --> 00:48:47.860
from doing the undercover
investigations, is just the

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:50.780
crazy things people will
do to animals.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.490
It doesn't make sense,
a lot of the stuff.

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:55.180
Because people in the bird
trade, for example--

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.680
I did a lot of work on the wild
bird trade, which has

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.850
been greatly decreased through
various efforts.

00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:02.960
But people were feeding baby
parrots, and they were using

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:07.480
like ketchup bottles in like
a conveyor belt like this.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:08.740
And they would overfeed.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.600
It was being done so quickly and
roughly that three or four

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.390
of these birds would choke
in the process.

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:16.510
And you're like, that doesn't
make any sense.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:18.560
You're killing the things
you're trying to save.

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:21.110
But when you have these
industrialized processes,

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:21.980
people do crazy things.

00:49:21.980 --> 00:49:23.990
They put too many birds in the
box to try and save money,

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:25.610
which ends up killing
them all.

00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:29.710
And so it surprised me how
irrationally people

00:49:29.710 --> 00:49:31.600
behave on that end.

00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:35.260
I think on the other end what
surprised me is how quickly

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.330
people in China and parts of
Asia have become sensitized to

00:49:38.330 --> 00:49:39.320
these issues.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.320
So people--

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:43.410
when we started this campaign,
people said, oh, you'll never

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:44.030
change China.

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:46.090
Oh, this has been thousands
of years.

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:48.840
And my counter is, I don't think
there's been anywhere in

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.790
the history of the planet that's
changed as quickly as

00:49:50.790 --> 00:49:53.470
China has changed in
the last 10 years.

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:54.660
Everything has changed.

00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:55.940
It's a whole new ballgame.

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:57.160
So we're not trying
to change things.

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.950
We're trying to make this
part of the change.

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:01.880
And what I've found and has
really heartened me and

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.560
surprised me is how quickly
people get it, and when they

00:50:04.560 --> 00:50:07.680
get it, how they start
to switch to the

00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:08.990
other side quite rapidly.

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:10.440
An example is Taiwan.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.270
I did a lot of work there.

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:14.220
And it wasn't that long ago when
people were involved in

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:15.890
eating dogs, for example.

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:18.330
And now people have a little
dog, and it's in the car, and

00:50:18.330 --> 00:50:19.100
it's driving there.

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:22.270
And it's part of the family
and things like that.

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:23.650
And that's happened
very quickly.

00:50:23.650 --> 00:50:26.340
Whereas in the West, our
sensitivity to animals has

00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.760
evolved over 300 years.

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.965
And if you were back in the
Industrial Revolution and you

00:50:30.965 --> 00:50:32.360
saw the way we treated
animals, you

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:33.850
would be truly ashamed.

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:35.520
And that's kind of where
China is now.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.810
But they have to make this
change in the space of 10

00:50:37.810 --> 00:50:38.465
years, not 300.

00:50:38.465 --> 00:50:39.500
And it's not just on this.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.340
It's on everything else.

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:42.010
And what's amazing is
they are doing it.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:42.920
DIANE SOLINGER: They're
doing it, yeah.

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.210
PETER KNIGHTS: And you
look at how smoking

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:45.740
is reduced in China.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.240
It used to be everywhere.

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.245
Now you go into Beijing,
and the taxis

00:50:49.245 --> 00:50:50.700
don't smell of smoke.

00:50:50.700 --> 00:50:52.410
Hotels don't smell of smoke.

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:55.790
This has happened in like a
year, you've seen the changes.

00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:58.110
So the pace at which people
are capable of change has

00:50:58.110 --> 00:50:59.080
surprised me.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:00.820
And it also gives me
reason to hope.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.310
I believe we can do this in time
to save these species.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:03.740
DIANE SOLINGER: Thank you.

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:08.970
In parting, right before you
leave, what do you think we

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:11.850
can do as Googlers, as
individuals, as YouTubers?

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:12.870
What can we do?

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:14.330
PETER KNIGHTS: Get involved
and spread the message of

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:15.060
what's going on.

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:18.990
And I think we'd love to work
with you guys more on how we

00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:22.270
can use social media to get
these messages out, get people

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:24.810
involved and engaged, make
it cool, make it fun.

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:28.480
Because again, the key to me on
any of these issues is very

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.710
often we have a problem.

00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:30.960
It gets in the news.

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.610
Its flavor of the month
for like a week, or 15

00:51:33.610 --> 00:51:34.800
seconds, as they say.

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.840
And then we move on.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.610
And the key to me about solving
these problems is

00:51:37.610 --> 00:51:39.720
keeping it out there for an
extended period, so people

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.010
don't think it's solved
and go away.

00:51:41.010 --> 00:51:42.590
But they keep working.

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:44.290
I think that's why we've had the
success with the sharks.

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:45.950
And we've been working
it for a long time.

00:51:45.950 --> 00:51:46.795
And we haven't gone away.

00:51:46.795 --> 00:51:47.890
We haven't just done
a six-month

00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:48.600
campaign and given up.

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.300
We just stayed on with
it and eventually--

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.240
DIANE SOLINGER: It can't be the
next new shining thing.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.670
You got to stick with this
and stick with it.

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:53.630
PETER KNIGHTS: And then
eventually you

00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:54.530
hit a tipping point.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:56.860
DIANE SOLINGER: Yeah.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:00.030
And there are some things that
you can do through Google

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:02.290
immediately.

00:52:02.290 --> 00:52:05.570
WildAid has a project
in our GoGive tool.

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:10.150
It's also part of the
environment campaign, so there

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:12.870
are volunteer opportunities
for WildAid.

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:14.400
PETER KNIGHTS: I know nothing
about social media, so I need

00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:14.950
help on social media.

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:15.520
DIANE SOLINGER: So that.

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.270
And there's an AdWords
program.

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:19.780
They're interested in maximizing
their AdWords grant

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.520
that they have from
Google, as well.

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.140
So what I want to do
now is thank you.
