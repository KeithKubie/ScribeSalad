00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.910
Welcome to now you see it

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.680
One of the most important characters in a movie often times is actually the setting where the movie takes place in the same way that

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.729
A character has a personality influences the plot or represents a certain idea

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.720
So too can a setting just as effectively

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.060
Contribute to the mood style or themes in a story while settings always indicate time or place

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.829
I want to look at the many instances when setting goes even deeper and either gives insight into a character

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.950
symbolizes a certain idea moves forward the plot or

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.789
establishes mood a setting is wherever a scene takes place and can be anywhere from space to a desert to virtual reality [a]

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.219
Lot of the time a setting is an extension of a character depending [on] where a character works lives or spends their free time

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.759
We learn more about them perhaps [the] best example of the use of setting to describe a character is the Xanadu in Citizen kane this

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.670
Castle where Charles [Kane] lives is ridiculously large

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.949
Elusive secluded and creepy the inside of his mansion has many rooms [some] of them almost completely empty

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.840
others filled to the brim with Knickknacks

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.530
and other trophies kane cares nothing about his home seems either Barren or

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.450
artificially stuffed with objects for king to live there we infer that he's extremely wealthy looking to separate himself from the world lonely Empty and

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.899
Unsuccessfully filling his emptiness with pointless trophies this setting contrasts nicely with the small cozy Cabin

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.779
He lived in as a child which was much more intimate at homee

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.409
About [schmidt] has a similar use of setting if a character is introduced in a completely barren room

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.779
What does that say [about] the character in?

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:50.860
lost in translation

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.249
Charlotte and Bob feel confused and out of place in tokyo and the setting reinforces how they feel out of touch with their

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.789
Significant others as they grow closer and understand how to cope with their fears and problems the portrayal of tokyo goes from Dark and confusing

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.919
close-Ups at the beginning to clear Bright wide shots at the end the settings showcased their growth as

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:14.609
Characters a setting can also be a strong symbol in the movie and represent some idea for example Vietnam war movies usually

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.330
Portray the war as ambiguous

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.869
senseless and full of confusion and these ideas are

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.620
represented in the Dense Dark and

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.519
Menacing jungle where it's oftentimes hard to tell friend from foe in Little Miss sunshine the beauty pageant represents a flawed?

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.060
American Dream Beauty Pageants are a strange phenomenon American society where little [girls] are paraded [onstage] and judged on their outer appearance

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.890
[the] film uses the setting of the beauty pageant to Critique how the American dream is composed of

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.589
superficial and unfulfilled goals [the] pageant is a

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.699
Representation of those who buy into this false dream the family member is rejecting the beauty pageant in defining their own happiness themselves Conveys

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.300
The message that one's worth is determined

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.389
[by] the self and not by a panel of judges [a] similar example would be office space where his office

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.240
Represents a world where people put financial security at a well-paying job over their own happiness [a] setting can really represent

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.359
anything in life of [Pi] Pi's journey across the Ocean is a

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.109
representation of his spiritual journey while the meaning of this setting is more strongly emphasized in the novel the film still makes the connection between

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.800
His spiritual journey across the Ocean and a person's spiritual Journey in life one important part of his journey is landing on the Moving Island

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.199
while he can survive on this island the island is toxic and he would live his life trapped on it without completing his journey and

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.950
Dying alone and unfulfilled the island is a symbol of the choice everyone has to avoid completing his or her spiritual Journey the movie

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.360
Criticizes staying on this island [the] setting of the island represents an obstacle in every person's spiritual journey if someone wants they can never figure

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.100
Out what they believe in and instead remain on the Island [and] die unfulfilled and forgotten [the] movie

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.399
Criticizes this religious choice and uses the setting to convey this criticism. [I] saw how my life would end if I stood on that Island

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.400
Alone Forgotten [I]

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.269
Had to get back to the word or die trying

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.260
One important thing to know when analyzing a setting is what ends up happening?

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.510
To it do characters leave it or do they stay the most powerful ending of a setting is when it gets blown [up]?

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.260
Or burned down because that represents a rejection of whatever that setting

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.169
Symbolizes settings can act like characters when they influence the plot settings have the power to leave people stranded on a desert Island

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:15.689
Kill them or Force two characters to come together

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.410
We're moving

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:25.589
Characters can never truly remove themselves from setting and setting continuously gets used to advance

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.020
The Story forward not every setting has a higher meaning

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:34.079
But just about each one sets a certain mood for a scene film noir sets the mood of mystery and Deception by placing characters in

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.659
Settings with loss of shadow lighting and contrast another very common setting trope is menacing lightning which

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.839
Consistently conveys fear or doom often in a comedic way

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.679
Filmmakers really have limitless options in how a setting conveys a mood if someone is on a setting high up that shows power if someone

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.670
Is set low in the dirt it signifies a lack of Power emperor Kuzco?

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.809
Whether a setting is big cramped clean dirty safe

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.810
Or dangerous it can contribute infinite layers to a story setting is an underrated character settings [provide]. Just as much meaning

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.960
Symbolism plot elements and mood as a real-life character

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.169
So when analyzing is seen don't forget that just because settings are in the background doesn't mean they're not worth noticing. Thanks for watching

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.499
