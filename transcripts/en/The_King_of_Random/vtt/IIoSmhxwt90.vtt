00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.460
Hey guys

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.259
It's turning into liquid nitrogen week on the king of Random and today is no [exception] for bizarre happenings

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.599
Welcome back to the king of random cooking show

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.660
I'm just joking this video [was] sponsored by a company called [hellofresh]

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.220
They send boxes of food to your door to make it easier and more convenient to make your meals

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.709
But my wife will tell you I am not much of a cook so rather than taking these ingredients and turning them into three

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.369
Gourmet meals like you're supposed to do [I] wonder what would happen if you took some fruits

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.840
Vegetables and even meat and dip them in a bath of liquid nitrogen just to see what would happen

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.300
Let's start off with a piece of lettuce

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.220
You know lettuce is Bendy, flimsy, and floppy, but if we stick that down into the [liquid] nitrogen that all changes very very quickly

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.420
And all it takes is a couple of seconds

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.289
You can see now. It's actually super crispy. Just flake in your hands and turn

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.400
That's cool. What happened if we put the whole thing in there?

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.299
All things getting pretty crispy now and watch this

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.840
Well, that's one way to shred your lettuce

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.789
next up

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:24.549
I think we be fun to try this chicken breast it's really squishy, really flimsy, and it's meat so let's see what liquid nitrogen

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.859
Does to meat start by cutting this thing open.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.140
There's a healthy chicken breast

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.879
You know it's done when the bubbling starts to settle down now that right there is what you call flash-frozen

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.289
There we go. There's our piece of meat. You can see it's completely frozen if we take something like a sledgehammer

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.580
That's impressive

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.350
Figure this out if you move it around

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.280
[know] what sounds like

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.140
pieces of glass

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.470
Dropping down it looks and acts. Just like shards of glass it’s amazing. That's chicken

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.229
Let's try a little baby broccoli next you see this stuff is really limp and flimsy

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.989
Put that in for a few seconds

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.790
Here we go sautéed veggies extra crispy

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.249
You see when that broccoli is done. It is super Super crispy

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.039
That's amazing. What else we want to try tomato?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.669
Look at it. Tomatoes change color as it freezes. It turns more of a whitey pasty color there we go

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
See it's already kind of cracked

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.940
Have pieces everywhere

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.709
Shatters

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.449
That used to be a tomato. You couldn't tell by looking at it. Could [you]?

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.000
Sounds like rocks or broken glass and it is a little bit cold. I think for my last experiment

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.020
I'm going to try ground beef because everybody knows what ground beef is like

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.760
It's not hard and [solid] it's very very squishy. This is kind of stuff you make your hamburger patties out of

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.560
There we go

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.560
Look at that

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.660
Turn it into a nice little hamburger ball

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.040
I think that might [be] a little bit too big let's turn them into smaller meatball [all] right

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
There we go

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.280
So I know this might seem a little bit wasteful

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.950
It was a lot of fun and don't worry every scrap that you see use here is going to be used for some purpose it

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.339
Will be taken care of so there will be no waste well guys that's it [for] this video

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.990
I hope you enjoyed some of these experiments

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.780
I had a lot of fun, and I hope you did as well big. Thanks to hello Fresh

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.549
We are going to eat now in a company like [hello] fresh reaches out to sponsor a video they also send these things called talking

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.120

[I'm] just glad to have you along for the ride today of course

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.890
Liquid Nitrogen is for professionals and experts only this isn't something that I can recommend doing at home

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:56.149
But it is something that I sure enjoy doing with you today. Now. Who's going to clean up this mess, I?

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.790
Can't believe the guy is my wife salvaged all those scraps in the big mess that I made is turned it into this

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:07.719
How awesome is that that is what [we're] having for dinner tonight
