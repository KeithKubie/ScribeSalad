We're actually going to do some programming, and we're going to add a feature to ASCII Chan.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
If you don't remember ASCII Chan is, we started using that in Unit 3, I believe.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It looks something like this.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We just have two inputs on a simple form, and we can insert in some ASCII art into the box here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Then when we submit it, we see our art here on our page,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
if we were to reload this page, we would show the 10 most recent pieces of artwork submitted.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Obviously, this site is going to be a big deal--a big social community.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I'd like to add some features to it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
What I'd like to do is to draw over here a map that shows on the map

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
where the most recent submissions came from,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
so that when you come to ASCHII Chan you can see what a global community it is.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We have to do a couple things. Let's talk about them.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
One thing we're going to need to do is figure out where the user submitting is from.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We're going to need some sort of service to convert the request IP into coordinates.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
For this we'll be using a service I just found called "hostip.info," which is a handy little website.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I'll show you right now. I found this by googling.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Basically, you go to hostip.info and for any IP address, they will tell you where it's located.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They also have an API that has very simple documentation.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Basically, if we go to api.hostip.info and include the IP address in a get parameter,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
they'll give us some XML with location data, and I'll show you what that looks like.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
For IP--their example IP--we get all this information,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
including city, country, country abbreviation, and what we're really after--some coordinates.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Here we've got the longitude and latitude.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This will be a really handle service that we'll be using.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We also want to draw a map, and for this we'll be using Google Maps.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Google Maps has a really handy service called "static maps,"

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
which is where we can basically make a URL that draws a make with markers on it.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I'll show you where the documentation for that lives.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That is here. It's called the Static Maps API version 2.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If we just scroll down here to a quick example, we can see the type of thing we can build.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Given this URL, it would load this image.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If we were to just copy this URL here and load it in a new tab,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
we would get that image with the markers,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and these markers are all defined in the URL itself.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That's going to be a pretty cool, handy service.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
What I want is a map just like this, and I want it to appear right here,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.277
and I want it to have the location of the most recent submissions.
