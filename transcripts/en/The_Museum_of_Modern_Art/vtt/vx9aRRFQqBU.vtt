00:00:00.082 --> 00:00:02.766
(gentle music)

00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.923
- I'm standing in the MoMA stores

00:00:04.923 --> 00:00:08.070
and I want to talk today about a poster

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.450
of 1912 to 13 designed
by the German designer

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.728
Ludwig Hohlwein for Kaffee Hag.

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:19.022
Kaffee Hag was one of
a number of foodstuffs

00:00:19.022 --> 00:00:21.782
that represent German innovation

00:00:21.782 --> 00:00:24.422
in applying scientific principles

00:00:24.422 --> 00:00:26.678
to new foodstuffs.

00:00:26.678 --> 00:00:30.444
It was a decaffeinated kind of coffee,

00:00:30.444 --> 00:00:32.767
which was advertised at this time

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:34.533
as being healthy,

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.069
and hence, Hohlwein's decision

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.305
to link it to this man

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:42.155
clad in his tennis whites.

00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:46.778
By 1913, Kaffee Hag
already had a strong visual

00:00:46.778 --> 00:00:49.519
and brand identity on the market.

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.975
It was just succinctly
referenced in this image.

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:57.214
You can see half of the icon appearing

00:00:57.214 --> 00:00:58.840
on the side of the coffee mug,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.848
but that was enough to trigger

00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:03.374
recognition of a brand.

00:01:03.974 --> 00:01:06.797
The strength of the image really relies

00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:08.989
on this very simple,

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:12.827
incredibly economical visual means

00:01:12.827 --> 00:01:15.510
to communicate the message

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.733
with bold use of forms

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:21.130
and contrasted tonalities,

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.018
a limited color palette

00:01:23.018 --> 00:01:27.449
and a very modern approach
to the typography,

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:30.155
using this Sans Serif type.

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:33.068
And what was unusual
and new and very modern

00:01:33.068 --> 00:01:36.644
for the time was his
use of negative space.

00:01:36.644 --> 00:01:39.004
You really are focused

00:01:39.004 --> 00:01:41.857
on the title Kaffee Hag.

00:01:41.857 --> 00:01:45.805
Another example of this
wonderful economy of means

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:49.031
and giving the image a
slightly humorous touch

00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:53.087
is the way he's accommodated
the printer's name

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.223
in the shape of a tennis ball.

00:01:57.303 --> 00:01:59.948
And it's not only about
branding of the product,

00:01:59.948 --> 00:02:03.248
it's also about the
branding of Ludwig Hohlwein

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.231
as a graphic designer.

00:02:05.231 --> 00:02:08.642
By 1925, he'd designed about 3,000

00:02:08.642 --> 00:02:10.521
of these posters.

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:15.856
His signature is located

00:02:15.856 --> 00:02:17.287
in the bottom

00:02:17.287 --> 00:02:21.965
where he's extended the
umlaut over Munchen, Munich,

00:02:21.965 --> 00:02:25.344
to connect to his name in this compact

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:28.743
and graphic rendering of his identity.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.446
