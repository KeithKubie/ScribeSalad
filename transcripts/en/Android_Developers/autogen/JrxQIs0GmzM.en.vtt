00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 align:start position:0%
sort of being touchy-feely and for me it
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.980 align:start position:0%
sort of being touchy-feely and for me it
was<00:01:44.820><c> always</c><00:01:44.970><c> hard</c><00:01:45.210><c> to</c><00:01:45.360><c> sort</c><00:01:45.570><c> of</c><00:01:45.600><c> wrap</c><00:01:45.659><c> my</c><00:01:45.869><c> head</c>

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
around how that relates to design for
 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.789 align:start position:0%
around how that relates to design for
myself<00:01:48.840><c> because</c><00:01:48.930><c> I'm</c><00:01:49.140><c> more</c><00:01:49.259><c> of</c><00:01:49.320><c> a</c><00:01:49.380><c> developer</c>

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
myself because I'm more of a developer

myself because I'm more of a developer
and<00:01:50.009><c> so</c><00:01:50.549><c> I</c><00:01:50.579><c> really</c><00:01:50.820><c> like</c><00:01:50.939><c> the</c><00:01:51.060><c> examples</c><00:01:51.540><c> that</c>

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 align:start position:0%
and so I really like the examples that
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.719 align:start position:0%
and so I really like the examples that
she<00:01:51.810><c> gave</c><00:01:51.960><c> like</c><00:01:52.259><c> actually</c><00:01:52.649><c> showing</c><00:01:52.920><c> how</c><00:01:53.280><c> like</c>

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 align:start position:0%
she gave like actually showing how like
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.850 align:start position:0%
she gave like actually showing how like
for<00:01:53.939><c> example</c><00:01:54.030><c> when</c><00:01:54.869><c> one</c><00:01:55.290><c> of</c><00:01:55.350><c> the</c><00:01:55.409><c> ones</c><00:01:55.530><c> here</c><00:01:55.740><c> is</c>

own decide for me but let me have the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 align:start position:0%
final say you can see there so for
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.350 align:start position:0%
final say you can see there so for
example<00:02:02.189><c> when</c><00:02:02.490><c> you're</c><00:02:02.610><c> deleting</c><00:02:02.939><c> a</c><00:02:02.969><c> message</c>

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
example when you're deleting a message
 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
example when you're deleting a message
it<00:02:04.140><c> deletes</c><00:02:04.469><c> first</c><00:02:04.829><c> and</c><00:02:05.009><c> then</c><00:02:05.100><c> there's</c><00:02:05.280><c> an</c>

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 align:start position:0%
it deletes first and then there's an
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.900 align:start position:0%
it deletes first and then there's an

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.600 align:start position:0%

yeah<00:02:08.910><c> so</c><00:02:09.119><c> same</c><00:02:09.270><c> thing</c><00:02:09.300><c> is</c><00:02:09.600><c> how</c><00:02:10.050><c> they</c><00:02:10.170><c> actually</c>

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 align:start position:0%
yeah so same thing is how they actually
 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.340 align:start position:0%
yeah so same thing is how they actually

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 align:start position:0%
showed how they actually help them
 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.990 align:start position:0%
showed how they actually help them

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
inform their design decisions so there's
 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.860 align:start position:0%

that i think the major four techniques
they<00:04:55.350><c> talk</c><00:04:55.500><c> about</c><00:04:55.530><c> they</c><00:04:56.040><c> actually</c><00:04:56.280><c> also</c><00:04:56.400><c> spent</c>

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
did a session on cognitive science and
 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.370 align:start position:0%
did a session on cognitive science and
design<00:05:30.390><c> so</c><00:05:30.660><c> he</c><00:05:30.780><c> mentioned</c><00:05:31.050><c> a</c><00:05:31.080><c> couple</c><00:05:31.200><c> of</c>

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
design so he mentioned a couple of
 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.620 align:start position:0%
design so he mentioned a couple of

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
mentioned things like proximity closure
 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.730 align:start position:0%
mentioned things like proximity closure
etc<00:05:35.670><c> we</c><00:05:36.420><c> could</c><00:05:36.570><c> see</c><00:05:36.720><c> here</c><00:05:37.080><c> this</c><00:05:37.500><c> kind</c><00:05:37.710><c> of</c>

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
etc we could see here this kind of
 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.220 align:start position:0%
etc we could see here this kind of
triangle<00:05:38.010><c> and</c><00:05:38.250><c> so</c><00:05:38.370><c> on</c><00:05:38.750><c> this</c><00:05:39.750><c> is</c><00:05:39.900><c> actually</c>

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:45.110 align:start position:0%
thought I was really useful just because
 

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.380 align:start position:0%
thought I was really useful just because
you<00:09:45.920><c> know</c><00:09:46.040><c> it</c><00:09:46.220><c> applies</c><00:09:46.520><c> to</c><00:09:46.760><c> any</c><00:09:46.910><c> app</c><00:09:47.120><c> you</c><00:09:47.150><c> could</c>

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:47.390 align:start position:0%
you know it applies to any app you could

you know it applies to any app you could

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
sort of go through these different
 

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.950 align:start position:0%
sort of go through these different
iterations<00:09:49.070><c> and</c><00:09:49.250><c> see</c><00:09:49.520><c> how</c><00:09:50.420><c> would</c><00:09:50.630><c> work</c><00:09:50.840><c> with</c>

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
iterations and see how would work with
 

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:53.170 align:start position:0%
iterations and see how would work with
these<00:09:51.080><c> different</c><00:09:51.470><c> patterns</c><00:09:51.950><c> and</c><00:09:52.220><c> certainly</c>

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:53.180 align:start position:0%
these different patterns and certainly
 

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:54.580 align:start position:0%
these different patterns and certainly
there's<00:09:53.420><c> pros</c><00:09:53.630><c> and</c><00:09:53.660><c> cons</c><00:09:54.020><c> to</c><00:09:54.110><c> each</c><00:09:54.260><c> of</c><00:09:54.470><c> them</c>

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:54.590 align:start position:0%
there's pros and cons to each of them
 

00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's pros and cons to each of them
which<00:09:54.740><c> I</c><00:09:54.830><c> think</c><00:09:55.010><c> was</c><00:09:55.100><c> the</c><00:09:55.160><c> takeaway</c><00:09:56.260><c> yeah</c><00:09:57.260><c> I</c>

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:57.290 align:start position:0%
which I think was the takeaway yeah I
 

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.660 align:start position:0%
which I think was the takeaway yeah I
really<00:09:57.530><c> like</c><00:09:57.710><c> how</c><00:09:57.830><c> they</c><00:09:57.950><c> kind</c><00:09:58.160><c> of</c><00:09:58.220><c> separate</c>

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:58.670 align:start position:0%
really like how they kind of separate
 

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.730 align:start position:0%
really like how they kind of separate
out<00:09:58.820><c> the</c><00:09:59.120><c> structure</c><00:09:59.450><c> into</c><00:10:00.020><c> or</c><00:10:00.470><c> they</c><00:10:00.590><c> have</c><00:10:00.710><c> a</c>

00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:00.740 align:start position:0%
out the structure into or they have a
 

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.260 align:start position:0%
out the structure into or they have a
couple<00:10:01.130><c> of</c><00:10:01.190><c> common</c><00:10:01.490><c> patterns</c><00:10:01.910><c> for</c>

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:02.270 align:start position:0%
couple of common patterns for
 

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
couple of common patterns for
recognizing<00:10:02.840><c> structure</c><00:10:03.230><c> right</c><00:10:03.410><c> so</c><00:10:03.620><c> they</c><00:10:04.130><c> look</c>

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:04.370 align:start position:0%
recognizing structure right so they look
 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:06.490 align:start position:0%
recognizing structure right so they look
at<00:10:04.490><c> apps</c><00:10:04.700><c> that</c><00:10:05.030><c> may</c><00:10:05.510><c> have</c><00:10:05.690><c> a</c><00:10:05.720><c> specific</c><00:10:06.050><c> focus</c>

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:06.500 align:start position:0%
at apps that may have a specific focus
 

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.580 align:start position:0%
at apps that may have a specific focus
like<00:10:06.980><c> one</c><00:10:07.340><c> of</c><00:10:07.550><c> the</c><00:10:08.330><c> top</c><00:10:08.600><c> level</c><00:10:09.080><c> sections</c><00:10:09.440><c> is</c>

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:09.590 align:start position:0%
like one of the top level sections is
 

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:11.350 align:start position:0%
like one of the top level sections is
the<00:10:09.680><c> most</c><00:10:09.860><c> important</c><00:10:10.310><c> and</c><00:10:10.460><c> then</c><00:10:10.940><c> apps</c><00:10:11.150><c> that</c>

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
the most important and then apps that
 

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.940 align:start position:0%
the most important and then apps that
are<00:10:11.450><c> very</c><00:10:11.570><c> deep</c><00:10:11.930><c> where</c><00:10:12.380><c> they</c><00:10:12.500><c> have</c><00:10:12.650><c> kind</c><00:10:12.830><c> of</c>

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:12.950 align:start position:0%
are very deep where they have kind of
 

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:15.370 align:start position:0%
are very deep where they have kind of
like<00:10:13.100><c> an</c><00:10:13.250><c> equal</c><00:10:13.580><c> weighting</c><00:10:14.120><c> of</c><00:10:14.300><c> sections</c><00:10:14.960><c> but</c>

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:15.380 align:start position:0%
like an equal weighting of sections but
 

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.930 align:start position:0%
like an equal weighting of sections but
each<00:10:15.530><c> section</c><00:10:15.980><c> itself</c><00:10:16.250><c> is</c><00:10:16.430><c> very</c><00:10:16.460><c> deep</c><00:10:16.790><c> and</c>

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:16.940 align:start position:0%
each section itself is very deep and
 

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:20.020 align:start position:0%
each section itself is very deep and
then<00:10:17.360><c> they</c><00:10:17.510><c> look</c><00:10:17.690><c> at</c><00:10:18.250><c> another</c><00:10:19.250><c> kind</c><00:10:19.580><c> of</c><00:10:19.700><c> type</c>

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:20.030 align:start position:0%
then they look at another kind of type
 

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:22.330 align:start position:0%
then they look at another kind of type
of<00:10:20.210><c> pattern</c><00:10:20.480><c> or</c><00:10:20.900><c> structural</c><00:10:21.290><c> pattern</c><00:10:21.740><c> where</c>

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:22.340 align:start position:0%
of pattern or structural pattern where
 

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:25.420 align:start position:0%
of pattern or structural pattern where
an<00:10:22.760><c> app</c><00:10:22.970><c> is</c><00:10:23.270><c> very</c><00:10:23.300><c> very</c><00:10:23.810><c> interconnected</c><00:10:24.430><c> which</c>

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:25.430 align:start position:0%
an app is very very interconnected which
 

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
an app is very very interconnected which
is<00:10:25.580><c> this</c><00:10:25.760><c> case</c><00:10:25.970><c> so</c><00:10:26.480><c> it's</c><00:10:26.690><c> really</c><00:10:26.840><c> kind</c><00:10:27.050><c> of</c><00:10:27.080><c> a</c>

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:27.170 align:start position:0%
is this case so it's really kind of a
 

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
is this case so it's really kind of a

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:29.810 align:start position:0%
good way of structuring or thinking
 

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:36.890 align:start position:0%
you know the individual components think
 

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.110 align:start position:0%
you know the individual components think

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
about it as a whole like what are the

about it as a whole like what are the

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:42.260 align:start position:0%
trying to solve for different users and
 

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:43.449 align:start position:0%
trying to solve for different users and
then<00:10:42.500><c> of</c><00:10:42.620><c> course</c><00:10:42.680><c> they</c><00:10:42.980><c> spent</c><00:10:43.190><c> a</c><00:10:43.250><c> fair</c><00:10:43.399><c> amount</c>

00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:43.459 align:start position:0%
then of course they spent a fair amount
 

00:10:43.459 --> 00:10:45.490 align:start position:0%
then of course they spent a fair amount

yeah<00:11:14.810><c> so</c><00:11:14.990><c> the</c><00:11:15.079><c> navigation</c><00:11:15.589><c> drawer</c><00:11:15.620><c> was</c><00:11:15.890><c> one</c><00:11:16.070><c> of</c>

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so the navigation drawer was one of
 

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so the navigation drawer was one of
those<00:11:16.220><c> patterns</c><00:11:16.490><c> that</c><00:11:16.730><c> was</c><00:11:16.880><c> introduced</c><00:11:17.300><c> in</c>

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:17.570 align:start position:0%
those patterns that was introduced in
 

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:20.290 align:start position:0%
those patterns that was introduced in
agains<00:11:18.110><c> and</c><00:11:18.620><c> richest</c><00:11:19.010><c> talk</c><00:11:19.220><c> and</c><00:11:19.490><c> Nick</c><00:11:20.120><c> and</c><00:11:20.269><c> I</c>

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:20.300 align:start position:0%
agains and richest talk and Nick and I
 

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
agains and richest talk and Nick and I
covered<00:11:20.510><c> it</c><00:11:20.690><c> later</c><00:11:20.930><c> which</c><00:11:21.140><c> we'll</c><00:11:21.320><c> talk</c><00:11:21.350><c> about</c>

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:21.550 align:start position:0%
covered it later which we'll talk about
 

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.650 align:start position:0%
covered it later which we'll talk about
but<00:11:22.550><c> definitely</c><00:11:22.880><c> it</c><00:11:22.970><c> will</c><00:11:23.120><c> probably</c><00:11:23.390><c> do</c>

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:23.660 align:start position:0%
but definitely it will probably do
 

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.310 align:start position:0%
but definitely it will probably do
another<00:11:23.690><c> full</c><00:11:24.500><c> episode</c><00:11:25.220><c> of</c><00:11:25.250><c> a</c><00:11:25.490><c> DA</c><00:11:25.640><c> on</c><00:11:26.230><c> just</c><00:11:27.230><c> the</c>

00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
another full episode of a DA on just the
 

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.870 align:start position:0%
another full episode of a DA on just the
navigation<00:11:27.800><c> drawer</c><00:11:27.829><c> at</c><00:11:28.100><c> some</c><00:11:28.279><c> point</c><00:11:28.519><c> suddenly</c>

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
navigation drawer at some point suddenly
 

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.259 align:start position:0%
navigation drawer at some point suddenly
what<00:11:29.060><c> is</c><00:11:29.240><c> Omega</c><00:11:29.810><c> yeah</c><00:11:30.170><c> yeah</c><00:11:30.589><c> for</c><00:11:31.220><c> sure</c><00:11:31.269><c> alright</c>

00:11:32.259 --> 00:11:32.269 align:start position:0%
what is Omega yeah yeah for sure alright
 

00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:35.290 align:start position:0%
what is Omega yeah yeah for sure alright
so<00:11:32.420><c> moving</c><00:11:32.540><c> on</c><00:11:32.779><c> then</c><00:11:33.680><c> Nick</c><00:11:33.980><c> and</c><00:11:34.190><c> I</c><00:11:34.269><c> did</c><00:11:35.269><c> a</c>

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:35.300 align:start position:0%
so moving on then Nick and I did a
 

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.240 align:start position:0%
so moving on then Nick and I did a
session<00:11:35.600><c> called</c><00:11:35.990><c> Android</c><00:11:36.560><c> design</c><00:11:36.860><c> for</c><00:11:37.130><c> you</c><00:11:37.220><c> I</c>

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:37.250 align:start position:0%
session called Android design for you I
 

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.759 align:start position:0%
session called Android design for you I
developers<00:11:37.940><c> and</c><00:11:38.149><c> this</c><00:11:38.779><c> was</c><00:11:38.990><c> kind</c><00:11:39.380><c> of</c><00:11:39.500><c> more</c>

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:39.769 align:start position:0%
developers and this was kind of more
 

00:11:39.769 --> 00:11:41.769 align:start position:0%
developers and this was kind of more
like<00:11:40.220><c> a</c><00:11:40.370><c> developer</c><00:11:40.970><c> talk</c><00:11:41.180><c> it</c><00:11:41.390><c> wasn't</c><00:11:41.660><c> really</c>

00:11:41.769 --> 00:11:41.779 align:start position:0%
like a developer talk it wasn't really
 

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:44.050 align:start position:0%
like a developer talk it wasn't really
so<00:11:42.140><c> much</c><00:11:42.290><c> for</c><00:11:42.560><c> designers</c><00:11:42.980><c> but</c><00:11:43.130><c> I</c><00:11:43.579><c> think</c>

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:44.060 align:start position:0%
so much for designers but I think
 

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.210 align:start position:0%
so much for designers but I think
especially<00:11:44.149><c> Nick's</c><00:11:44.779><c> part</c><00:11:45.079><c> the</c><00:11:45.680><c> responsive</c>

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:46.220 align:start position:0%
especially Nick's part the responsive
 

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
especially Nick's part the responsive
design<00:11:46.459><c> area</c><00:11:46.820><c> this</c><00:11:47.540><c> is</c><00:11:47.690><c> incredibly</c><00:11:48.410><c> useful</c>

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:48.890 align:start position:0%
design area this is incredibly useful
 

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:52.329 align:start position:0%
design area this is incredibly useful
for<00:11:49.220><c> both</c><00:11:49.370><c> designers</c><00:11:49.730><c> and</c><00:11:50.029><c> developers</c><00:11:50.440><c> so</c><00:11:51.440><c> at</c>

00:11:52.329 --> 00:11:52.339 align:start position:0%
for both designers and developers so at
 

00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:55.210 align:start position:0%
for both designers and developers so at
a<00:11:52.430><c> very</c><00:11:52.459><c> high</c><00:11:52.640><c> level</c><00:11:52.760><c> we</c><00:11:53.149><c> covered</c><00:11:54.220><c> navigation</c>

00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:55.220 align:start position:0%
a very high level we covered navigation
 

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.590 align:start position:0%
a very high level we covered navigation
we<00:11:55.310><c> so</c><00:11:55.519><c> we've</c><00:11:55.670><c> covered</c><00:11:55.850><c> how</c><00:11:56.060><c> to</c><00:11:56.089><c> implement</c><00:11:56.420><c> the</c>

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
we so we've covered how to implement the
 

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.810 align:start position:0%
we so we've covered how to implement the
navigation<00:11:57.110><c> drawer</c><00:11:57.140><c> for</c><00:11:57.470><c> example</c><00:11:57.890><c> the</c><00:11:58.579><c> Nick</c>

00:11:58.810 --> 00:11:58.820 align:start position:0%
navigation drawer for example the Nick
 

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:00.970 align:start position:0%
navigation drawer for example the Nick
did<00:11:59.060><c> a</c><00:11:59.089><c> whole</c><00:11:59.300><c> big</c><00:11:59.360><c> bid</c><00:11:59.990><c> on</c><00:12:00.170><c> responsive</c><00:12:00.680><c> design</c>

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:00.980 align:start position:0%
did a whole big bid on responsive design
 

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
did a whole big bid on responsive design
techniques<00:12:01.490><c> and</c><00:12:01.670><c> they</c><00:12:01.760><c> compared</c><00:12:02.029><c> you</c><00:12:02.120><c> want</c><00:12:02.240><c> to</c>

00:12:02.319 --> 00:12:02.329 align:start position:0%
techniques and they compared you want to
 

00:12:02.329 --> 00:12:04.090 align:start position:0%
techniques and they compared you want to
talk<00:12:02.449><c> about</c><00:12:02.570><c> their</c><00:12:02.779><c> here</c><00:12:02.930><c> and</c><00:12:03.769><c> then</c><00:12:03.890><c> I</c><00:12:04.070><c> I</c>

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:04.100 align:start position:0%
talk about their here and then I I
 

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.949 align:start position:0%
talk about their here and then I I
finished<00:12:04.699><c> off</c><00:12:04.880><c> with</c><00:12:04.910><c> implementing</c><00:12:05.540><c> the</c><00:12:05.750><c> holo</c>

00:12:05.949 --> 00:12:05.959 align:start position:0%
finished off with implementing the holo
 

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:07.300 align:start position:0%
finished off with implementing the holo
visual<00:12:06.050><c> language</c><00:12:06.500><c> like</c><00:12:06.890><c> how</c><00:12:07.010><c> to</c><00:12:07.070><c> implement</c>

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:07.310 align:start position:0%
visual language like how to implement
 

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
visual language like how to implement

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:09.529 align:start position:0%
dividers and and touch feedback and
 

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:11.380 align:start position:0%

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:13.070 align:start position:0%
you go day yeah and so they created
 

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.310 align:start position:0%
you go day yeah and so they created
these<00:15:13.250><c> kind</c><00:15:13.490><c> of</c><00:15:13.550><c> like</c><00:15:13.730><c> little</c><00:15:14.320><c> diagram</c>

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
these kind of like little diagram
 

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.860 align:start position:0%
these kind of like little diagram
journals<00:15:15.890><c> of</c><00:15:16.070><c> how</c><00:15:16.250><c> people</c><00:15:16.310><c> use</c><00:15:17.210><c> their</c><00:15:17.690><c> devices</c>

00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:17.870 align:start position:0%
journals of how people use their devices
 

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.140 align:start position:0%
journals of how people use their devices
so<00:15:18.770><c> this</c><00:15:18.950><c> is</c><00:15:19.070><c> basically</c><00:15:19.190><c> like</c><00:15:19.490><c> a</c><00:15:19.550><c> time</c><00:15:19.820><c> graph</c>

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:20.150 align:start position:0%
so this is basically like a time graph
 

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
so this is basically like a time graph
where<00:15:20.480><c> I</c><00:15:20.840><c> think</c><00:15:21.230><c> it's</c><00:15:21.380><c> just</c><00:15:21.440><c> kind</c><00:15:21.770><c> of</c><00:15:21.800><c> a</c><00:15:21.890><c> full</c>

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:22.130 align:start position:0%
where I think it's just kind of a full
 

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
where I think it's just kind of a full
day<00:15:22.370><c> and</c><00:15:23.210><c> they</c><00:15:23.300><c> just</c><00:15:23.450><c> highlighted</c><00:15:23.900><c> the</c>

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.050 align:start position:0%
day and they just highlighted the
 

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.810 align:start position:0%
day and they just highlighted the
portions<00:15:24.530><c> where</c><00:15:24.800><c> people</c><00:15:25.190><c> were</c><00:15:25.370><c> using</c><00:15:25.580><c> their</c>

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
portions where people were using their

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:28.570 align:start position:0%
devices and so they made kind of little
 

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:30.700 align:start position:0%
devices and so they made kind of little
observations<00:15:29.570><c> around</c><00:15:29.750><c> like</c><00:15:30.080><c> people</c><00:15:30.380><c> mostly</c>

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:30.710 align:start position:0%

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:47.270 align:start position:0%
guess continuous portions so kind of
 

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:49.090 align:start position:0%
guess continuous portions so kind of
some<00:15:47.480><c> of</c><00:15:47.570><c> these</c><00:15:47.660><c> some</c><00:15:48.140><c> of</c><00:15:48.170><c> these</c><00:15:48.260><c> charts</c><00:15:48.950><c> were</c>

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.500 align:start position:0%
especially a part at the end where they

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.930 align:start position:0%
reconcile their brand with the platform
and<00:16:20.960><c> then</c><00:16:21.110><c> I</c><00:16:21.590><c> guess</c><00:16:21.770><c> I</c><00:16:21.980><c> think</c><00:16:22.190><c> it</c><00:16:22.280><c> was</c><00:16:22.400><c> Tom</c><00:16:22.670><c> that</c>

and sketch it all out rather than just
 

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:35.909 align:start position:0%
and sketch it all out rather than just
you<00:21:34.720><c> know</c><00:21:34.870><c> which</c><00:21:35.110><c> I</c><00:21:35.230><c> think</c><00:21:35.620><c> a</c><00:21:35.679><c> lot</c><00:21:35.710><c> of</c><00:21:35.860><c> people</c>

you know which I think a lot of people
 

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
you know which I think a lot of people
do<00:21:36.220><c> is</c><00:21:36.429><c> dive</c><00:21:36.940><c> into</c><00:21:37.120><c> the</c><00:21:37.330><c> code</c><00:21:37.510><c> too</c><00:21:37.750><c> quickly</c><00:21:37.990><c> and</c>

00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:38.230 align:start position:0%
do is dive into the code too quickly and
 

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
do is dive into the code too quickly and
you<00:21:38.830><c> know</c><00:21:38.980><c> build</c><00:21:39.520><c> and</c><00:21:39.820><c> invest</c><00:21:40.179><c> a</c><00:21:40.210><c> lot</c><00:21:40.299><c> of</c><00:21:40.390><c> time</c>

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:40.510 align:start position:0%
you know build and invest a lot of time
 

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:42.090 align:start position:0%
you know build and invest a lot of time
is<00:21:40.630><c> something</c><00:21:40.809><c> which</c><00:21:41.049><c> then</c><00:21:41.440><c> won't</c><00:21:41.650><c> throw</c><00:21:41.890><c> away</c>

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:42.100 align:start position:0%
is something which then won't throw away
 

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
is something which then won't throw away

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:07.090 align:start position:0%
actually one of the things that we
 

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:09.990 align:start position:0%
actually one of the things that we
should<00:27:07.660><c> jump</c><00:27:07.840><c> to</c><00:27:07.990><c> the</c><00:27:08.110><c> yes</c><00:27:08.770><c> first</c><00:27:09.220><c> yeah</c><00:27:09.760><c> yeah</c>

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
should jump to the yes first yeah yeah
 

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.730 align:start position:0%
should jump to the yes first yeah yeah
let's<00:27:10.180><c> do</c><00:27:10.330><c> this</c><00:27:10.420><c> one</c><00:27:10.600><c> first</c><00:27:10.780><c> so</c><00:27:11.380><c> there</c><00:27:11.650><c> are</c><00:27:11.680><c> a</c>

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:11.740 align:start position:0%
let's do this one first so there are a
 

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
let's do this one first so there are a

came around the time of google i/o the
 

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:19.470 align:start position:0%
came around the time of google i/o the
first<00:27:17.890><c> and</c><00:27:18.100><c> i</c><00:27:18.130><c> guess</c><00:27:18.280><c> the</c><00:27:18.310><c> biggest</c><00:27:18.670><c> to</c><00:27:19.120><c> me</c><00:27:19.240><c> is</c>

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
first and i guess the biggest to me is
 

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
first and i guess the biggest to me is
is<00:27:19.690><c> the</c><00:27:20.260><c> google</c><00:27:20.740><c> play</c><00:27:20.770><c> music</c><00:27:21.130><c> redesign</c><00:27:21.850><c> so</c>
