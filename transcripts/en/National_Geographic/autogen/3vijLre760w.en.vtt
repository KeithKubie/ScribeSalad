00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:03.480
(birds chirping)

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.341
- [Narrator] Shrouded in a
blanket of clouds they awaken.

00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:10.540
Their canopies of green
glitter in the sun.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.285
Their wildlife start to slither.

00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:13.690
(snake hissing)

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.410
- Chirp.
(birds chirping)

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.000
- And growl.
(growling)

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.800
- And one of the planets
richest ecosystems

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.287
comes to life.

00:00:23.287 --> 00:00:26.380
(crickets chirping)

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.310
Rainforests are the oldest
living ecosystems on the planet.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.410
Some can trace their origins
to over 70 million years ago.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.913
Back to a time when dinosaurs
still roamed the Earth.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.320
While the giant reptiles have disappeared

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.410
rainforests continue to thrive

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.430
growing on every continent
except Antarctica.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.220
Two types of rainforests are
scattered across the globe.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.352
Temperate and tropical.

00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:59.080
Temperate rainforests are mainly
found in the mid-latitudes.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.200
Often near cooler, coastal,
mountainous regions.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.020
Tropical rainforests are primarily located

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.130
in warmer climates between
the Tropic of Cancer

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.873
and the Tropic of Capricorn.

00:01:11.922 --> 00:01:13.040
(thundering)

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.780
As their names imply, temperate
and tropical rainforests

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.030
are the wettest forests on earth

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.173
receiving up to about 33
feet of rain per year.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.840
This precipitation plays a
critical roll in creating

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.370
an exceptionally lush and
biologically diverse habitat.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.770
While rainforests only make up about 6%

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.300
of the Earth's surface area, they are home

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.913
to over half of the World's
plant and animal species.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.500
This biodiversity creates benefits

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.011
that extend far beyond
the rainforest boundaries.

00:01:49.011 --> 00:01:53.150
Rainforest plants produce
an assortment of food items.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.190
In addition to ingredients useful

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.470
in everyday products and medicines.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.380
In fact, an estimated
70% of the plants used

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.173
in cancer treatments are
only found in rainforests.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.310
On an even larger scale, rainforests help

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.918
to stabilize the planet's climate.

00:02:12.918 --> 00:02:17.309
It's lush, green vegetation
regulate global temperatures

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:21.490
by absorbing massive amounts
of radiation from the Sun.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.700
They also absorb vast
amounts of carbon dioxide

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.950
and convert them into oxygen,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.293
about 40% of the planet's breathable air.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.680
Over the past few centuries,
rainforests have disappeared

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.570
at an alarming rate.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.420
Factors such as economic
inequalities, human development,

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.460
and demand for natural
resources have fueled

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.859
the deforestation of
these rich ecosystems.

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.690
At the current rate,
rainforests, which have survived

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.090
for over 70 million years

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.423
may completely disappear
within the next century.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.398
But through educational campaigns,

00:03:03.398 --> 00:03:05.819
sustainable logging practices,

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.910
and cooperation with local communities,

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.850
deforestation may begin to slow down

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.450
helping to preserve rainforests

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.589
for many generations to come.

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:18.339
