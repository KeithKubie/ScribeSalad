00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.510
I can smell the vinegar. Ooh, cool!

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.529
Color changes like this always amaze,
and this activity

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.590
lets children begin to see why they
are important and useful in science.

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.640
Today we're going to be doing a bit of
an experiment with this.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.660
Do you know what this is? Brain!
Could be a brain, what do you think?

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.480
Cabbage? It's a red cabbage (even though it's not really red).

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.160
So, what we're going to do:

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.469
I'm going to chop a bit off.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.010
It's getting blue. Why is it going blue?

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.970
Because the cabbage colour...

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:12.180
So you think the cabbage colour is coming out of the cabbage and going into the water?

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.740
Yeah! You can do some really fun things with this coloured water,

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.080
but we need to make loads more.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.500
This kind of cabbage is red because it contains chemicals called
anthocyanins. 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.160
Blitzing the cabbage in water

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.230
lets us extract those chemicals and use
them for our experiments.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.920
Right, we're going to do some science now with this. I'm gonna get some vinegar,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.420
and pour it in there. What do you think might happen?

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.720
Change a little bit of colour?

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.810
Explode? Maybe it will explode...

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.820
Look carefully while I pour this. Look what happens.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.520
I think it is going to change colour.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.640
Cool! So this cabbage water changes colour

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.060
in a slightly strange way, so shall we see if it changes colour with other things?

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.420
Yeah! This is actually bicarbonate of soda.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.700
What do you think might happen this time?

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.180
Hmm... it's going to go all fizzy?

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.580
Me too, I think it's going to go fizzy.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.880
Watch carefully what happens again.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.730
I knew it was gonna turn blue! No you didn't.

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.670
Let's try some fizzy water, yeah?

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.210
What colour, guys, do you think this is
going to be go this time?

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.400
A different colour completely?

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.500
Yes, because it's a different thing.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.280
What's going on? It's going pink!

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.560
Is the water more like vinegar or bicarbonate of soda?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.700
More like the vinegar.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.080
Yeah so there's something in common in the fizzy water and the vinegar.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.480
It's fun to just look at all the
color changes you can get with this

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.460
cabbage juice, but this activity is a great
way to introduce children to the idea

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.460
we can learn about the properties of
substances using these chemical reactions.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.360
We call liquids like this cabbage juice

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.570
indicator solutions because they tell us
something about the chemical composition

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:21.670
of other substances.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.100
In this case liquids which turn the juice red
have properties that scientists categorise

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.010
as acidic.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.630
Liquids that make it go blue or green are know as alkaline. 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.590
Download the info sheet to find
out more about this experiment.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.820
We'd love to see photos of whatever you get up to

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.220
and subscribe to see lots of other great experiments.
