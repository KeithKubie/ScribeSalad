00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:08.660
GERARDO CAPIEL:
I'm Gerardo Capiel,

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:11.085
and I lead product management
for Consumer Payments

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:12.530
here at Google.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.104
And with me is my partner
in crime, Varouj Chitilian.

00:00:15.104 --> 00:00:16.520
VAROUJ CHITILIAN:
All right, who's

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.005
excited to hear about
Google Pay today?

00:00:18.005 --> 00:00:18.838
GERARDO CAPIEL: Woo.

00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:20.192
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: All right.

00:00:20.192 --> 00:00:25.505
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:29.660
GERARDO CAPIEL: Great,
so earlier this year we

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.210
unified all the
ways that you can

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.530
pay with Google into a single
brand called Google Pay.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.560
With Google Pay,
you can play online

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.540
and at millions of places
all around the world

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.160
with the payment
information that you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.040
saved in your Google account.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.220
Today, we're going to be talking
about the great ways in which

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.520
we're making it easier,
faster, and more

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.035
rewarding for your customers to
check out online and in stores.

00:01:05.655 --> 00:01:09.120
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: We want to
make payments easy for everyone

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.100
everywhere.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.250
See, Google Pay is
not just an app.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.900
Google Pay makes payments a
foundational and integral part

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.810
of a Google user's account.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.740
So for Google users logged
into any Google service,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.890
they can experience
amazing payment experiences

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.940
that Google Pay provides.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.470
The other advantage to tying
everything to one account

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.800
is that payment methods
and transactions can all be

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.630
managed in a central location.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.530
Now we all know that mobile
is the fastest growing

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.590
e-commerce surface,
but your customers

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.380
are transacting on all surfaces.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.630
So we want to make
sure with Google Pay

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.720
that Google users can pay as
easily in stores with a tap

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.850
as they can online at
your sites and apps,

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:12.090
as well as on Google, on
Chrome, on YouTube, Google Play,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.708
and even Google Assistant.

00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:17.340
GERARDO CAPIEL: Thanks, Varouj.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.130
So what's in it for
all you developers

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.870
out here in the crowd?

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.500
Well, currently
there are hundreds

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.810
of millions of payment methods
saved to Google accounts

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.800
when users transact
on Play or when they

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.860
save their cards in Chrome.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.930
We know from operating Google
Play, one of the world's

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.970
largest e-commerce marketplaces,
that these users that

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.680
have saved payment
methods to their account

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.700
are much more likely to
complete a transaction than when

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.490
they have it.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.830
And we call these users
ready-to-pay users.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.140
Via our APIs, we're going to
enable these ready-to-pay users

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.280
to also check out quickly
and easily in your own apps

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.150
and websites, which
means that you're

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.930
going to see increased
conversion rates, faster

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.190
monetization.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.530
And you'll be able to
provide your customers

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.800
with the same easy quick
checkout experience

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.250
that we provide on Play.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.120
Now speaking of
payment methods, let

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.960
me turn to the Google Pay app.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.400
So in an upcoming update
of the Google Pay app,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.970
we're going to allow you
to manage all the payment

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.960
methods in your Google account,
not just the payment methods

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.750
that you use to pay in-store.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.570
And even better, we're
going to provide you

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.310
with a holistic view of
all your transactions,

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.160
whether they be on
Google Apps and services,

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.070
such as Play and
YouTube, whether they

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:08.390
be with third-party merchants,
such as Walgreens and Uber,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.520
or whether they're
transactions you've

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:16.170
made to friends and families
via our peer-to-peer service.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.380
And of course, the app
is available on Android.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.779
But I'm really excited
to tell you all

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:26.410
that we're bringing this
capability to iOS and the web.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.880
Woo!

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:35.820
So let's dig a little deeper
into the Google Pay app.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.140
So if you've opened the
app, you come to a Home tab.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.630
Hopefully many of
you have seen this.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.450
And this tab is
personalized for you

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.350
based on the credit and debit
cards in your Google account,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.380
based on the loyalty
programs that you

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.610
have saved to Google
Pay, based on the offers

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.250
that you have saved
to Google Pay,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.540
and even based on the
stores that are nearby you.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.510
You can see examples of
the many types of cards

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.830
that you might find in the home
feed of the Google Pay app.

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.800
Now what's really exciting is
that some of these feed cards

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.360
are actionable.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.270
So for example, this
card that you see here

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.360
allows you to sign up
for Balance Rewards.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.880
Or, if you already
belong, it allows

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.020
you to link your Balance Rewards
account to your Google account.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.600
And this card is geo-aware.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.750
And so what that means
is it only shows up

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.430
when you're at Walgreens.

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:37.380
So that's what makes the Home
tab so personalized and great.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.990
So merchants out there and
providers of loyalty programs

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.530
and offers programs that
wish to take advantage

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.760
of these features
should join the ranks

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.600
of the hundreds of partners that
have implemented the Google Pay

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.450
APIs for loyalty.

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:04.890
And to learn more, I encourage
you to go to g.co/pay/business.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.680
Now we're also working
with ticketing providers

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:17.190
so that our users can easily
and quickly save event tickets

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.460
and boarding passes to
their Google account,

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.870
and then be able to access them
right in the Google Pay app.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.140
I'm excited to announce
some of our early access

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.960
partners, some of which I
see out here in the crowd,

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.970
such as Singapore Airlines,
Southwest, Eventbrite,

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.550
and Fortress GB, who
provides ticketing

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:44.230
infrastructure to major soccer
leagues in the UK and beyond.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.840
So to talk more about transit,
I'm going to turn it to Varouj.

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:52.180
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Yeah,
so loyalty and payments

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.120
covers most of what's
in your wallet.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:07:00.370
But transit is a massive use
case for our Google users.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.300
Now Google Pay already
supports transit, and has

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:08.140
for a while at transit agencies
that accept contactless debit

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.920
or credit cards.

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.540
So we see transactions in
London, Chicago, Kiev, Sydney,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.680
Portland, and coming
soon in Vancouver.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.710
But if we only support
contactless debit or credit

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:29.090
cards for transit, we'll
be leaving a large portion

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.590
of our Google users that use
traditional transit tickets

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.380
and passes under-served.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.410
And so we've been partnering
with transit technology

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:45.770
providers, like NXP and
ITSO, to natively support

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.910
these traditional tickets and
passes within the Google Pay

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:51.170
app.

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:56.320
So you may have heard recently
that we launched in Las Vegas

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.580
as well as in Portland.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.300
And today we'd like to
announce that coming soon we'll

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.660
have support in West
Midlands in the UK.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.740
So very, very exciting.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.220
Now we're working really
hard on Google Pay,

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:18.040
and Google Pay is already
available to hundreds

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:22.510
of millions of
users in 18 markets.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:28.500
And I'm really proud to say that
just recently Google Pay passed

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.043
100 million downloads in the
Google Play Store-- very--

00:08:32.043 --> 00:08:32.876
GERARDO CAPIEL: Woo!

00:08:32.876 --> 00:08:37.178
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:37.178 --> 00:08:40.110
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: But
we're not stopping there.

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.440
Very soon, we will
be launching many

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.480
of the core features and the
Google Play app globally.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.910
That means that
billions of Google users

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:54.210
worldwide will be
able to leverage

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:57.780
the amazing payment experiences
that Google Pay provides,

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.168
so we're very, very
excited about this.

00:09:01.168 --> 00:09:02.160
GERARDO CAPIEL: Great.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.390
It is super exciting.

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:08.910
And users in the UK and
the US have one more thing

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.860
to be excited about--

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.860
we are bringing
peer-to-peer payment right

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.840
into the Google Pay app.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.470
That means that you'll be
able to send and request money

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:22.920
directly from the
app in the Send tab.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.350
But even more
exciting than that is

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:31.160
that you're going to
be able to easily split

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:35.200
that purchase for tickets to
the soccer game or the drinks

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.380
at the pub easily right
from the Google Pay app.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:41.350
So if you pull up the
transaction details

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:44.830
after paying for drinks at
the pub, right from there

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.760
you'll be able to split the
expense with your friends.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.436
Super exciting.

00:09:50.436 --> 00:09:52.450
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Awesome.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:53.890
And guess what?

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.630
For many of these
payment experiences,

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:59.600
you don't even need to have
the Google Pay app installed.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.650
For example, our P2P
experience is already

00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:06.830
embedded in Gmail, Android
Contacts, Google Assistant,

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:11.340
Apple iMessage, and
Android Messages.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.290
Last year, we announced
the ability for you,

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:17.910
through your mobile banking,
to provision a debit or credit

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:23.010
card into Google Pay to be able
to use it in stores and online.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:26.100
This year, we take it a step
further with our banking

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.510
partners.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.900
You can now sign up for
a new credit or debit

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.220
card in the mobile banking app,
have that provision to Google

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:40.380
Pay, and start using it even
before the credit or debit

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.629
card arrives in the mail.

00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:43.170
That awesome?

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:46.730
GERARDO CAPIEL:
That's pretty cool.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.720
That is pretty cool.

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:51.830
And so now that we've taken
you through this whirlwind tour

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.280
of everything that's been
happening since we were last

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.290
up here, which
has been dizzying,

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:01.220
and the things that are making
it easier, simpler, and more

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.960
rewarding for our users to
pay online and in stores,

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.830
let's talk about the specific
ways in which you all here can

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.910
create great experiences
for your customers online

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:14.540
and in stores.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:19.690
So let's start with online.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.890
What I really like about
online is its scale.

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:28.180
There are millions and millions
of merchants all around

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:32.460
the world where you
can buy things online.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.160
And we want to make every
single one of those checkout

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.930
experiences great.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.890
So that means that we
need solutions that scale.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:44.080
And ideally they're
solutions where

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:49.210
you don't have to do anything,
or just do very little.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:53.590
Chrome AutoFill is one
of those experiences.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:55.720
Chrome AutoFill
removes the hassle

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.800
from users of having to type
in credit card numbers, type

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.470
in shipping addresses
and billing address.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.690
It makes it super simple.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.910
So hopefully your site
already works perfectly

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.350
with Chrome AutoFill.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.390
But we know that there's a
number out there that don't.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:17.680
So we want to make sure
that your users are

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.530
able to take advantage of
AutoFill as best as possible.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:26.170
And we've published a set of
guidelines and best practices

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:31.150
that will enable you to test
and optimize your checkout

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.750
forms for Chrome AutoFill.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:40.960
To learn more, go to
g.co/pay/autofill.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.070
Or, when you exit out o
here, visit our sandbox right

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:48.580
across the way and
speak with our engineers

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.260
about how you can optimize
your checkout flow.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.510
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: So if
we focused exclusively

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:00.710
on AutoFill, we'd be doing
Google users a disservice.

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:04.560
The North Star here is really
to skip the checkout form

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.080
altogether.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.740
And that's where the Google
Pay APIs for checkout come in.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:16.970
Now we announced the online
payment APIs last year.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.470
But since then, we've made
three major enhancements

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:24.220
that I'd like to
talk to you about.

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:28.030
Number 1, we're announcing
JavaScript bindings

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:30.490
for the Google Pay
API for checkout.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:34.840
That means you can provide your
customers with great payment

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:40.390
experiences that Google Pay
provides across all browsers.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:44.980
Number 2, in our APIs we
use a very consistent JSON

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:48.400
representation of the
request and response object.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.820
What this means is that if
you implement the Google Pay

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:56.260
APIs for checkout, for example,
for web, for JavaScript,

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.570
you can easily port
that, including

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:02.080
the payment
processing to your app

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:05.040
and also to Google Assistant.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.410
I actually want to show you a
quick demo here-- not a demo

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:14.140
but screens here of what we've
done with Fandango that's

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:16.570
coming soon where
you can actually

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:21.280
get a very easy checkout
experience from Google

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:28.780
Search when you use Google
Pay APIs for checkout.

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:32.800
So a user searches for
tickets on Google.com,

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.050
then they go to
that Fandango site

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:38.410
where they can easily
select and purchase tickets

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.760
using Google Pay.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.580
So very exciting.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.850
And the last thing,
that last enhancement

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:50.240
that I'd like to talk
about, is that we've

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:53.390
enhanced our ready-to-pay API.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.680
With this API, you can tell
whether a user on your site,

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.210
a customer on your site,
has payment method that you

00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:03.790
can actually accept.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:05.870
And what this allows
you to do is now

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.420
that I know that this
is a ready-to-pay user,

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:11.750
you can really streamline
the checkout experience

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:17.734
and really drive
increased conversions.

00:15:17.734 --> 00:15:19.960
GERARDO CAPIEL: Right,
that's pretty cool.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.890
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Let's
see this stuff in action.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.060
GERARDO CAPIEL: But
it's even cooler

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.143
when you see it in action.

00:15:23.143 --> 00:15:25.160
Let's turn to the
computer, please.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:25.660
Great.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.030
So last year when
we were up here,

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.130
we showed you the great
checkout experience

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.920
that we created on
the web, but it was

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.530
limited to Chrome on Android.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.020
I'm really excited that
we've now extended this

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.180
to many other browsers,
such as Safari,

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.450
both on desktop
and iOS, Firefox,

00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:46.540
and a number of browsers, and
Edge and Internet Explorer

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.370
are coming soon.

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:50.710
And you'll be able to play
with this yourselves right

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.850
after this slide.

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:58.120
So I'm on our demo site, time
to get some new Google gear.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.740
So I like this shell right here.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:02.380
So I go to the
Product Details page

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.560
and I see that there is a
Buy with Google Pay button.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:11.860
And this is good because, you
may not know this, but over 60%

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:16.280
of online purchases are
really just for one item.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:21.580
So why put users through
a multi-step checkout flow

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.890
where they have to add to a
card and all these other steps.

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.880
Let's just let them buy what
they want right directly

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.360
from Product Details.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.570
So when I click there,
because I was already

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.700
logged into my Google
account since I was maybe

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.640
checking my Gmail
or using YouTube,

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.040
whatever other Google service,
I'm automatically logged in.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.570
I see the payment
methods that I've

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.570
saved to my Google account
and other information that's

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.540
in my Google account, such
as my shipping address.

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.830
And then I just hit
Continue, and voila--

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:51.850
I am done.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.080
It's that simple.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.610
OK, so that's cool.

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.310
But on Chrome, we're doing
something even more cool

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.450
in the near future.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:09.099
So on Chrome, we are creating
a near native experience

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:16.240
that is fast and seamless and
tightly integrated into Chrome,

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.859
as you can see right here.

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:21.670
When I move my window
around, things stay in place.

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:22.930
And this is really great.

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:26.270
Let's turn it back to
the slides, please.

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.400
So if you want to check this
out yourselves on your iPhone

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:39.380
or on your desktop, go
to g.co/pay/webdemo.

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:48.620
So fewer distractions, faster
checkout, simpler checkout

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.320
means greater conversion.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.210
And we're pretty
confident that you're

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.700
going to see these
types of results

00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:59.540
when you implement
the Google Pay API.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:03.380
Since we announced Google Pay,
the response from merchants

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.810
has been overwhelming
all around the world.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:12.290
We've added merchants such
as Uber and DoorDash, ASOS,

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.260
Deliveroo, and-- soon coming--

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:18.490
Starbucks.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:22.030
And our partners are
seeing great results.

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:25.960
StubHub, for example, since
they've implemented the newest

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:31.210
version of our API, has seen
a 7x increase in transactions

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:32.710
through Google Pay.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.490
And Airbnb saw an 11x
increase in transactions

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.530
through Google Pay.

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:41.140
And it's also interesting
that Hotel Tonight--

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:46.750
interesting and great-- has
found that users that use

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:53.260
Google Pay to complete a booking
are 65% more likely to complete

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:55.790
the transaction than
those who don't.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.150
So really, really great results.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:59.005
Super exciting.

00:18:59.005 --> 00:19:00.920
VAROUJ CHITILIAN:
Varouj, tell us more.

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.170
Yeah, so if you guys take
one thing away from I/O

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:10.510
on the payment side,
you should definitely

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:13.570
figure out how you're going
to implement these Google Pay

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.570
APIs for a checkout
on your surfaces

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:19.690
to give your customers
incredible payment experiences.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.170
And we have two additional
sessions that you can go to.

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.580
The first is tomorrow-- what's
new for online checkout.

00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:28.660
And that's on stage 6.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.210
And the second is
by our UX team,

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:34.180
it's called Google Pay best
practices for great payment

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.290
experiences.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.620
And that's on stage
7 on Thursday.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:40.610
So please go and
check those out.

00:19:46.941 --> 00:19:48.890
GERARDO CAPIEL: Great.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:52.340
So let's talk next
about something

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.970
that users love more
than saving time--

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:56.930
saving money.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:58.520
Who doesn't love to save money?

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:06.020
So Google Pay is more
than just a way to pay.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.940
We've invested heavily
in making Google

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:13.130
Pay a platform by which
you can engage your users

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.240
through loyalty and offers.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.300
In previous years,
we've been up here

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:25.040
and we've talked about our
Smart Tap protocol, which

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.520
is based on NFC and
allows users when they're

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:33.290
in store to just tap once
and convey their loyalty

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:37.700
credentials and offers along
with payment information.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:38.900
It's a great experience.

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.330
And merchants all
around the world

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:44.270
have been implementing
Smart Tap in creating

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:50.610
great value-added check out
experiences for their users.

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:55.520
So I'm excited to announce
today that Russia's Verbank is

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.880
the latest partner that
is going to be rolling out

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.820
Smart Tap across thousands
of merchants in Russia.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.420
And this is super exciting.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.557
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Varouj?

00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:07.390
Yeah, but we're not
just stopping at loyalty

00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:10.040
and offers when it
comes to Smart Tap.

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.570
We're working with
tickets as well.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.416
And in fact, we have an
incredible demo today

00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:16.790
that we've done
with our partners

00:21:16.790 --> 00:21:21.320
at Ticketmaster that brings
together all the APIs and Smart

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:24.300
Tap into one demo.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:26.940
So let's go to the phone.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.160
So you'll have to use
your imagination here.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.650
Let's all pretend
we're in Orlando, so

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.720
excuse the humidity.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.230
And I'm a massive soccer
fan, and my favorite team

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.820
is the Chicago Fire of the MLS.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:48.510
So Chicago Fire is
visiting Orlando City SC.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:52.110
And I really want to check
out this game with Gerardo.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:55.740
So I'm going to open
the Ticketmaster app.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.820
Now since they're my favorite
team, it'll be in Favorites.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:14.320
So now I select the game, I
select the ticket, do Buy Now.

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:25.790
And here we see the Buy
with Google Pay button.

00:22:25.790 --> 00:22:35.950
So I'll give that a click,
and I'll complete checkout.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:37.820
Boom-- I've purchased tickets.

00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:40.075
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:40.075 --> 00:22:42.310
GERARDO CAPIEL: Gets
better, though, gets better.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:43.560
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: What's that?

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.400
GERARDO CAPIEL: I
said it gets better.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.180
VAROUJ CHITILIAN:
Oh, it gets better.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:46.137
Yeah.

00:22:46.137 --> 00:22:47.470
So now I can view these tickets.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.430
And here we see the
Save to Phone buttons

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.350
that Gerardo mentioned.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:06.770
So I can save this
ticket to Google Pay.

00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:11.125
So now let's open
the Google Pay app.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.650
When I go to the
cards, I now notice

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:24.450
that I have my tickets here for
Orlando SC versus Chicago Fire.

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:27.060
And I'm all ready
to go to this game.

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:28.260
So I'm super excited.

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:29.690
GERARDO CAPIEL:
Get your gear on.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:31.710
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: But
here's the kicker--

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.050
no pun intended--

00:23:34.050 --> 00:23:38.940
I can actually go to the
gate to get into the game.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:42.570
And I don't need to fiddle
around with paper tickets

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.120
and I don't need
to scan QR codes.

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.055
All I need to do--

00:23:46.055 --> 00:23:47.940
GERARDO CAPIEL: Let's turn
it to the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:48.440
Thank you.

00:23:56.281 --> 00:23:58.995
VAROUJ CHITILIAN:
Is tap, and I've

00:23:58.995 --> 00:24:00.245
gained entry into the stadium.

00:24:00.245 --> 00:24:02.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:04.680
And I go along the way.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:09.020
So these are the incredible
user journeys that we can create

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.544
together with these APIs.

00:24:12.544 --> 00:24:13.335
Back to the slides?

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:24.230
GERARDO CAPIEL:
OK, that was great.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.900
Now that we've overloaded
you with information

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.830
about all the great things that
you can do with Google Pay,

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.200
what are next steps?

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.860
So the first one is super
easy because it just

00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:36.940
takes a few steps.

00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:40.900
You exit out this door and
you head over to our sandbox.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.120
And there you can meet with
the engineers that have

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.250
built all these amazing things.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:49.810
And you can get your questions
answered, you can get demos.

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:52.210
And some of the demos even
get you cookies-- and I'm not

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:55.330
talking about browser cookies,
like real tasty good cookies.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.580
VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Oh, man,
I'm getting hungry up here.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.920
GERARDO CAPIEL: Yeah.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.280
And as we've mentioned
throughout the presentation,

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.310
there are several deep
dives the rest of this week

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.560
into the different things
that we talked about today.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.850
First of all, I'd
encourage you to go check

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:17.620
out tomorrow night at
6:30 on this stage the

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.200
what's new for online
checkout session, which

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:24.280
is going to be run by one of
our PMs and one of the engineers

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.490
that have built all
these amazing things.

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.160
Then on Thursday,
our payments UX

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.670
team is going to be doing
a session on best practices

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:36.190
for creating great
checkout flows.

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.410
And they're going to touch
upon many of the things

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.300
that we talked about
today, but really go

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.610
a lot deeper and beyond.

00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.640
And then finally on
Thursday afternoon,

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.730
right near here on
stage 5, you can

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.084
learn about how you can add
transactional capabilities

00:25:52.084 --> 00:25:52.750
to your actions.

00:25:55.315 --> 00:25:56.690
VAROUJ CHITILIAN:
So if you can't

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.290
make the sessions
or the sandbox,

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:02.190
or if you're watching
on Livestream

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:03.950
and you want to
learn more, these

00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.380
are some of the
resources you can go to.

00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:11.300
g.co/pay/autofill will give
you best practices on how

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.150
to optimize your
site for Autofill.

00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:18.080
G.co/pay/business will give
you an overview of everything

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.970
we've discussed today.

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.580
And if you're a developer and
you just want to jump right

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:28.710
into the API documentation,
please go to g.co/pay/dvelopers

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:30.930
to get to the API
documentations directly.

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.710
It's going backwards.

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:44.280
So I want to say thank
you to all the developers

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.880
and the developer
community in the room.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.940
Really, these
payment experiences

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.840
are a partnership between us.

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.600
We can't provide these
peer payment experiences

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.580
to your customers without you.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:00.690
And so thank you very much for
coming today, and thank you

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.190
for working with
us in developing

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:05.290
these incredible experiences
together with Google Pay.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:05.790
Thank you.

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.289
GERARDO CAPIEL:
Thank you very much.

00:27:07.289 --> 00:27:07.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:14.030
