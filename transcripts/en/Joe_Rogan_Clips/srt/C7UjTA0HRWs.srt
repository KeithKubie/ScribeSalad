1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,430
How about your boy, Tj? Dillashaw both
our boys. Yeah, that's fine. Good.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,750
Do you see his apology? Yeah,
I did. What'd you think? Well,

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,660
I mean at least he's a just straight up
admit and I think that's what you have

4
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:11,880
to do because then you're kind
of like, yeah, I fucked up.

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,590
Then people can't really come at you.
Yeah,

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,940
I mean he's being honest about it and um,
oh, I do have to correct something. He,

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:23,180
someone wrote an article that said that
Cody Garbrandt found out the TJ tested

8
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:26,580
positive for his fight too.
And Cody went crazy.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,360
I think I got duped by a click
baity articles. We all got duped.

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,230
Everyone thought that.

11
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,010
And actually that got us with a
click baity articles in one day,

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,550
but I should have been more responsible.
So my apologies to Tj. So they had,

13
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:41,220
I don't think there's a been another
one that they tested them on that he's

14
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:45,090
positive, but they're looking into it.
Now here's the thing. Well we have to,

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,230
this is something that I know,
um, EPO is not always tested for.

16
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,930
Correct. And you see, Dana, what'd he say?

17
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,000
Cause you saw it as expensive as fuck
you. Hold on. You guys, aren't he at?

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:56,760
He didn't know.
He goes,

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,690
you guys aren't tests for EPL every
time we paid this much money for,

20
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:03,870
you know not to show up guys at three
in the morning and test them and you're

21
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:07,560
not testing every time and we pay this
much. He was, I had no idea. Yeah,

22
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,820
well time to cancer you saw. Thanks boys.
Thanks wise. Thanks for playing. See Ya.

23
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,220
Everything's been looking good. You
have to take it from here. Come back,

24
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:18,740
be cool bro. Yeah, next thing you
know, everybody's back looking thick,

25
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,380
picking, choosing now,
but they still, I see.

26
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,220
I guess what they're gonna do is they're
going to go back and see if they still

27
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:29,130
have the samples for when he did
beat Cody and test those for APL.

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,120
Well this is what you and I were talking
about where we're at the store when

29
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:35,460
you're like, how far do we go
back? Dude, I'm telling you, Joe,

30
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:39,180
you don't want to go down
that. Oh, you're crazy.

31
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,790
What's real? Why? Why you want
to do that? You're crazy, dude.

32
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,790
You can't do it, you're gonna
ruin the foundations of see UFC.

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,440
This is an intellectual exercise. I don't
really want you to test them all. Yeah,

34
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,270
but if I was going to argue and I'd
say test him, I I think line it up.

35
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,360
What's fine? What's up? We've always
wondered half. We'd not be shit.

36
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:05,660
I've never wondered. Do you want to test
Forrest Griffin and Stephan Bonner? UFC.

37
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,500
Oh, the fight. That
catapulted the freaking test.

38
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,550
UFC this,

39
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,740
but then again test all the
football players test all
the on everyone's feelings

40
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:20,880
hurt because you watch screw ball. Did you
want screwball? No, I have it. Holy Shit.

41
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:24,300
Is it good Billy Billy Corbin document?
Yeah. Do you know what they did? Yeah,

42
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,230
they had little kids play a
writer's again. It's crazy, right?

43
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,030
It's hilarious story.

44
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,960
The story is nuts because
it's in the people who are
actually there narrating it.

45
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,171
They're,

46
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:38,640
they're telling the story and they got
these little kids playing a rod and

47
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,400
playing the villain. It's fucking
great. It's crazy story though.

48
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:45,480
It's a crazy story. I
feel bad for Tj, man.

49
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,840
You know what, man, when everybody
makes an agreement to not cheat,

50
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,880
they're testing you all the time to try
to make sure that you're not cheating.

51
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,070
Don't you think that the environment's
different now than it was before you saw

52
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,430
it? It was was initiated and don't
you think that's a good thing?

53
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,450
I'm putting words in your mouth. Nose,
highest phrase. That question. Yeah.

54
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,660
Yeah. As I am on five politician,
I know. No, you're right.

55
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,460
It is better overall for the purity
of the sport. I think it's better,

56
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,250
but I still assume guys are going
to figure out a way to cheat. Yeah.

57
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,470
Because PDS in sports is no different
than than a referee or a judge or gloves.

58
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:25,980
They go hand in hand.

59
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,170
People have always done pds or
enhancements in every aspect,

60
00:03:31,171 --> 00:03:34,890
whether it's football, basketball,
and music, surfing, sex.

61
00:03:34,891 --> 00:03:36,660
It's just what humans do.

62
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,610
Especially when the odds are so high that
this little thing can help you achieve.

63
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,580
Maybe it gets you a victory,
but you know,

64
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,500
and then also with with Tj
Dillashaw is thing. Granted,

65
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,000
we know epls illegal, but this, uh,

66
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,000
this one's a little different for
tested positive for like steroids or

67
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,210
never like straight up steroids because
if you and I engage in a fight and we

68
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:04,850
have eight weeks of training and you go
to Mount Everest or where the fuck you

69
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:08,510
want to get your red blood cells higher
and then fight me back at sea level,

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,910
but I just stay here and
Jack those red cells,

71
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,240
you know the difference is that if you
operate at sea level and you are taking

72
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:18,583
EPO,

73
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:23,890
you will be able to work much harder and
get more rounds in and you will recover

74
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:26,900
much better if you are up at altitude.

75
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:29,630
The problem is living in
training really at high out to,

76
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:31,130
you can't put out as much output,

77
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,360
but the night of the fight we're
going to have the same. No. Why?

78
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:37,950
The EPO will have more, not even
close. No, you're gonna you,

79
00:04:37,951 --> 00:04:41,260
you could have a stroke from that stuff.
I mean it doesn't have to do it. Right.

80
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:42,850
It depends on how much you're taking.
Yeah.

81
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,520
That was one of the things Novitsky
was telling me about her young cyclists

82
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,010
thick. They were just
having strokes. We your boy,

83
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,410
I think it was Lance Armstrong
that maybe was on your show,

84
00:04:51,411 --> 00:04:54,110
but he would wake up and midnight and had
to have to ride a bike because they're

85
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:59,000
so sick. That was my friend's
Salami. Do I know slummy? No, no,

86
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,130
I'll explain. Okay. But
you know what I'm saying?

87
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,700
Like you can't actually
use it for long bike racer.

88
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:07,250
You'd have the talent to get up in
the middle of the night. Yeah, right.

89
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,820
Lance did discuss how guys think.
That's why I got it. Yeah, it's been,

90
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,750
we've talked about it.
Maybe Lance [inaudible],

91
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:15,630
lance talk about having to get up and
where did you and I talked about that?

92
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,720
I talked about getting up in the
middle of night riding a bike. No,

93
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:20,240
I'm just kidding. No, I'm
just kidding. But anyway,

94
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,470
obviously look that with
the Lance Armstrong thing,

95
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,620
I feel like everyone was doing it and
you don't anyone you don't think you have

96
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:34,100
seen, you think Tj is the only one? No,

97
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,880
I think other people are taking EPO and
they're hoping they don't get caught.

98
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:42,770
That's what I think. I think it's still
cheating. Correct. And I think, um,

99
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,180
I don't think everybody's doing that.

100
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,150
I think there's a lot of guys who
were doing it honorably. I agree.

101
00:05:47,151 --> 00:05:49,310
All those guys are doing it honorably.
You know,

102
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:52,880
I think you could get it in
your mind. Look, I don't,

103
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:58,310
this is just is what to take from Max
Holloway. It is what it is, right?

104
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:02,330
It is what it is. What it
is. It's cheating. Right. He
would, TJ would admit that.

105
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,170
I'm sure he did a minute. Yeah
he did. That's what it is. But

106
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,030
I mean I don't even know of have a point.
I don't know if I do either.

107
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,270
But it's put,
it's the guys trying to,

108
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,270
I was going to say the guy's
trying to provide for his family,

109
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,830
but so is everybody else.
Cody Garbrandt so his cardiogram ramps.

110
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,790
So is Henry Sudo. So is
everybody. Everybody. He fights.

111
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,230
But I would like to sit down with Tj
and I reached out to him since he's been

112
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:31,550
suspended. I want to sit down with
them just like, why would you,

113
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,890
why did you do it?
Like what led you to this?

114
00:06:33,891 --> 00:06:38,120
Because his card has been great since
he was a child with his wrestling

115
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:42,530
background. At what point along the way,
was it six years ago, six fights ago.

116
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,940
Did you think you need to do this in
order to beat these guys? Well, let's,

117
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,270
we could look at one thing that
we know that he's been doing.

118
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:54,980
He has a rigorous strength and
conditioning program. That training time,

119
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,770
that drink conditioning program
that he's doing. You have,

120
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,870
I have an issue with that.
I understand your issue,

121
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,930
but that shit is off the charts.
Crazy difficult.

122
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:06,830
They're doing wild stuff and medicine
ball work and plyometrics and all this

123
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:09,170
stuff and Tj looks like a
fucking beast when he's doing it.

124
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,040
Have you seen Brian Ortega's
workout with, with, with Mike? Yeah.

125
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,270
They do crazy shit too. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. I mean, I'm not justifying it,

126
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:22,570
but what I'm saying is that in
order to do that kind of work,

127
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,500
like to put out that kind of pace,

128
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:27,770
your body's going to have to have some
time to recover in between workouts. Well,

129
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:28,880
if you take EPO,

130
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,970
that time of recovery is diminished
quite a bit according to Novitsky.

131
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,890
I'm saying it allows
guys to put in more work.

132
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,860
So it doesn't just give you more cardio.

133
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,760
It allows you to recover faster so
you could train harder. And you know,

134
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,840
as well as anybody that sometimes the
difference between victory and defeat is

135
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,970
just having a little
more in your gas tank.

136
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,120
Just having special at that little
longer camp Humphreys not being injured.

137
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:58,160
The last couple of weeks we
lost some cardio. You know
those awful feelings. Well,

138
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:01,090
if you had the opposite of
those awful feelings of now,

139
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,330
instead of being compromised,
