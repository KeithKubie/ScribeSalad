00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:10.850
It seems like all processed foods are terrible…
but might they actually be saving your life?

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.309
When talking processed foods, my mind immediately
jumps to pastries, ready to eat frozen meals

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.450
and soda pops… but that’s only part of
the picture.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.500
Processed foods are really anything that’s
been altered or modified from its original

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.500
state.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.140
Think of how many food items have salts or
sugar added, or have been smoked, cooked,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.670
packaged or canned in preservatives - these
are all considered processed.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.320
Basically, if it’s not a whole apple or
plain nut, it’s probably processed.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.090
So clearly, if the definition of “processed”
is that broad, processing isn’t always bad

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.750
for you - in fact, processing can make food
safer.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.010
Pasteurization, for example, kills harmful
bacteria in milk and juice, which makes them

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.390
safer for consumption.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.470
Freezing counts as processing too, and in
addition to fighting bacterial growth, it

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.510
actually helps foods preserve their nutrients.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.969
This is all why some scientists decided it
didn’t make sense to lump all processed

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.120
foods together.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.700
Doing so muddles results in studies and as
a consequence, allows big food companies to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.299
make claims that are in their best interests.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:13.850
So, scientists have separated out the real
villains under the term ultra-processed.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.920
Carlos Augusto Monteiro, leading researcher
at the Centre for Epidemiological Studies

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.229
in Health and Nutrition at the University
of São Paulo defines “ultra-processed”

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.630
as foods that fall into the ready to eat and
ready to heat buckets.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.450
Think of an aluminum wrapped energy bar or
a burger at a junk food joint.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.310
He explains that these foods are made up of
multiple minimally processed foods.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.850
And, they’re typically processed further
through baking or frying, they have more additives,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.360
they’re packaged or canned, and they have
more added salt, sugar, vitamins, minerals.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.860
Actually - a LOT more: a typical ultra-processed
meal contains 33% more sugar and 25% more

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.600
salt and fat than a meal comprised of natural
and minimally processed foods.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.689
You probably already know why these foods,
and what’s in them, are bad for you.

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.640
Sugar is linked to obesity, diabetes and artificial
sugars are linked to cancer, weight gain,

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.299
and mess with your metabolism.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.530
Added fats - especially trans fats, are linked
to coronary heart disease.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.870
And you may also know that processes like
refining carbohydrates can lead to overeating,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.390
and insulin spikes.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.980
But ultra-processed foods also contain less
of important things, like fiber.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.760
Which is a problem because besides decreasing
your risk of diabetes and aiding in digestion,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.500
fiber helps you feel full.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.110
Not enough fiber, and you’re more likely
to overeat.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.879
Add to this that ultra-processed foods are
more energy dense, and it means that on top

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.260
of eating more calories, you’re eating the
wrong kind.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.050
And this matters because consumption of ultra-processed
foods is increasing, and these foods are replacing

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.260
other less processed foods in the U.S., and
abroad . While lots of processed foods are

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.090
good for you, NO ultra-processed food is healthful.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.780
Now this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t have
pizza, ever.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.160
But it does mean we should be vigilant about
quantity and quality when making food choices

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.349
as a whole.

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.480
When choosing meats, Trace has the run down
in this episode.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:33.200
Check it out 
to learn more about how processed meats can

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.230
cause you harm.
