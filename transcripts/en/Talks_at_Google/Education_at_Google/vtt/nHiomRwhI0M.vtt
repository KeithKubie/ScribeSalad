[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.697 --> 00:00:06.530
MIKAEL MEIR: Thanks.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.710
It's good to be here.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.520
And thank you for your time.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.077
I understand typically
experts occupy this stage.

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:16.160
And they've written books.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.610
And they come to share
with you their knowledge.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.130
And I want you to know upfront
I am not an expert in anything.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.120
What I am is a guy who is
an expert in my own failure

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.980
and the pain and
suffering that comes

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.430
from making wrong choices.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.570
So I'd like to begin by asking
you to reflect on a question.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.960
If you had the opportunity
to make $50 million

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.180
in an insider
trading transaction

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.350
and you were guaranteed not to
get caught, would you do it?

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.630
Ask yourself, what percentage
of the people in this auditorium

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.320
would do it?

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.680
What percentage of the people
in the organization would do it?

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.020
What percentage of the people
in your family would do it?

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.660
For the last seven
years, I've taught

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.170
a course, Ethics and Finance,
to MBA students at a university.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.510
And in the second class, we
learn about insider trading.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.110
And I posed that very same
question to my students.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.585
They write yes or no
anonymously on pieces of paper.

00:01:19.585 --> 00:01:20.710
I gather up all the papers.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.840
And I calculate the percentages.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.440
So of over a seven-year period
I've been calculating this,

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.360
what percentage
of students do you

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.620
think would take that trade?

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.498
Just shout out.

00:01:31.498 --> 00:01:32.040
AUDIENCE: 40.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.320
MIKAEL MEIR: 40?

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.460
AUDIENCE: 75.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.713
MIKAEL MEIR: 75?

00:01:35.713 --> 00:01:37.830
AUDIENCE: 60?

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.360
MIKAEL MEIR: In the ballpark--

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.860
67%.

00:01:42.688 --> 00:01:43.980
So think about what that means.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.550
67% of postgraduate
business students

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.297
going into the field of finance
would commit an illegal act

00:01:51.297 --> 00:01:53.130
if the dollars were big
enough and they were

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.800
guaranteed not to get caught.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.440
The real question is, why?

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.180
Why would they cheat?

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.800
Why would they sacrifice
principles for profit?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.220
And the answer
goes to the essence

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.970
of what I want to talk
to you about today.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.490
The answer, I believe, is the
very definition of greed--

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.130
a voracious, self-centered
wanting for excess beyond what

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.830
is necessary and sufficient.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.990
And without an
awareness around greed,

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.260
it can be incredibly seductive.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.200
And it can be
brutally destructive.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.790
So I'm going to share my story
and hope to give you a greater

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.000
awareness around
greed through that

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.060
by telling you about how
through some shortcomings

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.960
in my character the seductive
and destructive force of greed

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.310
got a stranglehold on me,
brought me to my knees.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.280
And I betrayed the things
that mattered the most to me--

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.190
my dignity, my
values, my family.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.520
And how over the course
of the last 14 years,

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.670
I rebuilt my character,
reclaimed the things

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.330
that mattered most
to me by recognizing

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.740
that character is not something
that's black or white.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.190
It's not set in stone.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.900
Character is malleable.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.450
And it's a function of
context and circumstance.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.170
And so what I had to do was
make a hyper-vigilant effort

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.250
at cultivating
virtue and character

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.930
throughout the last 14 years.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.090
Albert Einstein says there
are three great forces that

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.040
rule the world--

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.850
stupidity, fear, and greed.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.490
And I'm totally clear that
stupidity, fear, and greed

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.460
ruled my life for
the first 40 years.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.850
And then life dropped this
huge boulder on my head.

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.020
And I was forced to wake up.

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.180
I met some amazing teachers.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.930
And they drilled these
three insights into my head

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.810
that I'm going to share with you
through the context of my story

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.060
in hope that they
will be useful to you

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.550
on your journey in
leadership and life.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.400
Psychologists tell us
that our childhoods create

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.570
the conditioning that sets
up the core trajectory

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.470
that our lives take and that
typically we have a parent that

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.870
sets up the major
patterning around

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.132
how we relate to ourselves and
how we relate to the world.

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:26.340
And for me, it was my father.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.790
I remember him in
two dimensions.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.670
One dimension-- he was
a hot-shot surgeon,

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.760
drove a Mercedes, wore
really slick clothes.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.900
Another dimension was a guy
that was emotionally shut down,

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.620
very critical, very judgmental,
and very hard on me.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.790
So my mind wired up
early on that in order

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.860
for me to be safe, I
would have to achieve

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.260
and be successful financially.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.660
In order for me to cultivate
the sense of belonging,

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.590
I would have to
achieve financially.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.110
My mind wired up that
financial achievement

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.270
would define the foundation of
a happy and successful life.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.640
So I got into the
game of business.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.830
I started 12 companies over
the course of my career.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.380
And as I was getting
varying levels

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.950
of success under my belt, I was
getting greedier and greedier.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.800
And so I migrated to the
financial services industry.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.170
I set up a merchant bank.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.700
This is 1998.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.010
Our game plan is to fund
early-stage internet

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.700
infrastructure companies, work
intensively with management

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.450
teams, raise subsequent
rounds of funding,

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.360
and get them public at
exponential valuations to where

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.820
we had invested.

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.180
And I needed somebody to
do technical due diligence.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.105
So I hired a young
guy, cum laude

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:42.540
out of an electrical
engineering school,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.000
tall, blonde hair,
blue eyes, Israeli.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.825
I remember in our first
interview him saying, Michael,

00:05:48.825 --> 00:05:49.950
I don't have any interests.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.992
I don't have any hobbies.

00:05:50.992 --> 00:05:52.350
I care about one thing.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.010
I want to make as much money as
I can working as hard as I can

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.715
as fast as I can.

00:05:57.715 --> 00:05:59.340
And I thought to
myself, where have you

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.485
been all my life, baby?

00:06:01.485 --> 00:06:04.320
I hired him, after
that, made him partner.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:07.360
We recruited a small research
team, worked 18 hours a day,

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.140
seven days a week, didn't see
my wife, didn't see my kids,

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.670
totally consumed
with building wealth.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.120
Dot com boom hit.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.800
We get a few of our
companies public.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.050
I go from having nothing
and being worried

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:22.890
about paying my mortgage to
an eight-figure net worth

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:23.580
overnight.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:26.040
And in my mind, I
thought, I'm 33.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.900
And in my mind, I
thought, I made it.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:28.680
I got the Porsche.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.700
I got the Range Rover.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:30.630
I got the Rolex.

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.360
I travel all around the world
first class, best hotels,

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.980
best restaurants, really
indulged in pleasure.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.700
And how long do you think
that pleasure lasted?

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.680
For me, six months.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.480
Why?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.900
Because my psychology
was rooted in scarcity.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:54.350
It was rooted in this scarce
competitive adversarial model

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.160
of being that I can describe
to you in two words--

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.890
not enough.

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.900
I don't have enough.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.290
I don't have enough
relative to the next guy.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.140
There's not enough
out there for me.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.670
And ultimately, this lie--

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:14.280
this core belief
that I am not enough.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.075
And so in my mind, I thought,
I got to make more money.

00:07:18.075 --> 00:07:19.700
I got to get into
like quarter billion,

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.945
half a billion dollars.

00:07:21.945 --> 00:07:23.320
And so I thought
that what you do

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.310
with this core
belief of not enough

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.350
is you fill it up with more.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.110
Does that work?

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.460
Can you fill up a core belief
of not enough with more?

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.710
Can you solve an
internal problem

00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.500
with an external solution?

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.360
In my mind, I thought I could.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.620
So I moved into--

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.010
I set up a retail investment
management company.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.730
And it was a very crowded space.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.640
So we needed a highly
differentiated product.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.950
We set up this product
it was like a bond, where

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.440
your principle was guaranteed,
except instead of interest

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.500
as you return, we linked
returns to a basket

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.020
of heavy-hitter hedge
funds out in New York City.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.680
Because at the time--
this is 2002, 2003--

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:04.220
hedge funds were a very
hot and sexy asset class.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.060
And we designed this product
called the Bank Note Trust.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.940
And we go out into
the marketplace--

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.130
and again, 18 hours a
day, seven days a week.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.020
My poor wife, kids
didn't see me.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:19.270
It was about, how do I
get to that next level?

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:20.770
And this product
started taking off.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.020
We're raising $20 million,
then $40 million a quarter,

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.742
then $50, then $100
million a quarter.

00:08:25.742 --> 00:08:27.950
And so I needed capital in
order to fund the business

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.242
because it's really taking off.

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:30.590
And demand is heavy.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.570
So I started
looking for capital.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.700
And I'm in my office.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.530
And my partner comes
into my office.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:39.500
And he says, Michael, I'm
about to deploy $200 million.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.530
And I just got off the phone
with our guaranteeing bank.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:45.200
And they said because we're
buying in such volume,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.520
we can get a 15%
volume discount.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.030
I said, that's fantastic.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.400
Do our investors
get disadvantaged?

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.090
He said, no.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.310
They still get exactly
what we promised them.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:57.920
But because we're
buying wholesale,

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.613
we get that beefy margin.

00:09:01.613 --> 00:09:02.780
And we looked at each other.

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:06.230
And we said, that's $30
million free dollars

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.610
that we didn't anticipate.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:19.460
At that time, my desire for
money, power, recognition,

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:23.060
prestige completely
overpowered my desire

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.870
to live in my moral
compass, to live my values.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.810
To buy wholesale and
sell retail is fine.

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.680
You can do it in any business.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.500
You can even do it in the
financial services industry

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.440
as long as you disclose.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.450
And we made a
conscious choice not

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:41.180
to disclose because we
thought, if we put this

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.700
into our disclosure material,
our investors would find out.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:45.180
Our competitors would find out.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.638
They'd think we were getting
a free ride off our investors'

00:09:47.638 --> 00:09:48.650
back, which we were.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.450
And we wouldn't have been
able to sell as much.

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:54.650
So what we did was we set up
an elaborate offshore structure

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.080
to hide what we were doing.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.720
We went to a big, fancy
law firm and bought

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.150
a legal opinion that said
everything that we were doing

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:05.570
was legal that we
thought would protect us

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.920
and window dress what
was, in effect, a highly

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.930
unethical and dishonest move.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:15.510
And onward we went--

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.350
$100 million a quarter,
$150 million a quarter,

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.520
$200 million a quarter.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.910
We were raising more money
than banks and mutual funds.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.480
I had a high-power executive
team that reported to me.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.970
I had offices
around the country.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.240
And I was salivating
about this exit at a half

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.805
a billion dollars that I
thought we were going to get.

00:10:34.805 --> 00:10:38.990
And I was often
intoxicated with the notion

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.980
of success and power.

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.512
One day, I'm at the
gym, doing my workout.

00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:46.220
And I get a call.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.120
And I never got a call.

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.480
I always worked out
from 12:00 to 2:00.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.910
Nobody ever called me
from 12:00 to 2:00.

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:50.390
I got a call.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.307
I picked up the phone.

00:10:51.307 --> 00:10:52.420
It was my partner.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.250
He said, Michael, eight
people from the enforcement

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.140
team of the
Securities Commission

00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.490
just walked into our office.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.000
And they want to speak to us.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.353
I said, what do they want?

00:11:02.353 --> 00:11:03.270
He said, I don't know.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:06.350
Just get over here fast.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.400
The walk from the
gym to my office

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.180
was the longest walk of my life.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.980
My stomach is churning.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.310
My heart is pounding.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.250
My mind is catastrophizing.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.718
What if we get charged?

00:11:20.718 --> 00:11:22.010
What if this gets in the paper?

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:24.740
What if I lose my company?

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:25.880
I get to the elevator bank.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.520
I ride up the elevator.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.850
I stand outside the boardroom.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.452
I take a deep breath.

00:11:32.452 --> 00:11:36.140
I put on my mask of fearless
confidence, and I walk inside.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.480
The head of the enforcement
team says, hello, sir.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.880
We want to understand a little
bit about your operations.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.220
And we'd like to begin by
asking you a few questions.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:45.110
I said, no problem.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:46.018
I'd be happy to help.

00:11:46.018 --> 00:11:47.810
I'm just going go get
settled in my office.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:49.800
Everybody OK for coffee, water?

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.300
OK.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:51.530
I'll be right back.

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.420
With that, I beeline
into my office.

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:54.270
I pick up my phone.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:54.978
I call my lawyer.

00:11:54.978 --> 00:11:57.560
I say, Mike, eight people from
enforcement just walked in.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.768
And they want to speak to me.

00:11:58.768 --> 00:12:00.150
What do I do?

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.600
He said, well, you don't
actually have to talk to them.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.370
Remember, we separated the
portfolio management license,

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:08.930
which is under
their jurisdiction,

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.420
from the securities distribution
side of the company.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.920
So it's actually
your partner that's

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.850
under their jurisdiction.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:15.475
And it's him that
has to speak to them.

00:12:15.475 --> 00:12:16.860
I said, that's fantastic.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.605
Can you send me that in writing?

00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:20.650
He said, sure.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.820
So I go back into the boardroom.

00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:27.170
I tell everybody that my partner
is going to be helping them.

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.800
And I'm around if
they need anything.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.690
And I answer a few
more questions.

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.620
And I excuse myself.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.210
And I go out into
the organization

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:41.150
to try and calm the moral
outrage as a result of the fact

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:46.970
that we are getting audited
by the Securities Commission.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:49.790
About three weeks later, I
get a call from my partner.

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:52.250
He said, Michael, the
Securities Commission

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:55.370
is really uncomfortable
with our structure.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.660
They don't like what they see.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.930
They're putting a cease
trade order on the business.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:00.980
It's going to go public.

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.272
It's going to get in the media.

00:13:02.272 --> 00:13:05.252
We're too young to bear
this kind of publicity.

00:13:05.252 --> 00:13:06.210
I think we're finished.

00:13:09.787 --> 00:13:13.707
I didn't sleep that night,
agitated, tossing and turning.

00:13:13.707 --> 00:13:15.040
I get out of bed in the morning.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.770
I go downstairs, open the door.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:17.940
I pick up the newspapers.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:20.820
And there it was on the
front page, business section

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:22.290
of both papers--

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.785
scandal, commission
moves against Portus,

00:13:25.785 --> 00:13:28.530
which was the name of
my company at the time.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:29.820
And I can barely read it.

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:30.480
It's all fuzzy.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.830
But I see my name in all of it.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.360
And I was like, the media's
turning me into a crook.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.990
And I just threw
the papers down.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.610
And I thought, my
reputation is completely

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:47.630
damaged across the entire
business community.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:50.540
I eventually had to fire
everybody in the organization.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:55.130
And I was built with the ability
to withstand a lot of stress

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:56.630
for whatever reason.

00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:02.660
But firing good people who
had mortgages in scandal

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:04.280
was almost too much
for me to bear.

00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:09.020
I pulled everybody into the
boardroom, conference call

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:13.040
across the country,
gave a farewell speech,

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.350
handed out notices
of termination.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:17.300
I went into my office.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.940
And I broke down, and I cried.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.480
And I hadn't cried since
I was a little boy.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.100
But as human beings,
we're adaptive, right?

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.602
So I'm adapting to my new norm.

00:14:28.602 --> 00:14:30.810
Securities Commission, so
I got to manage my lawyers.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:33.143
I got to manage the little
bit of money that I had left.

00:14:33.143 --> 00:14:35.890
I got to figure all this out.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:39.150
I'm in the kitchen,
preparing breakfast.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.870
I'm in a more adaptive place.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:42.430
I get a call from my partner.

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:44.162
Michael, checkmate.

00:14:44.162 --> 00:14:45.745
I said, what do you
mean, "checkmate?"

00:14:45.745 --> 00:14:47.760
He said, you know
the $50 million

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.585
offshore fund that KPMG froze?

00:14:50.585 --> 00:14:52.696
I said, yeah.

00:14:52.696 --> 00:14:55.840
He said, I just
convinced the Swiss bank

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.970
to release 15 of
the $50 million.

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:01.630
And I wired the money
to an offshore haven.

00:15:01.630 --> 00:15:04.510
So now no matter what
happens, we got gunpowder

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.630
to fight legal with.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:10.570
And we got a safety net in
case all hell goes loose.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:14.582
I'm like, you did what?

00:15:14.582 --> 00:15:15.790
I got off the phone with him.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:17.380
And I'm going to
tell you honestly.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:22.480
My first reaction to
what he did was relief

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.140
because as a result of legal
expenses, living expenses,

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.010
and investment losses,
all the money that I made

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.520
had evaporated down to nothing.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.250
And I figured, at least
in a worst-case scenario,

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.520
if I end up in jail,
I'll have something

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.350
to support my wife
and kids with.

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:46.540
And my next thought
was, holy crap.

00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:49.280
This was a civil
disclosure issue.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.950
All of the money
and the investments

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.750
were in a prime
brokerage account.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.400
Now there's theft.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:55.600
It's criminal.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.130
And there's money missing.

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:59.730
And I'm a part of this.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.590
And I didn't know what to do.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.490
I didn't know where to turn.

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:07.300
I mean, what do you do?

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.867
There's $15 million.

00:16:08.867 --> 00:16:10.660
7.5 is yours.

00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.910
Do you take the $7.5 million?

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.830
And now, well, at least,
if I have no money,

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:18.460
I'll be able to fund
a great legal defense.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.408
And if I have to go to jail,
my family will be supported.

00:16:21.408 --> 00:16:23.200
Or do you say, no, I
don't touch that money

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:25.458
because that's stolen money.

00:16:25.458 --> 00:16:28.000
You don't have the money to fund
a great legal defense, which

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.833
increases the probability
of you potentially

00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:32.740
going to jail and your wife
and kids not getting supported.

00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:34.250
For some people,
it's a no-brainer.

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:35.380
They take the money.

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.030
For some people,
it's a no-brainer.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.930
They'd never take the money.

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.420
I didn't know.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.690
And to make matters
worse, three weeks later,

00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:47.110
we both got charged with
multiple counts of fraud.

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:53.370
So I'm panicking.

00:16:53.370 --> 00:16:55.740
I am in a state of
total overwhelm.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:57.210
I don't know who to talk to.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:58.890
I don't know where
to go, what to do.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.710
I'm doing intensive
religious study,

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.090
asking the big questions.

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.810
Is there a god?

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:04.839
Why am I here?

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:06.369
Why did this happen to me?

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.819
I'm in intensive therapy,
trying to understand my mind

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:09.569
and how it worked.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.400
I'm reading 10
self-help books a week.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.560
Nothing's helping.

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.150
And then I was
introduced to a lady

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:17.650
who I had a conversation with,
kind of like a counselor, who

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:22.109
I thought was incredibly
powerful and clear and wise.

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:24.540
So I decided to go see her.

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:29.550
And I can remember in one of
our few sessions that I went in,

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.570
I walked in.

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:32.970
I'm filled with
righteous indignation.

00:17:32.970 --> 00:17:34.320
I'm angry at my partner.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.070
I'm angry at the prosecution,
the Commission, KP--

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:40.650
I'm angry at the world.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:41.250
She sees me.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.810
And she says, OK, listen.

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.760
I see you're angry.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:47.050
Let me ask you a question.

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.406
What was your sin?

00:17:49.406 --> 00:17:50.950
I said, my sin?

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.160
I was playing the
game like guys do.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.030
I was in finance.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.220
I don't think I was
doing anything different

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:59.070
than a lot of people
do in finance.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.490
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:02.610
The world is against me.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:05.890
She said, really?

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:09.100
She said, what was
your part in this?

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:11.160
I said, I don't know.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:17.100
She said, it starts with
a G. I still didn't know.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:20.510
She said, greed.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:22.950
And when she said
that, I got pissed off

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:25.140
because I didn't want
to take responsibility

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.780
that I was a part of creating
all of these things that

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:28.650
happened to me.

00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:33.547
I wanted to play victim
and blame everybody else.

00:18:33.547 --> 00:18:35.380
But there was a part
of me that was actually

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:39.370
relieved because she
had named what was true.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:43.150
And now I could see
this character trait

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.180
that was so destructive
to me and so many people.

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:48.520
And I could begin to heal it.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.270
And I came to understand
that from my greed,

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.790
no amount of money was
ever enough for me.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:59.800
I always lusted after more
money, more accolades.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.985
From my greed, I didn't
care about my clients.

00:19:02.985 --> 00:19:04.360
I didn't care
about my investors.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.260
I cared about myself, my
ego, and my pocketbook.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.010
That's the thump the ego makes.

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:15.550
And from my greed, I was
deceptive and manipulative

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:17.680
and using part of
my investors' money

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.725
to finance the growth
of my business.

00:19:20.725 --> 00:19:21.850
And she said, this is good.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.835
You're getting
honest with yourself.

00:19:23.835 --> 00:19:25.880
I said, it, doesn't feel good.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.180
She said, well, here's
what I want you to do next.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:30.970
I want you to go
tell some people.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.790
Who do you want me
to tell this to?

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.460
Start with your mother.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.870
Tell your wife.

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:39.250
Tell your friends.

00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:40.122
Tell your brother.

00:19:40.122 --> 00:19:40.830
Tell your sister.

00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:42.130
So I went out.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.460
And I said, I was
dishonest in business.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.930
I was playing a big game.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:50.090
I'm in big trouble.

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:52.180
And I'm scared.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.590
And people asked me often,
did family and friends kind of

00:19:56.590 --> 00:20:00.100
shun you after you went
through this whole debacle?

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:01.840
And actually, the
opposite was true.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:04.948
What I got was love,
understanding, and compassion.

00:20:04.948 --> 00:20:06.740
And I think there are
two reasons for that.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:10.540
The first is, I was blessed with
really great people in my life.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:15.670
But the second is, I wasn't
arrogant and evasive and vague.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:20.260
I was vulnerable,
transparent, and honest.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.750
And I learned that
in our vulnerability,

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:27.370
there is just so much
power to connect.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:31.413
It's a very powerful
leadership trait.

00:20:31.413 --> 00:20:32.830
And so I did start
feeling better.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.920
I felt like even though I was
potentially going to jail,

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:39.100
I felt like this 2,000-pound
weight had been taken off

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:40.940
my chest.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:45.370
So I went in to visit
my counselor again.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:48.216
And she said, hello, Mikael.

00:20:48.216 --> 00:20:50.380
And I said, what are you
calling me Mikael for?

00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:53.260
My name is Michael,
Michael Mendelson.

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:57.220
She said, you have
been born anew.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:21:00.520
And it was like
the room got quiet

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.850
because I realized
that I actually

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:07.480
was a different person than
when I first came in to see her.

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.010
And I got emotional around it.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:11.590
And she said, have
you ever thought

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:13.330
about changing your name?

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:16.840
Because in many traditions
throughout the centuries,

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.480
when people want to create a
new trajectory for their lives,

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.400
it's actually quite common
to change your name.

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:25.810
It's kind of weird.

00:21:25.810 --> 00:21:27.792
But you know what?

00:21:27.792 --> 00:21:29.500
I'm getting slaughtered
on Google Search.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:33.340
It could be a great way for
me to kind of reinvent myself.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.930
She said, don't do it
because you're hiding.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:39.640
No more hiding.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.790
Do it because it's an
external reflection

00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:46.288
of an internal transformation.

00:21:46.288 --> 00:21:47.330
And so I listened to her.

00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:48.890
And I reflected on that.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.140
And then without
a second's notice,

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.810
just like a punch in
between the eyes, she goes,

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:57.366
now how about these criminal
prosecution hearings?

00:21:57.366 --> 00:21:58.850
I said, well, what do you mean?

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:00.500
They're kind of ongoing.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:01.562
She goes, well, look.

00:22:01.562 --> 00:22:03.020
You've gotten honest
with yourself.

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.550
You've gotten honest with
your friends and family.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.560
Do you want to get
honest with them, too?

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.600
I said, what, tell
them that I was greedy,

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.150
selfish, and dishonest?

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:17.330
She goes, how about telling them
the situation, the conditions,

00:22:17.330 --> 00:22:21.380
what happened, your involvement?

00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.870
I said, if I do that,
I may end up in jail.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.720
She said, you may end
up in jail anyways.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.660
But at least if
you tell the truth,

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.450
you will end up in jail
with your human dignity.

00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:40.700
She said, you may end up
physically imprisoned and freer

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.120
than you've ever been in your
life, Mikael, having released

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.680
yourself from the inner prison.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.060
I'm like, this is heavy, man.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.120
What's on the table here?

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.600
I don't know.

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.530
I got some resistance.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.197
And I said, well,
what about my partner?

00:22:53.197 --> 00:22:54.890
Wouldn't I be
betraying my partner?

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.830
And she said,
Mikael, do you really

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:01.940
think your partner has your
best interests at heart?

00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:08.600
She said, you can never go
wrong standing in your truth.

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.830
And when she said that, it
hit me like a ton of bricks

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.780
because I realized
that I had gotten so

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.760
caught up in greed and
clever manipulations

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.330
that I had completely
lost my way.

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:23.360
And now to connect
with my partner

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.450
and be complicit in
this $15 million theft,

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:30.480
I would be a living
betrayal of my values.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.170
And I had three young daughters.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.720
And how can I look these
little girls in the eyes

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.300
and be the man I
want to be and say,

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.500
you got to be honest in
life in order to be happy,

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:47.720
if I'm conniving in order to
get my piece of the $15 million?

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:49.460
So I made the decision
there and then.

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:51.980
I said, my life
from this point on

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:57.260
has got to be about
truth and honor.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:04.700
And that choice was a 180-degree
shift for my worldview.

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.730
As a boy who couldn't trust
his father, I trusted no one.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.160
Life is a zero-sum
game, kill or be killed,

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.380
survival of the fittest.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:14.900
Always think five steps ahead.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:16.530
Always be the smartest
guy in the room.

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:20.180
And if you're not, you're
not working hard enough--

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.740
identity construct.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:25.220
And now I'm going
to go into jail.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.850
I lost all my money.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:28.940
I don't know for how
long I'll be there.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.960
I don't know how my wife and
kids are going to be supported.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.100
And I just had to
surrender all of that.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.110
I had to let go.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:41.270
And I had to trust.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:43.970
I had to trust that if
I do the right thing,

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:46.320
the right thing is
going to happen.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:51.500
I had to trust that life's got
our back, that it's friendly.

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.690
I had to trust life.

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.660
And that was the first
lesson that I learned--

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:59.075
was to just to let
go and to trust.

00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:09.710
And so my next step after
that was to pick up the phone

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.700
and call my partner and
ask him to give back

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:17.240
the money so that we could
be honest and work this out.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.970
And unfortunately, he hadn't
had the spiritual transformation

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:20.930
that I had.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:22.910
And he was like, no effing way.

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.020
They destroy my business.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.380
They destroy my reputation.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.490
This is all-- whatever.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:27.660
So we had this huge--

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:30.462
we had a falling out.

00:25:30.462 --> 00:25:31.920
And my next steps
were quite clear.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:32.870
I called my lawyers.

00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:36.452
I said, I want to go sit
down with the prosecution.

00:25:36.452 --> 00:25:37.910
And I want to tell
them everything.

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.740
Lawyers thought that wasn't
the best idea because they

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.000
could use it against me.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.260
And I said, I'm resigning.

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:45.350
As master of my universe,
I ain't doing a good job.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.190
I'm going to go in.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.960
And I'm going to trust that
if I do the right thing,

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.440
the right thing will happen.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.680
And after five days of grueling
interviews and three months

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.880
of grueling negotiations,
because the dollars were

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:01.920
so big-- we were
in $800 million--

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.980
this had gone to the
Department of Justice.

00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:05.990
So it had gotten a
little bit political.

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:08.840
And they wanted jail time.

00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.420
And so I had these
three little girls.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.040
And I wanted to get
on with my life.

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.020
And this would have
been a five-year fight.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.600
So I agreed to one
count of fraud,

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:22.580
two years in a federal
prison, with the provision

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:25.000
that I could get out within
six months on good behavior.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:33.690
The choice to go to
prison was horrendous.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:36.900
The choice to put
my personal safety

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:40.230
at risk in the face of
violence was horrendous.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:48.800
The choice to further damage
my reputation was horrendous.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.300
But none of that
was the worst part.

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:59.070
The worst part was the Friday
night before I went in.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:01.260
My wife and I, telling
my young daughters--

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:04.350
I had one daughter that was 10,
one daughter that was seven,

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.720
and one daughter that was four--

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:08.610
that we had to tell
them something.

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.855
And then gathering around
the table after dinner

00:27:10.855 --> 00:27:11.730
and looking up at me.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.160
They all have these
big, beautiful blue eyes

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.230
and long, flowing hair.

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:16.800
What, Daddy?

00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.713
Are we going to go
to the treat store?

00:27:19.713 --> 00:27:20.380
No, my darlings.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.690
I got to tell you
something serious.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.120
Daddy made some mistakes.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:30.910
And I got to go away for six
months, maybe a little longer.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:32.260
No, Daddy.

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.510
Why?

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.860
Me seeing the fear
in their eyes--

00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.010
because Daddy made
some bad choices.

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:43.150
And whenever we make choices,
there's always consequences.

00:27:43.150 --> 00:27:45.370
Well, can we come
visit you, Daddy?

00:27:45.370 --> 00:27:46.090
No, my darlings.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:47.710
You're not going to be able to.

00:27:47.710 --> 00:27:50.020
And the look of
terror in their eyes.

00:27:50.020 --> 00:27:52.190
And my big one started bawling.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:53.320
And she grabbed my stomach.

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.340
And she goes, no, Daddy.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.160
It's not fair.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.210
You can't go.

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.510
And my middle one
grabs my neck and goes,

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:01.330
Daddy, you're going
to miss my birthday.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.398
And my wife's crying.

00:28:02.398 --> 00:28:03.190
And they're crying.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.880
And I'm crying.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.560
That was the worst part--

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:11.220
seeing the consequences
of my choices

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.110
in the tears of these
little precious girls' eyes.

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:20.990
And as I was getting
ready to go inside,

00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:23.487
I amped up my mixed
martial arts practice,

00:28:23.487 --> 00:28:25.070
which I had been
doing for four years.

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:26.910
So I amped up my
meditation practice.

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:28.190
So I was physically confident.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.900
And I was calm.

00:28:31.888 --> 00:28:36.770
I'm trying to kind of prepare
for mortal combat zone.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:38.930
And nothing, nothing,
nothing can prepare you

00:28:38.930 --> 00:28:41.360
for landing up in prison.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.310
Nothing can prepare
you for waking up

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:48.050
in an orange jumpsuit
in a 10-by-10 jail cell.

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:50.940
Nothing can prepare
you for the violence.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.100
It's not one-on-one fights.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.640
It's five on one, guys
getting beaten to shreds.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.860
And the guards don't
get in the way.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.780
And nothing can prepare
you for the lockdowns

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.610
when there's a stabbing
on another range.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:05.030
And you can't leave your
little cell for three days.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.310
And every second feels
like an eternity.

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.610
And a sense of hopelessness
and despair come in.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.590
Nothing can prepare
you for that.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.300
But as I kind of got
through the trauma of it--

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:21.410
the capital T Trauma of it--

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.525
a funny thing happened.

00:29:22.525 --> 00:29:23.900
I guess because
of all the work I

00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:28.220
was doing on myself and my
ego, my ego was disintegrating.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.360
And my heart was opening up.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.610
I looked at these inmates.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:35.960
And they were mentally
tormented and misdirected.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:38.200
And I just had so much
compassion for them

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.370
because compassion welled up.

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:42.780
And I was like,
how can I help you?

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:43.650
I'll listen to you.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:44.840
I'll be your psychologist.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.330
I'll help you position
your parole hearing, which

00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:48.770
is a marketing exercise.

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:49.920
I go, what can I do?

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.030
How can I help?

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:53.510
And it was really interesting,
because my whole life

00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:56.780
and the way that I even
went in there was protection

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.820
from a place of fear.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:29:59.580
My ass.

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:02.660
That's my reputation,
my image, my family.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.235
We're protecting
all of the time.

00:30:05.235 --> 00:30:06.860
And that's even the
way I went in there

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.200
was mixed martial arts, right?

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.712
But then all of my ego
attachments get stripped.

00:30:12.712 --> 00:30:13.920
I don't have a house anymore.

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:14.837
I don't have a family.

00:30:14.837 --> 00:30:18.080
I don't have anything
except for this heart.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.170
And this heart
was ready to open.

00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:21.230
And it did open.

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:22.700
And I was in service.

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.390
And being in service to
these people actually

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:31.190
had the days pass
in a fulfilling way.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:36.650
And I learned the power
of servant leadership

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.920
in prison, ironically.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.110
And that was my
second big lesson.

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:46.430
It was the power of being
open-hearted and compassionate

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:49.310
and having the
intention of service.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:50.730
So we're coming to the end.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.240
So I get out.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.610
Unfortunately, all those
great lessons didn't stick.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:57.050
And I'm thinking, I'm scared.

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.700
And I'm like, OK, how am
I going to rebuild myself?

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.760
And I thought, OK, I know
what I'm going to do.

00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.980
I used to be a hot-shot
finance entrepreneur.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.827
Now I'm going to be
Mr. Transformation.

00:31:06.827 --> 00:31:07.910
I'm going to write a book.

00:31:07.910 --> 00:31:09.250
I'm going to get on
the speaker circuit.

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.670
I'm going to get on "Oprah."

00:31:10.670 --> 00:31:13.520
I'm going to show the world the
master of the universe I really

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.870
am.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.030
And I still had this
beautiful teacher.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:19.460
And I walked in to see her to
tell her all my grand plans.

00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:24.250
And she said, you are
an arrogant egomaniac.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.700
I said, I know.

00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.140
I'm working on it.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.397
She said, working on what?

00:31:28.397 --> 00:31:29.480
Have you learned anything?

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.935
I'm surprised your head
even got through the door.

00:31:31.935 --> 00:31:33.440
And I got pissed off at her.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.067
I said, let me
tell you something.

00:31:35.067 --> 00:31:35.900
I'm living on fumes.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.190
I got to make a living.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:39.680
I'm getting slaughtered
on Google Search.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.230
I have got to rebuild
my reputation.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.940
My wife is furious with me.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.310
I've destroyed our
financial future.

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:49.640
She's horrified of whether I'll
be able to provide to my wife

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.980
and kids in the future.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.560
And when I can get
my butt out of bed

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.950
and I look in the mirror, I
can't stand the guy that I see.

00:31:58.950 --> 00:32:00.710
So you tell me, oh wise one.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:02.700
What should I do?

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.360
And she said,
there's one solution

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.395
to all of those problems.

00:32:07.395 --> 00:32:08.120
I said, great.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:08.970
Tell me.

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.208
What do you think it is?

00:32:11.208 --> 00:32:11.750
I don't know.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:13.760
You want me to go be in
service more to people?

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:14.677
She said, that's good.

00:32:14.677 --> 00:32:16.370
But that's not it.

00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:20.762
You want me to go apologize and
kind of reconstruct the debt?

00:32:20.762 --> 00:32:21.470
That's good, too.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:22.850
But that's not it.

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:24.110
I said, I don't know.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:28.930
She said, it starts with an
H. I said, I still don't know.

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:33.070
She said, humility, Mikael.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:37.550
You must understand
the nature of humility.

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:41.130
It is where all
of your power is.

00:32:41.130 --> 00:32:45.130
And when she said that, it
was like every cell in my body

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:48.130
just relaxed because
now I could stop

00:32:48.130 --> 00:32:51.490
all of the cleverness
and manipulation trying

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:55.480
to cover up that
sense of inadequacy

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.300
that the boy inside
was still feeling.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:02.830
Now I could stop trying so
hard to be somebody I wasn't.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:06.250
And I learned that humility
lives on this continuum.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:10.270
On one side, you have ego
and arrogance and pride.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:13.180
And on the other side,
you have low self-esteem,

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.080
feelings of unworthiness,
feelings of inadequacy,

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.180
which we all have
at time to time.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.030
And so I learned that I came
from that insecure, inadequate

00:33:22.030 --> 00:33:23.820
place based on my childhood.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.630
And I pulled myself into ego.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.220
I'm going to build a
billion-dollar fund.

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:30.340
Then I went back
into low self-esteem.

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:34.330
Then I could shift myself
back into pride and ego.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:39.460
And I learned that humility is
this divine middle ground where

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.660
we're not better than anybody.

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.930
And we're not
worse than anybody.

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.420
You've got nothing
to be proud of.

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:49.570
And you've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:54.430
Humility is
acceptance of what is.

00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:59.200
It is service from a
place of compassion.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:04.770
Humility is the master key that
unlocks the bondage of ego.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:06.520
Because if you're not
better than anybody,

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.660
and you're not
worse than anybody,

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.350
and you've got nothing
to be ashamed of,

00:34:09.350 --> 00:34:11.683
and you've got nothing to be
proud of, what do you have?

00:34:11.683 --> 00:34:13.263
What's available to you?

00:34:13.263 --> 00:34:15.940
Everything, right?

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.920
Possibility.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.303
But without that, we often
toggle back and forth

00:34:21.303 --> 00:34:22.345
in our own inner prisons.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:29.170
She went on to tell
me that my problem was

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:33.639
that I look at situations,
circumstances, and events

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:37.510
to use them to fill myself up.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.880
And she said, you got to
flip that on its head.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:44.530
You need a transformation to a
service-oriented consciousness.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.940
You got to look inside
and say, what do I have?

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.300
What are my gifts
and talents that I

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.139
can use to be in
service to other people?

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:54.960
She said, what did
you learn in prison?

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.650
I said, I learned to serve.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:59.740
She said, take that
service into your life,

00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:01.810
into all of your life.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.960
Give up the desire for the
fancy this and the fancy

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:08.590
that and the house and
the suits and the cars

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:13.810
and the towers of Babel
and just be simple.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:19.120
Peace and fulfillment
live in simplicity.

00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:25.960
Simple, focus, heart--
that is your essence.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:29.380
Let that essence be your guide.

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:33.460
So I finally started to have
some of that wisdom sink

00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:34.800
into my skull.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:41.050
And as a result of a lot of
hard work and good fortune,

00:35:41.050 --> 00:35:44.230
I say through no virtue of my
own, I still have my marriage.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:48.016
We're going to be celebrating
our 25th anniversary in May.

00:35:48.016 --> 00:35:52.500
I try to show up for my kids and
be a loving presence for them.

00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.070
And one's in university.

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:55.260
One's going to university.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.910
So they seem to be no
high-risk behavior.

00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:59.740
They seem to be OK.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:04.840
In my job, I work with
leaders and leadership teams,

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.780
helping, them grow through
challenge and change,

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:10.030
grow through transformation
like I went through

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:11.680
so that they can
be more effective

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:14.270
and fulfilled in
their daily lives.

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.715
And I offered to tell
my story to students.

00:36:16.715 --> 00:36:19.090
I wanted to go out to students
and tell them so that they

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:21.430
don't make these same mistakes.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:24.820
And after one guest lecture,
I got hired on faculty

00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.700
to a major university to
teach ethics and finance

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.300
to an MBA program, which
is the prison to professor

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:33.130
in five years.

00:36:33.130 --> 00:36:38.710
Miracles, total-- I didn't
architect a recovery

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:40.870
and a career rehabilitation.

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:45.550
All I did was I stayed
steadfast in my practice

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.790
to serve with an open heart.

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.780
My life unfolded
beautifully and organically

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:55.450
when I redefined success--

00:36:55.450 --> 00:37:01.840
redefined success-- as an act of
continuously working on myself

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.110
and being in service
to other people.

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:07.690
It's 14 years, and it
seems to have worked.

00:37:07.690 --> 00:37:09.400
And I'll tell you,
I still shift back.

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.650
I have this alter ego I
call Slick Mickey, where

00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:15.110
I want to do deals, want to
make money, all of these things.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.950
But I got to stay mindful
that that's not a scorecard

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.290
that I consciously chose.

00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:22.750
That is a scorecard
that I adopted

00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:26.410
from a society that has
me chasing and grasping

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.060
my entire life.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.228
Psychologists call it
"hedonic adaptation,"

00:37:30.228 --> 00:37:31.270
or the hedonic treadmill.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:32.770
We want to get that job,
want to get that salary,

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:34.180
want to get that house,
want to get that spouse.

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.800
Whatever it is, we get it.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:39.190
We adapt, feel empty,
miserable, set the new goal,

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:42.850
adapt, empty, miserable,
on this perpetual cycle

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:44.800
of dissatisfaction.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.810
And that was my story.

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:50.150
I work hard, be successful,
achieve, make money,

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:51.880
then I'll be happy.

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.890
That formula for me--

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:57.280
and as far as I see, many
other people-- didn't work.

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:59.140
So there's another way.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.700
I'll leave you with this.

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:04.585
The sum of my experience
has taught me--

00:38:04.585 --> 00:38:06.460
first of all, I'm not
saying there's anything

00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:07.690
wrong with achievement.

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:09.910
I'm not saying there's
anything wrong with working

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.520
hard and having nice things.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.120
What I'm saying is, if we
make that our sole focus--

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.480
achievement and
material things--

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.800
we set ourselves up to be
vulnerable to those three

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.650
great forces that rule the
world-- stupidity, fear,

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:27.520
and greed.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.100
And at best, we feel empty.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:31.820
We can feel empty at
the end of our lives.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:34.120
So what I'm saying
is, if we recalibrate

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.390
that focus and put some of
our energy and intention

00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:43.150
into developing who we are as
a people, cultivating virtues,

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:46.750
and then when we act
from that balanced place,

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:49.330
then we're in a position
to really create

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:52.810
an enduring sense of
value for ourselves,

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:56.920
for our organizations, for our
communities, for our families,

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.690
and ultimately for the world.

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:02.050
And so if any of this
resonates with you,

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:05.470
my invitation is to take
a little bit of today

00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:06.820
and just reflect.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.360
How focused are
you on achievement?

00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:13.438
And how focused are you
on cultivating virtue?

00:39:13.438 --> 00:39:14.980
And if it feels
right, maybe you want

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.180
to recalibrate a little bit.

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:21.010
And with that, I thank you so
much for giving me your time

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:22.990
and allowing me to come
here and serve you.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.980
Thank you.

00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:31.380
I'll take any questions.

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.908
I'm an open book.

00:39:32.908 --> 00:39:33.450
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:35.370
Thanks for the talk.

00:39:35.370 --> 00:39:37.410
What are your
tactics or strategies

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:40.680
in your day to day when you
feel yourself slipping back

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:41.997
to-- what was it, Slick Mickey?

00:39:41.997 --> 00:39:43.080
MIKAEL MEIR: Slick Mickey.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.270
AUDIENCE: Get yourself
back to the middle.

00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.660
Thank you.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.930
MIKAEL MEIR: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:50.010
Well, I would say
it's a practice.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:54.180
So it's a practice
of deep mindfulness.

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:58.410
It's being really aware of
mental emotional reaction

00:39:58.410 --> 00:39:59.580
patterns.

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.990
It's being really aware of what
happens in my physical body

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:06.420
and when tension comes up.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:13.200
And with that awareness,
coming into three deep breaths,

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.910
stimulates the
vagus nerve, which

00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:18.040
is command central for the
parasympathetic nervous system,

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.590
which releases
neurotransmitter--

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:21.000
that's like Valium.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.920
Three deep breaths--
best tool in the world.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:29.130
And then from those three deep
breaths, refocus awareness

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:30.450
to, what is my purpose?

00:40:30.450 --> 00:40:32.640
And where are my real values?

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:36.060
So it's kind of
like, recalibrate.

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.770
Get conscious.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:40.260
Check in with value system.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:42.810
Make choice, I would say.

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:43.710
Thanks.

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.430
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for sharing your journey.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:46.388
MIKAEL MEIR: Thank you.

00:40:46.388 --> 00:40:48.720
AUDIENCE: Initially,
you asked a question.

00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.610
One of the premises
was, if there was

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:52.780
no chance of getting caught.

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.505
I'm not sure how
germane that is.

00:40:54.505 --> 00:40:56.130
One sees people doing
things, even when

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:58.672
there's every chance of getting
caught, and they still do it.

00:40:58.672 --> 00:41:01.620
I'm thinking of the recent
college admissions scandal

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:02.550
and whatnot.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:03.938
What's your take on?

00:41:03.938 --> 00:41:05.480
MIKAEL MEIR: On the
college admissi--

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.938
AUDIENCE: Or just the fact that
people will do these things

00:41:07.938 --> 00:41:10.355
even when there seems to be
every chance of getting caught

00:41:10.355 --> 00:41:11.572
from the outside perspective.

00:41:11.572 --> 00:41:13.280
What leads people to
do things like that?

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.280
MIKAEL MEIR: Yeah, yeah.

00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.830
You know, not to be
overly simplistic,

00:41:17.830 --> 00:41:20.400
but I think this kind of
goes to the essence of greed.

00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:24.810
And it may not be just greed
for money, but greed for I

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:28.410
want my kids to have
a certain image.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:31.500
And I'm prepared to cross
ethical boundaries in order

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:32.220
to get that.

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.620
And I have such a
sense of entitlement

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:40.040
that I can actually pull this
off that I'm going to do it.

00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:47.840
So there's almost like this
delusion that people live in.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.340
They don't acknowledge that,
well, my kid's going to get in.

00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:52.200
Maybe they're not going to
be the brightest student.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.700
And maybe they're
going to fail out.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:58.530
Or even when they
graduate, then what?

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:02.220
And what are the
ramifications of making

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.590
them think that they have
a level of capability

00:42:04.590 --> 00:42:06.340
that they don't really have?

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.850
And what does that do to their
mental health down the line?

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:13.590
So I would say it's
still a derivative

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:18.090
of that voracious, self-centered
wanting without really thinking

00:42:18.090 --> 00:42:21.500
about, hey, what are the
consequences of these choices?

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.000
Thank you.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.018
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:23.018 --> 00:42:24.310
So thanks again for being here.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:25.935
You mentioned at the
beginning that you

00:42:25.935 --> 00:42:27.730
believe character is malleable.

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:28.340
And I agree.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:31.360
I think that people
can really change.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.900
But there's also
a line somewhere.

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:35.608
And there are things that people
would consider unforgivable.

00:42:35.608 --> 00:42:37.900
And it sounds like you were
able to receive forgiveness

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.820
from the people closest to you.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:42.285
But I wonder how you
think about that line

00:42:42.285 --> 00:42:44.410
and if there were others
who refused to forgive you

00:42:44.410 --> 00:42:46.360
and how you think about that.

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:47.110
MIKAEL MEIR: Yeah.

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:47.720
Thank you.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:48.887
Thank you for that question.

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:53.545
I'll tell you, the
biggest challenge for me

00:42:53.545 --> 00:42:54.420
was forgiving myself.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.110
Once I could come into a deeper
place of self-forgiveness--

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:05.370
because we're not talking about
a 2 out of 10 on the stake.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.540
It's like a pretty
serious mistake.

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:10.710
Once I could get to that
self-forgiveness place,

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.730
what other people thought
mattered less and less.

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:16.590
When I didn't
forgive myself, there

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:19.210
was some self-loathing in there.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:20.910
You're such a-- how could you--

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:22.410
all of that stuff.

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:24.630
When other people
didn't forgive me

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:27.810
or had a negative opinion
of me, it really hurt.

00:43:27.810 --> 00:43:30.040
It would kind of go to the gut.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:33.570
But self-forgiveness
is-- it's a journey.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:37.740
But once I get there
and I understand that--

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:38.840
I'm a human being.

00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:39.790
I'm imperfect.

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.120
I make mistakes.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.210
I am unconscious, more conscious
than I was in the past.

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:47.970
But I have a certain
level of consciousness.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.410
And I'm on a certain journey.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:51.600
And everybody else is, too.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.730
So I judge people less.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:54.780
And I mean, listen.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:56.820
I've done this talk a few times.

00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:02.378
I did it to a whole huge room
of type-A investment bankers.

00:44:02.378 --> 00:44:03.920
And people are like,
are you serious?

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:06.720
Are you really going
to walk into that?

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.273
And they were actually great.

00:44:09.273 --> 00:44:11.940
But there were people that said,
hey, this guy is still a crook.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.220
Yeah, people don't change.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:17.550
I saw that more
as him projecting

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:22.930
his own issues and his
own sense of guilt on me.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:24.300
And I just say, you know what?

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:27.270
You can have your opinion,
because I know the truth.

00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:29.508
Every day, I made some mistakes.

00:44:29.508 --> 00:44:30.300
But you know, look.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.757
We get up in the morning.

00:44:31.757 --> 00:44:33.090
We look ourselves in the mirror.

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:40.070
We say, was I the best
husband, son, friend, employee?

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:41.610
It was the best I can be.

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:42.908
That's all we can do.

00:44:42.908 --> 00:44:44.200
So thank you for your question.

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:44.867
I appreciate it.

00:44:44.867 --> 00:44:45.660
Yeah.

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:47.910
AUDIENCE: So my
question is about if--

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:50.430
how do you see people having
their aha moment if they

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.260
don't have a low like you had?

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.360
I mean, yours was pretty
impactful in your life.

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:56.922
So if that hadn't
happened to you,

00:44:56.922 --> 00:44:58.380
if you hadn't gotten
caught, do you

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.590
think you would have eventually
come to this conclusion?

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:05.952
And for people who want to have
this level of enlightenment,

00:45:05.952 --> 00:45:07.410
how do they come
to that conclusion

00:45:07.410 --> 00:45:09.500
if they don't have a rock
bottom that they hit?

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:10.170
MIKAEL MEIR: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:11.020
Thank you for that.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:11.520
Yeah.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:15.750
Well, hopefully they can
learn from numbskulls like me,

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:19.050
which is why I'll do this
talk anywhere, anytime, don't

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:19.652
have to pay.

00:45:19.652 --> 00:45:22.110
I just want to help people so
that they can-- because there

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.865
are people that do
have transformation

00:45:23.865 --> 00:45:25.320
after I tell the
story, depending

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:30.210
on where they are in their
particular life journey.

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:33.480
My theory-- and this is a
bit of a spiritual theory--

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:36.510
is that life gives us warnings.

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:39.780
And it's up to us to
be sensitive to some

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.460
of the nuances.

00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:44.460
And I've heard the analogy
that sometimes life will

00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.090
drop a feather on our shoulder.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:49.020
And if we don't
acknowledge the feather,

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:53.760
it turns into a pebble,
a rock, a bigger rock.

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:56.940
Apparently I had such a thick
skull, I got the boulder.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:58.402
But I think that
there are signs.

00:45:58.402 --> 00:45:59.610
I think that there are signs.

00:45:59.610 --> 00:46:03.940
And I believe that everybody's
got this journey in life.

00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:07.080
And there's lessons
that they have to learn.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:12.330
And in some ways, it's almost
like a flower doesn't blossom

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:17.460
in nature until all of the
conditions surrounding it

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:18.690
are just right.

00:46:18.690 --> 00:46:21.960
I think human transformation
works in that same way.

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.700
We can water the soil.

00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:24.390
We can nurture.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:25.770
We can do all of these things.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.940
But there's a certain mystery,
as there is in nature.

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:31.950
And until that unfolding
is ready to happen,

00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:33.943
it can't happen.

00:46:33.943 --> 00:46:35.610
Well, thank you very
much for having me.

00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:38.660
[APPLAUSE]
