Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh my God, you guys, I have to tell you this story. So I'm flying. So I do an episode of Kroll show. Um, and always working with necro. You're guaranteed you're gonna laugh your ass off. I'll fucking bet. Can I kiss the kid's ass any? I fucking love him. I think he's, I think he's a fucking genius. So anyways, um, I go,

Speaker 1:          00:22          I go to the airport and I'm taking the red eye, taking this 10 55 flight, nine fucking stop. Cause that's how I do it. All right. I'm on a good plane. Why would I want to get off it and switch and roll the dice and get on another one? You know, let's just fucking get there. When I drive up to San Francisco, I don't pull over and fucking Burbank and then get hit. No another car. We get it built. All right? So I get on the fucking plane, right? I use my miles, bumped myself up like a fancy person. You know, maybe, maybe I invented the cheesecake factory. People are thinking and then they see how I'm dressed and I go, oh no, he didn't vent the cheesecake factory. Um, and I go to go to sit down on my seat and I go to set my bag down.

Speaker 1:          01:10          I was going to set it down right in front of me. And the nice fellow sit next to me. He goes, why don't you stick it in the middle of this room? And he moved his bag out of the way. I'm like, all right, this guy's a solid dude or whatever. And then all of a sudden the waitress comes by as stewardess, whatever. She comes by, a flight attendant, whatever the fuck you supposed to call them. She comes up and she's, uh, can I get you jealous with Drake? And I was like, yeah, can I get out? Let me get a water please. I sir. No ice. What? However you make it. Stop acting like it's a fucking Martini. It's war, right? Just give me a water with ice. Thank you. Um, and the, the guy next to me, he orders it. Doers. Neat. No ice, no nothing.

Speaker 1:          01:50          Just put it in there so they bring our drinks, all right. And I'm really thirsty. So I start sucking mine down and he just throws his back. Like it's nothing like fucking John Wayne right before he's going to turn around and beat up three guys, three moustachioed guys in the 1930s. Right? So, um, I'm just sitting there and everybody's getting on the flight, you know, when I'm looking around at the passengers, you know, fucking doing whatever I'm doing and all of a sudden the guy next to me, Mr Doers goes to me, uh, he goes, excuse me? He goes, are you afraid to fly? And I looked at and I was like, what? He goes, are you afraid to fly? And I go, no, no, I'm not. And he goes, he goes, all right, but you know, it's [inaudible]. He goes, it's okay. You know, it's okay to tell me if you're afraid to fly.

Speaker 2:          02:43          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:45          And it's immediately getting weird. And I'm like, no, I'm not afraid to fly. And, and I'm thinking in my head, wait, is he afraid to fly? And that's why he's drinking the way he just drank. And now he's hoping that I'm going to be afraid to fly. So, you know, he just wants to open up. That's what I'm thinking. And I got, I'm like, yeah, no, I'm not afraid to fly and he won't leave it alone. He goes, all right, cause you know, you're, you're, you're fidgeting, you're looking around at other passengers. And I'm just sitting there looking at it like, is this guy fucking serious? And I go, no. I go, I'm not afraid to fly. So now I'm like, fuck this guy. I'm not talking scaffold rest of the flight. This guy's weird man. It's like 30, just get painted pictures like 32 year old wirey in shape, but like, why are we white dude?

Speaker 1:          03:35          He's got a skully cap on with fucking glasses. Um, [inaudible] you know, and uh, he goes, uh, like there's like a minute of silence and people still getting on the plane and then he goes, hey, sorry about that. So we, we just, we just got off on the wrong foot. He's like, my name is so and so. He goes, what's your name? And then I'm thinking in my head like, what's my name? My name is frank. I wanted to give him like a f by just some reason I just wanted it's bill. And he goes, Oh hey bill. And he goes, nice to meet you. So we shake hands and I'm just looking at, I don't have any poker face. I'm looking at the guy like, what the fuck is your problem? I'm not even trying to not, I'm not trying to be pleasant. I'm already done with this guy. So then the guy goes, oh hey bill. He goes, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right? Like he's fucking interrogating me and I, I'm like, is this guy fucking serious? And I start doing the math in my head going, when is this guy like an Air Marshall or something? And I'm like, no, he's not. He's fucking slamming Bose over here. Fuck this guy. So I just go, I go, look, I don't, I don't have to answer your questions.

Speaker 1:          04:49          That's it. And I just looked straight forward [inaudible] he goes, okay, now I'm concerned. Okay. I am concerned and I'm looking at, I'm like concerned about what he goes, you're fidgeting your, you, you, you have issues with other passengers and blah blah blah blah. He's such a Peyton like, like this. Like he's been, I don't know what the fuck like psychologically breaking me down. All right, so now just by this point they've closed the fucking the door to the fuselage and we're starting to taxi

Speaker 1:          05:22          and I just finally looked at the guy and I go, I go, you know I came up with the fight one point. I literally stick my hand out cause he kept saying I was nervous and I stick my hand right in front of his face and I hold it level. Oh that's what I did the first time. Yeah. I hold that level. I go, I'm not nervous. Then he goes, well not anybody can do that. And that's when I was like, fuck this guy. I'm not talking to the guy. Sorry. Fuck this story up. Then Denny Denny came back, got my name. Now he's going, why are you going to Indianapolis? And I find, look at them. I say, listen pal, I'm drinking waters. You're drinking doers. Okay, there's no issue over here. And then he goes, it wasn't doers. What she gave me wasn't doers really.

Speaker 1:          06:03          What was it? Some sort of spy juice. You fucking jerk off this point. I want to punch him right through his fucking stupid wirey glasses, right? So he's going like, you look around hostels. And I said something that just ticked him off. I was like, yeah, dude. I go, I don't have to answer your questions. All right, leave me alone. And then he goes, uh, he goes to egos. He starts going like, okay, now I am really concerned right now. He goes, why are you going to Indianapolis? And I just look at him, you know, when I start doing, I start doing like this Ryan Gosling, you know that little Smirk, that fucking Mano Lisa Smile. He has his, he smirks his way through all his fucking movies. I do go, I go full on Ryan Gosling. Now I'm not talking to this guy and I just keep looking at him and I gave him that little half of smirk and I just shake my head.

Speaker 1:          06:48          That's my game. Now that's, this is my gets like, if you're going to be a Dick Right now with your fucking delusional authority, right? That you're going to see like we're in fucking Guantanamo and you're going to waterboard me. Huh? There's no water, there's no board. Go Fuck Yourself. Here's my smart and I'm just going to shake my head at you like you're a fucking pathetic human being. This is what I'm doing. Alright? And this is the funny thing. I'm such a Dick. All I have to say to the guys, I'm a comedian, I'm going to do a sold out show there and that would make them back off, but I'm a dick. I'm like, fuck this guy. I want to see where this is going. So now he's all fucking amped up and he starts droppingF , you know he's saying the f word. He sitting there going, if you don't, he goes, you don't fucking answer my question by fucking now I'm going to hit that call button.

Speaker 1:          07:32          We're sitting there taxiing down and fucking getting in line. I'm going to fucking hit this fucking button if you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and I'm just fucking monoliths to smile smart into shaking my head like you are a fucking retard, right? So now he sees saying the efforts so much the way who sitting in front of me diagonally in front, right in front of him, turns around and looks at us and now my heart's racing. I'm like, where's this going? This is going to be great. I am 100% fucking innocent. This guy's drunk and I think he's going to hit that button. Oh, I've got a feeling he's going to hit that button. What's going to happen? Right? I want to see what the pilot looks like. Let's see where the fuck this is going. Right? So he goes, you don't fuck you. He starts eating.

Speaker 1:          08:13          He starts bringing his hand up to the button going, I'm going to hit that button. You don't have to go fucking do it. I'll hit that button and I'm sitting there smirking and I'm thinking in my head, go ahead and hit the fucking button. Let's see what happens. Let's see what happens. Right. So filing now he wants to hit the button and he can't fucking find it and it's an in defense of him. I couldn't find it either. I was looking up there, I half wanted to hit it myself. Then he finally, he finally finds it and he hits it right? And now I'm just like, Holy Shit, what's going to happen? And he sitting there going, yeah, Huh, you want to fucking play this game and you want to fucking play this game. And I was surprised. I mean it took like fucking like 30 seconds before a flight attendant, the one who gave him the booze, which evidently wasn't booze comes over.

Speaker 1:          08:55          And at this point we're like doing that shit where we're behind a plane, we're almost ready to take off, like we're pulling up and then stop and pull it up, then stop in as planes take taken off. So she goes, yeah, what's the problem? Over here. And he goes, ah, I'm not comfortable to fly with this guy. This guy, he's fidgeting, he's looking around at other fucking people, but blah, blah, blah, blah. He's doing all this thing, right. And then the stewardess looks at me and I'm just sitting there fucking my little smart, just shaking my head. And I just looking at this dude just shaking my head like, this guy's out of his fucking mind. I don't say a word. And this guy goes on and on and on about his fucking psychobabble, about how I'm the security risk. So she goes to the, so she goes, okay. Um, any other passengers? Have you noticed anything? She talked to anybody first-class at this point.

Speaker 1:          09:45          Does anybody noticed anything odd about this guy? And The lady who was sitting right in front of the dude diagonally from me turns around. She goes, yeah, I've been listening to this guy brew right, Berating this other passenger. She's on my side and I haven't said a fucking word. This is great. And I'm just sitting there smirking. Then the let students looks at me and I shrugged my shoulders like, I don't know what to tell you. So finally she said, sir, do you have anything to add to this? And I just said, I look, I'm just a guy trying to go to Indianapolis. This guy over here, he starts slamming his doors. I kind of felt like a rat when I said that. He goes, he's slamming his doors. Next thing you know, he's dropping the F bomb to me. Then I'm thinking, oh fuck.

Speaker 1:          10:27          I just said bomb, right. Fortunately nothing happens. So now another fucking, the male stewardess comes over right now. He's going like, what's going on? And the captain of the fucking now at this point, we pulled over and the plane has stopped. 250 people trying to get to Indianapolis and jerk off over here. Can't hold his fucking alcohol. Who just watched a person of interest every, every, I guess, evidently I have no fucking idea. Now the plane is stopped. His fucking jerk off his, stopped the plane interrogating a Goddamn comedian. Like I'm in the fucking Taliban and like he works for the CIA, right? So now we're just sitting there,

Speaker 2:          11:11          okay.

Speaker 1:          11:12          And the captain is up front in the plane, like saying to the stewards is going basically relaying, do I really have to fucking come back there? This is the last flight in the night. Is there really a God damn problem? And that was the vibe. And they finally said to the [inaudible], sit next to me, are you going to be okay to fly with him? And at that point it appeased his fucking ego that he was somehow in control. And he goes like, you know what? Okay, it's fine. It's fine. It'll be fine. It'll be fun. So they go, okay. So now the plane's going again and now we're now we fucking come around and he's sitting there fucking, he's in my ear. And at this point I am laugh, like to fucking laugh. You hear me doing the podcast? That's what I'm doing. And he's sitting there going, I, he goes, you don't, I'm glad.

Speaker 1:          11:59          I'm glad you, I hope he fucking do. I hope you fucking try something. I'll be fucking try something when we're up there. I really hope you fucking try something. And I'm just fucking like God, Boston laughing. Shake him at like, what are you gonna fucking do to me? What are you gonna do to me? How are you going to punch me in the face? You fucking wirey jacket with your fucking glasses on. You know, that's a federal offense. You're going to go to jail if you do that or something. I don't know what. Right. So I'm just in a fucking laughing at the guy going, I actually, at one point I put my fucking little eye pillow thing on, you know, like I'm going to sleep. I had that out too when the store, this was talking to me, I was like putting it on is this total mind fuck.

Speaker 1:          12:40          Like I don't know what this guy is. I'm just trying to go on to Indianapolis. I'm going to sleep. And um, so I got, I got my fucking eye thing on right as he sitting there threatening me, just, I was going with total passive aggressive. It's like, dude, I'm so not concerned with you. I'm literally putting a blindfold on. Alright, so this fucking guy, like he starts going, he goes, yeah. He goes, you think you fucking won this, you fucking won this. He goes, Mike, you know my dad is my dad. He started saying his dad's some major CEO in Indianapolis. Does it sound like a fucking made up story? I swear to God, this is all true. He Goes, Mike, my dad is a major CEO in Indianapolis in La. Have you fucking arrested? And The lady turns around again, how have you fucking arrested the second weekend on the ground?

Speaker 1:          13:23          I'm thinking like, for what? For what? Sitting here, you fucking lose her. Learn how to hold your alcohol. Right? And he starts describing the view that I'm going to have when I go to jail, like some fucking law and order episode. Oh, you're gonna love it. You'll be able to see Lucas oil field and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I'm just sitting here cracking up laughing and then there's this pause, right? And I'm thinking finally he finally shut the fuck up. It's like a three, four minute pause. He finally just gave up because I wasn't giving him anything. I was just laughing and shaking my head. I was being a dick to him. I was cause I was enjoying it and then there was like a three minute pause and then all of a sudden he just goes, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill?

Speaker 3:          14:09          Okay

Speaker 1:          14:12          so we're like 20 minutes into the flight and am I going to be honest, he was, my adrenaline was so going during all of that because I knew I didn't do anything wrong, but I thought we were literally going to go back and it was going to be fucking cops there. And they like if, if, if, if the fucking stewardess or the pilot asked me who I am and where I'm going, I'm going to tell him I respect your authority. You're just some, Gee I don't, you don't have any fucking authority. I don't have to answer your questions. It was pro was one of the most fun experiences I've ever had with another human. Like when somebody thinks that they have power and you know they don't and all they can do is try just keep bluffing and raising their voice and start cursing at you. And if you just start laughing at them, the look on their face is fucking priceless.

Speaker 4:          15:07          So

Speaker 1:          15:10          the last thing he said, he said, why are you going to Indianapolis Bill? Right. And I fucking started howling. Just fucking holding my stomach, shaking my head.

Speaker 4:          15:20          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          15:20          And with my fucking eye pillow thing on right. And I know I'm going to get a ton of shit that I wear one of those, I fucking underrated. Get the one at Brookstone where it's literally a pillow. I'm telling you, you could fall asleep 12 noon facing the sun. It's awesome. So anyways, like after he, he asked me what, what, you know where you're going, Bill, you like there was like a 10 minute, like probably 10 minutes had gone by and I can't fucking sleep because it's so fun and in me, I can't wait to tell the story to every comic. I know. I can't wait to try it on stage to see if it's funny or whatever. Uh, so finally I just like got fuck it. Maybe I'll just get on my computer and I bring up my eye pillow and I like, I got to look at the guy cause I know he's fucking staring at me waiting for me to do something right. So I lift it up, I get my fucking Monalisa smiled going and I look over at the guy and dude, he is fucking passed out.

Speaker 2:          16:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          16:19          He looked like he got shot. He was sitting there like his head was just hanging straight down and anytime the plane move like his head was, I mean he, the way you got knocked out and for the rest of the fucking flight all fucking uh oh what's Matt Damon's character? Jack Ryan. Whole fucking Jack Ryan over here is just, you know the sky marshal, the fucking Bose bag and God knows what else he was on. He was just completely out passed out for the rest of the fucking flight. And this is why I'm on to Dick. I am, I was having so much fun with this guy. I start, I can't sleep, so I start slamming waters because I want to have to get up and take a piss just to see if this guy's going to freak out because this security risks is getting up. And this, the joke was on me, he never regained consciousness.

Speaker 1:          17:12          And then I really had to take a pest, but I'm such a stubborn fuck. I was holding it because I wanted to make sure he was awake when I got up, cause that was going to give him a little smirk and then I was going to get up CV at the call button again. Um, but he didn't, he didn't wake up til we hit the ground. And um, and then it's funny. Then he woke up and it was like four hours later, so now he'd kind of slept off whatever the fuck this guy was on.

Speaker 4:          17:39          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:39          And I'm sitting there smart and waiting for the guy to start talking to me. He won't look at me and I, and I think at that point he kind of fucking realized that maybe he got a little, uh, a little extra little too patriotic. So we stop, we stopped with the gate and everything and we're going to get up. So I grabbed my shit. I get up and I'm just kinda looking at him and he won't look at me. And then the lady who was sitting in front of me had this big smile on her face. She goes, hi. She goes, I don't, I don't want good. I go that I go, that was an interesting one. And I said it really loud. So the guy heard, and he didn't say anything, and t this is what he did to try to save face. His pillow was kinda stuck behind, was kind of stuck behind his shoulder and like a weird place. So he was frustrated with it. So he ripped it out from behind him and kind of threw it down on the floor, went [inaudible] like tried to do some caveman grunt to try to still have some sort of, I don't know what. So, so that was my flight to Indianapolis people. Um, how far into the fucking podcast are we? That was a long, that was a long fucking story.
