00:00:00.772 --> 00:00:03.145
- [Instructor] Last video,
we end with the conquests

00:00:03.145 --> 00:00:06.369
of Alexander the Great,
how he's able to conquer

00:00:06.369 --> 00:00:10.029
most of the map that we see right up here,

00:00:10.029 --> 00:00:14.336
especially from Greece all the
way through the Middle East

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:18.503
through Persia and getting
to the borders of India.

00:00:19.677 --> 00:00:22.264
Conquering Egypt as well.

00:00:22.264 --> 00:00:24.566
And we mentioned that he
had a very short life,

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:27.887
and after his death, his empire was split.

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:31.221
But coincident with that
time we have other powers

00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:34.301
in other parts of the
Mediterranean that are growing.

00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:38.877
Mainly the Romans, and Rome
was established several

00:00:38.877 --> 00:00:42.616
hundred years before the
time of Alexander the Great,

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:46.154
but by that time they're
starting to conquer more and more

00:00:46.154 --> 00:00:49.234
of the Italian peninsula right over here,

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:51.134
what we would now consider
the Italian peninsula.

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:55.301
You also have a power in
Carthage forming right over here

00:00:56.726 --> 00:00:58.829
on the north African coast.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.746
Carthage was initially
a Phoenician settlement.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.266
The Phoenicians, famous
for our phonetic alphabet.

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.940
The Phoenicians were based in what is now

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.033
modern day Lebanon and
Syria and they were traders

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:16.605
and they settled throughout
the Mediterranean.

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:20.772
And Carthage and the Carthaginian
power or civilization

00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:24.475
was a fairly significant one at this time.

00:01:24.475 --> 00:01:26.646
And you could imagine
when there are two powers

00:01:26.646 --> 00:01:28.470
that are close to each
other, they might want to be

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.119
going after the same interests
or conquest the same land,

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:32.995
or they might view each other as a threat,

00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:35.277
they tend to start fighting each other.

00:01:35.277 --> 00:01:38.517
And that is true of Rome and Carthage.

00:01:38.517 --> 00:01:40.297
And the wars that they fought,

00:01:40.297 --> 00:01:42.928
they were called the Punic
Wars, and they occurred

00:01:42.928 --> 00:01:45.261
between 264 BCE and 146 BCE.

00:01:50.518 --> 00:01:53.101
You have the Punic Wars, Punic.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:57.238
And once again, we will do
many videos on the Punic Wars,

00:01:57.238 --> 00:02:00.694
but these are the wars that
involved Hannibal famously

00:02:00.694 --> 00:02:05.220
taking elephants across the
Alps in order to attack Rome.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.461
And we see it right over
here on our little timeline.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:11.914
The Punic Wars between Carthage and Rome.

00:02:11.914 --> 00:02:16.234
And just to be clear, this
little purple shaded in

00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:19.590
on our timeline, that
represents the Carthage

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.421
and the Carthaginian civilization.

00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:24.345
I guess you could say power.

00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:26.345
And this is Rome.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:30.260
But eventually Rome wins
decisively and is actually able

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.454
to wipe out Carthage,
literally wipe it out.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:38.621
And so Rome more and more
is becoming the dominant

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:43.143
power in the Mediterranean,
and as you will see shortly,

00:02:43.143 --> 00:02:45.185
well beyond the Mediterranean.

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:48.594
In this period Rome is a republic.

00:02:48.594 --> 00:02:50.957
And when we talk about a
republic, we're talking about

00:02:50.957 --> 00:02:55.124
some type of representation,
although it's not the same form

00:02:56.326 --> 00:02:58.575
of representation that
we would think today.

00:02:58.575 --> 00:03:02.649
We would be talking some
form of preserving rights.

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:05.564
Once again, not exactly
as what we would do today.

00:03:05.564 --> 00:03:10.384
But as we get to the middle
of the first century BCE,

00:03:10.384 --> 00:03:13.206
we have a very successful Roman general,

00:03:13.206 --> 00:03:16.207
you might have heard
his name, Julius Caesar,

00:03:16.207 --> 00:03:19.252
who was able to take power of Rome,

00:03:19.252 --> 00:03:22.626
who was able to be the dictator of Rome.

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:26.209
And in power he starts
to end the republic,

00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:29.105
and he does many other things.

00:03:29.105 --> 00:03:30.835
He starts rearranging the calendar,

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:33.252
gets a month named after him, July,

00:03:33.252 --> 00:03:38.033
and then he gets assassinated
and his adopted son Augustus

00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:39.502
takes power.

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:43.511
And Augustus is often
considered to be the first true

00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:47.288
emperor of Rome, that
the republic is now over.

00:03:47.288 --> 00:03:51.179
And he, too, gets a month
named after him, August.

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:54.165
Now at around the same
time, you have another

00:03:54.165 --> 00:03:57.229
very significant figure that shows up,

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:01.237
and obviously Jesus is a
significant figure in religion,

00:04:01.237 --> 00:04:03.439
but that has effect on history.

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.869
His teachings are the basis of a religion

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:07.930
that's going to have profound consequences

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:11.053
for the rest of history, for the world.

00:04:11.053 --> 00:04:14.125
And even though we might
have this, you could say,

00:04:14.125 --> 00:04:16.025
the secular timeline of BCE,

00:04:16.025 --> 00:04:20.006
refers to before the common
era, or CE, the common era.

00:04:20.006 --> 00:04:23.231
Right now the year I'm
making this video is 2016 CE.

00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.907
Those are secular versions
of a calendar which is,

00:04:25.907 --> 00:04:27.929
essentially, centered on Jesus' birth

00:04:27.929 --> 00:04:30.277
or pretty close to Jesus' birth.

00:04:30.277 --> 00:04:32.839
Instead of BC, it would be before Christ.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:37.660
Instead of CE, we say AD, in
the year of our Lord in Latin.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.855
And Jesus, it's important
to note, because sometimes

00:04:40.855 --> 00:04:42.995
people might learn about the life of Jesus

00:04:42.995 --> 00:04:44.980
and they might think about the holy land

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.721
and Nazareth and Jerusalem
and whatever else,

00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:50.697
but it's important to
realize that at that time,

00:04:50.697 --> 00:04:54.053
Jesus was born and raised
and grew up and died

00:04:54.053 --> 00:04:56.419
as part of the Roman Empire.

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.821
In fact, when he was born,
which wasn't actually zero BCE,

00:04:59.821 --> 00:05:03.598
or zero we should just say,
year zero, we now think

00:05:03.598 --> 00:05:06.681
it was pretty close to 4 BCE or 4 BC.

00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:11.215
So he was born in the reign of Augustus

00:05:11.215 --> 00:05:15.047
and he died in the reign of Tiberius.

00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:18.178
So some of the first Roman emperors.

00:05:18.178 --> 00:05:20.339
So with that, we have our overview

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.018
of especially ancient civilization.

00:05:23.018 --> 00:05:25.353
And in the next few
videos, or many vidoes,

00:05:25.353 --> 00:05:28.536
we will go deeper and drill
deep into each of these topics

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.606
that we referred to, but
hopefully the last few videos

00:05:30.606 --> 00:05:33.684
give you a high-level
view of what was happening

00:05:33.684 --> 00:05:36.871
in the world both in
terms of time and space
