00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.042
So we see now how to transform a couple of different equations to this new form,

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.045
which is really helpful for us in certain ways. But there are a lot of different

00:00:08.045 --> 00:00:12.142
equations for parabolas that don't look just like these two. In particular, what

00:00:12.142 --> 00:00:16.296
if our equation doesn't have a leading coefficient of 1? Leading coefficient

00:00:16.296 --> 00:00:19.950
here, refers to the coefficient in front of the x squared term, the term with

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.790
the highest power. In both of these situations, that coefficient is 1, which we

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.734
know makes factoring a lot simpler, and presumably, also changes how we complete

00:00:27.734 --> 00:00:33.002
the square. In fact, recall the equation that we came up with as our final

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:39.032
equation, for calculating Grant's profit based on the price that he charges per

00:00:39.032 --> 00:00:43.827
glasses wiper set. Last lesson we had p equals negative 200 c squared, plus

00:00:43.827 --> 00:00:48.447
18,400c, minus 133,200, here our leading coefficient is negative 200, that's

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:52.956
certainly not equal to 1. If we want to find out exactly where the vertex of

00:00:52.956 --> 00:00:57.263
this equation is, we're going to need to get this in that new form, using

00:00:57.263 --> 00:01:02.004
completing the square. Well, we'll get to solving this eventually, but for now

00:01:02.004 --> 00:01:06.477
I'd like us to start out with a equation similar to this, and that its leading

00:01:06.477 --> 00:01:11.092
coefficient is not 1, and over through that, to eventually be able to deal with

00:01:11.092 --> 00:01:15.620
the Grant situation. Here I've graphed the equations y equals x squared, that

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.036
parent parabola we've seen so many times, and then a second parabola y equals

00:01:20.036 --> 00:01:24.534
three x squared, this green one right here. So judging from the relationship

00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:29.078
between these two graphs, how does multiplying the leading coefficient of a

00:01:29.078 --> 00:01:33.942
parabola change the shape of the parabola? Does it shift it vertically, shift it

00:01:33.942 --> 00:01:37.148
horizontally, make it wider, or make it more narrow?
