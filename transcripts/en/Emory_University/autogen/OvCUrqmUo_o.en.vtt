enormous complexity of how these errors
 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.680
enormous complexity of how these errors
occur you can have an error that occurs

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690
occur you can have an error that occurs
 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.120
occur you can have an error that occurs
and yet it doesn't necessarily have to

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130
and yet it doesn't necessarily have to
 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:34.120
and yet it doesn't necessarily have to
harm somebody it's it's the harm causing

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130
harm somebody it's it's the harm causing
 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.560
harm somebody it's it's the harm causing
air as though that should really and

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570
air as though that should really and
 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.060
air as though that should really and
dramatically attract our attention

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070
dramatically attract our attention
 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.370
dramatically attract our attention
although any error really really should

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380
although any error really really should
 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.740
although any error really really should
for that matter so that's that's that's

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750
for that matter so that's that's that's
 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.740
for that matter so that's that's that's
one set of issues that we have to do in

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750
one set of issues that we have to do in
 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.360
one set of issues that we have to do in
terms of training but the other one I

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370
terms of training but the other one I
 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.249
terms of training but the other one I
think that you were talking about is how

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259
think that you were talking about is how
 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.860
think that you were talking about is how
do we develop a sense of conscience in

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870
do we develop a sense of conscience in
 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.629
do we develop a sense of conscience in
health care professionals and it cannot

begin to early I mean I can give a
 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:57.399
begin to early I mean I can give a
lecture to third year medical students

00:04:57.399 --> 00:04:57.409
lecture to third year medical students
 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.620
lecture to third year medical students
about the need to be frank and honest

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630
about the need to be frank and honest
 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.149
about the need to be frank and honest
and ethical and transparent and blah

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:01.159
and ethical and transparent and blah
 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:02.770
and ethical and transparent and blah
blah blah and all that kind of stuff but

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780
blah blah and all that kind of stuff but
 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.439
blah blah and all that kind of stuff but
let that medical student actually

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449
let that medical student actually
 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.469
let that medical student actually
observe a physician disclosing error in

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479
observe a physician disclosing error in
 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.320
observe a physician disclosing error in
a less than Frank less than honest less

than transparent way and my hunch is

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820
than transparent way and my hunch is
 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.110
than transparent way and my hunch is
that we'll have much much more much

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120
that we'll have much much more much
 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.480
that we'll have much much more much
greater impact on the development of
