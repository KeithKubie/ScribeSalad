00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.110
We're told to graph the
inequality y is less

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.040
than 3x plus 5.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.330
So you give me any x, y is going
to be less than 3 times

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.040
that x plus 5.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.520
So the way to think about it is
you want to think about the

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.930
line y equals 3x plus 5, but
since we're going to be less

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.920
than that, instead of drawing
the line, we're going to draw

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.980
it as a dotted line and then
shade all the y's that are

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.760
less than that.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.730
So let me show you
what I mean.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.990
So if we wanted to just draw 3x
plus 5, if this was just an

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.330
equality, if we wanted to draw
that graph-- I'll do it in

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.020
this dark green color-- we'd say
OK, the y-intercept here

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.220
is positive 5.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.220
So we'd go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.400
And we'd say the slope is 3,
which means if we move 1 in

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.770
the x direction, we move up 3.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.840
If we move back in the x
direction, we're going

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.150
to move down 3.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.660
If we move back 2, we're
going to go down 6.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.590
2, 4, 6, just like that.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.970
Now, if this was graphing the
line y is equal to 3x plus 5,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.070
we would just connect
all of these dots.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.500
But because we're not less than
or equal to, we're just

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.410
less than, we're going to do a
dotted line here to show that

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.640
the line is actually not
going to be included.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.740
So let me draw a dotted line
here, which is actually

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.650
surprisingly easier to draw
than a regular line.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.040
So that is a dotted line.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.700
We're not going to include
that line, we're going to

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.540
include all the y's that are
less than 3x plus 5.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.220
So let's think about
it for second.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.180
If you give me some arbitrary
x, so let's say that x is 0.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.470
If x is 0, then what's
3x plus 5?

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.170
Well, 3 times 0 plus 5 is 5.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.290
So y is going to be
less than that.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.500
If x is 0, y has to
be less than 5.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.020
So y is going to be all of
these values down here.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.390
And it would not include-- and
if you were doing it as a

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.050
number line, you would do a
circle over there-- you would

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.530
not include 5.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.710
If x was equal to 1,
what is 3x plus 5?

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.320
3 times 1 is 3, plus 5 is 8.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.919
So y would have to be less
than 8, 8 is over here.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.230
So it's all the values less
than eight over here.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.500
So in general, for any x over
here, the y's that are less

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.210
than 3x plus five are
all of the values

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.800
below the dotted line.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.570
All of these values below the
dotted line is the graph of

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.250
the inequality y is less
than 3x plus 5.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.360
If it was less than or equal
to, you would make that a

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.970
solid line.

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.670
But it's not, so it's just all
of this area down here.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.730
All of this area below this
line, that's what that less

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.530
than tells you.
