00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.535
In all of the piecewise functions we've looked at so far, the endpoints of each

00:00:03.535 --> 00:00:08.182
of the segments have matched up with one another exactly. Which makes the

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:12.084
graphs continuous. There are no breaks. Now when this is the case, we can

00:00:12.084 --> 00:00:16.402
choose to include these boundary values. These values of x where we switch from

00:00:16.402 --> 00:00:20.502
one part of the function to the other. To be in either of the two parts of the

00:00:20.502 --> 00:00:24.356
function that come together at that point. We don't want any over lapse

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:28.660
however. So in the case of this last function we were looking at. We initially

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.759
included that x equals 0 point. In the probable part of the function. Which is

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.723
why we had 0 is less than or equal to x is less than 3. As the domain, for this

00:00:37.723 --> 00:00:42.429
middle piece of the function. We could however instead, include 0 in this first

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:47.260
linear part, the negative one half of x minus 4 part of the function. If we

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.822
decide to pursue that, we'd have to switch off our inequalities over here. So

00:00:50.822 --> 00:00:55.011
instead of having 0 is less than or equal to x right here you have 0 is less

00:00:55.011 --> 00:01:00.915
than X. I would switch the equal to part to be here over. So domain for this

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:05.123
first line is negative five is less than or equal to x, less than or equal to

00:01:05.123 --> 00:01:10.118
0. We could do the same thing with x equals 3. And now we can see it's

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:14.234
contained in the f of x equals x minus four portions. This line right here. We

00:01:14.234 --> 00:01:17.654
could instead, include it in the parabola if we just made x is less than or

00:01:17.654 --> 00:01:22.083
equal to 3. Instead of x is less than 3, and if we just switch this to less

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:26.891
than sign. Sometimes however, piecewise functions aren't continuous. They often

00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:31.556
have breaks in them. But sometimes Piecewise Functions aren't continuous. They

00:01:31.556 --> 00:01:35.540
often have breaks in them, as you can see in the two functions I've drawn here.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.516
Now, if you want to show that a certain point is not defined on a function, or

00:01:38.516 --> 00:01:43.462
in other words, if you want to exclude its X coordinate from the domain. We

00:01:43.462 --> 00:01:46.360
just draw a little open circle at that point like I've done in several places

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.134
here. Now, for each of these two piecewise functions here, I'd like you to

00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:54.243
decide which of these end points should stay open. And which ones should be

00:01:54.243 --> 00:01:57.281
filled on, based of course on how I've defined the domains for either of the

00:01:57.281 --> 00:02:01.815
functions. If you think an endpoint should be filled in, just click the circle

00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:05.670
that's at that endpoint. And if you want it to stay open, then just leave it

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.810
open. Don't mark it. To double-check your work, you can make sure that there's

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.010
no x value on either of these graphs that belongs to two different parts of the

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.899
functions.
