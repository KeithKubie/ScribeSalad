00:00:01.419 --> 00:00:06.630
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:07.810
FILIP: Hello, everyone.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.590
This is "The Flutter
Boring Show" again.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.290
This is me, Filip, and Emily.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.950
EMILY: Hello.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.561
Welcome.

00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:15.060
FILIP: Yeah.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.160
Welcome to "The Boring Show."

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.650
Emily is new in
the Flutter team,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.200
but she's been writing
that code for a while.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.400
She's coming from-- she's
a compiler engineer, right?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.810
EMILY: Yep.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.220
FILIP: So today, we are
going to finish what we

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.250
started the previous episode.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.830
And we are going
to add animations

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.214
because that's one thing
that people are asking us.

00:00:41.214 --> 00:00:43.130
EMILY: And you always
need a compiler engineer

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.575
to show your animations.

00:00:44.575 --> 00:00:45.200
FILIP: Exactly.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200
That's why we need it.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.160
But first, obligatory--

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.780
"Flutter Boring Show"
is about one hour long.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.650
It's about doing stuff,
and then having problems,

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.920
and then fixing them,
and always recorded.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.680
Nothing is edited
out, basically.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.300
And this is because
we think that it's

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.530
more interesting and more
educational to see us fail

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.770
and to see all these things
that you wouldn't normally

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.570
see in an edited video.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.790
EMILY: Long form live coding.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.720
FILIP: Yes.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.230
Yes.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.350
We really like the feedback that
you are giving us on YouTube.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.870
There's a bunch of questions.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.100
We're trying to answer them
on YouTube in the comments.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.950
But some of them we want
to highlight here as well.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.340
So let me just quickly see.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.620
So there's many questions
about Google Maps,

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.690
which are not supported as
a widget in Flutter yet.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.070
It's coming, so we don't
really have much to comment on.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.030
What we know is there is a--

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.730
EMILY: Yeah.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.100
There's open source
leaflet maps where you

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.020
can embed maps into your app.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.139
That is currently working.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.539
There's some demos online.

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.930
And then the Google Maps
people are hard at work here.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.730
So hopefully very soon.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.480
FILIP: Yes.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.880
And just to be
clear, if you want

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.050
to show a map as a different
activity, that's possible.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.820
But yeah, we get it.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.900
You probably want your
maps to embed in things.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.410
And that's what
we don't have yet.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.800
Another question by
Mohamed [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.440
was about Unmodifiable
List View,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.810
which is something that
I'm using heavily in block.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.830
And in many other
places where I'm like--

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.840
we have a stream of lists
of articles, for example.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.080
We don't want the
consumer, the view,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.770
to be able-- even though
we trust ourselves,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.150
we don't want people to be able
to modify the list that we are

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.990
publishing through the stream.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.080
So that's what Unmodifiable
List View is for.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.470
It's basically-- it's what
it says on the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.500
It's unmodifiable.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.930
So you can be pretty
sure that people will not

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.050
mess with your data for like--

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.112
if they're listening
to your stream.

00:03:24.112 --> 00:03:25.070
That's the only reason.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.330
If you are, for
example, prototyping,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.040
you don't need to
worry about it, really.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.040
EMILY: Just a regular
list view is totally fine.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.900
FILIP: Yes.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.340
And the last-- oh, and last
but not least, there's the--

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.840
[INAUDIBLE] asked about--

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.990
OK, block is neat,
but there are things

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.090
happening inside the block
that I might want to know--

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.310
for example, showing
a progress indicator

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.970
while I'm loading something.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:55.470
EMILY: Yeah.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.920
Because the problem with
block is you basically--

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.320
it's abstracting away all
that information about--

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.570
it's trying to get the
information, and now it has it.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.160
It's just like, here
it is to the view.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.030
So--

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.530
FILIP: Yeah.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.430
So that's what we're going
to do today, I think.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.410
So because we were going to
talk about animations anyway,

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.260
and because that's a really
good thing to have when

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.430
you're loading stuff--
to have animation--

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.990
we're going to try, in the
next hour, to do just that.

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.490
The last thing--

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.310
I want to show something
that people are not maybe--

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.290
people assume because
of how Flutter

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:43.440
works that it goes directly
to OpenGL, that accessibility

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.491
is not really supported.

00:04:46.491 --> 00:04:46.990
It is.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:52.170
So I just want to show here.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.360
If I turn on the
accessibility mode--

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:02.950
and I'm not super familiar
with how that works.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.490
But if I go--

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.840
yeah.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:14.980
There is one of
these things where--

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.560
yeah.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.150
So I'm going to open the
[INAUDIBLE] app here.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.560
It's a photo app.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.460
But as you can see,
it works as if it's--

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:26.540
everything is there.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:29.630
So it actually reads out things.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.820
I can go here.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.290
Buttons work, and are
accessible, and all that.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.790
So--

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.373
EMILY: And if you've
been watching the

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:42.000
show, you saw that
we did nothing--

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.100
well, I-- Filip and Matt and
Andrew have done nothing,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.700
basically.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.081
It all built in out of the
box, which was pretty nice.

00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:49.580
FILIP: Yeah.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.410
That doesn't mean that
everything will be this easy.

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.160
But yeah, if you're
using buttons,

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.700
and if you have text there,
that's going to be accessible.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.730
And this is because of, again,
a widget that's called Semantic,

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.020
I think.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.170
So if you're not super excited
about how accessible your app

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.830
currently is, just wrap it in--

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.490
wrap things in semantic widgets,
and that's going to be helpful.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.640
I'm going to spend
some time trying--

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.250
you know what?

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.380
I'm just going to turn it off.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.390
OK.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.180
So let's get going.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.270
So we have the app here.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:40.760
So let me just quickly--

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.180
we have now two screens.

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.370
If we click here,
we have new stories.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.070
If we click here,
we have top stories.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.720
We can still open them.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.700
We can still click this button
and get to the actual article.

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.820
And I think that's about it.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.830
The cool thing is
it's created in block.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.970
So the UI code is really just
like-- if I click on something,

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:13.220
it's going to just take
the block, take a sync,

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.740
and add a new event on the sync.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.460
And that's it.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.130
And then things happen
at the background.

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:22.250
And then over here--

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.240
wait.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:26.480
Over where we're showing
the stories, we're just--

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.730
we just have our stream builder.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.860
And we're listening
to the articles

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.730
that are coming from the block.

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.230
So it's pretty simple.

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:41.630
So we want to work on
the blocks a little more

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.030
so that we actually show--

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:47.990
so you are able to build
a circle or indicator

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.480
or some kind of indicator
that we're loading things

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.129
from the network.

00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:54.170
Because otherwise, yes,
it's hidden in the block.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:56.180
So it looks like--

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.290
here it's pretty obvious that
this is not the greatest user

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.190
experience.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:02.270
Because-- see?

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:04.100
I don't know what's happening.

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.476
I clicked on it, and sometimes
it just takes a long time.

00:08:06.476 --> 00:08:08.850
EMILY: There's a little lag
because it's the network in--

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:09.380
FILIP: Yes.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:15.420
So we want to make that visible.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.870
EMILY: So we want
to expose the stream

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:21.800
to do that so that people
can be like, is it loading,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.800
and we'll just put an event
in the stream that says,

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.380
hey, loading event has started.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:31.640
So the view can be anything
that wants to display

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.289
loading is happening can do so.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.010
And then when it
knows to turn off,

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:37.760
there will be another
event on the stream.

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:43.320
FILIP: So do you want a
bool, a stream of bool?

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:43.820
OK.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.320
That's--

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.880
EMILY: Yeah, I figure we
don't need anything else.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:53.942
FILIP: So we need a
stream of is loading.

00:08:53.942 --> 00:08:56.900
So a stream of bool.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:09:01.250
And again, as always, it's
backed by a behavior subject

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:05.990
so that if you subscribe
to that after the fact,

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:08.237
it will immediately give
you the latest value.

00:09:08.237 --> 00:09:09.320
EMILY: The most recently--

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:11.160
FILIP: The most recent value.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.830
And so now we have
this is loading subject

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.250
that we need to
populate with things.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.162
So when we first start--

00:09:24.766 --> 00:09:27.020
get articles and update, right?

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:32.710
So yes, we need to
actually press this.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:33.880
OK.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.150
Update articles.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:39.200
And then update
articles actually--

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.160
EMILY: Is doing the thing.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.480
So I think what you want is--

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.990
you can say just before
you make the request,

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:52.210
you can set and add
a loading event,

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.280
AKA put true in the
is loading stream.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.330
FILIP: Yes.

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:59.550
EMILY: And then when you're
done, you can say false.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.470
FILIP: So I think I should put
it-- so get article-- so let's

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:04.820
put it here.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:10.850
So is loading subject at true.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:21.910
And I should add the seed
value to false, just to be--

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:25.700
to never return null.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.235
And then when we're done--

00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:30.950
OK.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:34.640
So here we can do basically--

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.960
EMILY: I would do it after.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:40.810
Not that it really matters,
but it's available really done.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:41.610
FILIP: At false.

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.740
OK.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.510
So nothing happens, obviously.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.445
And now-- that was quick.

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.370
So one thing that
I'm going to do also

00:10:55.370 --> 00:11:02.690
is I'm going to change this
to an async thing because--

00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:06.575
wait here.

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:11.230
Do I need the IDs?

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.180
Oh, no.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.180
You don't need anything.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.800
Because what I want to do is
also wait a little bit more.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:27.110
So future delayed,
something like--

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.970
just have a little bit--

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:34.070
because you're going to be
doing this awesome animation.

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:36.010
You want at least
one second off.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:40.070
EMILY: But I can code
that because I can--

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.500
when we're coding
animation, I don't

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.120
have to use the stream yet.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.172
I can just have
it always visible.

00:11:46.172 --> 00:11:46.880
FILIP: All right.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:47.680
All right.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.415
EMILY: Don't make our data
any slower than it has to be.

00:11:50.415 --> 00:11:51.750
FILIP: OK.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.250
All right.

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.710
So we're down here.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:58.640
I'm going to push it
to Github, and you go.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.150
EMILY: OK.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.858
FILIP: All right.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:13.680
EMILY: So before I added
the loading indicator,

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:20.730
I did notice one little
bug in the code currently.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.580
So when you go over
to New Stories,

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.930
it updates, but the
buttons don't change.

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.180
It still looks like we're
always on Top Stories, which

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.440
is kind of weird.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:38.670
So the way to fix that
is in this-- basically,

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.000
we have our current index,
and it's always set to 0.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.860
That's kind of the problem.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.080
And so we have this--
it's a stateful widget--

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:52.020
so we can store
the current index.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:13:00.390
And then when we update the
sync that we are-- sorry,

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:04.290
the stream that we're listening
to, we can call a set state

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:08.250
to be like, redraw that little--

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.110
FILIP: Which leads
to a juicy topic

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:15.450
of why have a block if you
have a state over here.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:20.190
And I think that
as a distinction,

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:23.790
this is actually UI state.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:28.380
To me, that's-- this is
not the state of the apps.

00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.330
We could still have it
in a block somewhere,

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:35.730
but this is something that's
totally fine to just have

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:36.700
there.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:37.200
EMILY: Yeah.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.130
It's pure UI stuff,
whereas other--

00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.190
in theory, we could--

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:48.080
the Hacker News API
is a read only API.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.030
But if it were write only, you
could have state-- like, hey, I

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:52.050
marked this as read.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:53.640
Or even you could
have local caching

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.150
where you could mark it as read.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.260
But this is a pure notifying
the buttons in just the view.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:06.330
It has nothing to do with
the data that we're getting.

00:14:06.330 --> 00:14:10.240
So to do that, I'm
just going to add--

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.570
and let's start with 0.

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:19.715
And we'll select this.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:29.975
And then it should just
a matter of calling--

00:14:29.975 --> 00:14:32.120
and you guys have talked
about state [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.570
and calling set
state and all that.

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:37.380
FILIP: I think so.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:37.880
Yeah.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:42.430
If you're watching the
fifth episode of this,

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:45.200
I think you're an
advanced Flutterista.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:53.710
OK, cool.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:57.800
So we added this
little set state there.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:58.890
Oh, cool.

00:14:58.890 --> 00:14:59.740
Very cool.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:01.210
All right.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:03.850
EMILY: So now,
also you'll notice

00:15:03.850 --> 00:15:05.650
there's a little bit
of an animation that

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:06.550
goes on there too.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.650
The text grows
and changes color.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:10.570
FILIP: That's implicit, right?

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:11.410
EMILY: Yeah.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.345
We get that out of the box.

00:15:14.345 --> 00:15:14.845
Yes.

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.730
OK.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.930
How about we all--

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:27.020
so I wanted to talk
about custom animations.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.900
But for talking about
out-of-the-box stuff first,

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:36.250
maybe we can subscribe to the--

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.440
FILIP: The is loading?

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.100
EMILY: The is loading stream.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:42.220
I'll use the progress
indicator, and then I

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:44.930
can swap it out for something.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:45.430
FILIP: Yes.

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:46.530
That is perfect.

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.810
EMILY: OK.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:57.730
So just for starters, I'm
going to stick the is loading--

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.400
the progress indicator up here.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.000
I'm sure there could be
a better spot for it,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.110
but we're developing.

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.760
So let's just take
in the leading thing.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:10.494
Progress indicator.

00:16:10.494 --> 00:16:12.285
And progress indicator needs--

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.559
FILIP: Oh, circular
progress indicator, I think.

00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:24.350
Because progress
indicator is an abstract--

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.920
EMILY: Is abstract, OK.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:27.810
Oh, look at that.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:28.309
All right.

00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:29.387
So now this should just--

00:16:29.387 --> 00:16:30.220
FILIP: Load forever?

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.470
EMILY: Be there forever.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:33.730
Or not.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.120
FILIP: Maybe it's there, but
it-- can you make it white?

00:16:40.411 --> 00:16:40.910
Oh.

00:16:46.788 --> 00:16:48.288
EMILY: I can try a
background color.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.900
Well, that looks great.

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.665
FILIP: Yeah.

00:17:03.665 --> 00:17:05.589
EMILY: Hmm.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:07.369
OK.

00:17:07.369 --> 00:17:08.600
FILIP: What's going on?

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.892
EMILY: What's going on here?

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:27.540
FILIP: Let me also look
into the doc circler.

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:38.910
EMILY: I swear I've
used these before.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.040
FILIP: Yeah.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:40.540
EMILY: OK.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:45.120
You know what I like
to do when I get lost?

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:47.560
I look in the
Flutter [INAUDIBLE]..

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.100
FILIP: And you just--
just for the hell of it,

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.560
make the top bar or net
bar-- what's it called?

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:55.690
EMILY: That bar?

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:56.890
FILIP: White.

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:58.330
Have it a white background.

00:18:00.832 --> 00:18:02.290
I have a suspicion
that it's there,

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.259
but we just don't see it.

00:18:04.259 --> 00:18:05.800
EMILY: Do you want
me to change this?

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:06.535
FILIP: No.

00:18:06.535 --> 00:18:07.951
EMILY: Because
they're both white.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.840
Oh, because it's blue.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:14.250
FILIP: Yeah.

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:15.220
And I don't know why--

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.330
EMILY: We can't [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:16.330 --> 00:18:17.538
FILIP: The background color--

00:18:17.538 --> 00:18:20.130
I don't know why the
background color didn't work--

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.850
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.100
Anyway, so--

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:23.600
EMILY: OK.

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.540
So now we have a
forever spinning thing.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:29.580
That's not very useful.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:36.480
But I will-- this is
a little distracting.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.650
Let's take this out for now.

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:42.080
[INAUDIBLE] like, ah!

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:42.990
OK.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.970
So I'll just leave this
white for the time being.

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:49.890
So now what we want to
do is, from the block,

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.920
say if it's there, we will have
this [INAUDIBLE] indicator.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:56.820
And if not, then we'll
have a space or a container

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.810
or something.

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.540
So now that I just
remembered that,

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.475
we can say
widget.bloc.isLoading.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:09.120
And let's see.

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.130
That is-- well, we
need a stream builder.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:19.200
So let's just pull this
up into another widget

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.170
because this could
get a little unwieldy.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.402
FILIP: Yeah.

00:19:23.402 --> 00:19:24.110
EMILY: Let's see.

00:19:29.061 --> 00:19:30.560
FILIP: That's, by
the way, something

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.410
that we haven't done before
is create a new widget.

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:34.170
So that's great.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.580
Yes.

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.070
EMILY: So I pretty--

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.300
basically, if I just feel like
it's getting nested too deeply,

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.830
it's time to pull
some pieces out.

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:44.720
FILIP: Yes.

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.940
EMILY: And-- so I'm
using Visual Studio code.

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.620
And this is a pretty
handy shortcut.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.590
If you just press st, you can--

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.270
stateful or stateless.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:55.690
And so in this case, we just
need a stateless widget.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:59.030
So bam, it does all that.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:19:59.930
What did I call that?

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:00.763
FILIP: Loading info.

00:20:00.763 --> 00:20:03.230
EMILY: Thank you.

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.600
Too distracted
pointing out features.

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:11.590
So now we want a stream builder.

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.270
I'll just get--

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:16.070
I'm full of useful
things right now.

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.910
Stream builder.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:25.790
And stream builder is going
to have our stream, which

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.250
is that is loading thing.

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.120
FILIP: Which you'll
need to provide,

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.306
I think, in the
constructor of loading info

00:20:32.306 --> 00:20:33.430
because we don't have the--

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.700
EMILY: Thank you.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:34.700
Yeah, because we got it.

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:40.470
So stream bool isLoading.

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:42.140
FILIP: Oh, OK.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.980
You could also just provide
it with a block itself.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:50.430
But this is-- yeah,
because this is--

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:51.560
EMILY: So yeah.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.790
What is best block practices?

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:56.030
To send the whole
block, or to send

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.352
just the information that I--

00:20:58.352 --> 00:21:00.560
FILIP: Well, for this, I
think-- yeah, you're right--

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.450
just the information.

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.350
Although if, at some point--

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.570
yeah, this one is fine.

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.910
At some point,
many of the widgets

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:15.550
that you will be building are
going to need more than one

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.340
of the streams.

00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.256
EMILY: Yeah, for sure.

00:21:17.256 --> 00:21:19.220
FILIP: And then it makes
more and more sense

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.420
to have a block thing.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.920
EMILY: But just
generally speaking--

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:25.050
FILIP: This one-- the small one
is fine with just the stream.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:25.550
EMILY: Yeah.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:29.140
But generally speaking,
block pattern--

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:29.810
is it--

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:31.570
FILIP: I think most--

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.260
what I've seen is you
really pass the whole--

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.250
EMILY: The whole block.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:36.750
FILIP: Yeah.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:37.340
EMILY: OK.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:37.839
All right.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.610
So this._isLoading.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.770
And it doesn't recognize
stream because I guess

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:48.846
we haven't imported dart sync.

00:21:48.846 --> 00:21:52.220
FILIP: We're early
in the development.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.270
EMILY: Imagine a
world without futures.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:56.850
OK.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.315
And then is loading.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:02.240
OK.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.650
So now we pass our builder.

00:22:20.026 --> 00:22:27.066
And this is a bool and snapshot.

00:22:27.066 --> 00:22:29.840
Thank you.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.340
OK.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.550
OK, there we go.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.050
OK.

00:22:38.050 --> 00:22:39.425
FILIP: [INAUDIBLE]
super helpful.

00:22:39.425 --> 00:22:40.195
EMILY: Yes.

00:22:40.195 --> 00:22:45.040
So now we're going to
say is it currently true.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.580
And so-- yeah.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:49.590
There's-- let's see.

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:53.530
If snapshot dot-- well, first
you could say it has data.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:56.222
But since you've seeded
it, it always has data.

00:22:56.222 --> 00:22:57.430
So we should be able to say--

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:58.300
FILIP: Yes, hopefully.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:58.799
Yes.

00:22:58.799 --> 00:23:00.970
We'll see.

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.030
EMILY: So if it is
loading, then we

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:08.520
want to return the circular--

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.820
nope.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.320
Circular progress indicator.

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.590
And then else we can
just return container.

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:19.090
FILIP: OK.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:23.800
EMILY: Yes.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.410
That should--

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.881
FILIP: Yep, this sounds great.

00:23:28.881 --> 00:23:29.380
EMILY: OK.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.300
And then I will
construct, because I

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:32.518
don't think we're passed in.

00:23:32.518 --> 00:23:33.892
Yeah.

00:23:33.892 --> 00:23:35.266
Widget.bloc.isLoading.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.780
OK.

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:42.950
So we just hot reloaded.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.380
Oh, yay.

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.270
Error.

00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:46.770
FILIP: Yeah.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.430
That's what we
want on this show.

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:52.640
So what's going on?

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.700
Boolean expression
must not be null.

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.661
EMILY: So maybe it was--

00:23:57.661 --> 00:23:58.160
FILIP: Yeah.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:03.670
That's-- I think what
happens is that the icing--

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:08.425
so the build method,
because it's--

00:24:08.425 --> 00:24:10.540
I think it's called before--

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.020
EMILY: Before it's constructed?

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.330
The block is constructed?

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.760
FILIP: Well, before
the next event

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.690
loop when the stream has the--

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.410
EMILY: When it's been seeded?

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:21.310
FILIP: Yeah.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:22.380
You have to--

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:29.060
EMILY: Snapshot.hasData
and snapshot.data.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:29.560
OK.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.060
Let's try it.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:31.560
Clear that.

00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.210
And-- a ha.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:38.884
Bam.

00:24:38.884 --> 00:24:39.550
FILIP: It works.

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.210
EMILY: OK.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.400
So now we have a very
boring [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.760
FILIP: Yes, but it works.

00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.430
It's awesome.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:49.460
EMILY: And let us write
something interesting.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.720
So we can have--

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.435
we can build a custom
loading animation.

00:24:54.435 --> 00:25:00.310
And since this is Hacker
News, I know that--

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:01.970
well, OK, backing up.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:06.570
So there's a package
called Font Awesome Icons

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:08.770
for all the font awesome icons.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:12.850
And there is a Hacker News icon.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.240
So we could build
something using that.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:21.940
We could do a little pulsing
thing, growing in size

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:24.830
or spinning.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:25.330
FILIP: Yeah.

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:26.163
Yeah, let's do that.

00:25:26.163 --> 00:25:26.710
That's great.

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.835
EMILY: So how about--

00:25:28.835 --> 00:25:29.550
so let's see.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.430
I'll add-- I have to look up the
latest version of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.240
Or I guess technically--

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.660
our Pub people are going
to be unhappy with this,

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.000
but you could just do this.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.842
FILIP: I know what
you're going to do.

00:25:40.842 --> 00:25:41.800
EMILY: I'll look it up.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.310
I'll do the correcting.

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.980
Good!

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:44.956
No.

00:25:44.956 --> 00:25:46.131
I'll look it up.

00:25:49.612 --> 00:25:50.320
FILIP: That's OK.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.870
I wouldn't-- it's fine.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:53.890
Just any.

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:57.040
So what I sometimes
do is I just put any.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.230
There this is even more radical.

00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:01.570
But yeah, I put any there.

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:05.350
And then I-- if I'm lazy,
I look in pubspec log

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.970
to see what it got to
me, and then I use that.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:11.500
So that's one way to do it.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.000
So properly, we would
go to [INAUDIBLE],,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.160
we would find out what's
the latest version,

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.400
and put that there.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:19.900
EMILY: Yeah.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.850
Because the problem
with this is,

00:26:21.850 --> 00:26:25.457
in theory, Font Awesome
could update its versioning

00:26:25.457 --> 00:26:27.790
and it could do a breaking
change, although in this case

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:28.780
it's very unlikely.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:33.640
And then our users of our app
would be like, what gives?

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.890
It doesn't work anymore.

00:26:34.890 --> 00:26:38.200
And you're like, but I
didn't change any code.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:43.000
So we have sketchily
imported fonts.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.680
Awesome.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.135
And pull down the package.

00:26:53.765 --> 00:26:55.720
FILIP: Oh, wow.

00:26:55.720 --> 00:27:03.940
EMILY: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.330
FILIP: Is it not there?

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:08.306
EMILY: Let's see.

00:27:08.306 --> 00:27:11.490
You said pubspec.lock?

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:12.710
FILIP: Oh, is it--

00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:13.812
wait.

00:27:13.812 --> 00:27:14.750
Font Awesome--

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.420
EMILY: Oh, is it
Font Awesome Flutter?

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.800
I think it is.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:19.886
I think-- let's try that.

00:27:19.886 --> 00:27:20.880
FILIP: You know what?

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.640
Maybe--

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.650
EMILY: Maybe I should
actually search.

00:27:23.650 --> 00:27:25.954
FILIP: So Font Awesome.

00:27:25.954 --> 00:27:28.120
EMILY: Although it is
interesting it didn't warn us.

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.870
FILIP: Yeah, that's weird.

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.110
So there is--
actually, there's two.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:36.160
So one is Font Awesome, and
it's the CSS framework thing.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.440
So you have the
CSS framework on.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:41.080
And then there's
Font Awesome Flutter.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.090
And that's the icon bag
available as Flutter icons.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.590
EMILY: OK.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.460
And since I've been
looking at the lock,

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.340
now I know the version number.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.860
There we go.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.450
Everything is above the board.

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:53.950
OK.

00:27:59.615 --> 00:28:00.115
FILIP: OK.

00:28:00.115 --> 00:28:01.590
Something is weird.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:06.440
Is it just slow to update?

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:12.070
By the way, is this your
development box, Emily?

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.170
EMILY: No.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:17.670
I do not normally
develop on a MacBook Air.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:21.261
This is for compact
development while traveling.

00:28:21.261 --> 00:28:21.760
Yeah.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.700
I normally develop on a desktop.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.310
So you might see the hot reload
might be a little bit longer

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:27.930
than normal.

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:28.930
FILIP: Yeah, I saw that.

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:30.400
That's, like, three seconds.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.491
So I was like--

00:28:31.491 --> 00:28:31.990
EMILY: Yes.

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.500
OK, so--

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.070
FILIP: I want to highlight that.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.569
EMILY: Yes.

00:28:33.569 --> 00:28:39.651
This delightful laptop is six
years old and a MacBook Air.

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:40.150
FILIP: Yes.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:41.740
Not meant for development.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.030
EMILY: Yeah.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.560
I was holding out
because I didn't

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.990
know if this newfangled more
RAM thing would catch on.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:50.631
So I'm waiting
for it to pan out.

00:28:50.631 --> 00:28:51.130
OK.

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.178
So why is-- what the heck?

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:03.560
FILIP: It's weird
because pub get is fine.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.350
EMILY: Yeah, it didn't complain.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:10.570
When all else fails, copy paste.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.496
So now you're happy?

00:29:12.496 --> 00:29:13.120
FILIP: Oh, wow.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:15.552
That's weird.

00:29:15.552 --> 00:29:16.510
Maybe there was a typo.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.446
Anyway, so that's fine.

00:29:18.446 --> 00:29:20.320
EMILY: Meanwhile, people
on YouTube are like,

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:21.960
you typed it wrong.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.510
OK.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.450
So that's there.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:28.670
That was not supposed
to be time consuming.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:34.660
So let us-- let's just stick
the icon there for starters,

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:37.881
and we can do stuff with it.

00:29:37.881 --> 00:29:38.380
FILIP: Oh.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.400
So you can actually use
it with the icon widget.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.191
I didn't know that.

00:29:41.191 --> 00:29:41.890
That's cool.

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.480
EMILY: Yeah.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.690
And let me show you this.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.590
So that, and then I think
this is going to be white,

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:49.120
so I should change--

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.030
FILIP: Back?

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:50.690
EMILY: Yes.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:52.280
Just get rid of that.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:55.640
OK.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.286
So now when it--

00:29:58.286 --> 00:29:59.600
oh.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.610
FILIP: What was that about?

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:02.570
EMILY: OK.

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.010
So we can't hot reload
because we added a packet.

00:30:05.010 --> 00:30:06.680
So we need to hot restart.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:14.536
So this should work if we--

00:30:14.536 --> 00:30:15.530
no.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:20.500
FILIP: Do you need to
add assets or something?

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.000
No?

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.850
EMILY: I'm just going to--

00:30:29.850 --> 00:30:33.139
before we start,
just [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:33.139 --> 00:30:33.639
FILIP: Sure.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:51.917
EMILY: I've--

00:30:51.917 --> 00:30:53.000
FILIP: Oh, you-- oh, yeah.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.490
EMILY: I'm just
like [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:55.740
FILIP: Just looking at-- yeah.

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.630
It looks like everything.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.667
Icon,
FontAwesomeIcons.hackerNews.

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:09.680
It feels like it--

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.370
it's kind of there, but--

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:12.870
EMILY: Yeah.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:16.490
FILIP: We chose something.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.750
EMILY: Come on.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:18.830
Come on, MacBook Air.

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:20.060
You can do it.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.240
FILIP: You can hear it.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:21.740
EMILY: Yeah.

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:23.510
Oh, there we go.

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.030
There's the little Y Combinator.

00:31:26.030 --> 00:31:31.886
So now, just for development's
sake, I'm going to get rid of--

00:31:31.886 --> 00:31:33.260
I'm going to always
make it there

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.880
so we can see what
we're developing.

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.020
FILIP: Yes.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:40.929
EMILY: So there-- does
Hacker News square, maybe?

00:31:40.929 --> 00:31:41.720
Let's try that one.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.595
I think it's rounded.

00:31:42.595 --> 00:31:44.752
It's pretty.

00:31:44.752 --> 00:31:46.570
Yeah, little rounded corners.

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:47.477
FILIP: Oh, OK.

00:31:47.477 --> 00:31:47.976
Wow.

00:31:47.976 --> 00:31:48.475
Nice.

00:31:48.475 --> 00:31:50.211
EMILY: OK.

00:31:50.211 --> 00:31:50.710
All right.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:58.300
So to start, we can fade
in and out, do you think?

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.560
Or do you want to
do grow or rotate?

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:05.420
FILIP: Since it's going
to be short, hopefully,

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:10.390
maybe fading in and out may not
be the greatest thing to show.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:14.911
EMILY: So we can set
how fast we want it to--

00:32:14.911 --> 00:32:15.910
FILIP: That's true, yes.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:18.800
EMILY: So it's always
under our control.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.300
FILIP: Yeah.

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:20.492
Let's do fading out.

00:32:20.492 --> 00:32:21.950
That's something
that seems useful.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.910
I'm not sure if it's
useful for loading,

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.290
but definitely useful
for many other things.

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:27.040
EMILY: Yeah.

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:30.010
I'm envisioning like
kind of pulsing.

00:32:30.010 --> 00:32:31.040
FILIP: Oh, OK.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:31.540
Yeah.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.690
That's-- yeah, that makes sense.

00:32:33.690 --> 00:32:34.540
EMILY: Yes.

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:36.730
Inwardly, some designers
are watching this.

00:32:36.730 --> 00:32:38.580
They're like, what
are you doing?

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:40.780
FILIP: No!

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:43.440
EMILY: This is why I know
[INAUDIBLE] designer.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:43.960
OK.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:49.466
So to do that, there is a--

00:32:49.466 --> 00:32:53.530
I think it's called
fade transition.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:57.910
And so you can just wrap this.

00:32:57.910 --> 00:32:59.350
I'll do that.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:13.300
And fade transition--
basically, it

00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.730
says I'm going to fade
in and out on this thing,

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.770
or fade one direction generally.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:23.750
And you say-- it takes
this intimation of opacity.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:26.568
So there's a couple
of parts of animation.

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:34.280
Generally speaking, there's
this animation controller object

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.790
that is going to be
driving the animation.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:47.160
And it will tick between values
0 and 1, like decimal values.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:53.405
And so what we are
going to pass in-- so

00:33:53.405 --> 00:33:56.000
for this animation,
this opacity thing,

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.430
we're going to pass in
this little stream that

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:01.610
says at this moment,
this is the value

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:02.810
that I should be animating.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.393
And it will go
[MAKES TICKING NOISE]..

00:34:04.393 --> 00:34:05.480
FILIP: Yeah.

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:12.709
EMILY: So I want to
add a controller.

00:34:12.709 --> 00:34:15.639
I think we'll make
this a stateful widget.

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:20.605
So there's-- yeah.

00:34:20.605 --> 00:34:22.480
Let me just type, and
then I'll explain this.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.690
FILIP: Yeah.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:29.699
So I'll try to talk
over your typing.

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:36.020
So what I think we
need to do is to make

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.230
this the stateful widget.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.510
The stateful widget,
I think, needs

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:47.630
to mix in a class that makes
it conform to vsync, basically

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:55.340
making it run things or change
the animation control thing.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.200
I'm probably not
saying the right thing.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:02.060
But basically, it makes a
round of 60 frames per second.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:07.030
And then with that, we--

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:13.120
well, we will have
our ticker, basically.

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:13.690
EMILY: Yeah.

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:14.780
So at a high level--

00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:21.290
let's see.

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.790
Is it animation ticker?

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:26.000
FILIP: Try ticker,
and that should--

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.960
EMILY: TickerProviderStateMix.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.830
So there's this--

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:33.800
I'm going to construct
a controller.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.891
AnimationController controller.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:06.650
This takes this
ticker provider vsync.

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:13.010
So vsync-- basically,
it's keeping

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:15.710
track of whether this
widget is in view

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:17.900
or not so that
Flutter doesn't spend

00:36:17.900 --> 00:36:22.550
its energy animating things
that are not actually visible.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:25.790
So by adding this
mix in, we have just

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:29.360
said that we are a
ticker, and so we can

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:31.950
increment between these frames.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:33.800
And so when this
widget is visible,

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.840
then it will animate stuff.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:40.220
And then we can
specify the duration.

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:45.620
So again, just for debugging,
let's make it really slow.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:54.100
So duration, three seconds.

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:54.600
OK.

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:01.080
Oh, great.

00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.070
Oh, I need to restart because--

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.900
init state.

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:10.305
Because init state is
only run when you restart.

00:37:10.305 --> 00:37:11.851
That's something else.

00:37:11.851 --> 00:37:12.350
OK.

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:12.850
Hold on.

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:15.650
Let me just clear this and--

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:16.970
because I have too many errors.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:26.260
Oh.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.460
I haven't hooked up--

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.050
I didn't hook up my--

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:33.130
this requires to have
opacity be something,

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:35.560
and I didn't finish
constructing it.

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:40.330
So opacity is--

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:41.950
FILIP: I think
you're one paren off.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.335
EMILY: Oh, jeez.

00:37:44.335 --> 00:37:45.289
Thank you.

00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:50.960
OK.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:38:00.120
So if we do more complicated
animations, you can--

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.990
there might be-- your
controller would direct

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:09.650
the overall set of
animations, and you could have

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:11.470
multiple animations in there.

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.920
And so you could specify--

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.570
in here, you can create
this little animation

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:19.980
thing that would say--

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:23.670
so for fading is maybe
only 1 and 1/2 seconds,

00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:26.420
and then something
else is two seconds.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.500
So it gets compiled together.

00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:30.240
But since for
this, it's all one,

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:35.010
for now we can pass
that indirectly.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:35.930
OK.

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:38.820
And right now, we--

00:38:42.222 --> 00:38:46.470
I'm not even sure if that's--

00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:52.080
so I think-- so
now we need to have

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.390
this controller do the thing.

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:59.160
So you can say
controller.forward.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.320
So right now, we're
doing it always.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.774
We're not saying
if you have data.

00:39:04.774 --> 00:39:05.940
So we're just going forward.

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.070
So it should just
go from nothing

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:10.970
to fade into view over a
course of three seconds.

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.140
FILIP: Ooh, OK.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:16.640
OK.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.660
I wasn't even hoping.

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:18.160
Good.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.230
Good.

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:20.510
That's awesome.

00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:21.950
EMILY: OK.

00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:27.685
So even if we wanted--

00:39:27.685 --> 00:39:31.760
so forward produces
a ticker future.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:35.480
And so when it is done--

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:37.110
this is the quick
and dirty thing.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.560
We won't necessarily
do this for real.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:44.850
But then you can say
then when it's done,

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:49.030
you can say controller.reverse.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:50.527
And so then it'll fade back out.

00:39:50.527 --> 00:39:51.110
FILIP: Oh, OK.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:52.586
Let's try that.

00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.690
EMILY: So OK.

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:58.760
Maybe I need to do a hot--

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:02.516
let's in and then--

00:40:02.516 --> 00:40:03.140
FILIP: And out.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:03.440
All right.

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:03.740
EMILY: OK.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.198
Maybe I'll make it
a little faster.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:12.500
So that's that.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:19.595
But what would be cool is if--

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:27.580
I was thinking if
we had a couple,

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.205
and they were flashing
at different times, kind

00:40:30.205 --> 00:40:30.882
of pulsing.

00:40:30.882 --> 00:40:31.590
FILIP: All right.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.340
Yeah, sure.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:33.910
Go for it.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:38.626
EMILY: Or we could make it grow.

00:40:38.626 --> 00:40:42.130
Do you have a preference?

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:46.570
FILIP: So I wonder what's
more interesting for--

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:50.610
what's more used out
there in the wild.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:54.620
So the two ones, that would mean
basically staggered animation.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.120
EMILY: Yeah.

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:59.850
So basically, there would be--

00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:03.910
if we want to have
it grow, it's more--

00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:06.850
it's kind of like your
more standard widget

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:07.560
building things.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.540
We would wrap this fade
transition in, say--

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:12.130
I think there's a--

00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:13.150
FILIP: Scale transition.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:15.330
EMILY: Yeah.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:18.700
Transform-- well, the
scale, or you can--

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.260
this is a little more if
you want to do [INAUDIBLE],,

00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:24.140
but transform.scale, and then
you can just do other things.

00:41:24.140 --> 00:41:24.681
FILIP: Right.

00:41:24.681 --> 00:41:25.840
Right.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:33.100
EMILY: If we have multiple and
we want to have them offset,

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.990
that gets into a little
more of this thing,

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:40.120
controlling this
animation stream.

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:48.100
And so the way we could
do that is we could--

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:53.170
so we didn't get
into tweening at all.

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:55.636
Let me jump into
Animation Controller.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:05.680
So animation-- where does
it talk about tweens?

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:09.440
FILIP: Yeah.

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:13.200
And by the way, that's
something that I read about once

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.340
in every three months.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.870
And I always forget.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:16.520
There's tweens.

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.700
There's animation.

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:21.300
There is animation controller.

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:25.890
And I'm forgetting about
this one other thing.

00:42:25.890 --> 00:42:27.030
EMILY: Tween Flutter.

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.863
That will be useful.

00:42:32.005 --> 00:42:32.880
FILIP: Yes, this is--

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.310
EMILY: No, I wanted the actual--

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.340
FILIP: Oh, the class?

00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.250
EMILY: Class definition.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:50.680
All right.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.881
So this is used if you--

00:42:54.881 --> 00:42:56.380
[INAUDIBLE] was
talking about if you

00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.320
have multiple
pieces of animation

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.470
and you want one to be only
part of the full thing,

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.240
because your controller
is the full thing.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:10.120
So your tween is saying I want
you to go between these two

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.500
ranges of values.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:16.110
And then animate also takes
a duration or an interval

00:43:16.110 --> 00:43:17.549
so you can say within this time.

00:43:17.549 --> 00:43:18.090
FILIP: Right.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:20.310
Right.

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:25.990
But I think the interval is
from 0.5, for example, to 1.0.

00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:28.794
It's the part of
the whole animation.

00:43:28.794 --> 00:43:29.710
It's not the duration.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.420
EMILY: Yes, it's a fraction.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:36.730
Everything is always 0 to 1, and
you have to scale in your head.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:38.668
So I think the--

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.020
I think we can do either.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:53.010
I think having two animations
that are playing off each other

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:56.409
might be a little
more challenging.

00:43:56.409 --> 00:43:57.200
But we could do it.

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:57.960
We have time.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.812
Or do you want to an easier one?

00:44:00.812 --> 00:44:02.020
FILIP: Let's-- you know what?

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:07.070
So before we do that,
should we look at how

00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:08.200
you're using the animation?

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:11.341
Is that how you would
start it and stop it?

00:44:11.341 --> 00:44:11.840
EMILY: OK.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.650
Yeah.

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:18.390
Let me-- yes, because
I took out the whole--

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.690
oops.

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:26.240
We want to say if we have data--

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:29.390
FILIP: So Emily is
waiting for things

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:31.920
to happen in the
stream builder when

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.880
there is new information
coming from our block.

00:44:34.880 --> 00:44:43.460
So she is-- and when
there's new data,

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.800
then she runs the controller.

00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:49.460
So she runs the
animation from 0 to 1,

00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:52.680
and then she uses
it for the opacity.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:53.180
OK.

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.250
EMILY: Yeah.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:57.860
So I'm going to make
this time even shorter,

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:02.810
because it's now--

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:04.160
well, it goes by really quickly.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.470
And there's a couple of things
you can do to show more.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.380
So I just made it one second.

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.590
That might not even be--

00:45:10.590 --> 00:45:13.027
you can barely see it in there.

00:45:13.027 --> 00:45:13.610
FILIP: Oh, OK.

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:16.310
EMILY: So how about--

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:22.170
what I can do is I can
bump all the values up.

00:45:22.170 --> 00:45:24.500
So controller is
going from 0 to 1.

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:28.730
What if I start at 0.5 and up?

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:32.400
But I have to clamp it
because it'll be mad.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.310
It's like, your opacity didn't--

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:40.910
FILIP: What about-- can we do
it so that when the transition

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.130
stops--

00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:48.920
when we say loading false,
and we say, OK, so control,

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:50.960
go back--

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.010
or no.

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:57.650
Controller, go-- to continue
with our little animation

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:02.230
to the bitter end, even
though we're already there.

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:05.280
Maybe-- I'm not sure if that's--

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.970
EMILY: So that would be--

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:09.410
take out this future thing.

00:46:09.410 --> 00:46:12.170
It's possible that
if it were too fast,

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:13.920
we're not going to see
a whole lot either.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:16.740
But what we can do is--

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:23.220
so if return contoller.reverse.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:29.450
So this is saying start the
animation when we are loading.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:33.710
And then if we get the update
event, then we fade out.

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:39.180
And the fade out event is the--

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.120
FILIP: But what I meant is--

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.280
so first we can guard.

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:47.240
So if Snapchat does not add
data, just do the container.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:50.880
And then we know that
Snapchat has data.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.800
And it's either true, which
means we are just starting

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.200
to load, or it's false.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:03.230
And so if it's true, we start
the controller forward and not

00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:04.604
do anything else.

00:47:04.604 --> 00:47:05.395
And if it's false--

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:08.810
yeah.

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:12.950
If it's false, I thought we
would wait for the animation

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:17.900
to complete and then reverse.

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.480
EMILY: So that's
what I had originally

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.560
written with the then.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:27.880
The thing is we are getting the
it's completed information to--

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.320
or the it's completed
event in the stream

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.109
so quickly that we
don't get to finish it.

00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.650
FILIP: Right.

00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:33.149
Right.

00:47:33.149 --> 00:47:36.650
EMILY: So you're
saying don't process

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:39.570
that event in the stream
loader until we're done.

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:41.130
Is that what you're thinking?

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:41.720
FILIP: Yeah.

00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.440
I think what you're
doing is basically--

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:48.860
if either the Snapchat has
no data, which only happens

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:52.410
at the start, or if it's false,
which means we stopped loading,

00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:55.310
you immediately return
the container, which

00:47:55.310 --> 00:48:00.160
basically removes everything.

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.730
Oh, yeah.

00:48:02.730 --> 00:48:10.430
EMILY: So we could have this
always return that transition.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:23.158
So we're always
going to have this.

00:48:23.158 --> 00:48:25.710
This is always
going to be there.

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:28.620
It will-- I think
this is effectively--

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:33.945
it's going to look the
same because we're still--

00:48:33.945 --> 00:48:35.700
we're going to get
that event quickly.

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:40.440
What I was going to say is--

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.164
this is another--

00:48:41.164 --> 00:48:42.330
FILIP: Yeah, do it your way.

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:45.300
Because I just realized
we would have to--

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.180
yeah, do what you wanted
to do, because that

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.360
sounds more reasonable.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:50.960
EMILY: OK.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:53.490
What I was going to say is--

00:48:53.490 --> 00:49:01.280
this is kind of a hack,
but we could say--

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:01.780
here.

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.810
I'm going to go back
to the container thing

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.210
because we want it to go away.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:08.850
But you could say--

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:13.090
let's start it.

00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:14.310
Let's try a 0.5.

00:49:14.310 --> 00:49:16.578
FILIP: Wait, you can do that?

00:49:16.578 --> 00:49:18.450
EMILY: So yes.

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:19.775
So we're going to have--

00:49:19.775 --> 00:49:22.620
oh, wait, so this is--

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:25.920
now we have to do the--

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.526
we have to get--

00:49:28.526 --> 00:49:30.150
this is returning
animation controller,

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.250
and we need the values of this.

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:34.560
So we want to do--

00:49:38.315 --> 00:49:40.420
I think we need to do tweening.

00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:41.180
FILIP: Yeah.

00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:50.770
EMILY: So tween from 0.5 to 1.

00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:54.460
And I think animate controller.

00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:55.875
FILIP: Oh, yeah, that sounds--

00:49:55.875 --> 00:49:56.500
EMILY: I think.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:57.000
FILIP: Yeah.

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:09.650
OK.

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:11.980
Let's try this.

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:12.562
So this--

00:50:12.562 --> 00:50:13.940
[CRASHING SOUND]

00:50:13.940 --> 00:50:16.336
Whoa.

00:50:16.336 --> 00:50:17.780
That's fine.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:20.460
EMILY: Our whiteboard
is attacking us.

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:20.960
OK.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.350
So now it's like-- it starts
a little bit stronger.

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:28.310
But again, it's
because we're too fast.

00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:33.320
Again, if I take this
out, we can see the full.

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:33.820
FILIP: Yeah.

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:35.610
It's going to crash,
though, right?

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:41.270
Because Snapchat is-- maybe not.

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:42.774
EMILY: We don't use it, so--

00:50:42.774 --> 00:50:43.440
FILIP: Oh, cool.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.080
EMILY: And this is just dead
code, but we'll-- go away.

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.310
So this is going to
stay there in this case.

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:49.810
OK.

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:51.310
So it's--

00:50:51.310 --> 00:50:52.840
FILIP: Oh.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:56.260
EMILY: And actually, I
just realized I've been--

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.760
I've been changing
this, but I don't

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.301
think I was doing
a hot restart, so I

00:50:59.301 --> 00:51:01.135
think it's been slower
than one second.

00:51:01.135 --> 00:51:04.060
So I need to do the restart.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:08.230
Because init state doesn't get
run when you do a hot reload.

00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:09.561
So that's a little faster.

00:51:09.561 --> 00:51:10.060
FILIP: Yes.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:18.100
So tween is useful
when you want to do

00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:22.720
from somewhere to somewhere
instead of the full thing.

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.880
For example, if you--

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:27.607
basically, you're
changing the curve.

00:51:27.607 --> 00:51:29.440
EMILY: And you can
also-- so right now, this

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:31.750
is basically a linear tween.

00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:34.990
We're just going 1.5, 1.6.

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:36.400
You can also--

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:41.900
I'm pretty sure in here,
this animate, you can say--

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:43.720
there's curved animations.

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:49.380
So you can-- rather
than march towards 1.0,

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:51.890
you can do these
sorts of angles.

00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:55.480
I think there's
a page that has--

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.440
there's--

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.850
FILIP: Is in.

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:01.420
So these are pretty--

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:06.880
so if you go to
Flutter.io/tutorials/animation,

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.110
that's where you'll
find all these things.

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:11.050
And that's a really good read.

00:52:11.050 --> 00:52:14.350
And as I said, I read it
once every three months.

00:52:17.025 --> 00:52:19.150
So for example, with the
opacity-- that's something

00:52:19.150 --> 00:52:23.230
that I just learned
recently, is that opacity,

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:28.210
if you go in early, it'll
look nonlinear to us humans.

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:31.540
Because for some reason,
we see it differently.

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:36.370
So they use-- the real
animators and designers

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:38.420
would use something
like is in or is out.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.820
I'm not sure which one.

00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:46.000
But yeah, so it helps
to familiarize yourself

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.800
with non-linear curves.

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.240
Because these mostly seem
like more interesting

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:56.980
and fun to watch for people.

00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:59.320
EMILY: Do you
remember what the--

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.460
who defines is in, is out?

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.220
FILIP: Oh, OK.

00:53:09.140 --> 00:53:10.950
That is curves.

00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:12.070
EMILY: Oh, curves.

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:12.860
I was doing curve.

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:13.610
That would be why.

00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:19.610
OK.

00:53:19.610 --> 00:53:23.360
So now we need to--

00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.890
let me just controller.reverse.

00:53:24.890 --> 00:53:27.230
Because otherwise, it's
always going to be in there,

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:29.828
and that is problematic.

00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:44.150
So we're ending at 0.5.

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:47.630
FILIP: Yeah, because
we're not doing anything--

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:49.620
oh.

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.080
You know what?

00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:52.520
Are you waiting for the--

00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:54.050
EMILY: Oh, I'm not.

00:53:54.050 --> 00:53:54.555
Good call.

00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.730
So .then parentheses.

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:01.670
They're fun.

00:54:09.035 --> 00:54:10.508
Yes.

00:54:10.508 --> 00:54:12.472
Oh.

00:54:12.472 --> 00:54:13.945
This is done.

00:54:17.873 --> 00:54:18.390
OK.

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:19.830
Oh, look at that.

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:22.330
You can see it, but it's
not [WHISPERS INAUDIBLY]..

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:23.230
Cool.

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:25.420
So what next?

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:26.350
Do we want to--

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:31.490
FILIP: No, I think we're on time
or over time, which is great.

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:37.720
So we-- the app
looks as it looks.

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.580
So it's still not great.

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:42.720
But what I'm trying
to say-- it kind of

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:47.830
has all the bells and whistles
that we envisioned it to have.

00:54:47.830 --> 00:54:50.260
It needs a lot of polish,
but that will be--

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:52.000
I think watching that
would be even more

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.330
boring than "The
Boring Show" level is.

00:54:55.330 --> 00:55:00.460
So what I think
is going to happen

00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:06.090
for the next episode is we're
going to shop for other ideas

00:55:06.090 --> 00:55:07.000
to look at.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.050
For example, we had--

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:12.970
a lot of people are
asking us about things

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:15.871
that wouldn't really fit
into this particular-- oh,

00:55:15.871 --> 00:55:16.870
you're making it orange.

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:18.130
Awesome.

00:55:18.130 --> 00:55:23.330
To this particular app.

00:55:23.330 --> 00:55:25.780
So we might want to start--

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:33.340
or even just modify an existing
app live, but not this one.

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:37.990
I'm probably-- just
because I'm a neat freak,

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:44.540
I'll probably make a last
comment to this not televised

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:49.030
that it's going to at
least make it functional as

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:50.890
of [INAUDIBLE] use readers.

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:54.700
Because one of the things that
we don't have still is we're

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:57.280
not actually asking for
the latest top stories

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.860
or the latest news stories.

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:04.990
So now you're only reading
five stories always.

00:56:04.990 --> 00:56:06.430
But that's important.

00:56:06.430 --> 00:56:07.840
I think it really looks good.

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.851
Just by the orange
thing, you made it--

00:56:09.851 --> 00:56:10.600
EMILY: I made it--

00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:11.369
FILIP: Way better.

00:56:11.369 --> 00:56:12.785
EMILY: Kind of
Hacker News-themed.

00:56:12.785 --> 00:56:13.451
FILIP: Oh, nice.

00:56:13.451 --> 00:56:15.567
How did you get the--

00:56:15.567 --> 00:56:20.950
EMILY: You just set the
theme, primarySwatch.

00:56:20.950 --> 00:56:21.990
FILIP: Oh, deep orange.

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:23.320
OK.

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:23.820
Yeah.

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:24.990
That's great.

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:27.090
So yeah, that's awesome.

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:29.580
And then we have the
loading indicator.

00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:32.720
We have some elements
of block in in there.

00:56:32.720 --> 00:56:34.670
EMILY: Add some drop
shadow in between.

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:35.460
FILIP: Yeah.

00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:37.080
All these things-- yeah.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:40.760
For example, if you
click on the thing,

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.730
it just says story,
which is weird.

00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:44.700
And there's a bunch
of little things

00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:46.837
that could definitely
get better.

00:56:46.837 --> 00:56:47.920
EMILY: That could be easy.

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:48.390
I think--

00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:49.265
FILIP: Yeah, totally.

00:56:49.265 --> 00:56:51.516
That was very easy.

00:56:51.516 --> 00:56:53.830
EMILY: I'm going to
fix it while you talk.

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:55.760
FILIP: No, I was
going to end now.

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:56.260
EMILY: OK.

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.120
FILIP: So thanks for watching.

00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:01.380
Please, if you have any
questions about animation,

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:05.530
Emily will be there
answering it for you.

00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:08.690
There's some other stuff
that we talked about,

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:12.270
and we're happy to
always answer them.

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:14.340
But more importantly,
if you have

00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:19.830
ideas of what app we should be
building next so that it gives

00:57:19.830 --> 00:57:25.320
us a lot of options of things
that you care about to talk

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:31.101
and to implement, then please
put it in the comments.

00:57:31.101 --> 00:57:31.600
All right.

00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:33.070
Thank you for watching.

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:35.940
EMILY: Thanks so much.

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:38.690
