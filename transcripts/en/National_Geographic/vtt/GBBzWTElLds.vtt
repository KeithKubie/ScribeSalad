In 2013, I was asked to cover
breast cancer in Uganda.

00:00:15.948 --> 00:00:18.317 line:0%
Breast cancer has less than
a handful of oncologists

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:19.786 line:0%
in the whole country.

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.020
<i> A woman who has
 breast cancer</i>

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.788
<i> thinks of it as a
 death sentence.</i>

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.426
<i> Most of the resources in
 Uganda went to HIV-AIDS.</i>

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.662
<i>So cancer is something that is
sort of just seen as a curse.</i>

00:00:29.896 --> 00:00:31.130 line:0%
<i> This is Mary</i>

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.399 line:0%
<i> she had been living with
 tumors for several years</i>

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.735 line:0%
<i> but didn't want to tell
 anyone, she was ashamed.</i>

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.371 line:0%
There was a team of American
doctors from Seattle

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:41.307
who went to try and bring
ultrasound technology

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:42.842
to detect tumors early.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:45.277
When she took off her
shirt, this is what we saw

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:47.280
and they did a biopsy on Mary

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.316
and it turned out the
cancer was very localized.

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:54.553
and she was able to get a
mastectomy and survived.

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.422
<i>This is Jolly and her husband.</i>

00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:59.258
<i> She had gotten a
 mastectomy a year before</i>

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:03.395
<i>and did not follow up, and
I spent five days with her</i>

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:04.897
<i> until she died.</i>

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:08.067
<i>And this is her daughter seeing
her mother in the casket.</i>

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.803
<i> She didn't even know her
 mother had passed away.</i>

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:13.406
She just got a call and was
pulled out of boarding school

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.008
and when she came into the
truck, they just opened the lid

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.677
and... there was her mother.

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:19.978
And I was crying so hard
when I took this picture

00:01:19.978 --> 00:01:21.714
it's completely out of focus.

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:26.185
And that's Jolly's bed about
half an hour after she died.

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:28.888
<i>They're cleaning it and getting
 ready for another woman.</i>

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.323
<i> And this is, there is
 one radiation machine</i>

00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:33.460
<i>that serves four countries.</i>

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.929
<i> It works 24 hours a day.</i>

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.465
<i>This is Jessy, she was trying
 to get chemotherapy.</i>

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:42.334
<i> She had two sons and was
determined to stay alive.</i>

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:45.271
<i> But she didn't have $10
to take the bus back home</i>

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.540
<i> to see her children in
 between chemo treatments</i>

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.377
<i>so she slept outside of the
 hospital for two months.</i>

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.780
<i> She had to change her
 own bandages every day</i>

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.248
<i> because there was no one
 available to do that.</i>

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:58.851
<i> This is her finally
 getting chemo</i>

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:01.820
<i>and she is leaving the hospital
 to go see her children.</i>

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.224
<i>This is her on the bus-ride back</i>

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:06.926
<i> and her sister washing
 her when she gets home.</i>

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:10.163
<i> And this is her
 with her children.</i>

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:15.969
And Jessy died about six
months after that story.
