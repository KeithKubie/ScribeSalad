00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.580
Okay, I hope you're able to get this one right. The answer is variant 1 would

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.000
be more significant, and the reason is that

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.660
this mutation or variation, this change from a

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.830
C to an A, changes the codon from CTG, here's C T or U. G, which would

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.650
be a leucine right, the second amino acid was leucine, to an ATG, which would be

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:33.140
AUG or methianine. So now we change from a leucine up here to a methianine down

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.610
here. Leucine to methianine. But in this variation going from a CTG to a TTG.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.840
If we look over here, t. So u and then u and then g. You'll notice is still

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.240
a lusine. This codon is still a lusine just like that codon up there.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.880
So where as this is a variation, a change

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.330
from the cytosine to the thiamine. The codon is

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.920
different, but the overall amino acid produced from it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.620
is still leucine. So this is not going to be

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.959
nearly as significant a change as this one here,

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:07.880
where we get a different amino acid entirely. Remember

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.530
structure is function in the chemical world, and we

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.360
just changed the structure. Of our overall protein because

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.780
we change the amino acid.
