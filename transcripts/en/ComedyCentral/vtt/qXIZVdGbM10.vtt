00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.901
As we jump to our next game, Sugar

00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:05.271
Daddies.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.778
If your beer-gutty buddies seem
unnervingly confident these days

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.480
that's because the latest trend
sweeping the Internet is dad

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:18.951
bod, the approach to fitness
that finally gives a catchy name

00:00:18.984 --> 00:00:20.553
to being out of shape.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:23.322
Though I say if you're gonna do
it, do it all the way and aim

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:24.757
for father bod.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.260
Just go full bod-father on these
chumps.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:28.461
Like this.

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:31.597
There we go.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.732
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:34.000
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: For the
uninitiated...

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.535
&gt;&gt; The watch tan line is
beautiful.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.203
That's a nice touch.

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:41.340
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: It's like they
follow your eyes wherever you...

00:00:41.373 --> 00:00:44.477
For the... for the uninitiated,
the Web site 8BitDad went so far

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.712
as to plan out the 30-day Dad
Bod Challenge, which features

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:49.849
mostly cheat days and drinking,
because you need reminders to do

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.117
that.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.386
Uh, but I think this itinerary
is a little lacking.

00:00:53.419 --> 00:00:56.055
So what are some other days that
should be part of the Dad Bod

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:56.923
Challenge?

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.658
In 60 seconds. And begin.

00:00:58.691 --> 00:00:59.659
(bell dings)
Flula.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:04.430
&gt;&gt; Day 22, bottle your toots,
sniff your toots.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:05.598
Repeat.

00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:06.232
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:07.266
(bell dings)
Mamrie.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.470
&gt;&gt; Day 20, ask your daughter
about Zach leaving One

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:11.637
Direction.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.438
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:13.038
(bell dings)
Rove.

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.975
&gt;&gt; Day 12, order UroClub.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.510
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:18.778
(bell dings)
Rove.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:21.714
&gt;&gt; Day eight, ask your doctor if
Cialis is right for you.

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:23.116
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.384
(bell dings)
Mamrie.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.853
&gt;&gt; Day seven, have your children
regret teaching you how to text.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:27.920
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.054
(bell dings)
Flula.

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.724
&gt;&gt; Impress your daughter's
friends by telling them about

00:01:31.757 --> 00:01:34.460
the time you sat next to Steven
Seagal at the Chili's in the

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:35.928
airport.

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:37.063
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:37.964
(bell dings)
Rove.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:40.433
&gt;&gt; Day 29, fart when you
[BLEEP].

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.708
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: I've done that.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:49.709
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.311
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: There's no way to
apologize for it.

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:53.913
(bell dings)
Mamrie.

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:58.117
&gt;&gt; Uh, day six, take a bite out
of a dog treat out of sheer

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.585
curiosity.

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:00.319
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Yes, points.

00:02:00.352 --> 00:02:01.721
(bell dings)
Flula.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:04.724
&gt;&gt; Eat the dog that you just ate
the dog treat from.
