00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:12.519
I think the great thing about having students
who have really deep knowledge of math and

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.850
science in these classes is that they draw
upon that in the way that they think about

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:18.850
math and science.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.039
So it's not just about math that, you know,
happens in a textbook that lives on a piece

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.869
of paper, but math that's embodied in engineering,
math that's embodied in their lives, math

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.100
that they can kind of think about in interesting
and different ways.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.129
Same with science, you know, it's about science
in practice that they may have done from a

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.739
UROP on campus, or from some other experience
that they've had interacting with faculty

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.770
that have done research in those areas.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.989
So they can bring that to the classroom -- they
can bring their own experience and their own

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.769
passion for Math and Science.

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.239
They bring so much to the classroom.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.879
And I don't need to sort of say like, "Well,
you really need to understand what's great

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.300
about science before you understand how to
communicate that to students, or to understand

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.629
what's great about... that math is a language
that we can use in lots of ways.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.960
You need to understand that before you can
teach math."

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.140
I don't need to do any of that for the students
here, and students who come from more diverse,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.060
sort of backgrounds with their own experience
with math and science do sort of need to learn

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.060
that first.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.280
They need to understand what's great about
science; they need to understand how math

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.420
is a language that helps us understand the
world.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.210
And so I think that if I were teaching in
a different university, I'd probably need

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.740
to help students learn that first before they
actually tried to convey that to their own

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:33.240
students, and I'm fortunate enough to not
have to do that here.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.890
For most of the students, math and science
have always come really easily to them.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.590
They've sat in a room, someone's perhaps lectured
at them, and they've kind of gotten it.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.070
They can do well on the tests, and they can
move on.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.600
And, sometimes it's a struggle for them to
think about, "Why... why is this student not

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.600
getting it?

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.689
You know, the teacher told it to them just
like they told it to me, and yet I understood

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:53.689
it and this student didn't."

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.560
And it's a matter of trying to think about,
"How do you break that

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.159
down to help them understand that everybody
sort of thinks about the world differently

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.709
and thinks about their own learning differently?"
and how to accept that challenge.
