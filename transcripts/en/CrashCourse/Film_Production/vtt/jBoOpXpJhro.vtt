00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.930
Have you ever tried to take a picture of a
sunset?

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.980
How’d it turn out?

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.310
It probably looked pretty bad compared to
the real thing, right?

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.030
Now, have you ever taken a picture of your
friend, when she was lit by the sunset?

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.070
It probably looked amazing!

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.599
The sun can be so fickle.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.209
But we need it for...life.

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.610
Luckily we don’t need it for filmmaking anymore.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.449
We can recreate a sunset and make it last
for hours.

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.460
We can light a lightning storm or make a room
look like it’s lit with just a few candles,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.570
but still be able to actually see.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.419
Light can accentuate drama or playup humor
or build suspense.

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.310
And, without it, the camera literally captures
nothing.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.650
Without light, film is...radio.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.430
And the production departments that control
all the light are usually grouped together

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.379
as G&amp;E: Grip &amp; Electric.

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.220
We’ve talked about the designers who build
the mise-en-scene through sets, costumes,

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.960
hair and makeup, but the lighting design is
just as important.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.550
A blank wall can be transformed with light
and shadow.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.090
I mean, you know this –– an instagram
can be made into art by controlling light

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.090
and shadow.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.860
This is part of the reason Grip &amp; Electric
work so well together.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.920
The electricians bring in and control the
light, while the grips control the shadow.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:16.480
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.480
Both the grip and electric teams work together
as an arm of the camera team.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:25.260
The Gaffer, Best Boy Electric, and electricians
work with the cinematographer to design the lighing.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.940
And the Key Grip, Best Boy Grip, and grips
work with all the non-electrical equipment

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.250
for the lighting and camera departments.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.950
The Electrical Lighting Technicians, or ELTs,
are responsible for getting light, but also

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:36.950
power, to the set.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.080
Like almost every crew position, it’s a
mix of creativity and technical skill.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.750
When it comes to lighting, though, it’s
especially technical.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:44.930
Like, there’s math.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.240
The Electric department has to make a new
plan for every lighting set up and every location.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.250
This plan is informed by the look the director
and cinematographer want to achieve, but also

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.880
by the power that’s available on site or
from the generators they’re able to bring

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.280
So the electric team isn’t just lighting
a set.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.090
They’re also bringing power to it.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.540
A lot of power, that could be deadly if it’s
not handled safely.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.010
But who’s responsible for safety on set?

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.229
That’s easy.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.229
You are.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.350
There are too many moving parts and changing
orders on a film set for safety to not be

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.910
everyone’s priority.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.600
So, trust me when I say, if an electrician
tells you to do something on set, do it.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.030
It’s for your safety.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.980
The gaffer and the electric team have to understand
the capacity of their equipment and the power

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.480
supplies that they’re pulling from.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.140
They also need to stay up to date on technology
changes.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.410
LED lights, for example, are just starting
to be used on sets.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.070
But of course, the whole purpose of the electric
department’s technical skill is to put it

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.200
to use creatively and convincingly.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.940
It can be easy to think of light as just light,
but think of the light in an old church or

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.640
the light in a big box store.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:45.720
Different, right?

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.680
Think of a cold rainy beach or a sunny mountain
top.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.260
It’s the same sun but it looks so different.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.480
Grip and electric teams work to control light,
and one of the most important tools at their

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.980
disposal is understanding color temperature.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.910
Think again about that old church versus that
rainy beach: they’re about the same brightness,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.080
but they’re different colors.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.430
The light in the church is what we’d call
“warm”; it’s kind of orange.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.910
Whereas the light on the beach is “cool”;
looks more blue.

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.220
That’s because the light has different color
temperatures, which we measure in Kelvin, or K.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.340
Typically, outdoor lighting is around 5600K,
or what we call “daylight balanced,” because

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.480
the sun’s light is 5600K.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.590
Indoor lighting is 3200K, or “tungsten,”
because tungsten is what the filaments in

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.990
lightbulbs are made from, and it puts out
light at 3200K.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.700
Obviously, there’s a whole lot of wiggle
room between those, and the camera needs to

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.970
be set up to match the color temperature of
the lights.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.440
When you see a video that looks really orange,
it’s because the lights are tungsten but

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.340
the camera is set to daylight balance.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.350
And vice versa when the video looks really
blue.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.000
You can get bulbs that are either daylight
balanced or tungsten, but if you only have

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.610
one type of bulb to light your film inside
and out, you can change their color temperature

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.410
pretty affordably with gels.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.440
Gels are transparent color filters.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.709
They come in many colors, but they’re most
commonly used in blue or orange.

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.940
And they come in different densities, too,
depending on how much light you're working with.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.680
Once the color temperature is right for the
scene, G&amp;E still has to control how the light moves.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.180
We talked about the basic 3-point lighting
set up when we talked about cinematography.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.240
The key light, the fill light, and the back
light, or hair light, all work together to

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.400
give a scene depth and allow the audience
to feel like they’re looking at a real space,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.400
not a screen.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.589
But you don’t just put up three lights in
a triangle.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.080
The electricians and grips shape the light
to create the look the gaffer and cinematographer want.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.080
Under the direction of the gaffer, the electricians
use the lights themselves to do this, and

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.159
the grips use several tools to block and steer
the light.

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:34.379
Because, remember that fickle sun?

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.110
Light will go wherever you let it, but it
needs to be guided.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.530
The first way to do this is with different
lights.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.620
The key, fill, and hair lights usually descend
in order of intensity.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.719
The key will put out the most light, then
the fill, then the hair light.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.530
But, not all light sources are lights.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.440
Frequently, the fill light is just light from
the key light bouncing off of a white wall,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.300
a mirror, or, appropriately enough, a bounce
board.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.120
A skilled grip can aim light with a bounce
board, but beyond that, there are many more

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.270
ways to control the light.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.879
The lights themselves have barn doors that
control how much light comes through and how

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:04.999
it’s aimed.

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:08.800
Barn doors are also where you can clip your
gels, if you need them, with your trusty c-47s.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.319
G&amp;E equipment gets the best names.

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:15.900
A lot of the effort in lighting is spent trying
to avoid unwanted shadows, but sometimes you

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.979
need shadows to shape the light how you want
it.

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.639
And the grips have all the rigging and equipment
to do that.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.270
Some of the most versatile pieces of equipment
that grips use are flags mounted on to c-stands,

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.750
to block, or “cut” the light.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.979
They’ll block light for the camera, but
because the grip department oversees pretty

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.750
much all the non-electrical equipment for
the set, they’ll also block light for things

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.800
like video village.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.900
And no, that’s not the last of the DVD-rental
chains -- it’s where people who can’t

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.099
see the camera can watch video playback of
what the camera is capturing.

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:46.080
For this, the team will usually use a special
kind of flag, called a floppy, because it

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.930
has a floppy drape that can be opened to block
out more light.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.710
Flags are sometimes called cutters, too, because
they break up the light sharply.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.280
But when the shadow needs to be more subtle,
G&amp;E will use diffusion.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.439
If the electricians want to lessen the intensity
of a light, they can add diffusion to it,

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:02.419
much like how they add gels.

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.080
On some lights they can add screens called
scrims over the lens of the light.

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.280
Grips can also bring in flags called silks
to put in front of large lights to diffuse them.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.860
And really big silks are used to protect an
entire set from the sun for an outdoor scene.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.979
Indoors, grips can control the light in a
scene by using black wrap, or cinefoil, to

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:21.319
direct light or seal the windows from sunlight.

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.349
Now, not only do grips have the power to block
out the sun and build the rigging for light

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.729
and shadow, they also build and manage the
equipment for the camera department.

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.300
In fact, the ways in which the camera moves are almost all built and maintained by the grips.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.180
If it’s a locked down shot, the grips set
up the tripod.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.409
If it’s a dolly shot, grips lay the dolly
track and control the dolly movements.

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:44.569
If the shot calls for a jib or a crane, grips
build and control this movement as well.

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:49.340
Even handheld shots often rely on grips, because
the camera operator may need to be on a ladder,

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.669
which will be held by a grip, or they may
put the camera on an apple box between shots,

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:55.139
which would be provided by the grip department.

00:06:55.139 --> 00:06:59.660
And, I can’t mention this enough, just like
the electricians have be manage safety of

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.009
the electricity and cables and bulbs they’re
using, grips are always thinking about safety

00:07:04.009 --> 00:07:05.009
with equipment.

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.330
From the way a c-stand is positioned to the
way a screw is tightened, there is a protocol

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.419
and a language for everything the grips are
doing to keep everyone on set safe.

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:18.110
Two of the most common words you’ll hear
from G&amp;E are “striking” and “points.”

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.199
Striking is called when an electrician is
turning on a light.

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:24.879
It’s a courtesy for anyone on set to look
away from the bright light, but it’s also

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:27.560
a warning that something potentially dangerous
is about to happen.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.860
A fuse might blow, a bulb might break, and
by calling “striking” the crew is getting

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.860
a head’s up.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.619
Points means someone is carrying something
big and pointy.

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:36.659
Probably a c-stand.

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:38.800
So be aware and watch where you’re moving.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.779
Knowing these two words will help keep you
safe, and also keep you from being obnoxious

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:44.069
on a film set.

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:45.069
All good things!

00:07:45.069 --> 00:07:48.589
Today we learned about the electric team and
how it balances the technical and the creative

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:49.919
sides of lighting.

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:53.619
We looked at some of the equipment electricians
use to shape light and talked about safety

00:07:53.619 --> 00:07:56.309
and language associated with the electric
department.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:59.699
We also talked about the responsibilities
of the grip department and how they support

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:03.729
the electric department, the camera department,
and all the non-electric equipment being used

00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:04.979
by various departments on set.

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:09.379
Next time, we’ll get into even more movie
magic with special effects, both on camera

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:10.520
and in post production.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.509
Crash Course Film Production is produced in
association with PBS Digital Studios.
