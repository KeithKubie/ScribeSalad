00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.960
Project four is very different from
the first three projects that you have

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.830
worked on, in the sense you're not going
to be double-upping anything, right?

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.765
You are only going to be optimizing the
webpage that is already given to you.

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:13.483
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:18.710
&gt;&gt; So, project four is where
you actually get to see

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.960
how each of the events in your webpage,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.890
starting from your scripting
events to appending them and

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.500
rendering them on your website and
how much time it takes to load them and

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.610
how it's going to affect your whole
efficiency of your webpage as a whole.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.100
&gt;&gt; So the experience of your users.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.257
You know that feeling when
you scroll on a webpage and

00:00:44.257 --> 00:00:48.241
it's just dragging or
it's kind of slow and lags?

00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:50.985
It's a really unpleasant experience.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:51.485
&gt;&gt; That's true.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:57.045
&gt;&gt; And the best websites are those that
feel really smooth and are very usable.

00:00:57.045 --> 00:00:59.725
So this is part of that usability.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:02.535
And people's patience,
with high speed Internet, man,

00:01:02.535 --> 00:01:04.155
we just expect things really quickly.

00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:04.944
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:01:04.944 --> 00:01:10.180
&gt;&gt; And so,
optimization helps you make it look like

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.020
everything is much smoother and faster
just by being really efficient and

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.990
organized and methodical with the way
that we load our page and contents and

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.140
render everything in the proper order.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.580
Also learn about caching.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.900
&gt;&gt; For project four, it's important to
know there are kind of two major parts.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:38.044
The first major part of project four
is getting a good PageSpeed score.

00:01:38.044 --> 00:01:38.762
So, you have ngrok.

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:42.503
So, if you run your server
on your own computer,

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:45.437
you can then use ngrok to tunnel that.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:48.621
So that then you'll get an actual URL,

00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:52.590
which on the web you
can plug into sites.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.965
Or you can also use GitHub
to make a bio page.

00:01:54.965 --> 00:01:55.710
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.237
&gt;&gt; And plug that in if you don't want
to run a server on your own computer.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.280
And there's lots of instructions and
good suggestions on PageSpeed Insights

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.940
to tell you how to optimize your page
and you can also apply a lot things

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.960
you've learned about minimizing the
critical rendering path in the course.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.680
So through a combination of following
the suggestions on that page and

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.595
what you learned in the course,
you can increase your page score,

00:02:24.595 --> 00:02:31.890
Insights score, to above 90 on both your
mobile and desktop version of your page.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.920
The second part of the project Involves
really getting into the JavaScript.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.740
I mean so once you've done all
the things that you learned about in

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.780
the course in order to
make your page run faster.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.800
And sometimes it's actually your
JavaScript that slows you down and so

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.510
we've created some Cam's Pizzeria,
is a sort of fictitious webpage.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.333
Somebody who wants to sell
these outlandish pizzas.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:03:02.110
They're actually pretty funny
if you read the descriptions.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.470
And you're supposed to
make that page faster.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.350
And in that case it's
actually the JavaScript.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.470
So take all your great JavaScripting
skills that you learned in OOJS and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.008
apply them to that pizza webpage and
see if you can optimize it.

00:03:17.008 --> 00:03:20.188
You're really looking at the Java code,
trying to speed it up.

00:03:20.188 --> 00:03:22.625
We've given you,
just try it first yourself and

00:03:22.625 --> 00:03:24.414
we've given you a lot of hints too.

00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:28.010
If you look at the office hours and you
find a lot of the extra documentation

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.890
we've created, it should point
you in the right direction.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.210
It's a good exercise to just
try it yourself first and

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.350
see what is inefficient about the code.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.502
And then if you get stuck,
maybe look at more of the documentation

00:03:39.502 --> 00:03:42.430
we've provided to sort
of get you all the way.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.320
&gt;&gt; I think the next two parts of
the rubric is just on commons and

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.350
documentation.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.730
Which is also a very
big part [CROSSTALK].

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.712
&gt;&gt; Very important,
not just within Udacity,

00:03:55.712 --> 00:04:00.631
not just for your projects, but-
&gt;&gt; [CROSSTALK] Through

00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:02.040
your career, yeah.

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.968
&gt;&gt; You communicate with people and
it's so

00:04:04.968 --> 00:04:09.470
much easier when you add commons and
make your code readable.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.070
So I think the next three
sections are the code quality.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.248
So in this project, mostly you're just
editing code that's been given to you.

00:04:17.248 --> 00:04:24.060
So make sure that the parts that
where you do edit is readable.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.601
The indications are the same or
appropriate indications in the sense as

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:32.440
you go through it and
comments where you made changes.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:33.890
And then they readme,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:37.930
we want to know exactly how you
want us to work with your project.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:38.680
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.491
&gt;&gt; If you are hosting it on GitHub.io,
we want to know the website and

00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:46.360
we want to know anything
else that you may have done.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.599
If you use Grunt and Gulp,
let us know that you have used it and

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.943
just list out the optimizations
that you made.

00:04:53.943 --> 00:04:57.332
&gt;&gt; That's true, yeah,
on some of the students,

00:04:57.332 --> 00:05:01.911
actually it's not very necessary
to list out optimizations but

00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:06.090
why we stress on it is because
the main .jsfile is so long.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:13.120
It's huge and we are only going to check
specific areas that need optimization.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.480
Which are the two fixes that Cameron
has already asked you guys to work on.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.810
So, yes, definitely, we are going
to look through your main .js and

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.810
see if you made changes to it.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.740
But it will help if we have a quick
bullet in the readme saying hey,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.280
this is the part in this file that
I've got I mean part and change on.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.469
So you can refer to it in main.js file,
but

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:41.341
you can also add bullets in your readme,
that would make things so

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:45.694
much easier for us and
make us grade your projects faster.

00:05:45.694 --> 00:05:50.897
&gt;&gt; And don't ignore that readme
part because, I don't think anybody

00:05:50.897 --> 00:05:55.590
over here likes to send submissions
bak for that one reason.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.760
&gt;&gt; It's very difficult to see that
you've performed optimization,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.450
it's great.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.820
You've used these built tools,
it looks perfect and

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.790
we don't want to send back just
because you forget comments or readme.

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:16.140
Because yeah, it's a very important
part of your work as a programmer.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.760
Any sort of field, any sort of
programming language that you use, yes,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.250
do not forget to comment or
add a documentation of your work.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.680
&gt;&gt; And you're not using GitHub.io
we do want to see instructions

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.830
on how you want us to host your website
over the Internet and check it.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.857
So I guess-
&gt;&gt; I had students use LAN servers as

00:06:40.857 --> 00:06:45.327
well in their project,
so they have had several

00:06:45.327 --> 00:06:50.381
different methods to actually
host their webpages.

00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:52.250
But do let us know you use.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.340
&gt;&gt; What you're used to.
