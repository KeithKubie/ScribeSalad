that was cited in the award so I'm going
 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.810
that was cited in the award so I'm going
to talk about behavior a welfare and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820
to talk about behavior a welfare and
 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.680
to talk about behavior a welfare and
poverty there are some themes that I

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690
poverty there are some themes that I
 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.720
poverty there are some themes that I
want to highlight from the beginning one

of them is perhaps the overriding thing
that gains that has guided a tremendous

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730
that gains that has guided a tremendous
 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.440
that gains that has guided a tremendous
amount of my work over the years which

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450
amount of my work over the years which
 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.199
amount of my work over the years which
is inquiring into policy that makes

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209
is inquiring into policy that makes
 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.590
is inquiring into policy that makes
people people better off that can

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600
people people better off that can
 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.250
people people better off that can
improve well-being if you think about

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260
improve well-being if you think about
 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.050
improve well-being if you think about
this in the context of global poverty

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060
this in the context of global poverty
 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.660
this in the context of global poverty
for example the problem here I think is

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670
for example the problem here I think is
 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.729
for example the problem here I think is
not that there's any lack of tools and

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739
not that there's any lack of tools and
 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.590
not that there's any lack of tools and
policies there are many many policies

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600
policies there are many many policies
 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.110
policies there are many many policies
out there for whom advocates believe

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
out there for whom advocates believe
 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.789
out there for whom advocates believe
that they can make the world a better

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799
that they can make the world a better
 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.770
that they can make the world a better
place but the key thing here is using

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780
place but the key thing here is using
 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.100
place but the key thing here is using
measurement as honest scorekeeping to

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110
measurement as honest scorekeeping to
 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.479
measurement as honest scorekeeping to
find out whether something is actually

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489
find out whether something is actually
 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.940
find out whether something is actually
working or whether it's not working at

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950
working or whether it's not working at
 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.310
working or whether it's not working at
all and one of the themes I'll emphasize

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320
all and one of the themes I'll emphasize
 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.070
all and one of the themes I'll emphasize
throughout is the enormous importance of

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080
throughout is the enormous importance of
 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.009
throughout is the enormous importance of
measurement almost by itself we're

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019
measurement almost by itself we're
 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.120
measurement almost by itself we're
always told there's no measurement

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130
always told there's no measurement
 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.940
always told there's no measurement
without theory and while that's true

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950
without theory and while that's true
 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.320
without theory and while that's true
it's more true just to say that

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330
it's more true just to say that
 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.270
it's more true just to say that
measurement is incredibly important and

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280
measurement is incredibly important and
 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.300
measurement is incredibly important and
it's often forgotten in economics just

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310
it's often forgotten in economics just
 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.610
it's often forgotten in economics just
how important measurement is the other

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620
how important measurement is the other
 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.080
how important measurement is the other
theme I'm going to talk about throughout

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090
theme I'm going to talk about throughout
 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.620
theme I'm going to talk about throughout
is individuals versus aggregates or

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630
is individuals versus aggregates or
 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.250
is individuals versus aggregates or
averages in a world in which you work

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260
averages in a world in which you work
 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.199
averages in a world in which you work
entirely on averages if you look at the

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209
entirely on averages if you look at the
 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.530
entirely on averages if you look at the
macro economy things like inequality and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540
macro economy things like inequality and
 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.000
macro economy things like inequality and
poverty are simply not legible without

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010
poverty are simply not legible without
 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.880
poverty are simply not legible without
disaggregation without the details of

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890
disaggregation without the details of
 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.580
disaggregation without the details of
individuals the other thing is even if

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590
individuals the other thing is even if
 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.620
individuals the other thing is even if
you're only interested in the aggregate

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630
you're only interested in the aggregate
 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.010
you're only interested in the aggregate
me distribution clearly matters for

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020
me distribution clearly matters for
 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.750
me distribution clearly matters for
aggregate economic activity and

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:55.760
aggregate economic activity and
 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.600
aggregate economic activity and
certainly for any serious analysis of

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610
certainly for any serious analysis of
 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.260
certainly for any serious analysis of
well-being finally we know that behavior

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270
well-being finally we know that behavior
 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.820
well-being finally we know that behavior
and well-being are linked for

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830
and well-being are linked for
 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.650
and well-being are linked for
individuals they're not linked for

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660
individuals they're not linked for
 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.390
individuals they're not linked for
aggregate so what you see from the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400
aggregate so what you see from the
 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.460
aggregate so what you see from the
macroeconomy doesn't necessarily tell

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470
macroeconomy doesn't necessarily tell
 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.800
macroeconomy doesn't necessarily tell
you by itself whether people are doing

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810
you by itself whether people are doing
 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.700
you by itself whether people are doing
better or doing worse there's a theme

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710
better or doing worse there's a theme
 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.590
better or doing worse there's a theme
which runs through a lot of my work in

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600
which runs through a lot of my work in
 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.840
which runs through a lot of my work in
which is being challenged and I'm

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850
which is being challenged and I'm
 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.210
which is being challenged and I'm
sympathetic to that challenge which is

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220
sympathetic to that challenge which is
 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.520
sympathetic to that challenge which is
that if people by and large behave in

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530
that if people by and large behave in
 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.920
that if people by and large behave in
their own interests than by looking at

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930
their own interests than by looking at
 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.960
their own interests than by looking at
their behavior we can infer quite a lot

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970
their behavior we can infer quite a lot
 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.820
their behavior we can infer quite a lot
about how they are doing

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830
about how they are doing
 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.650
about how they are doing
it's what economists called revealed

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660
it's what economists called revealed
 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.230
it's what economists called revealed
preference analysis and it's always been

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240
preference analysis and it's always been
 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.550
preference analysis and it's always been
long been the standard in economics I'm

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560
long been the standard in economics I'm
 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.680
long been the standard in economics I'm
going to start at the very oldest stuff

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690
going to start at the very oldest stuff
 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.240
going to start at the very oldest stuff
and come up to stuff I've been doing

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250
and come up to stuff I've been doing
 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.610
and come up to stuff I've been doing
relatively recently and then move back

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620
relatively recently and then move back
 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.970
relatively recently and then move back
more chronologically so starting with

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980
more chronologically so starting with

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.820
know with surveys is you want to know
how people respond to prices and I'm

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:37.830
how people respond to prices and I'm
 

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.339
how people respond to prices and I'm
going to talk about that quite a bit

00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:40.349
going to talk about that quite a bit
 

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:42.800
going to talk about that quite a bit
normally you can't do that from surveys

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:42.810
normally you can't do that from surveys
 

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.480
normally you can't do that from surveys
but some surveys collect data on

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:44.490
but some surveys collect data on
 

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:46.640
but some surveys collect data on
quantities as well as expenditures so

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:46.650
quantities as well as expenditures so
 

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.380
quantities as well as expenditures so
you know for a household that they

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:48.390
you know for a household that they
 

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:50.329
you know for a household that they
bought three kilos of rice and paid so

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339
bought three kilos of rice and paid so
 

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:52.430
bought three kilos of rice and paid so
much for it over the last week so you

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440
much for it over the last week so you
 

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.680
much for it over the last week so you
can get some idea of how much they paid

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:54.690
can get some idea of how much they paid
 

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.990
can get some idea of how much they paid
for each kilo and you can use that to

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000
for each kilo and you can use that to
 

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.110
for each kilo and you can use that to
analyze responses to prices across

larger than short-run responses this is
 

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.280
