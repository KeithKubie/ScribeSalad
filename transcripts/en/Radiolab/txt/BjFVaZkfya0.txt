Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio lab from [inaudible], w.N y. S. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab, the podcast chest. So today on radio lab

Speaker 2:          00:20          we've got a shorty for you, but it's like it's a good, it's a good thing. Yup. We're going to introduce you to two different,

Speaker 3:          00:25          I am a v S Ramachandran at the University of California San Diego. I direct the center for brain and cognition there.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Okay. My name is Dr Carol Berman. I'm at NYU Medical Center. I'm a psychiatrist. So there's, there are two folks and they're going to tell you two different stories

Speaker 3:          00:40          that really, it's the same story, just two different versions of it in a way. That's right. That's right. Can we start with Carol Berman?

Speaker 2:          00:48          So my patient, who is this 37 year old patient comes back to her house and sits next to this man who's wearing a red plaid shirt, trucking boots. And this woman looks at this man, doesn't quite know what to make of them. I think the gene she recognized and the boots and she takes a look at him and says, who are you? And he says to her, well, who are you? Come over here. Give me a kiss. So she leans in little tentatively gives him a kiss, but it feels wrong. Everything about this situation feels wrong. She was thinking this was some strange man who is sitting here in a, you know her husband's clothing. This did not look like her husband to her and she was wondering what he was doing in her apartment.

Speaker 3:          01:32          Okay, so that is one story. And now we want you to hear a second story. This one comes from Dr v S Rameshchandra. I saw a patient not long ago, was in coma, two weeks, came out of the coma, a student on our campus, intelligent, quite articulate, a little bit slow down, but overall quite intact. But here's the problem. When he looks at his mother, he says, doctor, who is this woman? This woman looks exactly like my mother, but she's an impostor and imposter. She is an impostor. She some other woman pretending to be my mother. No. Is this person coming into his in his actual is his mother and of course this is very alarming to the parents. Sometimes it's still spills over to the father. Okay. It's usually somebody very close to you and he has nothing else wrong with him. He just doesn't think that his mother is really his mother. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:21          This person looked like her husband, but there was something off like what? There was something about him. Some essence like the feeling you have was towards someone when you see them, right. The feeling or the essence of the person, the soul of the person isn't in there.

Speaker 4:          02:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:39          so it turns out that these two people are suffering from the same delusion, delusion, pronounced like cop grass', very rare cop named [inaudible], g r a. S are these kinds of cup grass delusions appear sometimes with brain injuries where certain kinds of dementia or sometimes just out of the blue, but the result is almost always

Speaker 2:          03:00          that you feel like your left ones have been replaced

Speaker 3:          03:03          by imposters.

Speaker 2:          03:06          No, still no one knows the underlying cause and there are lots of different ways to explain it. We explain it psychologically, there might be some negative aspects of the person that you don't want to recognize. Like maybe my patient, you know, saw some negative things in her husband that she didn't want to recognize. So when the negative aspects came in, he had to be a completely different person for her too because she couldn't, you know what I mean? On some level you think it's a kind of denial, right? So it'd be like Robert, if, if there was something about you that I just couldn't handle and every time that thing appeared, whatever it is, the only way I could deal with it psychologically was to make a break and to say, oh, well that's not the Robert I know. Therefore it isn't Robert at all. It's some fraud. Yeah, it's a fake. But if you think there's some psychological basis when you try and treat that psychological cause or whatever it is we do. But we don't get too far. We tried this stuff, but when a person starts breaking from reality and become psychotic, you could take a fingerprints, you could show them everything about the person and you can't get any place.

Speaker 3:          04:09          I think what's happening is something quite specific. You can explain this in terms of the known circuitry in the brain, the visual centers of the brain funneling information to the fusiform gyrus. But you recognize your mother or a dog or a table, a chair, because this a stranger is a Jo. Is that my mom? Is a dog, is that Fifi? Then the message goes to the Migdal of its cages, the emotional significance, emotional and relevance of what you're looking at for you. So wait, so, so to cap, to make that into a normal English mom is a face I recognized as mom any set of feelings that I associate with my correct. Absolutely. Now what happens is in this patient, because of the head injury, that wire is cut. So then no mommy feeling no mommy feelings. So you say, my, my God, this is my mom.

Speaker 3:          04:51          She looks like my mum, but what I'm doing, I know feelings. There's something really weird here. She must be an impostor. Now, that's a very farfetched delusion. Why doesn't she just say she doesn't feel like mom, but of course she's my mom and why doesn't he do that to be sure? Sometimes that happens, but most often he says, not my mom, because our thought processes are much more dependent on our gut level, emotional feelings. Then we realized, so absent a feeling, a familiar feeling of mom, some part of my brain says, that's your mother, and some part of me says, no, it can't be. And the deal that the brain works out is a deal that creates this fiction. It's an imposter because that solves the problem and the equation that says it can't be. It was from your emotions wins. But now here's the twist.

Speaker 3:          05:37          Now if she goes to the next room, speaks to them on the phone, he says, mom, where are you? How are you? It's wonderful to talk to you, Huh? All the emotions come flooding back and he is not delusional, right? Why would that be? And are literally, she comes to the room, he says, who are you? You look just like my mother, but you're not my mother. So seeing the face seems to set off this problem. The reason is, does a separate wire going from the auditory regions in the brain to the Amygdala emotional centers? That wire was not cut. So what you hear can be very familiar, but if you see it, then you got a problem. When people ask me, how come? What if she just Keke? What if she comes and talks to him? Right? What was the, why doesn't the hearing kick in and say, look, she is your mother. The answer is she our brains. There's a hierarchy of of priorities. You're highly visual creatures. We pay much more attention division, give much more weight to vision, dental hearing and to voice. Huh? So you say this is an imposter. She sounds a little bit like my mother. I don't know why, but she's obviously an impostor rather than she doesn't look like my mother, but has my mother's voice.

Speaker 2:          06:49          You tell me if you don't feel comfortable talking about this, but I understand that you have personal experience with cap grass dilutions. Yeah. Actually my husband, he started not recognizing other people first and then at some points I didn't even think I was his wife. I'm very stressed out with this whole situation because my husband was a charming, intelligent, wonderful person in all ways. And his dementia has been getting worse and worse. Yeah, you're a psychiatrist. So does, does your understanding of how that might work in the brain change your experience of it in some way? Well, no, it can't really change your feeling because you know, when I get home and I'd like to, and I get home, I kiss my husband and say hi, how are you today? And I hope he's recognized. I May and if he doesn't, you know, I feel terrible. I couldn't, after a hard day's work, I want to be able to hug him and kiss him and you know, have a nice friendly environment when I get back. But you never know what you're going to get when you get back home.
