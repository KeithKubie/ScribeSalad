00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.190
Kids are pretty amazing.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.920
They absorb languages like talkative sponges
while I’m still struggling to nail down

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.920
english.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.020
How do that do they do?

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.110
Hey you whippersnappers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.180
I’m just gonna come right out and say it:
kids are dumb.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.450
Most of them don’t know the first thing
about quantum mechanics or brain surgery.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.550
But my goodness do they pick things up quick.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.950
What’s their secret?

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.039
You may be tempted to think it’s because
their brains are growing.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.460
I mean, you look at a kid’s head and there’s
just not a lot of brain you can fit in there,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.679
so maybe children are generating more brain
cells until they become adults?

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:34.579
Well, that might be a small part of it.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:39.780
You’re already born with oodles of noodles,
around 100 billion, about as many brain cells

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.699
as you’re going to have for your whole life.

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.360
You will add more to your olfactory bulb,
prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.071
By age two though you only keep making new
neurons in your hippocampus, the part of the

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:52.409
brain associated with memory and learning.

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.420
It’s possible this neurogenesis is partly
responsible for why kids pick up new things

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.589
so fast.

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.449
Still the most significant thing about a child’s
brain development isn’t the number of neurons,

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.159
it’s their organization.

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:08.110
A baby is born with very few synapses connecting
neurons, but by age two or three they’ll

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.580
have more than twice as many than they will
have as an adult.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.160
This period is called Exuberant Synaptogenesis.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.710
Your brain will actually prune back the number
of connections because it just doesn’t need

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.180
so many once you’re a functioning adult
and set in your ways.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.850
Before that though, your brains wires get
more tangled up than headphones in your pocket.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.350
Your brain as an adult becomes more efficient,
with different parts of the brain being connected

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.990
a long way apart.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.040
Children on the other hand use neurons that
are more clustered together.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.160
This is why children are so creative: their
brains experiment with different configurations

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.920
before settling on a structure.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.530
So during these early stages when the brain
is so plastic, children absorb everything.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.030
Language is a notable example.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.970
When a baby hears speech, the neurons in the
relevant parts of its brain form more synapses.

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.840
The more they hear speech, the stronger those
connections become.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.100
It’s why their vocabulary quadruples in
size between the ages of one and two.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.040
I think it’s also why they pick up foul
language so well, too.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.060
Ever swear around a toddler?

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.180
It’s the only word they’ll say for the
rest of the day.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.520
But don’t pardon their french, because at
early ages kids pick up new languages accent-free:

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.039
there are multiple neural pathways so their
brains don’t get locked into one pronunciation

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.039
pattern.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.460
After their first year though, babies lose
the ability to distinguish the sounds of foreign

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.460
languages.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.810
Don’t get disheartened if you’re an adult
trying to learn a new language though.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.490
You’re still perfectly capable of doing
it with time and effort, you’re just going

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.010
to have to accept that you’re probably going
to have an accent.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.710
Speaking multiple languages will help you
communicate with much bigger audiences, but

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.959
you still need to reach them somehow, like,
say, through the internet.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.930
No domain extension will help you tell your
story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.690
from Domain Dot Com.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.560
And because you watch DNews, you can get 15%

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.060
by using the code DNews when you check out.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.600
There are some pitfalls to avoid when learning
a new language though.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.680
Trace helps you out here.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:01.740
Did you learn a second language as a kid,
or pick one up as an adult?

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.850
What was it like for you?
