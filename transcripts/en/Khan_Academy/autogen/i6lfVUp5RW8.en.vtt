00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.500
 There are two whole videos of Canadian Academy on 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.320
 the standard record and why we are interested. 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.800
 There are also some examples. 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.770
 In this video I want to use the algebra collection 1 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:19.960
 from ck12.org and make some examples of a standard entry. 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.460
 Let's take some things written 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.690
 with standard recording. 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.980
 Just as a reminder, the standard record is useful because 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.180
 allows us to write either very large or too many 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.220
 a small number, in ways that are close to our brains, 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.120
 first - recording, and second - understanding. 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.800
 Let's write some numbers. 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.900
 For example, 3,102 by 10? 2. 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.510
 I want to write it as a numerical value. 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.720
 It's already done with a standard record. 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.840
 It is written as a work of a number and 10 of a second degree. 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.310
 How do I write this? 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.750
 just like an ordinary number? 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.520
 There is a slow and fast way. 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.410
 The slow way is to say, this is the same thing as 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:09.540
 3,102 by 100, which means if you multiply 3,102 by 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.040
 100, will be 3,1,0,2 with two zeros in the back. 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.670
 Then we have 1,2,3 numbers after the decimal point, 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.260
 and this will be the right answer. 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.230
 This is equal to 310.2. 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.570
 The faster way to do is simply say: Look, 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.510
 now I only have 3 before the decimal point. 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.180
 Taking something from 10 to the second degree, 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.070
 I will move the decimal point to 2 to the right. 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.400
 3,102 at 10 ^ 2 is the same thing ... 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.260
 if I replace the decimal character with 2 because 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.920
 this is 10 at second degree ... this 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.090
 is the same thing as 310.2. 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.920
 This is perhaps a quick way to do this. 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.490
 Each time you multiply by 10, you shift the decimal point 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.840
 to the right with 1. 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.919
 Let's make another example. 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:14.910
 Let's say I have 7.4 at 10 ^ 4. 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.030
 Let's do it quickly. 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.560
 Let's shift the decimal point with 4 to the right. 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.560
 7.4 at 10 ^ 4. 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.400
 At 10 ^ 1, you will get 74. 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.050
 Then at 10 ^ 2, you will get 740. 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.080
 We will have to add 0 here because we have to 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.500
 we shift the decimal point. 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.710
 10 per third, you will have 7,400. 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.390
 Then 10-4, you will have 74,000. 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.825
 Notice, I took the decimal point 

00:02:43.825 --> 00:02:49.230
 I moved 1, 2, 3, 4 characters. 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.130
 That's about 74,000. 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.410
 If I had 74 and I had to move the decimal point by 1 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.920
 to the right, I had to put 0 here. 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.820
 I multiply it by 10. 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.760
 Another way to think about it is that I need 10 intervals 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.420
 between the leading figure and the decimal point. 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.250
 Right here I only have 1 position. 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.820
 I need 4 intervals. 1, 2, 3, 4. 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.670
 Let's take a few more examples because I think the more 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.230
 examples, the better you will understand what is happening. 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:26.590
 I have 1.75 at 10 in grade -3. 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.050
 This is the standard record I just want to write 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.800
 the numerical value of this. 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.360
 When you multiply something by 10 in the negative, 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.250
 you shift the decimal point to the left. 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.130
 That's 1.75. 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.550
 If you multiply it by 10 degrees -1. 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.330
 you will go 1 with the left. 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.940
 But if you multiply it by 10 at -2, you go 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.570
 left with 2. 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.130
 And you will have to put here 0. 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.670
 If you multiply it by 10 to -3, you will go 3 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.160
 left and you'll need to add another 0. 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.860
 Move the decimal character 1, 2, 3 to the left. 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.440
 Our answer will be 0.00175, which is the same thing as 1.75 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.560
 10 at grade -3. 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.519
 We can check if we have the right answer, 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.870
 if ... the unit is here if we count 1, 1 inclusive, 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.310
 and the zeros to the right of the decimal character that should be equal to 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.880
 the negative degree here. 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.150
 You have 1, 2, 3 numbers after the decimal point. 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.520
 This is the same thing as the -3 degree. 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.030
 You get thousands, this is 1 thousand. 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:41.330
 Let's do another example. 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.230
 Actually, let's mix them. 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.710
 Let's start with something that is written as a number, 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.250
 and then write it down with a standard record. 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.860
 Let's say I have 120,000. 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.430
 It's just a numeric value and I want to write it 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.270
 with standard recording. 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:01.490
 I can write this as ... I take the lead figure - 1.2 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.910
 times on ... just count how many characters 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:07.680
 after the leading figure. 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.760
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.270
 1.2 times 10-5. 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.650
 To understand logic, 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.950
 10-5 is 10,000. 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.390
 1,2 ... 10-5 is 100,000. 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.970
 This is 1.2 times ... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:29.900
 You got 5 zeros. 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.580
 That's 10 ^ 5. 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.230
 1.2 per 100,000 will be 120,000. 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.890
 It will be 1 and 1/5 per 100,000, or 120,000. 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.400
 I hope you do not despair. 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.030
 Let's do another. 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.840
 Let's say the numerical value is 1 765 244. 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.150
 I want to write this with a standard record, I take it 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.430
 the leading figure, 1, I place the decimal point. 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.050
 And everything else after the decimal point - 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.530
 7, 6, 5, 2, 4, 4. 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.460
 And then you count how many numbers there are between 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.920
 the leading figure ... I guess you can imagine 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.640
 the first decimal place. 

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.720
 Because there could be numbers that continue here. 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.370
 Between the leading figure and the decimal point. 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:19.080
 You have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 characters. 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.310
 This at 10 ^ 6. 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.620
 10 ^ 6 is just 1 million. 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.200
 That's 1,765,224 per million, which is logical. 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.750
 Approximately 1.7 million per million is approximately 1.7 million. 

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.260
 That's a little more than 1.7 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.970
 million is therefore logical. 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.360
 Let's do another. 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.730
 How to write 12 with a standard record? 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.120
 The same exercise. 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.430
 Equals to 1.2 ... we have only one digit 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.875
 between 1 and the decimal point. 

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:54.900
 This is 1.2 by 10 ^ 1, or 1.2 by 10, 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.540
 which is definitely equal to 12. 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.230
 Let's do a few examples in which we have 10 on 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:01.530
 negative. 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:08.480
 Let's say we have 0.00281 and we want to write this 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.450
 with standard recording. 

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.850
 What you have to do is just think 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:21.010
 how many digits are to include the leader 

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.365
 figure in value? 

00:07:22.365 --> 00:07:26.750
 What I mean is to list 1,2,3. 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.980
 The thing we want to do is move 

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:32.040
 the decimal point with 1, 2, 3 places. 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.710
 One way of thinking is that you can multiply. 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.220
 To move the decimal point to the right with 3 spaces, 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.200
 you can multiply by 10 ^ 3. 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.170
 But if you multiply something by 10 ^ 3, 

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:43.340
 you change its value. 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:47.440
 You have to multiply by 10 to -3. 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.090
 That way you will not change the value, do you? 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.920
 If I multiply it by 10 ^ 3, 10 on a negative 2 ... 3 ... 

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.440
 minus 3 is 0 ... this is exactly like the multiplication of 1. 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.820
 What will be equal? 

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.420
 If I take the decimal point and move it with 3 spaces to the right, 

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.510
 this part here will be 2.81. 

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:10.880
 Then we stay with that 1, 10 at 

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.720
 negative grade 3. 

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.770
 A very quick way to do is to say: Let's 

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.860
 count ... including the leading figure ... how many positions 

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:19.970
 I have the decimal point. 

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.440
 1, 2, 3. 

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.060
 Will be equal to 2.81 at 10 on 

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.430
 negative 1, 2, 3 degree. 

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.470
 Let's do another one like that. 

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.080
 Let me move up. 

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.520
 Let's do another one like that. 

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:43.240
 Let's say I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ... how many zeros I have 

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.750
 in this task? 

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:45.030
 I'll think of something. 

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.240
 0, 2, 7. 

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.830
 We want to write this with a standard record. 

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.540
 Count all items to 

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.380
 2, after the decimal point. 

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:57.610
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:01.870
 This will be 2.7 by 10 at 

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.460
 the negative 8 degree. 

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.270
 Let's make another where to start 

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.840
 with the standard record and we want to go 

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.760
 to the numerical value. 

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:13.690
 Just to mix things up. 

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:17.190
 Let's have 2,9 by 10 on 

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.830
 grade -5. 

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.360
 One way of thinking is: the leading figure, plus all 

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.110
 zeros to the left of the decimal point, 

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.980
 are 5 characters. 

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:29.600
 When you have 2 and 9 then you will 

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.170
 you got 4 more zeros. 

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.450
 1, 2, 3, 4. 

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.140
 And you get your decimal mark. 

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:39.610
 How do I know about 4 zeros? 

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:45.370
 Because the numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 positions after 

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:48.510
 the decimal point, including the leading figure. 

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:52.600
 That's 0.00029. 

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.670
 To check, do it another way. 

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.110
 How do I write this with a standard record? 

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:03.310
 I count all the characters, all zeros after 

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.050
 the decimal character, including the leading non-zero digit. 

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.330
 I have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 characters. 

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.725
 This is 10 of the negative 5. 

00:10:12.725 --> 00:10:20.590
 It will be 2.9 at 10 in grade -5. 

00:10:20.590 --> 00:10:23.230
 Once again, this is not simple 

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.450
 a kind of black magic. 

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.270
 There is logic in that. 

00:10:27.270 --> 00:10:30.920
 If I wanted to make that figure at 2.9, what I was going to do 

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:37.310
 to do is to shift the decimal point with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 positions in this way. 

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:43.010
 And to move the decimal point to the right with 5 places ... 

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:47.700
 let's say 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 9. 

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:51.670
 If I multiply it by 10 ^ 5, I will have to 

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.700
 multiply by 10 ^ (-5). 

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.230
 I do not want to change the number. 

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.060
 This is just a multiplication of something 1. 

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.790
 10 -5 in 10 (-5) is 1. 

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:07.910
 Indeed, this will move here 

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.850
 the decimal point 5 to the right. 

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:12.700
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.660
 That will be 2.5 and we will stay after that 

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.310
 10 (-5). 

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.640
 Still, I hope you find this exercise 

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.980
 for the standard recording as useful.
