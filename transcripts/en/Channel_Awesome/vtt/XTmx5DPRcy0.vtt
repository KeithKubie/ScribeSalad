00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.320
NC: I really hope you people appreciate what I do for you,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.120
cause let me tell you, it's not always easy.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.800
The stupid ass shit I have to sit through is JUST...

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.400
Well, it's not always fun.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.900
I mean, a bad movie is one thing. That's like two hours.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.560
But to watch episode upon episode of manufactured pwecious shit,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.680
or pweshit as I like to call it,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.480
Quite often, it's just more than I can bear.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.980
The only upside I have is that I can share my misery with the people who requested it in the first place.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.000
With that said:

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.160
Full House.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.980
♪Whatever happened to predictability?♪

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.360
For those of you blessed without the knowledge of this show,

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.500
I'll fill you in.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.840
Full House ran in the late 80's and early 90's on ABC's Friday lineup, TGiF.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.880
Which usually had about four family-friendly sitcoms

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.400
that always got called back to our depressing reality by ending with 20/20.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.340
Thank you, Hugh Downs.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.460
Full House often started off the lineup, with it's cutesy-wootesy, non-threatening

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.400
as well as not-funny humor, and actually ended up lasting for eight seasons.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.780
Eight Season.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.400
That is SHIT!

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.280
I can't last eight minutes watching this trite, how the hell did they last eight seasons?!

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.960
I mean, it's a genuine mystery! Nobody liked the show, so how the hell did it do so well?

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.340
Well, let's...

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.560
Swallow our dignity and tried to find out.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.640
So we get a typical mid-80's opening, where people at the time just love to fold their arms,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.080
laugh, and smile, hoping coincidentally for their credits to appear below them while a gender-confused

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.240
doo-wop band sings about the quirks of life.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.360
♪Everywhere you look, (everywhere you go)
There's a heart (there's a heart)♪

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.260
Ahh, those were the days.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.740
I especially love this image of a cutesy scenario going on while we stare at a gigantic prison.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.780
If that's not symbolic, I dunno what is.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.300
So, what's the story you're pleading me not to tell you?

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.760
Well, the world's raunchiest family icon, Bob Saget, plays a character named Dan,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.660
who just lost his wife to the always horrible...

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.560
[Insert name here] disease.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.240
He lives in San Francisco with his three daughters,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.140
DJ, Stephanie, and Michelle,

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.500
played by the pair of twins often mistaken for talented, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.580
But raising three girls is tough, so Dan calls upon a guitar-player who's not cool and a comedian who's not funny.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.100
The mullet-bimbos here are known as Jesse, played by John Stamos, who's also Dan's brother-in-law,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.400
and Joey, played by Dave Coulier.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.600
And if you think there's anything odd about three prissy guys living in a house with no women,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.940
you've clearly never been to San Francisco.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.720
So how bad is this show?

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.660
Well, let's take a look at the very first joke in the very first episode...

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.200
Woman: *sighs* The baby's sleeping like a baby.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.340
[Laughter]

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.020
And it's all downhill from there.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.340
I mean, I've watched several episodes and not one of these jokes made me laugh. NOT ONE!

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.160
I didn't even giggle at the sheer stupidity of them! Isn't that like, statistically impossible?!

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.060
I should've laughed at least once!

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.440
But talking about it doesn't help. Let's take a closer look at these characters.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.600
Jesse, for example, is a tough guy

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.880
(well, as tough as a pile of Fonzie's hand-me-downs can look).

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.900
Michelle: Let's play "ballerina!"

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.280
Jesse: How do you play "ballerina?"

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.680
Michelle: Catch me!

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.980
Oh!

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:10.940
Jesse: Oh! Okay?

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:11.960
Michelle: Turn around.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.620
On your tippy-toes!

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.600
Jesse: Tippy-toes, right.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.680
NC: This was written, people.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:23.920
Joey is a silly comedian always making wisecracks and punchlines that, quite frankly, make you want to castrate yourself.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.820
Joey: *Imitates Popeye*

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.980
*Imitates cartoon sound effects*

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.960
[Laughter]

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.540
NC: You know the guy from the Police Academy movies? The one that did all the incredible sound effects?

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.120
Dave Coulier is nothing like that guy.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.540
Joey: *Imitating Kermit* Hi, Michelle! It's me, Kermit the Frog.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.820
*Imitating Pee-wee Herman*
Hi, it's me, Pee-wee Herman! Haha! Do you wanna go to my playhouse? Ha! Ha!

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.660
[Laughter]

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.080
NC: He's like the man of 1,001 impressions!

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.180
And not one of them right.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:00.440
Joey: *Imitating Bill Cosby* If you move back into the house, you can a big juicy bowl of JELL-O®. Muauauauaua.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:07.000
NC: *Imitating Bill Cosby* I figure if I imitate a funny, successful comedian, I myself may one day become one.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.540
Oh, and did I mention he has a puppet of a woodchuck brilliantly named...

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.540
Mr. Woodchuck?

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.760
Joey: Well, I'd be nice to hold something warm and cuddly that didn't always talk about wood.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.260
NC: I'm above that joke.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.540
Then you've got Dan. His gimmick, I guess, is that he's just...clean.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.740
Dan: Okay, Steph, first thing you do when you get to the dance is locate all the fire exits.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.980
Keep an eye on your coat the entire night and if the punch smells funny, don't drink it.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.920
NC: Oh, and he's a little prissy, too.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.140
Dan: Okay, let's face it. I'm a lean, mean hugging machine.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.440
NC: Okay, he's a lot prissy.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:44.020
In fact, knowing Bob Saget the way we know him now, this is actually really funny to watch.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.980
Anyone who watches Bob Saget's stand-up know that he is a raunchy, raunchy man.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.640
And you know that saying all this family-friendly bullshit is probably just killing him.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.680
In fact, let's compare Dan Tanner and Bob Saget for a second, shall we?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.480
Dan: I know exactly how you feel.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:06.060
And I know how much you girls miss your mother.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.340
Bob: I've banged half the girls in the room, and that is fucking--

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.160
Not true, I have not banged anyone here, I stuck my pinkie in your butts, a couple of you.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.940
Dan: She was devastated.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.520
It broke my heart to see the tears in her eyes.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.600
Bob: Fuck that shit.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.620
No thanks, I'm good.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.980
Do not-- 
Kids, do not fuck that shit, you'll get an infection.
you listen to me.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.500
NC: Dan Tanner? Blow me.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.880
Bob?

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:35.160
(impersonating '89 Joker)
You...are my number one...guy!

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.280
Then you got DJ, who I have to admit, as she got older did get consistently hotter.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.120
but that didn't change the fact that she had little to no personality.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.620
DJ: Wow, you have a date and a dress.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.440
So far, my prom's looking like a bag of chips and a remote control.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.900
NC: Life is hell.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.900
There's Stephanie also, but she's sorta on the same boat of blandness.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.180
Neither characters really make an effort to stand out.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.260
Dan: Stephanie, what are you doing?

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.120
Stephanie: Just hanging around.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.740
NC: GOD.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.600
And then of course, there's the Gremlin babies themselves, the Olsen twins as Michelle,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.680
who I think literally just had the job of spewing catchphrases.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.160
Michelle: What'll it be, Comet? Kibbles or Bits?

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.300
NC: Aw!

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:17.800
Michelle: You're goin' down!

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.920
NC: Aww!

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.040
Stephanie: You're supposed to keep your cards close to your body.

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.620
Michelle: You're supposed to keep your eyes close to your head.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.700
NC: *smack* AWWW!!!

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.040
I guess this was the character that stole the show, or would, if there was anything of value to steal.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.340
For some reason, the Olsen twins really took off and made a video series that literally transformed them into millionaires.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.320
I swear it also transformed them into Barbie® dolls, but to be fair, I think the dolls are a little less plastic.

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.820
Michelle: You look just like Sleeping Beauty.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.400
Except you're awake.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.760
NC: The cash-cow goes...

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.160
[Mooing]

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.140
But when it started out, they were just exploitable babies.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.620
and the studio took advantage of every friggin' frame they were in.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.740
For example, one episode was about changing a diaper!

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.100
*Sarcastically*
Ooh!

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.800
Joey: I'll take the south end.

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.560
Jesse: Good.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.460
[Laughter and applause]

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.060
NC: That got an applause, people. That gives you an idea of the kind of humor they deal with on here.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:20.580
But that's not the only pressing issue this show addresses.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:25.340
There's a lot of other gut-wrenching dilemmas that this show dares to challenge! Like:

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.000
Who's gonna do the dishes?

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.020
Is the hammock gonna be put up okay?

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.560
And of course, Who can limbo the lowest?

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.960
Michelle: Let's get ready to LIMBO!

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.040
NC: But that's not all! Here's a list of some of the other episodes to give you an idea of how truly exiting this show was!

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.280
"The First Day of School", "The Return of Grandma",
"Sea Cruise", and "Daddy's Home".

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.100
You know what this is?

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:53.320
This is the life of people in picture frames.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.220
No issues, no real dilemmas,

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.840
just a series of cuddly inconveniences.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.600
This family makes Norman Rockwell look butch!
GROW SOME BALLS, WILL YA?!

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.340
There's other characters who eventually evolved into the show.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.640
Like Becky, who fell in love with Jessie and eventually married him.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.840
Again, she's pretty dull, but I'd be lying if I didn't say she was kinda hot...

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:14.000
Stephanie: We're doing that balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.680
Becky: You know, I did that play in junior high.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.660
Wasn't a lot of fun though.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.100
Well, I went to an all girls school.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.100
In fact...

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:24.080
I was Romeo.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.920
NC: Rather than, oh, I don't know, move out of the house,

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.300
Jessie and Becky stay together and give birth to twin boys.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:37.940
Yeah, because one set of annoying bad acting twins just wasn't enough.

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.640
Twin 1: Do you know what he said?

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.920
Twin 2: No, just keep nodding.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:46.920
NC: These boys are no actors as you can clearly see.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.680
You can practically see the cue cards they're reading off of!

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.080
Twin 2: You're no fun anymore.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.980
NC: There's also DJ's friend, Kimmy,

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.860
the white female Urkel of the group.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.120
Kimmy: (in Scottish accent) I'm practicing the bagpipes for the Scottish music festival after school.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.360
NC: You know, every time a joke from Full House is uttered, a poor soul commits suicide?

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.280
Kimmy: Don't get your kilt in a knot McGreasy.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.040
(gunshot)

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:10.940
NC: You see?

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.760
There's also DJ's boyfriend, Steve,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.380
whose voice you may actually recognize.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.380
Steve: I know exactly how you felt,

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.420
like someone punched you in the stomach and knocked the wind out of you.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.300
Aladdin: Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.880
NC: That's right, it's Aladdin from, well, Aladdin.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.460
That's an interesting bit of trivia for you.

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.720
But what the hell's he doing on this show?

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.700
I recently caught up with the actor who played in this role and I asked him why he took a part in this godawful show.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.920
He had this to say:

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.880
♪Got to eat to live, got to steal to eat, tell you all about it when I got the time♪

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:43.120
Yeah.

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.820
It's from our talk.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:51.600
We flew him in to Chicago, did an audio interview, and he chose to answer everything in song.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.740
He's quite quirky that way.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:02.440
Oh and there's also a dog named Comet because this show just wasn't cute enough yet.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:08.140
All that is missing is a little fairy named 'Pretty Prissy Funhead' and this atom bomb of cuteness will be complete.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.340
Set your adorable levels to '10'.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.960
Now most shows often have a theme or pattern,

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.920
but in 'Full House' case, it's more of an overused manipulative plot device.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.000
And trust me when I say they have several.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.040
Like how the corny music that would play whenever a speech is being made.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.260
What is it, honey?

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.040
It's just not fair.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:35.440
I didn't even know what love was until I met you.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.500
Where's mom?

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.040
How right of it was I?

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:53.340
You were here sweetheart, but it was like one part of you is missing.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:57.040
It's not like the actual emotion of the scene is enough to carry it,

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:00.560
so we have to play shitty ass music to let you know when the feel's on it.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.820
God, wouldn't I give to hear this sappy ass music over a scene that didn't require it.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.300
Stephanie,

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.340
there's a time that every girl is like when she might be noticing some changes.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:14.820
That might seem strange or bizarre to you, but it happens to every young woman.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.460
It's called 'having a period'.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.300
It's gross, disgusting, and unnatural,

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.040
but, it something that all females go through.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.060
You may see your body as something possessed, horrifying, or despicable,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.720
and that's because it is.

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:30.400
Stop it.

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.560
Right now.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.520
But that's not the only pattern.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:42.280
Every single show has a relatively harmless problem that always seem to be solved within a half-hour time limit.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.940
Or, in most cases, a one-minute speech.

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.220
But you still got ME.

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.040
You got me too.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.200
And me.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.160
Linkara: And me?

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.820
Benzaie: And me?

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.500
Googles: And me.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:00.940
Angry Joe: And me?

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.120
I'll move back in.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.720
(applause)

00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.920
Yes, you all can find that the studio audience from this show is VERY easy to impress.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.200
For example, here's what happens every time somebody kisses...

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.620
(Whoooo)

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.420
Oh my God, a kiss!

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.040
That must mean they like each other.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.680
I bet how they kiss, they'll move on to holding hands.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.140
(Squee)

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.620
So we all know how the show begins,

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.260
but you're like me, you're wondering how the hell does it all end?

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.700
Well unfortunately, a killing spree isn't involved.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.480
However, one of the characters does get injured.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.640
Michelle is involved in a horse-racing competition.

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:49.740
As it turns out, Dan and another girl's mother get WAY into their daughter's if she wins.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.940
Could you come out my little girl's...

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.160
I'm a parent, not a groomer.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.860
Oh I'm sorry, you just have the air of stable help.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.120
NC: Excuse me, I'm Snobby von Persnickerdy Bitch.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.100
I don't know if you saw Michelle riding out there, but if she entered the competition, she could win.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.320
Enjoy you little fantasy,

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:13.420
because in reality, my Elizabeth wins this competition every year.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.220
Did you know that I actually eat 'Good' for breakfast and regurgitate it as 'Evil'?

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.900
It's a delightful practice.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:22.520
This is why you don't go to public school.

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:29.160
NC: God, these scenes are so bad, even the horse looks like he's suffering. My only wish is that he can talk back to half of these morons.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.180
You know what? I think you missed a spot.

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.360
NC: (impersonating a horse) This is so demeaning, I wish I was glue.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.600
What do you think, Peppermill? You like the idea, just stand there.

00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:41.300
NC: (impersonating Peppermill) You're a insipid twat.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.100
He loves it.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:49.340
Alright Peppermill, I'm gonna tell you the same thing my beloved track coach taught me right before my very first big track meet.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.440
Tanner, you keep those water bottles filled.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.020
NC: (impersonating) Your humor is like my balls: Old and non-functioning.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.960
While that's going on, Jesse and Joey are trying to put together a show about how they're going to wrestle...

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.760
Okay...what mental asylum did this a-hole break out of?

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:08.140
Put my foot around your neck like this...

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.960
This was a family show, right?

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.960
So Michelle and the other girl decide to go out and practice when suddenly tragedy strikes.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.660
NC (as Peppermill): Off you go, bitch.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:30.220
Free at last. Maybe I can be a stand-in on Seabiscuit.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.120
She fell off her horse.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.120
Oh my gosh. What happened?

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.960
NC (as Joey): Should I do my Popeye impression?

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.240
So Michelle wakes up, but unfortunately has a horrible case of amnesia.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:44.000
Actually, what am I talking about? That's not unfortunate at all!

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.440
I wish I had that right now.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.240
Well, memory loss is very common with head injuries.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.560
How long's gonna last?

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.840
Well, it's usually just temporary.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:52.840
One episode, twenty minutes tops.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.660
So everyone tries to get Michelle to remember who she is.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.120
Dan, Jesse, Joe...

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.600
Seriously dude, which hospital?

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.940
So, you all live in the neighborhood?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.900
No, you're gonna love this...

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.760
We all live in this house.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:10.840
Oh...

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.260
I hope it's bigger than it looks from the outside.

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.760
Well, through the magic of studio sets, plot holes, and inconsistent writing,

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:17.460
YEAH!

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:25.320
So her memory does finally return in a weird existential moment where the two sisters are finally shown on screen together.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.640
I'm your memory.

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.040
Where the heck have you been? I've been looking all over you!

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.980
I hope I didn't cause you any trouble.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.580
Duh...

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.980
Psychology for dummies, by dummies

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:41.000
Gee, I sure hope there's an overwinded speech with shitty music to close us out...

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.240
Well, we stuck it out and we got through.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.160
Just like we always do.

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.780
Just like we always will.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.780
THIS SHOW IS THE WORST!

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:03.000
It's like if a Hallmark card pissed all over your family album and that's somehow mutated into a sitcom.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.240
It was never funny, never clever, never endearing,

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.220
so why do we keep watching it?

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.080
Eight seasons?! Hello...

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:16.820
that's...a long time to watch untalented hacks severed around a pair of unfunny female troll goblins.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.700
It's almost as if they were sending us a subliminal messages or something.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:22.580
In fact...

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.060
what happens when you play the Olsen twins' dialogue backwards?

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:28.380
You look just like Sleeping Beauty.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.120
Watch our shows and make us money.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:33.680
OH MY GOD!

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.820
And what's that scene there?

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.240
OH MY GOD...

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.140
The Olsen Twins are mutant alien robots bent on world domination!

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:46.320
I knew it all along!

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:48.840
The people have to know!

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.100
Come play with us, Critic.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.380
Come play with us...

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.640
Come play with us, Critic.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:14.620
Forever and ever and ever and ever...

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:16.520
TWINS!!!

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:18.380
(gunshots)

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.460
I did it.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.200
They're dead.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.500
Can you believe them?

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.100
Trying to take over the world?

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:27.840
Of course.

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:28.780
Of course.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.280
Well, seeing how they are in fact dead, I would just turn around and go to my normal duties.

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:39.760
Cause you know, they're dead. They're not like they're going to pop up anywhere...

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:43.780
Anywhere else...especially on my way back to my room.

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.320
So, I'm gonna make that turn I told you about a second ago...

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.300
and here I go.

00:17:52.700 --> 00:17:53.980
You see? Nothing there.

00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:54.880
Uh huh...

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.580
So I'll just get back to work and...

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.660
(jumpscare)

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.560
It's just a dream all along.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.280
Well, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember...

00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:09.320
(jumpscare)

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.480
I'm the Nostalgia Critic

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.260
(jumpscare)

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:20.880
I...

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.780
(jumpscare)

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:26.280
You know what I do and you know why I do it...

00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.440
(jumpscare)
