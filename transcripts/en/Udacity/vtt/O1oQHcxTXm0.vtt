00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.940
There are two main types of tests
you can add to your Android project,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.230
unit tests and connected tests.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.460
The primary distinction between the two,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.180
is that unit tests run on a regular
Java VM on your computer.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.560
And connected tests run on
an Android device or emulator.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.170
In general,
you should use unit tests for

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.060
testing generic,
non-Android related classes.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.150
In fact, since unite tests are run
against a mock Android STK

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.490
implementation, any code that
calls the android API will fail.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.920
In this case, you should either use
a mocking framework like Makido, to mock

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.710
the appropriate android dependencies,
or use a connected test instead.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.800
Additionally, you can configure
the testing options in your Gradle built

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.140
script, to construct the mock Android
implementation to return default values,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.720
rather than throw an error.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.570
In any case,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.280
it's up to you as a developer to decide
how to best write your tests, and

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.380
how to structure your code in such
a way as to make testing easier.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.660
Connected tests should be reserved for

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.720
testing logic that depend
on Android API's, or for

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.940
more high level testing like
integration and functional tests.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.850
Remember, connected tests are packaged
as an APK that will be installed on

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.640
an Android device or emulator.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.760
So there's typically more overhead
involved in their execution.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.840
Both unit tests and connected tests have
their own source sets, named test and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.790
android test respectively.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.230
The notion of variants
extends to tests as well.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.760
Allowing you to write tests specific
to your build type of product flavor.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.830
The naming conventions for these source
sets follow the same pattern as for

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.200
application code, except for
the test or android test suffix.
