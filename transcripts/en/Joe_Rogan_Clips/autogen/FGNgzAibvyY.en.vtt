have a different intensity relative to
 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.820
have a different intensity relative to

their body type and so if somebody's
 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.880

doing pads it's a 9 or a 10 out of 10 in

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890
doing pads it's a 9 or a 10 out of 10 in
 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.410
doing pads it's a 9 or a 10 out of 10 in
terms of intensity and they're doing

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420
terms of intensity and they're doing
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.999

that fasted or they're doing that

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009

and then they can't adapt as a response

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620
and then they can't adapt as a response
 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.319
and then they can't adapt as a response
to that training so they end up just

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329
to that training so they end up just
 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.720
to that training so they end up just
getting slower and more beat up instead

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
getting slower and more beat up instead
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.580

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.979
90 or 95% of our max we start hitting 80
and 70 and 60 and in diminishing our

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989
and 70 and 60 and in diminishing our
 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.420
and 70 and 60 and in diminishing our
ability to do these high-intensity

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430
ability to do these high-intensity
 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.490
ability to do these high-intensity
efforts now do you guys see anybody come

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500
efforts now do you guys see anybody come
 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.259
efforts now do you guys see anybody come
in and try to fight on a ketogenic diet

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269
in and try to fight on a ketogenic diet
 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.180
in and try to fight on a ketogenic diet
cuz I know quite a few guys we're doing

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190
cuz I know quite a few guys we're doing
 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.410
cuz I know quite a few guys we're doing
that for a while I know Bryan caraway

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420
that for a while I know Bryan caraway
 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.110
that for a while I know Bryan caraway
did it Matt Brown yeah that's right he

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120
did it Matt Brown yeah that's right he
 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.410
did it Matt Brown yeah that's right he
has fought but he varies and I think he

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420
has fought but he varies and I think he
 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.820
has fought but he varies and I think he
yeah well I talked to him I think he did

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830
yeah well I talked to him I think he did
 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.250
yeah well I talked to him I think he did
one pretty pure and then he did you know

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260
one pretty pure and then he did you know
 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.199
one pretty pure and then he did you know
he did the one where you you know you

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209
he did the one where you you know you
 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.120
he did the one where you you know you
might take in sixty or eighty carbs but

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130
might take in sixty or eighty carbs but
 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.470
might take in sixty or eighty carbs but
then you were come off in the state

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480
then you were come off in the state
 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.580
then you were come off in the state
kitchen I don't mhm

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590
kitchen I don't mhm
 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.130
kitchen I don't mhm
some of those guys like Zack bitter he's

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140
some of those guys like Zack bitter he's
 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.190
some of those guys like Zack bitter he's
a altra marathon runner he he there he

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200
a altra marathon runner he he there he
 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.259
a altra marathon runner he he there he
does eat ketogenic most the time but

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269
does eat ketogenic most the time but
 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.199
does eat ketogenic most the time but
then on days of big races he'll consume

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209
then on days of big races he'll consume
 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.930
then on days of big races he'll consume
a lot of sugars yeah and yeah and again

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940
a lot of sugars yeah and yeah and again
 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.930
a lot of sugars yeah and yeah and again
all insulin sensitivity - yeah so

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940
all insulin sensitivity - yeah so
 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.250
all insulin sensitivity - yeah so
essentially the the more we could

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260
essentially the the more we could
 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.990
essentially the the more we could
regulate blood sugar at rest and low

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000
regulate blood sugar at rest and low
 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.930
regulate blood sugar at rest and low
intensities then we can expand and to

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940
intensities then we can expand and to
 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.910
intensities then we can expand and to
support the development of that kind of

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920
support the development of that kind of
 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.720
support the development of that kind of
aerobic oxidative system and by adapting

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730
aerobic oxidative system and by adapting
 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.640
aerobic oxidative system and by adapting
to use fat as a primary substrate we're

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650
to use fat as a primary substrate we're
 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.780
to use fat as a primary substrate we're
doing a number of things one we're

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790
doing a number of things one we're
 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.820
doing a number of things one we're
balancing blood sugar at rest so that we

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:16.830
balancing blood sugar at rest so that we
 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.670
balancing blood sugar at rest so that we
can really limit the insulin spikes and

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680
can really limit the insulin spikes and
 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.880
can really limit the insulin spikes and
and essentially adipose development in

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890
and essentially adipose development in
 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.930
and essentially adipose development in
addition to really driving the body

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940
addition to really driving the body
 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.740
addition to really driving the body
towards the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750
towards the
 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.110
towards the
date of and/or the Ox date of aerobic

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120
date of and/or the Ox date of aerobic
 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.810
date of and/or the Ox date of aerobic
system and then as we increase in what

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820
system and then as we increase in what
 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.060
system and then as we increase in what
we do is we assess how the body adapts

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070
we do is we assess how the body adapts
 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.220
we do is we assess how the body adapts
so through the training intensities and

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230
so through the training intensities and
 

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.810
so through the training intensities and
we'll repeat that kind of on a monthly

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820
we'll repeat that kind of on a monthly
 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.610
we'll repeat that kind of on a monthly
basis to see how the athlete changes and

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620
basis to see how the athlete changes and
 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.680
basis to see how the athlete changes and
then as they increase in the intensity

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690
then as they increase in the intensity
 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.440
then as they increase in the intensity
of a training effort then we will adjust

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450
of a training effort then we will adjust
 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.770
of a training effort then we will adjust
the ratio of fat to carbohydrates as as

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780
the ratio of fat to carbohydrates as as
 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.370
the ratio of fat to carbohydrates as as
this as a fuel substrate
