00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.940
So in summary, for

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.020
this lesson, I've covered basic concepts of cross-correlation, convolution.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.640
I've discussed the differences between cross-correlation and

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.570
convolution, as applied to image filtering, and of course,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.400
I've also discussed the properties of convolution, and how we actually now can

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.520
generalize the whole process of how doing, how we can do filtering with images.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.420
This has just been a foundational types of things.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.710
And now we're actually with next lecture, we're going to start finding more

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.020
information from images, specifically things like edges and images, which

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.260
then will actually create the foundations for doing something we want to do.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.590
That is feature matching.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.170
All right? So we will be actually, taking what we've learned about filtering,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.710
and now start getting content information out of images,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.300
rather than just doing blurring and filtering that we've been doing.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.000
And I noted I'd been using MatLab for

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.790
some, some of this stuff, but you should feel free to use whatever you want.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:56.570
And I just always like to thank other people that I've borrowed some

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.200
concepts from.
