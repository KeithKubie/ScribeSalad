00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
 The main film is exploring the genetic breeding model. 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.680
 How to make machine learning 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.800
 This algorithm is easier to interpret and present 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.060
 Here are some small robots learning to walk or learn to play Mario or learn to jump high 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.060
 Genetic algorithm is outdated but still useful 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.720
 And I personally think that the genetic algorithm will rise in the future. 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.800
 Once the computer computing power is close to the point of scaring people 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.380
 However, the most popular technology today is deep learning and recurrent neural networks. 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 This is why the importance of linear algebra continues to increase 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.800
 The feasibility of using a short film to explain is getting lower and lower. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.900
 But let me use a small movie to explain a little how they work. 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.940
 Just to make it clear that it would be like this: 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.700
 There is only one student in an infinite classroom. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.580
 The test of the teacher's algorithm is unchanged, but now the "creator algorithm" is the "adjuster algorithm" 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.640
 Each knob determines the sensitivity of each neural link in the brain of the student algorithm 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.240
 There are a lot of nerve connections in it, so there are so many knobs 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.160
 Super super 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.460
 The teacher gives the student a picture while the adjuster adjusts the knob 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.080
 Make it stronger or weaker to bring students closer to the correct answer 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.000
 Much like adjusting the frequency of the radio 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.000
 Is there a radio now? Does the car have this thing? 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.300
 I don't know how to forget it. 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.900
 You should not know the exact frequency of the station you want to listen to. 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.300
 But can you tell if you are close to the station you want to listen to? 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.900
 This is similar to this algorithm but with more than 100,000 knobs and a lot of mathematics. 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.460
 Again, this is just for one problem. 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.140
 When the teacher takes the next picture 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.220
 The adjuster must adjust all the knobs so that the student can give answers to two questions. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.620
 As the test grows longer 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.900
 The amount of mathematical operations and the number of fine-tuning are getting bigger and bigger. 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.840
 But when done, the student algorithm 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.360
 I can recognize the images I have never seen very well. 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.340
 Although there are still some problems encountered in the main film 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.840
 In short, this is an introduction to the simplest neural network you can hear. 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.720
 If you are interested and you like math and writing programs 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.180
 Go and find out more. 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.980
 The machine that can be learned is everything in the future 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.600
 Perhaps literally - "everything in the future" 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.100
 In view of how we treat robots, I hope they can be a little better for us.
