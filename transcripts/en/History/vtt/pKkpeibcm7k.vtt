00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:02.170
- Who doesn't own a big backyard
like that

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.710
and not have one car in it?

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.380
That's just a waste.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.710
Oh, look at that.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.540
Look at that monster.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.460
Holy crap, that's like a
deuce and a half on steroids.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.210
That is neat.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.710
Hey, can we check that out?

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.420
Pull over.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.540
Pull over?

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.380
Watch this.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.210
Stay there truck.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.250
Yo, that thing's wicked.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.920
That's Danny's flavor.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.420
Yeah.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.830
Nice, dude.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.750
Oh, that is nice.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.380
Kevin and I are out searching
for a quick flip for the shop.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.750
While this car
doesn't look like it

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.750
needs any work by
us or anyone else,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.920
I still want to check it out.
- How you doing?

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.250
I'm Kevin.
- I'm Chrome.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.000
Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.920
Yeah, man.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.250
Man, '53.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.750
That is laid out.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.330
The 1953 Chevys
were the precursor

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.540
to the famous Trifives.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.420
Since the '53s weren't
as popular or as valuable

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.960
as stock cars, they were a
favorite among low riders

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.040
and custom builders
to completely

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.210
customize from the ground up.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.790
They're so popular
in this scene,

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.920
that even Hot Wheels made
a '53 Chevy lowrider toy.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.460
Man, this is a bitching car.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.750
Obviously, it's been chopped.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.040
How much did you chop it?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.960
The guy-- because
I got her like this.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.080
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.790
- Lucky you, man.
- I know.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.250
I saw it and I was like,
wow, it's got potential.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.250
You know, it needed glass.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.750
It didn't have the white walls.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.120
I changed the grill out.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.080
- This is a good chop.
- I know.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.540
They did--
- It's really good.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.880
I think they did pretty good.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.420
Was this piece here,
this skirt piece?

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.750
- Yeah.
- That is freaking--

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.250
That's the rock chip guard.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.000
I love that piece.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.670
You have to, because the car
is black and you lay it out,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.830
now it just blends
into the asphalt.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.170
What motor you got in it?

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.250
350.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.290
Nice.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.830
It's pretty-- pretty decent.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.670
I mean, man, we were
flying down here.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.330
Oh, I'll bet, man.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.330
Nice lines.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.670
Who did the striping on them?

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.120
I guess whoever,
the guy I got it from,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.920
he must have had
somebody do those.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.170
It's cool.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.170
You know, it was
one of those, it was

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.170
like a diamond in the rough.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.750
Right?

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.960
You know, I saw the
potential and I jumped on it.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.250
Did you find it
in Southern Cal?

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.120
Yeah, it was San Diego.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.580
There's a lot of
shops in San Diego,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.830
like backyard shops
in San Diego doing

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.920
all this stuff all the time.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.170
And then they unload it.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.580
I'm going to put
a sale sign on it.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.330
Are you really?

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.380
Yeah.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.380
What's the magic number on it?

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.710
- I need 30.
- 30?

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.670
- 30, yeah.
- I can't argue with that.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.120
What transmission
are you running in it?

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.330
- 700.
- Oh.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.460
Get out of here.
Really?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.710
I'm telling you,
we were flying.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.460
That's 350, 700R4, damn.
Cruise it.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.880
- Yeah.
- It was smooth.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.540
Bro, 30 all day long.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.040
30 all day long.
- All day.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.380
All day long.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.960
Man, that chop top
Chevy was beautiful

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.040
and definitely worth
$30,000, but by no means,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.330
is it a quick flip for us.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.460
So we're going to
keep on looking.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.880
Got chops on this
one, man, seriously.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.790
- I know, bro.
- This is a cool ass ride, man.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:57.620
Pleasure meeting
you guys, man.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.620
Back at you, dude.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.880
Cool, brother.
Thank you.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.040
Thank you so much.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.460
The price is good,
but not fall off

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.460
the back of the truck price.
