00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
&gt;&gt; I think India will become one of the leading
economic superpowers of

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.170
the 21st century just behind China.
Actually, I think India will catch up with

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.400
China in terms of growth
rate, not infrastructure, but growth rate

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.570
within the next 3 to 5 years.
I think the danger for India is that it becomes

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.080
complacent and the
rising India, shining India story makes the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.760
establishment in business
and political terms too come placement and

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.550
self-satisfied, because
there is a tendency for the Indians to think

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.480
that everything is fine
and they don't need to worry about the rest

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.330
of the world.
I think the truth is that India is showing

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.040
under Anand Sharma, the new
Commerce Minister, that it wants to engage

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.920
in the G-20 on the Doha
round.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.460
Prime Minister Singh is taking his rightful
place on climate control

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.969
and others who's in the Copenhagen talks.
I think India will become a responsible and

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.039
more important player in
the G-20 which will be the new global directorate

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.039
for new economic
policies setting.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:04.080
So do I think India will become a superpower?
Define superpower.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.680
As among the fastest-growing, strongest economies
on the planet in the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.360
21st century? Yes.
Militarily? No.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.560
Although it is a nuclear member -- member
of the nuclear club.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.460
But let's call it, rather than superpower,
let's call it one of the top

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.100
three economic players in the 21st century.
