00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:12.290
Carolee: I'm Carolee Schneemann, and
I'm here at MOMA for an interview

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.469
while I'm installing a
large diptych drawing,

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:24.722
Up To and Including Her Limits was
originally inpsired by a neighbor who came

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:26.275
to prune my apple tree.

00:00:26.808 --> 00:00:35.347
I had been working with 3/4-inch
manila rope in creating an
aerial suspended kinetic work

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:40.338
and then the tree trimmer went
away to have lunch and I just took

00:00:40.338 --> 00:00:44.240
off my clothes and crawled into the
harness to see what it felt like.

00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:49.998
The work demands a release, a
submission to the sense of float

00:00:49.998 --> 00:00:53.880
that I have being suspended.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.126
And then the physical extensivity
of the arm with the crayons
that are going to keep,

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:05.548
as I move, hitting the adjacent walls
that are situated so that they're within

00:01:05.548 --> 00:01:11.700
the reach of the hand with the
crayon as well as the floor.

00:01:12.262 --> 00:01:16.898
It's a work that developed over
the course of six or seven years.

00:01:17.988 --> 00:01:23.400
I kept adapting the rope and the
harness and the time duration

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.774
to various spaces that I would live
in and sleep in and sometimes even

00:01:27.774 --> 00:01:31.009
have my cat living with me in the museum.

00:01:31.902 --> 00:01:41.786
It's usually four to six monitors and
the various action sequences come from

00:01:41.786 --> 00:01:45.506
seven or eight different performances.

00:01:46.676 --> 00:01:50.523
Part of my fondness for Up To and
Including Her Limits is that it relates

00:01:50.523 --> 00:01:52.777
to the fact that I'm a painter.

00:01:52.777 --> 00:01:56.780
I have never described myself
as a performance artist.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.116
When I started extending materials
into realtime and literal space

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:03.991
it was coming out of the happenings.

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:07.986
I was influenced by Claes Oldenburg,
by Jim Dine by Robert Whitman

00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:14.693
and it had nothing to do
with self confession or self
exposure or personal narrative.

00:02:14.693 --> 00:02:21.278
It really had to do with painterly
sense of environment as a collage arena.

00:02:21.278 --> 00:02:26.418
Up To and Including Her Limits really
is a discussion with Jackson Pollock

00:02:26.418 --> 00:02:35.980
to vitalize the whole body as stroke
and gesture in this dimensional space.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:46.698
