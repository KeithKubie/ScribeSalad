00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.210
[music playing]
NARRATOR: Russia.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.880
Spanning a staggering
6.6 million square miles,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.120
it is the largest
country on Earth.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.830
Its massive territory is
also the most geographically

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.040
diverse, consisting
of some of the most

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.830
extreme terrain on the planet--

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:34.500
including dense forests, frozen
tundra, remote mountains,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.920
and barren deserts.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.380
Despite its physical size,
as much as 50% of Russia

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.040
remains uninhabited and
largely unexplored by mankind.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.920
Russia is almost twice the
size of the United States.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.330
Just to compare,
the United States

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.880
expands over four time
zones, while Russia

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.960
expands over 11 time zones.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.750
The size of Russia, its
harsh climate, especially

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.960
in the northern parts
of Russia, makes

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.290
it very difficult to explore.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.120
NARRATOR: One of Russia's
most mysterious areas

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.210
is a valley just
north of Kazakhstan,

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.290
where in 1987 archaeologists
from the University

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.960
of Chelyabinsk
discovered the remains

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.880
of an ancient settlement
which they were able to date

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.750
back to between the 17th
and 20th centuries BC.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.420
Much of the original structures
of this megalithic site known

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.830
as Arkaim no longer exist,
but scientists have mapped

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.580
out its original design, which
includes massive circular walls

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.000
similar to Stonehenge.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.500
So Arkaim has been described
as Russia's Stonehenge.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.580
Now, this is quite intriguing
because it's a very

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.500
similar latitude to Stonehenge.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.000
So it's been suggested
that it could

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
have been put there for
astronomical and surveying

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.620
purposes.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.790
It seems that
Arkaim at some point

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.670
was some type of
observatory, which I think

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.500
is incredibly fascinating.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.250
Because it means that
worldwide, our ancestors

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.210
witnessed other
things that would

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:34.040
explain this long-held
fascination with the stars.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.790
The way the city was built,
it was a circular structure.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.540
It had a very interesting
central square.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.540
Basically, it was an
interior circle surrounded

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.170
by a circle, which to
many means the mandala

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.880
principle of Buddhism--

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.290
or a depiction of the universe
in a very miniaturized way.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.210
NARRATOR: Incredibly,
archaeologists have found

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.000
that Arkaim was built with
features aligned to measure

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.080
as many as 18
astronomical events,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.080
such as the solstices
and equinoxes.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.420
And discovered among the
ruins was an ancient statue

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.540
of a man looking up to the sky.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.170
Adding to the mystery are
reports of strange anomalies

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.250
in the region that continue
to this day, which include

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.500
magnetic inconsistencies,
strange lights,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.580
and curious fog formations.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.080
When you consider the
strange lights, the weird fog,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.790
the magnetic anomalies,
the unusual hallucinations

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.040
and things that have
happened to people there,

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.290
it appears that this is some
sort of energy node or vortex

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.290
point on the Earth
that was actually

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.290
utilized by extraterrestrials
when this was constructed.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.710
If you actually look
at the shape of Arkaim,

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.540
it could have been the platform
for a spacecraft like a rocket

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.750
to launch off from.
