Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience, they back to your core point. I mean that's the reason why I also write science fiction is that the world of science is changing so fast that we really need to apply a lot of imagination to imagine where it's going. Because if you're just looking at what's happening now, it's like this train is going to speed by you. We have to kind of imagine it's like Wayne Gretzky. We have to imagine where the puck is going to be, not where it is now. And I, I mentioned George Church who's like, he's at Harvard, he's like the, the Living Charles Darwin. And I do a lot of speaking alongside George and it's become our little thing that he says that he reads, um, science fiction like mine. And then imagine says, well, that's pretty cool. How can we do that? And what I do is I look at the research coming out of labs like Georges and I, sorry, well that's where we are now.

Speaker 1:          00:49          What's that going to mean in 2050 a hundred years? And so we have to, that the science fiction plays a more important role than it ever has and kind of imagining where we're going and it's that imagining that allows us to try to say, well, what if that's one of the options of where we're going? What are the decisions that we need to make now so that we can have a better outcome rather than a worse than if you are gambling person. I don't know if you are, but if I had to give you 100 bucks to put on something in 20 years, it's going to be profoundly just eh change. It's going to change us in a way that is something that we're not really prepared to understand or deal with. What do you think that's going to be? I think it's going to be predictive genetics that we're going to have.

Speaker 1:          01:38          All right now it's like you go to your doctor when you're sick. You could have been, this could have been some genetic disorder that you had from the moment you were conceived and it was ticking and it was ticking and you showed up 50 years later when that's been manifest. So it's going to be very different. You're taking your kid home from the hospital, your newborn, and the doctor says, Hey, congratulations. This is really great. Um, but just Fyi, your kid has a 50% greater than average chance of getting early onset Alzheimer's 50 years from now and your cat, your kid has a really great chance of being phenomenal at abstract math. Like how are we going to think about how we're gonna think about what it means to be human when we have all of that information? And there are things now that we call fate and it's, it's, it's, uh, just a different model.

Speaker 1:          02:28          And so I think that, and once we have that, that's going to change a lot of a lot of things. It's going to fundamentally transform our healthcare. What we call healthcare now is really sick care. You show up with a symptom and this is going to be predictive. And it's going to change the we, the way we make babies because people are going to have real choices about which embryos to implant and we're going to have a lot of information about, I read a lot of really intimate stuff. So you feel like genetic manipulation and genetic engineering, genetic understanding, genetic knowledge, and then applied genetic medicine, those are going to be the big changes in the next 20 years, even more so than technology, which it's interconnected because these, there's really, it's like a super convergence of these technologies. So the, the genetics revolution is the artificial intelligence revolution in a sense that the complexity of genetics is so great, it's way beyond what our brains on their own could process.

Speaker 1:          03:19          And so really with all of these technologies are touching each other. And so the biological models are now influencing the AI. So for example, we are coming to the limits of silicon storage, but DNA has unlimited storage capacity. So it's the, as I've said before, the kind of the boundaries between biology and AI or genetics and AI is going to be very blurry. Yeah. That is a, an interesting concept, right? The idea of storing information in DNA and that has been discussed. Yeah. Which the great DNA is the greatest information storage mechanism ever imagined. But the question is what happens when you do store things in there and how does that information interact with all the rest of the stuff that's in your body already? Well, I mean, if you can do it in your body, you could, doesn't have to be in, doesn't your body just think of like your, your DNA has 4 billion years of history and it's done a great job of recording it.

Speaker 1:          04:16          It's incredible. Like am I have old eight track tapes? They, they haven't lasted. That is a squirrely concept that you have all that data inside your head. I mean, that's also when people make, when they try to understand instincts yeah. That people have, these are some sort of genetically encoded memories or some understanding of things that are dangerous and that these, they're in there because this is how we've learned over the years without actually having experienced these things personally. Yeah. Yeah. No. So it's, it's baked in. Our genetics are baked into us. And so, you know, I don't know if you've been to Indonesia, I was in Indonesia and they went to this place called Komodo island. Oh Wow. The dragons Komodo Dragon. And it was fascinating because it's like you can tell they don't have plaintiff's attorney. So here's walking around there, all these Komodo dragons and so yeah, these are like the most deadly creatures on earth and there's like some little guy with a little stick and it's like, well how effective is that stick?

Speaker 1:          05:10          But the way it works, so you're just walking around walking around cause they come checks when they're not killing people or killing animals. They're just sitting there. And so it's pretty scary. Do they ever get Jack, do people ever go there and get bitten? Yes. And they say, oh it's only a few times a year. It's like, well a few times. Yeah, that seems like a lot of times. A year is a lot. But the way it works for a Komodo Dragon, a mother lays the egg and then buries the egg and then forgets where the egg is. And then let's just say that this egg hatches and this little Komodo dragon comes out and the mother sees her own baby Komodo Dragon. She'll eat it in a second. Oh Jeez. And so if you're a Komodo Dragon, you better have your entire survival strategy baked into your DNA because nobody's teaching you anything.

Speaker 1:          05:58          And so for us, we have this sense that it's like parenting is really important. It is environment. It is really important. It is. But so much of who and what we are is baked in to our genetics. And I think that's, that's going to be this challenge. We're going to see ourselves as increasingly genetic beings. We can't become genetic determinist think that we're just genetics, but we're going to know a lot more. We're going to demystify a lot of what it means to be a human. Poof. Yeah, tiff is right, but are we going to lose the romance and the, the just the randomness of life because of that. That's what people are concerned with. Right? Like if, if we have some sort of genetic uniformity mean especially in particularly with like things like intelligence and athletic performance, we're not gonna appreciate freaks as much or maybe we'll all want to be freaks because the freaks are the ones who push us into I am not going to want to be a moron.

Speaker 1:          06:50          Yeah. Well your your question, it's, it's the essential question. It's like what makes a human a human isn't to some way of Higher Iq that doesn't make you a better human that makes you someone with a higher Iq. But how are we going to think about constructing societies when it's up to us? Like if we are going to say we value certain people, certain ideas, I think we're going to need artists. Like right now people like artists are sometimes in the mainstream, sometime they're on the fringe, but artists are going to be maybe the most important people in this new world then, right? Like right now in hospitals we have kind of a hierarchy and like the most technical people are the people who are valued the most and the least technical people. Like some of the nurses or nurse's aides are the people who were often valued and paid the least.

Speaker 1:          07:34          But when technology can do these technological feats, what's going to be left is how can we be great humans? How can we emote? How can we connect? How can we create art? And if we get swept away by this tide of science, as in, you know, how excited I am about the size a bit, if we could really undermine our humanity. But as for humans, what humans value is many aspects of that humanity. Art, the curations. Yeah, yeah. Literature things we, we, when you read someone's great pros, you're, you're reading like an insight into their mind. And that's what's interesting about it, right? You're like, yes, you're not going to get that from just ones and Zeros. Yeah. And that's, and there, there will always be this way we call it mystery. And even if we can do a genetic analysis of Shakespeare and Mozart and and whatever, like it's still miraculous and we need to celebrate that and we can't, we can't allow us to say that we are just our genetics or even just our biology.

Speaker 1:          08:36          But we also can't just say biology has nothing to do with it. And especially because we're going to know more about our biology. You know, about our, our, our differences. And that's, that's normal. I mean it used to be in the old days they, everyone thought, well God is weather and now we understand weather pretty much. And nobody's saying, oh that lightening, that's God is delivering message. It could be, but we still like, we still have that mystery and I think that it's, in some ways it's about our orientation. Like how do we make sure that we keep this view of life, that we have artists and humanists who are just at the core of this conversation about where we're going. What if that mystery ultimately turns out to just be ignorance and that as you develop more and more understanding, there's less and less mystery? Would we like to be less smart?

Speaker 1:          09:21          Well, we like to be, yeah, or overwhelmed by possibility. I mean that could be, I think those would be part of what romance is. It could be and certainly like the unknown every we wake up every morning. Sure. And we just don't know the answer. And there are some people like to going back to the issues of of life extension. There are some people who say, well that death is essential for appreciating life. I talk about this stuff all around and then there are people who say, you know, you're talking about eliminating these terrible diseases, but I know somebody who had that terrible disease and their suffering was a gift to everybody else because we all had more humanity in response to their suffering. Like, well that's kind of screwed up. I'd prefer them to not have that suffering, but those people are thinking wacky. It's Wacky, but we need to, I totally agree with you that if we allow ourselves to get swept away with this kind of scientific determinism, if we don't say we really value our humanistic traditions, our artists, our cultures, we could get lost and we had to become obsolete.

Speaker 1:          10:26          We could become obsolete, but we could also just become less human. And there's something wonderful and there's magic. But do you think that monkeys used to think, man can become a human? We become less monkey. You know what I'm saying? But no being looks in the mirror and recognizes that they are evolving. Yeah. We've, well, we've only been, homo sapiens were about 300,000 years. Right. Um, so we just, it's hard. We know where we've come from. Cause you, you see all those little charts from high school biology, but it's really hard for people to imagine being something else in the future. It's, it's, it's outside of our, of our consciousness. And so say she will square. Yeah. And we are monkeys. It's just that we've redefined our monkey thing. You know, we, we do it with a little different way.
