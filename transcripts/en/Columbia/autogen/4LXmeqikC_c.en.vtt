digitized things they're aggressively

00:08:32.209 --> 00:08:32.219
digitized things they're aggressively
 

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:33.860
digitized things they're aggressively
putting them online but they're an

is to say you leave you can keep the

is to say you leave you can keep the
images on your database allow us and so

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:22.410
images on your database allow us and so
 

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.079
images on your database allow us and so
what we've done at MIT is to build this

00:09:24.079 --> 00:09:24.089
what we've done at MIT is to build this
 

00:09:24.089 --> 00:09:26.660
what we've done at MIT is to build this
this this technology we call it the

this this technology we call it the
 

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.329
this this technology we call it the
shadow asset we go in and we build it we

00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:29.339
shadow asset we go in and we build it we
 

00:09:29.339 --> 00:09:31.130
shadow asset we go in and we build it we
build a Corral around a certain number

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:31.140
build a Corral around a certain number
 

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:34.579
build a Corral around a certain number
of images and one of the MFA units

00:09:34.579 --> 00:09:34.589
of images and one of the MFA units
 

00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:36.889
of images and one of the MFA units
that's that's four hundred images having

that's that's four hundred images having
 

00:09:36.899 --> 00:09:39.889
that's that's four hundred images having

are charged with doing it would be great

00:09:57.079 --> 00:09:57.089
are charged with doing it would be great
 

00:09:57.089 --> 00:09:58.850
are charged with doing it would be great
if they could do it better but there we

00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:58.860
if they could do it better but there we
 

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.440

that wild Corral so we what we've done

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480
that wild Corral so we what we've done
 

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.450
that wild Corral so we what we've done
is pulled that content in again and then

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:22.460
is pulled that content in again and then
 

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.580
is pulled that content in again and then
say in the context of 400 images

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:24.590
say in the context of 400 images
 

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.380
say in the context of 400 images
associated with this this this

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:26.390
associated with this this this
 

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:29.020
associated with this this this
particular unit and we do that we can

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:29.030
particular unit and we do that we can
 

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:30.850
particular unit and we do that we can
also add our own metadata we've added it

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:30.860
also add our own metadata we've added it
 

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.160
also add our own metadata we've added it
we have so the content can all live on

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:33.170
we have so the content can all live on
 

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.960
we have so the content can all live on
the MFA s database but we can add our

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:34.970
the MFA s database but we can add our
 

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.150
the MFA s database but we can add our
own metadata to it to create an exposed

own metadata to it to create an exposed
 

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.790
own metadata to it to create an exposed
keyword database so you know the MFA

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:39.800

is again to get specific is a general

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:52.790
is again to get specific is a general
 

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:55.360

and again two more scholarly scholarly

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:58.400
and again two more scholarly scholarly
 

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.230
and again two more scholarly scholarly
and academic users as well so that's

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240
and academic users as well so that's
 

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.940
and academic users as well so that's
that's a that's a huge people in what we

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:03.950
that's a that's a huge people in what we
 

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:05.560
that's a that's a huge people in what we
do and by allowing that data that

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:05.570
do and by allowing that data that
 

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:07.150

database to be open and to be
 

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.890
database to be open and to be
contextualized in a way with it there's

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:08.900
contextualized in a way with it there's
 

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.370

a digestible amount of content to the to

a digestible amount of content to the to
 

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.370
a digestible amount of content to the to
general users and that level with that

general users and that level with that
 

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.700
general users and that level with that
added level of relevance we find that

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:18.710
added level of relevance we find that
 

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.560

users are very much empowered and then
 

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.690
users are very much empowered and then
go and create their own mashups create

00:11:22.690 --> 00:11:22.700
go and create their own mashups create
 

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:24.400
go and create their own mashups create
