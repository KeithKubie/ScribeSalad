00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.860
Titanic was released in December of 1997.
Many Hollywood insiders and naysayers predicted

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.830
doom for the film. After all, it had cost
a record $200 million to produce; the story

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.480
had been told on film more than once; everyone
already knew the ending; and the film really

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.130
had no “big stars” to draw in the crowds.
(Originally the lead role was to go to Mathew

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.810
McConaughey to provide the “star power”,
but director James Cameron and Kate Winslet

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.310
both pushed for DiCaprio to get the role.)

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.260
After making a good, but not incredible, $28
million in its opening weekend, momentum (and

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.610
great word of mouth) quickly set in. Titanic
soon set a “never to be broken” highest

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.100
grossing film record (that was in fact soon
to be broken by Avatar). It was the number

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.570
one film at the box office an unbelievable
15 weeks in a row. Titanic eventually grossed

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:57.610
a record $600 million in the United States
alone in its first run. It became the first

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.560
movie to gross over $1 billion worldwide and
after the recent 3D release is up to $2.185

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.560
billion, making it just the second film over
$2 billion with Avatar (though, when adjusting

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.560
for inflation and ticket prices of the day
films were released, Titanic is only considered

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.560
the 5th highest grossing film of all time).

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.180
It wasn’t just a hit in the Western world
though, something about Titanic tugged at

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.570
the heartstrings of Afghan boys in a way no
other American love story ever had. Previous

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.740
to this, most Hollywood movies that made it
big in Afghanistan were almost exclusively

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.741
action movies, with Rambo III probably holding
the title for most popular American movie

00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:25.780
in Afghanistan, being “dedicated to the
brave Mujahideen ﬁghters of Afghanistan”.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.490
Despite the Taliban’s strict ban on American
cinema, VHS copies of Titanic flooded Kabul’s

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.720
black markets.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.600
Titanic-mania swept the country and had a
resurgence after the Taliban were removed.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.140
Before the crackdown (and after the government
was overthrown), posters of the film could

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.299
be seen hanging on countless Afghan walls.
Even extra-large vegetables, from tomatoes

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.560
to cucumbers, started to be referred to as
“Titanic Vegetables”. There was also “Titanic

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.360
Mosquito Killer”, “Titanic Body Spray”,
“Titanic Toothpaste”, “Titanic Sandals”,

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.590
“Titanic Wedding Cakes”… you get the
idea.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.189
One fabric seller in Kabul, Ali Ahmad, states,
“Still everyone plays Titanic. Because the

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.659
story is good. It’s a real story. That’s
why people still like it. And the love parts

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.530
— that’s what we like.”

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.840
But alarm bells didn’t start going off for
the country’s fundamentalist government

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.220
until teenage boys started emerging from downtown
barbershops sporting DiCaprio-style “Titanic

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.160
haircuts”. This incited the rage of the
Taliban and soon the police started cracking

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.160
down.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.430
Numerous teens and at least 30 barbers were
arrested because of the DiCaprio cut, others

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.230
were simply beaten and forced to shave their
heads. Because of this, many Afghan boys sporting

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.950
the new cut took to wearing hats, caps, or
turbans to hide their manes when they were

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.150
in public. Older young men (yep, I just wrote
that) actually grew beards to try to blend

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.160
in better while sporting their “Titanic”
cuts.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.459
Brave barber Aminullah Nazif, who never actually
saw the film, was not to be dissuaded though

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.660
and started giving the Titanic cut in secret,
with the first customer he had who requested

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.379
it showing him a Leo DiCaprio postcard and
asking to be given the “Titanic” cut.

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.870
Nazif became a popular “underground barber”
among Titanic-loving male teenage customers,

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.730
with many of his customers arranging to meet
at his shop late at night to get their Titanic

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.730
cuts.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.310
As one 16 year old, Nawid Mirkhail, who got
the Titanic cut, but then was forced to have

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.599
it shaved off said, “I like the hairstyle
of the film star… He was a handsome boy.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:25.490
And he looked very handsome with that haircut.”

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.970
While every movie star is probably at some
point flattered by imitations of himself (or

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.340
herself), DiCaprio may well be the only movie
star in history whose followers risked a physical

00:03:34.340 --> 00:04:03.290
beating and potential arrest for imitating
his hair style.
