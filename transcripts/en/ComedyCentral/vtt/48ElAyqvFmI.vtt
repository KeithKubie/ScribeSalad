00:00:01.548 --> 00:00:02.913
- The one thing I've
learned over the years

00:00:02.913 --> 00:00:05.606
is that you can't be afraid of failing.

00:00:05.606 --> 00:00:07.498
In fact on my show when I help businesses

00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:09.472
I fail all the time.

00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:11.343
I'm normally shy to show those moments

00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:13.944
but tonight I'm going
to make an exception.

00:00:13.944 --> 00:00:17.862
So let's take a look now at
some of my greatest failures.

00:00:17.862 --> 00:00:19.542
One of my least popular ideas was

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:22.211
for a completely germ-free hot dog stand.

00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:24.319
At outdoor food carts it's easy for germs

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:26.646
to transfer from money to your food

00:00:26.646 --> 00:00:28.738
so to completely eliminate this I designed

00:00:28.738 --> 00:00:32.171
a hands-free method to apply
condiments to the wiener.

00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:34.021
Also, there would be a second employee

00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:36.350
whose only job is to handle the money.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.361
- What are you doing with the wallet?

00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:39.268
- We're doing a germ-free experience

00:00:39.268 --> 00:00:40.610
so you don't handle your own money.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:41.621
- [Customer] Oh really?

00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:42.744
- [Nathan Voiceover] But
people were a bit annoyed

00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:44.000
with the money handling part.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.838
- Can I have my wallet back?

00:00:44.838 --> 00:00:46.307
- And the hands-free onion dispenser

00:00:46.307 --> 00:00:48.074
proved to be problematic as well.

00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:49.494
So you have to up, one up one down,

00:00:49.494 --> 00:00:51.510
and when it hits the table
the onions will fall.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.719
- [Cart Owner] Drop it, keep
droppin' it, up down, drop it.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.719
- [Nathan] Harder. Fast.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:00.195
- [Customer] This is not gonna work.

00:01:00.195 --> 00:01:01.678
- That's nothing to do
with the contraption,

00:01:01.678 --> 00:01:03.587
if you drop a hot dog you drop a hot dog.

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:05.007
The public just wasn't ready for

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:07.160
the germ-free hot dog experience.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.698
So I laid the concept to rest.

00:01:09.698 --> 00:01:12.042
Next, I had an idea for a tearless way

00:01:12.042 --> 00:01:14.450
to tell a child that their pet has died,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.013
to be an upsell service
for an animal hospital.

00:01:17.013 --> 00:01:19.149
The concept was to make a video of the pet

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:21.205
while it's still alive telling the child

00:01:21.205 --> 00:01:22.994
it's in animal heaven now.

00:01:22.994 --> 00:01:24.906
I hired the only voice
actor that responded

00:01:24.906 --> 00:01:27.300
to my Craigslist ad to be the dog,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.410
but when we showed it
to the owner's child--

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.809
(fanning harp music)

00:01:30.809 --> 00:01:34.855
- Oh, it's me, Madi, I'm in heaven now.

00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:38.395
So sorry I died, I miss you so much.

00:01:38.395 --> 00:01:41.562
I'm happy here so I'm not coming home.

00:01:45.184 --> 00:01:46.646
- No, she doesn't.

00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:47.500
- No.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.333
- Aw.

00:01:49.208 --> 00:01:50.695
It's okay.

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:51.974
- [Nathan Voiceover] He
hated his dog's voice.

00:01:51.974 --> 00:01:53.717
Another flubbed idea.

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:56.469
Next, we all hate paying
those pesky ATM fees

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:57.863
that charge us up to three dollars

00:01:57.863 --> 00:01:59.514
for basically doing nothing.

00:01:59.514 --> 00:02:02.038
So I designed an ATM that
cleans your card during

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:05.349
the transaction so you get
something for your money.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:08.958
No transaction fee, just
a card cleaning fee.

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:11.172
But my mistake was that
the washing process took

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:13.707
almost seven minutes and
people who were in a hurry

00:02:13.707 --> 00:02:15.701
got a little frustrated.

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.522
It still surprised me because the machine

00:02:17.522 --> 00:02:20.647
was doing a thorough job
but even after all that,

00:02:20.647 --> 00:02:23.508
people still didn't think
their cards were clean enough.

00:02:23.508 --> 00:02:25.443
- This is not clean.

00:02:25.443 --> 00:02:26.550
- That looks cleaner.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.072
- No, there's still dirt right there.

00:02:28.072 --> 00:02:29.290
- [Nathan Voiceover] People
just weren't as excited

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.957
about it as I had hoped.

00:02:31.957 --> 00:02:34.262
And lastly, my favorite ideas
don't just help with business,

00:02:34.262 --> 00:02:36.316
they're good for the community as well.

00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:38.427
So I approached a bar
with an innovative way

00:02:38.427 --> 00:02:40.825
to stop drunks from
getting behind the wheel.

00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:43.031
The concept was to have a
street magician stationed

00:02:43.031 --> 00:02:45.839
outside the bar performing a
magic trick that allows him

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:48.187
to secretly test the Blood Alcohol Levels

00:02:48.187 --> 00:02:50.094
of patrons as they leave.

00:02:50.094 --> 00:02:52.947
And with my background in
magic I offered to test it out.

00:02:52.947 --> 00:02:55.658
- For my final trick I'm
gonna need your keys.

00:02:55.658 --> 00:02:56.653
- My keys?

00:02:56.653 --> 00:02:59.570
- Yes, great, give the wand a blow.

00:03:00.643 --> 00:03:02.401
(exhales)

00:03:02.401 --> 00:03:04.617
Okay, a little bit harder,
right into the top.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:08.278
(hollow whistling)

00:03:08.278 --> 00:03:11.383
Okay, and you are over the legal limit.

00:03:11.383 --> 00:03:12.216
- [Man] Okay.

00:03:12.216 --> 00:03:14.068
- Blood Alcohol so your keys are gone

00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:15.964
and I cannot give them back to you.

00:03:15.964 --> 00:03:17.252
- Okay.

00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:18.177
- Sorry.

00:03:18.177 --> 00:03:19.274
- [Nathan Voiceover] But
that's when I realized

00:03:19.274 --> 00:03:20.842
the flaw in my idea.

00:03:20.842 --> 00:03:23.234
If I held onto his
keys, and he took a cab,

00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:25.326
the guy couldn't get into his apartment.

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:26.720
- Could I get my keys please?

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.060
- I can't because you're drunk.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.464
- Please give me my keys.

00:03:29.464 --> 00:03:30.932
- [Nathan Voiceover] And the
only solution at that point

00:03:30.932 --> 00:03:32.251
was to drive him home.

00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:33.671
- You live far.

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.568
- I know I do.

00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:37.742
- [Nathan Voiceover] Also
once I got him home I realized

00:03:37.742 --> 00:03:40.118
I couldn't just give him his
keys until he was asleep,

00:03:40.118 --> 00:03:42.026
or else he might go out and drive again.

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:43.240
- You need to see me sleeping?

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.429
- I need to see you fall
asleep before I leave your keys

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:49.179
or else you might take
them and go out again.

00:03:50.393 --> 00:03:52.167
You don't brush your teeth before bed?

00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:54.306
- Usually not, I usually
brush my teeth in the morning.

00:03:54.306 --> 00:03:55.139
- Really?

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:55.972
- Yup.

00:03:55.972 --> 00:03:58.543
I know it's kinda gross
but nobody else is really

00:03:58.543 --> 00:04:00.523
paying attention to the
way my breath smells.

00:04:00.523 --> 00:04:01.671
- [Nathan Voiceover] So
I had to put him to bed

00:04:01.671 --> 00:04:03.599
and make sure he went to sleep.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.184
♫ And if that looking glass gets broke

00:04:07.184 --> 00:04:10.599
♫ Mama's gonna get you a billy goat

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:12.980
- [Nathan Voiceover]
Before I left his keys.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.023
So as you can see, even the
greatest minds fail sometimes.

00:04:17.023 --> 00:04:18.440
- [Customer] Ohh!
