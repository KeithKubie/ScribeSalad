00:00:04.131 --> 00:00:04.880
Hi.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.660
My name is Sulaiman Balogun,
co-founder at ToLet.com.ng.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.940
ToLet.com.ng is Nigeria's
busiest online real estate

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.220
platform.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.570
We have, since inception,
been able to come up

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.580
with a three-part system.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.670
Find a house in
three easy steps.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.340
Look on our website,
see the property

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.130
that you're interested
in, and then we attach you

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.880
to one of our offline
agents, who would then

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.510
help you find-- who
would then basically

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.890
walk you through the process
of getting the house.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.960
What we did was
to basically have

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.380
absolutely no human
interaction with users.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.180
We had started a classifieds
website at the time.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.710
And what we did, we
basically did not

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.810
interface with the
users that much.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.220
However, just from our
contact page alone,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.360
we then started getting emails.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.370
We were inundated
with emails basically

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:10.570
requesting for certain changes
to be made to our website,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.120
and asking for different
types of services which

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.140
we didn't provide at the time.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.430
What we decided to do
after that was to set up

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.510
our customer service center.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.150
We put up our phone
numbers on the website,

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.580
beside the Book
an Inspection tab.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.030
And what we found was
an uptick in the amount

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.480
of people that were
actually reaching out to us.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.160
Within the space of
about one week, we

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.480
saw like a 200% increase
in the number of users

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.580
who were actually contacting us
and asking to view properties

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.630
that they had seen
on the website.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.120
There is always a
market for someone

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.985
to come and solve that problem.

00:01:52.985 --> 00:02:00.350
And we did the maths, we talked
around with our pilot team.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.940
The pilot testers
had already gone out.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.070
We had gotten feedback.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.050
We had looked at
our business model.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.630
We had spoken to
partner agencies.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.390
Everything basically-- we
made sure everything added up.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.140
And even though,
for the most part,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.580
a lot of people on
the outside thought

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.240
we were making a big mistake,
we knew from our research

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.400
that we were actually
doing the right thing.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.180
And that was probably
the best thing

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.030
that happened to our business.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.900
Because at the
end of the day, we

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.769
were basically trying to
listen to our customers.

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.810
Our customers were giving
us feedback, telling us

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.440
what they wanted us to do.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.930
And we knew that so long as
we kept the customer happy,

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.640
business was going to be good.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.980
We now find out that 90% of
the users of the ToLet.com.ng

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.400
service actually come to
us via the phone calls.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.260
They still use the website.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.350
They use the website.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.490
Nonetheless, they still prefer
to actually call and speak

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.380
to a member of a
customer service team,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.240
ask questions, and
get clarifications

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.580
before they then go
on to actually decide

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.580
to go view the property.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.930
Anybody out there who is
thinking about launching

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.480
a new product or
launching a new feature,

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.030
so long as that feature that
you are adding to your business

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.720
is very key and
crucial to your user,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.480
I can personally assure you
that you should-- I mean, go out

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.220
there and launch that feature.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.260
So long as your customer
is asking you for it,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.160
then they will be
willing to use it.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.950
And it could probably
be the biggest thing

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.960
that will change the
face of your business

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.230
from a very, very small
company to a very, very

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.570
huge powerhouse.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.220
