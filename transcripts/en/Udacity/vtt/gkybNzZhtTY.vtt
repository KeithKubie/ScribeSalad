00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.839
This is mechanism design, right?

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.980
King Solomon constructed
a game with payoffs

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.330
which somehow are supposed to capture
what's really going on with the mothers.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.210
And based on the action was able
to kind of determine what their

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.930
true preferences were so really this
was a game about eliciting preferences.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.430
And, in fact,
that's exactly what you said.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.010
You said, by their reactions, by their
behavior, King Solomon was able to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.898
figure out that A preferred that
the baby live and have B get it, him.

00:00:27.898 --> 00:00:35.270
Let's say him, while B preferred
mainly that A not have the baby.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.230
And by once getting preferences and
saying well that all those preferences

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.950
only makes sense for
the real mother and the fake mother.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.100
Let's just go with that and so
now I can determine the real mother is.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.240
&gt;&gt; Okay
&gt;&gt; Right and King Solomon's was.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.520
Now I'm going to make a claim
which is that this is insane and

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.589
doesn't actually make any sense.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.640
So let me ask you this, Michael.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.300
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.670
&gt;&gt; You're a rational kind of guy.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.670
&gt;&gt; I'm a wise guy.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.910
&gt;&gt; Your definitely a wise guy.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.030
Let's imagine that you were B,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.410
let's say B is not the real baby mother,
not the real baby mama.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.560
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So B is not the real mother, but

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.980
let's say that you're B.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.050
&gt;&gt; Okay?
&gt;&gt; I want to be the king but okay sure.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.930
&gt;&gt; And King Solomon.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.570
You can be both.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.090
And King Solomon makes this offer.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.970
I will cut the baby in half.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.620
If your goal is to keep the baby or

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.030
at least to make certain A doesn't get
the baby, what should you actually do?

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.990
&gt;&gt; All right here's what I
think you want me to say but

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.950
I'm not sure that I completely get it.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.830
So B Is as wise as King Solomon,
because game theory

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.160
assumes we have rational agents, etc,
etc with infinite processing power.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.950
So B is at least as smart
as King Solomon, and so

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.850
B says, okay, King Solomon is going to
use whatever I say to decide whether or

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.070
not I'm the real mom.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.660
And in particular, if I say don't cut
the baby, he'll think I'm the real mom.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.230
So B will cry out do not cut the baby.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.630
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.040
&gt;&gt; And now King Solomon's
back where he started and

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.080
that he has two identical women and
two identical reactions.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.630
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.289
And so if both of them say no,
then King Solomon knows nothing.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.430
But A being a extremely rational
person as well says, King Solomon will

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:24.070
know that the person who actually is not
the mom is going to say no facetiously

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.650
and so only the real mom would say,
yes cut the baby in half.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.220
&gt;&gt; No.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.470
&gt;&gt; No?
&gt;&gt; No because if that were true

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.490
then the other thing would,
then the story would make any sense.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:38.510
Actually the story doesn't make any
sense because first off the idea that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.270
someone would say you're going to cut
the baby in half I'm fine with that.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.030
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; As if people feel like that's

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.300
a caring mom none of that makes any
sense but don't have to go we can just

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.280
talk about game theory and
there's a little matrix here and

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.220
code The best action for
both of them is just to both say no.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.120
&gt;&gt; So you're saying King Solomon set up
a kind of a mechanism design problem or

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.640
set up a mechanism.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.010
And it was a flawed mechanism because

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.470
if you understand the mechanism you know
the right thing to say is just no and so

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.660
no and then he has to flip a coin
to decide who gets the baby?

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.250
&gt;&gt; Right.
And

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.250
then you're doing pretty
okay in that game,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.500
certainly better than the alternative,
which is to say yes.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.420
Think about it.
If your action in

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.610
some sense is either say no, or
to say yes, it was my baby, or

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.410
it's the other person's baby,
the equilibrium here is sort of both,

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.420
if the other person says no,
there's no reason for you to say yes.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.530
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; And if the other person says yes.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.960
Then you should say no.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.200
&gt;&gt; Right, so that's a dominant strategy.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.770
&gt;&gt; It's a lot like chicken and dare.

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.010
&gt;&gt; Chicken and
dare has this sort of thing where

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.220
you want to be the daring one
if the other one's the chicken.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.780
This is like, everyone says no.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.970
Yeah, okay.
Fair enough, but

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.180
you basically both want to say no.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.998
There's no circumstances under which
you want to say cut the baby in half.

00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:52.906
&gt;&gt; All right, all right.

00:03:52.906 --> 00:03:53.635
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.

00:03:53.635 --> 00:03:54.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I mean so

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.650
the problem with this of course is that
none of these people study game theory.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.260
So they maybe hadn't
thought things through and

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.065
they were just giving
their original reaction.

00:04:03.065 --> 00:04:07.975
&gt;&gt; Well I'm pretty sure in the real
world even people who haven't

00:04:07.975 --> 00:04:12.515
studied game theory would know better
than the say sure cut the baby in half.

00:04:12.515 --> 00:04:13.895
That's just not socially acceptable.
