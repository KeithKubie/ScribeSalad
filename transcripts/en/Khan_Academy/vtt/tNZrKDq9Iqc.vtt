00:00:00.694 --> 00:00:04.164
- [Voiceover] In the figure
above, PQRS is a rectangle.

00:00:04.164 --> 00:00:06.056
So that, let us note that these are

00:00:06.056 --> 00:00:08.530
right angles right over there.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.987
The area of triangle RST is seven.

00:00:10.987 --> 00:00:13.143
So RST is seven.

00:00:13.143 --> 00:00:16.405
And PT is equal to 2/5 PS.

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:19.981
What is the area of triangle PQRS?

00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:22.175
So let's think about what
information they've given us

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:24.044
and what we need to figure out.

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:29.044
So they tell us the area
of triangle RST is seven.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.764
So what is the area of triangle RST,

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:34.225
given these lengths right over here?

00:00:34.225 --> 00:00:37.197
Well, triangle RST, the
area of any triangle is

00:00:37.197 --> 00:00:39.960
1/2 times the base times the height.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.527
So what is the base of RST?

00:00:41.527 --> 00:00:45.033
What we could view it as
the length of segment ST.

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:48.852
So the area is going to be equal to 1/2

00:00:48.852 --> 00:00:53.852
times the length of segment ST,

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.543
for that (mumbles) times the height

00:00:56.543 --> 00:01:01.543
which is the length of segment RS.

00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:06.166
So times RS and that's equal to seven.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:08.423
And that's equal to seven.

00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:10.431
And if we wanted to
simplify this a little bit,

00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:13.167
we could multiply both sides by two.

00:01:13.167 --> 00:01:16.974
And so, we could get the
length of segment ST times

00:01:16.974 --> 00:01:21.974
the length of segment RS is equal to 14.

00:01:22.268 --> 00:01:23.886
Just multiply both sides by two.

00:01:23.886 --> 00:01:25.217
Two times 1/2 is one.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:27.473
Two times seven is 14.

00:01:27.473 --> 00:01:30.155
So this first piece of information is

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:33.537
that the product of ST and RS,

00:01:33.537 --> 00:01:36.877
ST and RS is 14.

00:01:36.877 --> 00:01:41.613
Then they tell us that
PT, I'll do PT in orange,

00:01:41.613 --> 00:01:45.432
then they tell us that PT is

00:01:45.432 --> 00:01:49.811
equal to 2/5

00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:51.690
times PS.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.650
Now let's just say,
I'm gonna use pink for,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.171
I'll just use this dark blue for PS.

00:01:57.171 --> 00:01:58.998
Times PS.

00:01:58.998 --> 00:02:01.544
So that's that length right
over there, that's PS.

00:02:01.544 --> 00:02:04.136
2/5 times PS.

00:02:04.136 --> 00:02:06.771
So that's the second piece of information.

00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:09.511
Right over here, I just rewrote it.

00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:11.325
And now, what are we gonna figure out?

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:14.813
We need the area of PQRS
of this entire rectangle.

00:02:14.813 --> 00:02:16.520
Well, the area of rectangle is going to be

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.082
its base times its height.

00:02:18.082 --> 00:02:20.947
So the area, what we need to figure out is

00:02:20.947 --> 00:02:24.128
going to be PS, the length of segment PS.

00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:27.506
So I can write, so we
need to figure out PS

00:02:27.506 --> 00:02:32.374
times the height which is RS.

00:02:32.374 --> 00:02:33.682
Times RS.

00:02:33.682 --> 00:02:37.791
This is what we need to figure out.

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:41.112
So going back to what we
know, so here we know PT

00:02:41.112 --> 00:02:44.792
in terms of PS or PS in terms of PT,

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:49.017
here we have an expression
with ST, RS, and 14.

00:02:49.017 --> 00:02:52.152
So somehow, if I could turn
this ST part of this expression,

00:02:52.152 --> 00:02:56.215
if I could turn this into
something that deals with PS,

00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:58.316
then I'm gonna be in pretty good shape.

00:02:58.316 --> 00:03:00.418
Now let's just look at this.

00:03:00.418 --> 00:03:03.610
How does ST relate to PS?

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.154
So let me write this over here.

00:03:05.154 --> 00:03:07.835
So S, the length of segment ST

00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:10.963
is equal to the length of segment PS.

00:03:10.963 --> 00:03:13.488
It's equal to the length of segment PS.

00:03:13.488 --> 00:03:18.011
Minus the length of segment PT.

00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:21.012
Minus the length of segment PT.

00:03:21.012 --> 00:03:23.003
So I could substitute this in for ST

00:03:23.003 --> 00:03:26.741
but now it has something as
in terms of both PS and PT.

00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:28.638
But lucky for us, we
can also substitute out

00:03:28.638 --> 00:03:30.592
the PT for something in terms of PS.

00:03:30.592 --> 00:03:32.624
That's what this does right over here.

00:03:32.624 --> 00:03:37.602
So this, we know that PT, the
second piece of information

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:40.523
they've given us, PT is equal to 2/5 PS.

00:03:40.523 --> 00:03:43.728
So we can rewrite this
whole thing and saying ST,

00:03:43.728 --> 00:03:45.964
the length of segment ST is equal

00:03:45.964 --> 00:03:50.439
to the length of segment PS minus,

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:55.439
minus 2/5 times

00:03:55.695 --> 00:03:58.341
the length of segment PS.

00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:01.165
Minus 2/5 times the length of segment PS.

00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:03.220
And once again, how did I do that?

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.397
Well, we know that that
is equivalent to that

00:04:06.397 --> 00:04:08.236
from this piece of information,

00:04:08.236 --> 00:04:10.383
from this piece of information here.

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:11.694
Now what's powerful about this is

00:04:11.694 --> 00:04:14.662
now I have ST purely in terms of PS.

00:04:14.662 --> 00:04:18.026
So if I replace ST with
what I have in terms of PS,

00:04:18.026 --> 00:04:19.164
it looks like I'm gonna have some type

00:04:19.164 --> 00:04:21.901
of product of PS and RS or something

00:04:21.901 --> 00:04:25.335
that I can solve for the
product of PS and RS.

00:04:25.335 --> 00:04:28.222
Before I even do that, let's
simplify this a little bit.

00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:31.105
If I have one PS minus 2/5 PS

00:04:31.105 --> 00:04:35.145
or we could even say 5/5 PS minus 2/5 PS,

00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:40.143
we get ST is equal to 3/5,

00:04:40.143 --> 00:04:45.143
3/5 times PS.

00:04:45.222 --> 00:04:47.284
And now we are ready to substitute.

00:04:47.284 --> 00:04:49.099
So instead of having an ST here,

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:54.099
we could write 3/5 PS

00:04:54.126 --> 00:04:57.666
3/5 PS

00:04:57.666 --> 00:05:00.128
times the length of segment RS.

00:05:00.128 --> 00:05:01.075
These are all the, you know the...

00:05:01.075 --> 00:05:02.657
3/5 times the length of segment PS

00:05:02.657 --> 00:05:07.405
times the length of
segment RS is equal to 14.

00:05:07.405 --> 00:05:09.193
And now we could just
solve for this product.

00:05:09.193 --> 00:05:10.586
What is PS times RS?

00:05:10.586 --> 00:05:12.138
Well, let's just multiply both sides

00:05:12.138 --> 00:05:14.753
times the reciprocal of 3/5.

00:05:14.753 --> 00:05:17.923
Times 5 over three.

00:05:17.923 --> 00:05:21.994
And we get, I think we
deserve a drum roll now,

00:05:21.994 --> 00:05:25.233
we get the product of PS

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:29.880
and RS being equal to,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.578
let's see, what's 14 times five?

00:05:32.578 --> 00:05:34.570
It's gonna be 50 plus 20.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.998
It's going to be 70.

00:05:35.998 --> 00:05:40.781
So this is going to be
equal to 70 over three.

00:05:40.781 --> 00:05:43.516
And we are done.
