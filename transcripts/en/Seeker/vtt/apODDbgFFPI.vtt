00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.600
There's a lot of talk about nuclear technology,
what with Iran and Fukushima and Green Energy

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.370
being thrown around every day.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:15.389
But how do we even MAKE nuclear fuel?

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.230
Howdy atomic children, Trace here for DNews…

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.599
Despite the controversy they often raise,
nuclear power plants are a huge source of

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:23.599
energy.

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.870
The Environmental Protection Agency says nuclear
power accounts for about 20% of electricity

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.289
production in the U.S.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.830
One of the reasons why is because it’s the
most efficient means of extracting energy

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.800
from a fuel source - about 8,000 times more
efficient than coal or oil.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.680
According to the Nuclear Energy Institute,
a fingertip-sized pellet of nuclear fuel contains

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:50.070
as much energy as "17,000 cubic feet of natural
gas, 1,780 pounds of coal, or 149 gallons

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.070
of oil."

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.390
Nuclear energy comes in two flavors, fusion
or fission.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.240
Fusion is when two hydrogen atoms fuse -- this
happens in stars; and fission is when large

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.120
"heavy" atoms are broken apart.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.980
Both release energy, and both have pros and
cons, but so far, we've only figured out nuclear

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.280
fission; so when I say fuel, I'm talking about
fuel for nuclear fission.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.140
Nuclear fuel is commonly referred to in the
news, as "highly-enriched Uranium," but getting

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.480
it to that point requires a LOT of effort.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.320
In 1941, Enrico Fermi, created the first controlled
nuclear chain reaction using a small amount

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.300
of uranium-235; and since then we've gotten
much better at taking uranium and creating

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.170
usable fuel from it.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.250
Uranium ore is most commonly mined in Canada,
Australia, Niger, Kazakhstan, Russia, and

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.050
Namibia; though it's not THAT rare -- it's
40 times more prevalent than silver in the

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.060
Earth's crust.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.190
Once drilled or dug out of the ground, the
uranium atoms are mixed in with the surrounding

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.370
minerals -- so it has to be processed -- this
involves some pretty intense chemistry.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:53.800
First, the ore is crushed, and then heated,
to dry out carbon content (like clay) so it

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.080
can be washed away.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.850
That slurry of ore and water is leached with
sulfuric acid.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.560
These processes cause the uranium atoms to
bond with the sulfur and oxygen forming uranium

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.820
oxide liquid.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.630
To get it to that yellow powder we recognize
from movies, the uranium is pulled out of

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.690
solution using ammonia.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.730
This "yellow cake" uranium is put in barrels
and shipped off to be purified even MORE.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.250
At this point the uranium isn't super radioactive,
yet…

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.190
If you stood one meter from a barrel full
of U three O eight, you'd get no more radiation

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.030
than from the cosmic rays hitting passengers
on a commercial airplane.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.490
This uranium still needs to then be enriched
before it can be used in power generation.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:41.890
That yellow cake uranium is 99.3 percent Uranium
238 and only 0.7 percent of uranium-235.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.060
To make the fuel, scientists need that U235
isotope -- this is where the now-famous nuclear

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.470
centrifuges come in.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.000
If you watch the news, you know Iran is developing
a nuclear program -- whether for energy or

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.030
weaponry, I'll leave that to the experts;
but they use centrifuges to enrich that uranium.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.690
As things go forward from here, it gets more
dangerous, and more radioactive, so the engineering

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.580
has to be VERY precise or people can die.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.030
First, they take the yellowcake uranium and
they turn it into a gas by creating a reaction

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.700
with fluorine -- the resulting uranium hexafluoride
gas is even MORE pure than yellowcake and

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.810
ready to go in a centrifuge.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.520
A centrifuge is a giant spinning container
designed to use physics in order to separate

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.520
materials.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.319
When you donate plasma, doctors draw blood
and spin it in a centrifuge.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.590
During the spinning, centrifugal -- or center
fleeing -- forces cause the heavier red blood

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.620
cells to come out of solution and collect
as far from the center as possible; lighter

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.750
plasma stays nearer the inside!

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.280
In the case of uranium, it's the same.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.700
The heavier U238 isotopes get thrown outward,
allowing the lighter U235 to stay closer to

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.090
the middle.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.020
It's not as good as blood, because there's
only a 1 percent difference in mass; so it

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.370
has to be spun again and again in centrifuge
after centrifuge THOUSANDS of times.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.480
Eventually, the gas in the middle of the centrifuge
gets more and more concentrated -- or ENRICHED!

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.580
The gas is MORE U235!

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.480
Once the fuel is 5 percent U235 (95 percent
U238) it's suitable for some nuclear reactors.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.790
Others require as high as 20 percent.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.819
But that's nowhere NEAR enriched enough for
nuclear weapons, which can require as high

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.049
at 90 percent U235.

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.060
Once it's reached the desired enrichment for
the type of power plant you want to run, the

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.310
enriched uranium hexafluoride has to be turned
into a solid by adding calcium.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.759
The calcium and fluoride react, creating a
salt, leaving behind only uranium oxide, which

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.509
is heated to 1400C and extruded into tiny
ceramic pellets.

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:43.850
Those uranium pellets are, in turn, put into
rods, and then hundreds or thousands of those

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.969
rods can be placed in various configurations
inside a nuclear power plant.

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.370
When we talk about nuclear energy programs
in other countries, world leaders get nervous.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.440
And now that you know the process, can you
see why?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.099
The massive centrifuges used make nuclear
fuel, are the same ones that could create

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:01.720
weapons grade uranium.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.400
It requires a lot of technical and chemical
knowledge to GET to that point, but in the

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.830
end it's dig uranium out, clean it up, and
then spin it!

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.629
Nuclear energy continues to be a controversial
choice for powering the future, and it's connection

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:28.680
to nuclear weapons is clear, but how do you
feel about 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:48.750
nuclear energy?
