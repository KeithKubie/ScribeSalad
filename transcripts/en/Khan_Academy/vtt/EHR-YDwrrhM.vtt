00:00:00.085 --> 00:00:01.612
- [Voiceover] So this is an example from

00:00:01.612 --> 00:00:03.957
the Khan Academy exercise,
graphing solutions

00:00:03.957 --> 00:00:06.372
to two variable linear equations.

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:07.904
And they tell us to complete the table

00:00:07.904 --> 00:00:10.319
so each row represents a solution of

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.666
the following equation.

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:13.059
And they give us the equation,

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:13.918
and then they want us to figure out,

00:00:13.918 --> 00:00:15.125
what does y equal when x is

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:16.658
equal to negative five?

00:00:16.658 --> 00:00:17.889
And what does x equal when

00:00:17.889 --> 00:00:19.955
y is equal to eight.

00:00:19.955 --> 00:00:21.116
And to figure this out,

00:00:21.116 --> 00:00:22.509
I've actually copied and pasted this

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.808
part of the problem onto my scratchpad,

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:27.455
so let me get that out.

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:29.336
And so this is the exact same problem,

00:00:29.336 --> 00:00:30.613
there's a couple of ways that

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:32.122
we could try to tackle it.

00:00:32.122 --> 00:00:34.583
One way, is you could try
to simplify this more,

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:36.115
get all your xs on one side

00:00:36.115 --> 00:00:37.764
and all your ys on the other side.

00:00:37.764 --> 00:00:40.215
Or we could just literally substitute

00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:42.106
when x equals negative five,

00:00:42.106 --> 00:00:44.544
what must y equal?

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.494
Actually, let me do it
the second way, first.

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:47.934
So if we take this equation,

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:49.931
and we substitute x with negative five,

00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:51.208
what do we get?

00:00:51.208 --> 00:00:54.993
We get negative three times,

00:00:54.993 --> 00:00:56.757
well, we're gonna say x is negative five,

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:58.382
times negative five,

00:00:58.382 --> 00:01:00.612
plus seven y

00:01:00.612 --> 00:01:03.793
is equal to five times, x is once again,

00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:05.371
it's gonna be negative five,

00:01:05.371 --> 00:01:06.509
x is negative five,

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:08.320
five times negative five,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.876
plus two y.

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:11.850
See, negative three times negative five

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.684
is positive 15,

00:01:13.684 --> 00:01:16.609
plus seven y, is equal to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.510
negative 25 plus two y.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.109
And now, to solve for y,

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:27.197
let's see, I could subtract
two y from both sides,

00:01:27.197 --> 00:01:29.751
so that I get rid of the
two y here on the right.

00:01:29.751 --> 00:01:32.259
So let me subtract two y,

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.720
subtract two y from both sides.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.555
And then if I want all my
constants on the right hand side,

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:40.525
I can subtract 15 from both sides.

00:01:40.525 --> 00:01:43.427
So let me subtract 15 from both sides.

00:01:43.427 --> 00:01:47.403
And I'm going to be left with
15 minus 15, that's zero,

00:01:47.403 --> 00:01:48.628
that's the whole point of subtracting

00:01:48.628 --> 00:01:51.867
15 from both sides, so I
get rid of this 15 here.

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:53.342
Seven y minus two y.

00:01:53.342 --> 00:01:56.069
Seven of something minus
two of that same something

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:57.498
is gonna be five of that something.

00:01:57.498 --> 00:01:59.193
It's gonna be equal to five y,

00:01:59.193 --> 00:02:03.303
is equal to negative 25 minus 15.

00:02:03.303 --> 00:02:05.253
Well, that's gonna be negative 40.

00:02:05.253 --> 00:02:07.933
And then two y minus two y,
well, that's just gonna be zero.

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:09.131
That was the whole point of subtracting

00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:11.058
two y from both sides.

00:02:11.058 --> 00:02:14.218
So you have five times y
is equal to negative 40.

00:02:14.218 --> 00:02:16.886
Or, if we divide both sides by five,

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:18.906
we divide both sides by five,

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:23.434
we would get y is equal to negative eight.

00:02:23.434 --> 00:02:26.197
So when x is equal to negative five,

00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:28.612
y is equal to negative eight.

00:02:28.612 --> 00:02:32.303
Y is equal to negative eight.

00:02:32.303 --> 00:02:34.486
And actually we can fill that in.

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:38.084
So this y is going to be
equal to negative eight.

00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:39.733
And now we gotta figure this out.

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:42.729
What does x equal when
y is positive eight?

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:47.024
Well, we can go back
to our scratchpad here.

00:02:47.024 --> 00:02:48.789
And I'll take the same equation,

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:51.807
but let's make y equal to positive eight.

00:02:51.807 --> 00:02:55.197
So you have negative three x

00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:58.262
plus seven, now y is going to be eight,

00:02:58.262 --> 00:02:59.748
y is eight,

00:02:59.748 --> 00:03:03.231
seven times eight is
equal to five times x,

00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:05.367
plus two times, once again,

00:03:05.367 --> 00:03:08.595
y is eight, two times eight.

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:11.149
So we get negative three x

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.446
plus 56, that's 56,

00:03:14.446 --> 00:03:18.441
is equal to five x plus 16.

00:03:18.441 --> 00:03:20.669
Now, if we wanna get all of our

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.410
constants on one side,

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.582
and of all of our x
terms on the other side,

00:03:24.582 --> 00:03:26.288
well, what could we do?

00:03:26.288 --> 00:03:29.011
Let's see, we could add
three x to both sides.

00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:31.790
That would get rid of
all the xs on this side,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.114
and put 'em all on this side.

00:03:33.114 --> 00:03:35.598
So we're gonna add three x to both sides.

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:36.806
And, let's see,

00:03:36.806 --> 00:03:39.058
if we want to get all the
constants on the left hand side,

00:03:39.058 --> 00:03:40.637
we'd wanna get rid of the 16,

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.516
so we could subtract 16
from the right hand side,

00:03:43.516 --> 00:03:44.305
if we do it from the right,

00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:46.860
we're gonna have to do
it from the left as well.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.977
And we're gonna be left
with, these cancel out,

00:03:49.977 --> 00:03:54.708
56 minus 16 is positive 40.

00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:56.008
And then, let's see,

00:03:56.008 --> 00:03:57.564
16 minus 16 is zero.

00:03:57.564 --> 00:04:00.593
Five x plus three x is equal to eight x.

00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:03.531
We get eight x is equal to 40.

00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:06.062
We could divide both sides by eight,

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:10.380
and we get, five is equal to x.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.609
So this right over here is going

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:15.187
to be equal to five.

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:18.441
So let's go back, let's go back, now.

00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:20.690
So when y is positive eight,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.174
x is positive five.

00:04:23.174 --> 00:04:25.270
Now they ask us, "Use your two solutions

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.516
"to graph the equation."

00:04:27.516 --> 00:04:28.631
So let's see if we can do,

00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:32.308
oh, whoops, let me, let
me use my mouse now.

00:04:32.308 --> 00:04:33.785
So to graph the equations.

00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:36.382
So when x is negative
five, y is negative eight.

00:04:36.382 --> 00:04:40.890
So the point negative
five comma negative eight.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.110
So that's right over there.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.563
So let me move my browser
up so you can see that.

00:04:46.563 --> 00:04:49.429
Negative five, when x is negative five,

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:51.403
y is negative eight.

00:04:51.403 --> 00:04:54.328
And when x is positive five,

00:04:54.328 --> 00:04:55.397
and we see that up here,

00:04:55.397 --> 00:04:58.391
when x is positive five,
y is positive eight.

00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:01.441
When x is positive five,
y is positive eight.

00:05:01.441 --> 00:05:02.246
And we're done.

00:05:02.246 --> 00:05:04.243
We can check our answer, if we like.

00:05:04.243 --> 00:05:05.520
We got it right.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.076
Now, I said there was
two ways to tackle it,

00:05:07.076 --> 00:05:09.824
I kind of just did it, I guess
you could say, the naive way.

00:05:09.824 --> 00:05:11.162
I just substituted negative five

00:05:11.162 --> 00:05:12.880
directly into this and solved for y.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.760
And then I substituted
y equals positive eight

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.291
directly into this, and then solved for x.

00:05:18.291 --> 00:05:19.660
Another way that I could have done it,

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.868
that actually probably would have been,

00:05:20.868 --> 00:05:22.957
or, it would for sure, would have been

00:05:22.957 --> 00:05:24.490
the easier way to do it,

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.978
is ahead of time to try to
simplify this expression.

00:05:27.978 --> 00:05:30.165
So what I could have done,
right from the get-go,

00:05:30.165 --> 00:05:31.802
is said, "Hey, let's put
all my xs on one side,

00:05:31.802 --> 00:05:33.936
"and all my ys on the other side."

00:05:33.936 --> 00:05:37.863
So this is negative three x plus seven y

00:05:37.863 --> 00:05:41.670
is equal to five x plus two y.

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.807
Now let's say I wanna
get all my ys on the left

00:05:43.807 --> 00:05:45.711
and all my xs on the right.

00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:48.218
So I don't want this
negative three x on the left,

00:05:48.218 --> 00:05:50.308
so I'd wanna add three x.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:51.840
Adding three x would cancel this out,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.187
but I can't just do it
on the left hand side,

00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:55.811
I have to do it on the
right hand side as well.

00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:58.667
And then, if I wanna get rid
of this two y on the right,

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:00.640
I could subtract two y from the right,

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.176
but, of course, I'd also
wanna do it from the left.

00:06:03.176 --> 00:06:04.657
And then what am I left with?

00:06:04.657 --> 00:06:07.188
So negative three x plus three x is zero,

00:06:07.188 --> 00:06:10.485
seven y minus two y is five y.

00:06:10.485 --> 00:06:13.109
And then I have five x plus three x

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:14.665
is eight x.

00:06:14.665 --> 00:06:17.730
Two y minus two y is zero.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.425
And then if I wanted
to, I could solve for y,

00:06:19.425 --> 00:06:21.003
I could divide both sides by five

00:06:21.003 --> 00:06:25.787
and I'd get y is equal to 8/5 x.

00:06:25.787 --> 00:06:27.992
So, this right over here represents

00:06:27.992 --> 00:06:30.384
the same exact equation as this over here,

00:06:30.384 --> 00:06:32.009
it's just written in a different way.

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.169
All of the xy pairs that satisfy this,

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:36.398
would satisfy this, and vice versa.

00:06:36.398 --> 00:06:37.350
And this is much easier.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.671
Because if x is now negative five,

00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:41.018
if x is negative five,

00:06:41.018 --> 00:06:43.712
y would be 8/5 times negative five,

00:06:43.712 --> 00:06:45.848
well, that's going to be negative eight.

00:06:45.848 --> 00:06:48.193
And when y is equal to eight,

00:06:48.193 --> 00:06:50.190
well, you actually could
even do this up here,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.951
you could say five times
eight is equal to eight x,

00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:54.918
and then you could see, well

00:06:54.918 --> 00:06:56.936
five times eight the same
thing as eight times five,

00:06:56.936 --> 00:06:58.868
so x would be equal to five.

00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:00.135
So I think this would actually have been

00:07:00.135 --> 00:07:00.824
a simpler way to do it.

00:07:00.824 --> 00:07:02.658
You see it all, I was able
to do the entire problem

00:07:02.658 --> 00:07:04.051
in this little white space here,

00:07:04.051 --> 00:07:05.537
instead of having to do all of this,

00:07:05.537 --> 00:07:08.295
slightly, slightly hairier, algebra.
