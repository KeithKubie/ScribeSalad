00:00:00.501 --> 00:00:02.678
Voiceover:The price of
things at two supermarkets

00:00:02.678 --> 00:00:04.388
are different in different cities.

00:00:04.388 --> 00:00:08.562
Toilet paper in Duluth,
Minnesota cost 3.99 a package

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:13.142
while toilet paper in New
York City cost 8.95 a package.

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:17.281
In Duluth, toothpaste costs $1.95 a tube

00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:22.086
while in New York City
it costs $5.25 a tube.

00:00:22.086 --> 00:00:23.993
The data for this can be encoded

00:00:23.993 --> 00:00:26.316
in the following grocery matrix.

00:00:26.316 --> 00:00:27.972
Let's see if this makes sense.

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:33.241
They have the price of
toilet paper in Duluth 3.99

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:35.356
that's this right over here.

00:00:35.356 --> 00:00:37.938
Then they have the price of toilet paper

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:40.079
in New York at 8.95

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.896
so that's this right over here.

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:44.093
This first row right over here,

00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:45.587
this is the toilet paper row.

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:50.510
I'll just write TP for short,
that's the toilet paper row

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.910
and this first column
looks like it's Duluth

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.725
while this second column
looks like it's New York City.

00:01:00.354 --> 00:01:02.624
Let's see if that works
out for the other data.

00:01:02.624 --> 00:01:08.654
In Duluth a toothpaste cost $1.95 a tube,

00:01:08.654 --> 00:01:12.778
so this data right over
here, is right over here.

00:01:12.778 --> 00:01:14.931
This looks like the toothpaste row.

00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:18.683
Toothpaste actually is also TP

00:01:18.683 --> 00:01:20.132
so I'll just write out tooth.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.098
This is the toothpaste row,

00:01:23.098 --> 00:01:24.981
this is toothpaste in Duluth, $1.95.

00:01:24.981 --> 00:01:28.102
Toothpaste in New York City, 5.25.

00:01:28.102 --> 00:01:31.080
That's how they have set-up
the data right over here.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.785
Which statements are true
about the above matrix?

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:38.359
Select all that apply.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:41.554
The following matrix can also be used

00:01:41.554 --> 00:01:43.560
to contain the same information as G.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.459
That's what's interesting
about the matrix,

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:46.928
what we have right over here

00:01:46.928 --> 00:01:49.584
is essentially an encapsulation
of all of the data

00:01:49.584 --> 00:01:51.911
that we have in this upper paragraph

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.857
and it's useful because a computer

00:01:53.857 --> 00:01:55.593
could make use of this data

00:01:55.593 --> 00:01:57.626
as long as it knows what these rows

00:01:57.626 --> 00:01:59.705
and what these columns actually represent.

00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:01.657
The first thing they ask us

00:02:01.657 --> 00:02:04.674
is whether the following
matrix can also be used

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:06.553
to contain the same information.

00:02:06.553 --> 00:02:10.899
Let's see, this is the price
of toilet paper in Duluth

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.931
and this right over here is the price

00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:17.074
of toilet paper in New York City.

00:02:18.043 --> 00:02:19.709
They have the exact same first row,

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.391
I would say that looks
like the toilet paper row

00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:24.658
and that would be Duluth column

00:02:24.658 --> 00:02:26.837
and this would be the
New York City column.

00:02:26.837 --> 00:02:30.105
Then if we define things that way

00:02:30.105 --> 00:02:32.885
then this would have to
be the toothpaste row,

00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:37.757
but the price of toothpaste in Duluth

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:40.017
is not 5.25,

00:02:40.017 --> 00:02:42.609
and the price of
toothpaste in New York City

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.120
is not 1.95.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.525
This one is not representing
the same information

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:48.555
as that up there.

00:02:50.678 --> 00:02:52.677
You can't just randomly order this around.

00:02:52.677 --> 00:02:54.432
Now you could represent it in other ways,

00:02:54.432 --> 00:02:56.007
you could have another ...

00:02:56.007 --> 00:02:58.057
Let's say I have the matrix A,

00:02:58.057 --> 00:03:01.092
we could have picked to
do something like this

00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:03.016
where we could have said

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:07.075
well maybe this is the toothpaste column

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:11.104
and maybe this is the toilet paper column,

00:03:11.104 --> 00:03:13.808
and that this first row is New York City

00:03:13.808 --> 00:03:16.544
and the second row is Duluth.

00:03:16.544 --> 00:03:18.254
You could have done something like this

00:03:18.254 --> 00:03:21.321
toothpaste in New York City was 5.25,

00:03:21.321 --> 00:03:25.435
toilet paper in New York City is 8.95,

00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:29.713
toothpaste in Duluth is 1.95

00:03:29.713 --> 00:03:34.868
and toilet paper in Duluth is 3.99.

00:03:34.868 --> 00:03:38.251
This would have been, this matrix A

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.459
that I've just constructed,

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.906
this does contain the same data

00:03:41.906 --> 00:03:45.225
because if we appropriately
define our columns and rows

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.043
to represent toothpaste or toilet paper

00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:48.204
in New York City or Duluth,

00:03:48.204 --> 00:03:49.852
you can contain that information.

00:03:49.852 --> 00:03:52.479
The problem with this one
is it's not consistent.

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:54.124
This first row makes us think,

00:03:54.124 --> 00:03:56.518
okay this must be the Duluth column,

00:03:56.518 --> 00:03:58.282
this must be the New York City column

00:03:58.282 --> 00:04:00.990
and that the second row must be toothpaste

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.571
since the first row is toilet paper

00:04:02.571 --> 00:04:04.171
but then they got things mixed up.

00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:06.188
If they switch these two things around

00:04:06.188 --> 00:04:07.846
then obviously you get the same matrix

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:10.174
but then at least the data
would have been consistent.

00:04:10.174 --> 00:04:12.498
I definitely would not
say that this matrix

00:04:12.498 --> 00:04:14.504
contains the same information.

00:04:14.504 --> 00:04:17.778
The second column represents
the price of toothpaste

00:04:17.778 --> 00:04:19.425
in the two cities.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:22.674
The second column is this right over here,

00:04:22.674 --> 00:04:24.754
no, that's not the price of
toothpaste in the two cities,

00:04:24.754 --> 00:04:26.823
that's the price of
the two different goods

00:04:26.823 --> 00:04:27.804
in New York City,

00:04:27.804 --> 00:04:29.675
so I wouldn't check that one either.

00:04:29.675 --> 00:04:34.875
Element G two comma one is equal to 5.25,

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:36.890
so when someone says ...

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.547
If you have the matrix

00:04:38.547 --> 00:04:41.110
and they give you two comma one.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.573
These are the indices of
the row and the column,

00:04:44.573 --> 00:04:47.920
so this is a second row, first column.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.151
Let's go there, second
row so this is one, two,

00:04:52.151 --> 00:04:57.152
second row, first column
is right over there.

00:04:57.152 --> 00:05:08.094
G two comma one is not 5.25,

00:05:08.094 --> 00:05:10.037
so I wouldn't check that one either.

00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:12.844
A change in the price of
toilet paper in Duluth

00:05:12.844 --> 00:05:14.366
can be represented by the matrix.

00:05:14.366 --> 00:05:19.228
Toilet paper in Duluth is this entry

00:05:19.228 --> 00:05:20.990
of our matrix right over there.

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.526
Change in toilet paper in Duluth

00:05:23.526 --> 00:05:26.496
would represent a change in this 3.99

00:05:26.496 --> 00:05:28.414
but they didn't change the 3.99,

00:05:28.414 --> 00:05:30.374
they changed the 9.75.

00:05:30.374 --> 00:05:32.509
The 9.75 would represent a change

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:35.047
in the price of toilet
paper in New York City.

00:05:35.047 --> 00:05:36.820
I wouldn't check that one either,

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.147
so I would only go with none of the above.
