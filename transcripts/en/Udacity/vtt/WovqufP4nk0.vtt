00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.580
We have just learned about the theory behind what

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.120
makes an effective data visualization.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.610
We saw how color, shape, length and scales, among other visual elements,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.190
can contribute both to the aesthetics of a data visualization,

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.330
as well as how the underlying information and data is communicated.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.490
Now I want to talk about how we might make some of the visualizations we

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.160
have seen and put the theory we talked about into practice.
