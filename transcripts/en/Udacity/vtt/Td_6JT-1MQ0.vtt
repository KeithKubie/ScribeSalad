00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay. So that's how a single checkbox works

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
but, rarely do you see a single checkbox by itself.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Usually you see them in a group.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So let's add a few more here.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So I've added two more checkboxes--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
type="checkbox"--

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and I've made their names be "r" and "s".

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
So now we have "q", "r", and "s".

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And then I also added a line break so it can

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
have a little separation from our Submit button.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Let's see how this looks in our browser.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Okay. If I Reload this page in our browser,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
now we see--we have 3 checkboxes

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and they can be toggled on and off,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
as you do with checkboxes.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Now what I'd like you to do is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
tell me what happens when I check

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
these first 2 checkboxes and I hit Submit.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So when we select the first two checkboxes and click Submit,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
what does the "query" section of the URL look like?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Remember, the query section--that's the name

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
for the portion of the URL, after the question mark.
