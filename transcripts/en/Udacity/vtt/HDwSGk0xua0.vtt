00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.660
Sometimes students have a hard time determining whether something is

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.610
reinforcement or punishment, or positive reinforcement or negative

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.025
reinforcement. The first the easiest thing to do is to say does the behavior

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:16.488
increase? If the behavior increases, it's reinforcement. If the behavior

00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:20.500
decreases, it's punishment. After you decide that, then go back and look, did

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.370
the behavior increase because something was added to the environment? If so

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.121
that's positive reinforcement. Or did the behavior increase because something

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:34.164
was taken away from the environment? If so that's negative reinforcement. And

00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:37.250
the same for punishment. If behavior decreases, did it decrease because

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.813
something was added to the environment, for example a painful shock? That would

00:00:41.813 --> 00:00:45.471
be positive punishment, and removing something from the environment and

00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:50.408
behavior decreasing would be negative punishment. So first ask, does behavior

00:00:50.408 --> 00:00:54.046
increase or decrease? And then ask, did it happen because something was added

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:57.755
to the environment or taken away? You can use this when you're going through

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:00.763
the problem sets, but I encourage you to look at your own life and see examples

00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:05.690
of positive and negative punishment, and positive and negative reinforcement.
