00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.510
Ron and Hermione are
practicing lifting feathers

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.910
into the air with magic.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.280
Hermione can lift a feather
35 feet into the air, which

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.250
is 5 times as high as
Ron can lift a feather.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.250
How high can Ron lift a
feather with his magic?

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.320
So Hermione, this 35 feet
is 5 times more than Ron.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.180
So to figure out
what Ron can do,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.300
we just take what Hermione
can do and divide by 5.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.230
So what's 35 divided by 5?

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.020
Well, 5 times 7 is 35.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.220
So 35 divided by 5 is 7.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.830
So Ron can lift a feather
7 feet in the air.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.955
So let's check our answer.

00:00:37.955 --> 00:00:39.880
Now, if you have trouble
with this-- and we

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.800
could also look at
the hints for this.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.870
So they show that Hermione can
lift a feather 35 feet, which

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.570
is 5 times higher than Ron.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.020
So this could be the length
of how high Ron can raise it.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.810
And so, if you were
to actually divide 35

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.875
into 5 equal sections,
so 5 times question mark

00:00:56.875 --> 00:01:00.820
is 35, that's the same thing
as saying 35 divided by 5

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.050
is question mark.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.690
And 35 divided by 5 is indeed 7.
