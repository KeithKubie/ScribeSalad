00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:20.734
The word entheogenic
means god-facilitating.

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:23.270
And it's this idea that tools
and techniques of ecstasy

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.970
can act as conduits,
as mediation

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.320
catalysts for encounters
with the numinous.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.310
They are essentially
god-hacks, OK?

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.710
It's this notion that
we are able to tweak

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.440
our subjective
experience to catalyze

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.900
a shift in consciousness that
leads us to kind of god-mode.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.211
And as Mckenna says, "Do not
give in to the astonishment."

00:00:49.211 --> 00:00:52.760
The realization that reality
is but a matrix of perception,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.998
that we can pierce that veil,
that we can raise the stage

00:00:57.998 --> 00:00:59.366
is astonishing.

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:02.660
It means we are
ontological engineers.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.440
We are the music makers and
we are the dreamers of dreams

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.649
indeed.

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:09.565
We tumble down that rabbit hole.

00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:12.918
We re-inscribe,
redefine, re-edit

00:01:12.918 --> 00:01:14.834
the nature of that rabbit hole.

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:17.229
The wonderland becomes
our wonderland.

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.652
The hero's journey
becomes the map

00:01:19.652 --> 00:01:22.440
for our own ecstatic
illumination.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.930
And I love this notion.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.370
You know, Mircia
Eliade, the philosopher,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.322
talked about
techniques of ecstasy.

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:32.240
He described shamans as
literally ecstatic technicians

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.330
of the sacred.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.960
This is my dream, right?

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.854
This notion that we actually
are able to create conditions,

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:45.291
to create spaces for all of us
to become ecstatic technicians

00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:46.277
of the sacred.

00:01:46.277 --> 00:01:47.756
That the passport
to the numinous

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:50.221
lies within and
that we can hack it.

00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:52.532
That there is a god-hack.

00:01:52.532 --> 00:01:53.031
Oof.

00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:54.414
It's an entheogenic revolution.

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:57.810
Boundaries are being dissolved
and we are being reborn.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.980
It is our birthright.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.640
It is our birthplace.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.440
We are as gods.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.540
We might as well get good at it.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.540
Cognitive ecstasy,
meta-cognitive ecstasy

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.690
is within.
