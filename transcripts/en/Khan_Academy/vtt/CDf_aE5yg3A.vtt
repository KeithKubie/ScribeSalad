00:00:00.382 --> 00:00:02.167
- [Voiceover] What I would
like to tackle in this video

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:04.133
is what I consider to be a particularly

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.800
interesting limits problem.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.796
Let's say we want to figure out the limit

00:00:07.796 --> 00:00:12.033
as X approaches zero from
the positive direction

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.900
of sine of X.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.833
This is where it's about
to get interesting.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:20.200
Sine of X to the one over

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.166
the natural log of X power

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.766
and I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:25.766 --> 00:00:27.700
and see if you can have a go at it

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.500
fully knowing that this

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.400
is a little bit of a tricky exercise.

00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:32.833
I'm assuming you have attempted.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.166
Some of you might have
been able to figure out

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:35.100
on the first pass.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.594
I will tell you that the first time

00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:37.933
that I encountered something like this,

00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.833
I did not figure it out at the first pass

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:41.100
so definitely do not feel bad

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.633
if you fall into that second category.

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:45.733
What many of you all probably did

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:47.166
is you said okay, let me think about it.

00:00:47.166 --> 00:00:48.833
Let me just think about
the components here.

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:51.333
If I were to think about the limit,

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:55.400
if I were to think about the
limit as X approaches zero

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.466
from the positive direction of sine of X,

00:00:58.466 --> 00:00:59.733
well that's pretty straightforward.

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:01.000
That's going to be zero,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.033
so you could think of like this part of it

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.633
is going to approach
zero but then if you say,

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:07.566
and you could say, I guess I should say.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.767
The limit as X approaches zero

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:12.200
from the positive direction of one over

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.733
natural log of X

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:15.366
and this is why we have to think about it

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:16.400
from the positive direction.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.723
It doesn't make sense to approach it

00:01:17.723 --> 00:01:18.700
from the negative direction.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.733
You can't take the natural log

00:01:19.733 --> 00:01:21.166
of a negative number.

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:23.466
That's not in the domain
for the natural log

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:25.366
but as you get closer and closer to zero

00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:26.866
from the negative direction,

00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:29.000
the natural log of those values,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.166
you have to raise E

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.733
to more larger and larger negative values.

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.325
This part over here is going to approach

00:01:34.325 --> 00:01:35.799
negative infinity.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.033
It's going to go to negative infinity.

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:38.566
One over negative infinity,

00:01:38.566 --> 00:01:40.600
one divided by super large

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.166
or large magnitude negative numbers,

00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:46.033
well, that's just going to approach zero.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:47.833
You could say that this right over here

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:50.566
is also going to be,

00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:52.900
is also going to be equal to zero.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.400
That doesn't seem to help us much

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.207
because if this thing is going to zero

00:01:58.207 --> 00:01:59.600
and that thing is going to zero,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.566
it's kind of an implication that well

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.433
maybe this whole thing is going to zero

00:02:03.433 --> 00:02:07.200
to the zero power but we
don't really know what zero,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.938
let me do the some, those color.

00:02:08.938 --> 00:02:11.033
Zero to the

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.933
zero power but this is one of those great

00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:16.800
fun things to think about in mathematics.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.800
There's justifications
why this could be zero,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.633
justifications why this could be one.

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:22.833
We don't really know what to make of this.

00:02:22.833 --> 00:02:25.666
This isn't really a satisfying answer.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:27.266
Something at this point

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:28.833
might be going into your brain.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.566
We have this thing that we've been exposed

00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:32.833
to called L'Hopital's rule.

00:02:32.833 --> 00:02:33.866
If you have not been exposed to it,

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:35.100
I encourage you to watch the video,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.133
the introductory video
on L'Hopital's rule.

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:40.368
In L'Hopital's rule, let
me just write it down.

00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:45.133
L'Hopital's rule

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:47.966
helps us out with situations where

00:02:47.966 --> 00:02:50.500
when we try to superficially
evaluate the limit,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.033
we get indeterminate forms

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:53.766
things like zero over zero.

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:57.133
We get infinity over infinity.

00:02:57.133 --> 00:02:59.733
We get negative infinity
over negative infinity

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:01.500
and we go into much more
detail into that video.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.800
It seems this is kind of,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.366
it feels like we're
getting a zero to a zero.

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:09.033
It's kind of we're
getting the strange beast

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:12.333
and at least evokes the
notion of L'Hopital's rule.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:15.300
You will not be, as we'll
see in a few seconds,

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.200
you're not wrong to, for that

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.866
L'Hopital's rule neuron to
be triggering in your brain

00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.633
although you can't apply it directly

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:23.600
to this right over here.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.400
L'Hopital's rule does not apply to

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.500
or directly apply to the
zero to the zero form

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.700
but what we can do is construct a problem

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.466
where L'Hopital's rule will apply

00:03:33.466 --> 00:03:36.300
and then use that to solve, to figure out

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.066
what this is going to be.

00:03:38.066 --> 00:03:41.500
This was essentially the
tricky part of this exercise.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.433
Well what do I mean?

00:03:42.433 --> 00:03:44.433
Well if we set Y

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:47.525
equal to Y of

00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:49.033
and maybe let me write it this way.

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:51.000
If we set, and I'll write Y,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.392
I could just write Y but I'll say Y

00:03:52.392 --> 00:03:53.566
is clearly a function of X.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.966
If we say Y of X is going to be sine of X,

00:03:56.842 --> 00:03:59.800
sine of X to the one over

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.733
natural log of X.

00:04:01.733 --> 00:04:03.484
This thing right over
here is essentially saying

00:04:03.484 --> 00:04:05.200
what's the limit as X approaches zero

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.818
from the positive direction of Y

00:04:06.818 --> 00:04:07.766
and once again we don't know.

00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:09.600
Maybe it's zero to the zero

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.166
but we don't know what
zero to zero actually is.

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:15.066
What we could do, what we could do

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:16.333
and this is a trick that you see a lot

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:18.500
and anytime you get kind of
weird things with exponents

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.766
and whether you're doing
limits or derivatives,

00:04:20.766 --> 00:04:23.666
as you'll see it's often times useful

00:04:23.666 --> 00:04:26.133
to take the natural log of both sides.

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:27.866
Well what happens if
you take the natural log

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:29.000
of both sides here?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.800
On the left-hand side

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.461
you're going to have the natural log,

00:04:32.461 --> 00:04:34.767
the natural log, and whenever
I think of natural log

00:04:34.767 --> 00:04:37.627
and E the way I always think about them,

00:04:37.627 --> 00:04:39.666
the color green for some bizarre reason

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:41.766
but we'll say the natural log of Y

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:43.733
is equal to.

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:45.600
If you take the natural log of this thing,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.266
actually let me just, I
don't want to skip steps here

00:04:47.266 --> 00:04:48.566
because this is interesting.

00:04:48.566 --> 00:04:49.833
This is going to be the natural log

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:52.700
of all of this business of sine of X,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.100
let me write this way.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:55.666
Sine of X,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.812
sine, I want to do this
in that orange color.

00:04:59.812 --> 00:05:02.266
The natural log of

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:05.700
sine of X to the one

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.600
over the natural log of X.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.866
Well we know from our exponent prior

00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:11.066
our logarithm properties,

00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:13.300
the logarithm of something to a power,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.033
that's the same thing as the power.

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:17.933
One over natural log of X

00:05:17.933 --> 00:05:22.366
times the logarithm, this
case the natural logarithm

00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:25.307
of whatever taking the sine of X here.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.386
Sine of X

00:05:29.386 --> 00:05:33.466
or we could say the natural log of Y.

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.409
Want to keep, stay color consistent

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:36.766
for at least one more step.

00:05:36.766 --> 00:05:38.966
The natural log of Y is equal to,

00:05:38.966 --> 00:05:40.333
if we just rewrite this

00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:42.900
this is going to be the natural log

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.966
of sine of X,

00:05:46.489 --> 00:05:48.100
the natural log

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.266
of sine of X

00:05:52.266 --> 00:05:56.600
over the natural log of X.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.066
Well this is all interesting

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:02.033
but why do we care about this?

00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:03.081
Why did I do this?

00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:05.100
Well instead of thinking
about what is the limit?

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.533
What is the limit as X approaches zero

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:09.266
from the positive direction of Y?

00:06:09.266 --> 00:06:12.166
Let's think about what
the natural log of Y

00:06:12.166 --> 00:06:14.200
is approaching as we approach,

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.233
as X approaches zero from
the positive direction.

00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:19.333
Let's figure out what the
limit of this expression

00:06:19.333 --> 00:06:22.166
right over here is as X approaches zero

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:23.256
from the positive direction.

00:06:23.256 --> 00:06:25.073
What is a natural log of Y?

00:06:25.073 --> 00:06:26.600
What is this whole thing?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.800
Not Y, what is the natural
log of Y approaching?

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.700
Let's think about that scenario.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.866
Let me write, do this in a new color.

00:06:32.866 --> 00:06:34.633
We want to figure out what is the limit

00:06:34.633 --> 00:06:38.100
as X approaches zero from
the positive direction

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.566
of this business and I'll
just write it in one color.

00:06:40.566 --> 00:06:41.666
The natural log

00:06:41.666 --> 00:06:44.800
of sine of X

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.966
over the natural log of X.

00:06:47.966 --> 00:06:50.633
I don't know, I wrote one time in print,

00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:51.700
one time in cursive.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.166
I'll just be consistent right over there.

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:54.933
Now why is this interesting?

00:06:54.933 --> 00:06:56.933
Let's see in the numerator here,

00:06:56.933 --> 00:06:58.689
this thing's going to approach zero,

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:00.081
natural log of zero
you're going to approach

00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:00.980
negative infinity.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.033
This thing right over here natural log of,

00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:04.800
as you approach it from
the positive direction.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.233
Once again you're going to
approach negative infinity.

00:07:07.233 --> 00:07:09.633
This gives you that indeterminate form.

00:07:09.633 --> 00:07:12.233
This is giving you

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:14.833
that indeterminate form
of negative infinity

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:16.833
over negative infinity which is neat

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:20.033
because this triggers or at least tells us

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:22.966
that L'Hopital's rule
may be appropriate here.

00:07:22.966 --> 00:07:25.966
We could say that this
is going to be equal to

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:30.200
the limit as X approaches zero

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.400
from the positive direction.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.867
Let me give myself a little bit more

00:07:32.867 --> 00:07:34.666
real estate to work up with

00:07:34.666 --> 00:07:36.966
and I can take the
derivative of the numerator

00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:38.800
and the derivative of the denominator.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.866
Derivative of the numerator,

00:07:40.866 --> 00:07:43.366
so the derivative of the numerator,

00:07:43.366 --> 00:07:44.633
I'm going to apply the chain rule here.

00:07:44.633 --> 00:07:47.133
Derivative of sine of X is cosine of X

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.300
and then the derivative,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.867
the natural log of sine of X with respect

00:07:51.867 --> 00:07:53.866
to sine of X is going to
be one over sine of X.

00:07:53.866 --> 00:07:56.800
This is going to be over sine of X,

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.133
so that's the derivative of the numerator.

00:07:58.133 --> 00:08:01.333
Then the derivative of the denominator

00:08:02.348 --> 00:08:06.033
is just going to be one over X,

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:08.033
one over X.

00:08:08.033 --> 00:08:10.000
This is all going to be equal to,

00:08:10.738 --> 00:08:12.533
this is equal to the limit

00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:16.600
as X approaches zero from
the positive direction

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.900
of I could write this as cosine of X,

00:08:21.223 --> 00:08:24.584
cosine of X.

00:08:24.584 --> 00:08:25.600
Let's see,

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.033
if I'm dividing by X.

00:08:30.756 --> 00:08:33.700
I'm dividing by X, I am going to get,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:37.766
this is going to be X over sine of X,

00:08:38.504 --> 00:08:41.067
X over sine of X.

00:08:41.067 --> 00:08:42.800
When I apply

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.533
and when I try to take the limit here

00:08:44.533 --> 00:08:45.540
I'm going to get a zero,

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.053
once again we got a zero over zero.

00:08:48.053 --> 00:08:50.400
This doesn't feel too satisfying

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.966
but once again this is
where our limit properties

00:08:52.966 --> 00:08:53.733
might be useful.

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.667
As you can tell, this is not the most

00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:56.753
trivial of problems

00:08:56.753 --> 00:08:58.466
but this is going to be the same thing

00:08:58.466 --> 00:09:01.500
and this will take a little
bit of pattern recognition.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.466
This is the same thing as

00:09:03.466 --> 00:09:05.700
because we know that
the limit of the product

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.500
of two functions

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.036
is equal to the product of their limits,

00:09:08.036 --> 00:09:11.900
this is the same thing as the limit,

00:09:12.576 --> 00:09:15.500
the limit as X approaches zero

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.366
from the positive direction of,

00:09:17.366 --> 00:09:18.833
if we take this part,

00:09:18.833 --> 00:09:20.400
let me do this in a different color.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.800
If we take this part,

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.233
that's not a different color.

00:09:24.233 --> 00:09:28.033
If we take this part right over here,

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:33.033
so that's going to be X over sine of X

00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:35.967
and then times the limit.

00:09:35.967 --> 00:09:38.166
Let me put parenthesis here

00:09:38.166 --> 00:09:41.266
times the limit,

00:09:42.004 --> 00:09:43.458
the limit

00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:48.933
as X approaches zero from
the positive direction

00:09:48.933 --> 00:09:50.766
of cosine of X,

00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:55.266
of cosine of X.

00:09:55.266 --> 00:09:57.166
Now this thing right over here

00:09:57.166 --> 00:09:58.240
is pretty straightforward.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.833
You can just evaluate it at zero,

00:09:59.833 --> 00:10:00.835
you get one.

00:10:00.835 --> 00:10:02.700
This thing right over here is equal to one

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:04.266
but what's this thing?

00:10:04.266 --> 00:10:05.733
This might ring a bell.

00:10:05.733 --> 00:10:07.500
You might have seen the
limit as X approaches zero,

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.194
of sine of X over X.

00:10:09.194 --> 00:10:11.233
This is just the reciprocal of that.

00:10:11.233 --> 00:10:12.766
This is X over sine of X

00:10:12.766 --> 00:10:14.969
but when you just superficially
try to evaluate it.

00:10:14.969 --> 00:10:17.000
You get zero over zero
so you can then apply

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.833
L'Hopital's rule to this thing.

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:22.533
Once again this is quite
an interesting scenario

00:10:22.533 --> 00:10:23.833
we find ourselves in.

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:27.300
This is going to be the
same thing as the limit

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.900
as X approaches zero from
the positive direction.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.571
Derivative at the top is one,

00:10:32.571 --> 00:10:34.967
derivative at the bottom, is cosine of X.

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.667
Well, this is just going to be one over

00:10:37.667 --> 00:10:39.333
cosine of zero is one,

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:40.833
so this is just going to be equal to one.

00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:42.666
We got to apply L'Hopital's rule again

00:10:42.666 --> 00:10:46.100
and realize that this limit
is going to be equal to one.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.233
One times one is one

00:10:48.233 --> 00:10:51.533
so this thing right over
here is equal to one.

00:10:51.533 --> 00:10:53.666
This thing right over here,

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:57.566
this thing right over here is going to be,

00:10:57.566 --> 00:11:01.033
this thing right over here
is going to approach one

00:11:01.033 --> 00:11:04.366
which tells you that this
thing is approaching one.

00:11:04.366 --> 00:11:05.966
What do we now know?

00:11:05.966 --> 00:11:09.100
We now know and I'll
write it out in language.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.904
We now know that the limit

00:11:12.904 --> 00:11:16.166
of the natural log of Y,

00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:19.666
the limit of the natural log of Y

00:11:19.666 --> 00:11:23.766
as X approaches zero from
the positive direction

00:11:23.766 --> 00:11:26.666
is equal to one.

00:11:27.834 --> 00:11:30.866
If the natural log of
Y is approaching one,

00:11:30.866 --> 00:11:32.534
what is Y approaching?

00:11:32.534 --> 00:11:35.333
Well in order for the
natural log, so once again

00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:36.676
we just know this thing right over here.

00:11:36.676 --> 00:11:38.133
We know this thing is one

00:11:38.133 --> 00:11:40.100
and this thing is a natural log of Y.

00:11:41.946 --> 00:11:44.033
We now know that this thing,

00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:45.766
the limit as X approaches
zero of this thing

00:11:45.766 --> 00:11:48.433
is one and that's the
same thing as a limit

00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:50.376
as X approaches zero from
the positive direction

00:11:50.376 --> 00:11:52.933
of the natural log of Y.

00:11:52.933 --> 00:11:55.133
These things are
equivalent, is equal to one.

00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:58.200
Well the natural log
of Y is approaching one

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.600
so if the natural log of Y

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.600
is approaching, let me write it this way.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.433
The natural log of Y is approaching one.

00:12:08.433 --> 00:12:10.500
Well what must Y be approaching?

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.871
Well to get the natural log of something

00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:16.183
that gets you one, well
Y must be approaching E

00:12:16.183 --> 00:12:17.966
because natural log of E is one.

00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:22.866
Then Y must be approaching E

00:12:22.866 --> 00:12:26.233
and we are done because
that's what we cared about.

00:12:26.233 --> 00:12:30.000
We cared about what is
Y, this is Y, remember,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.233
we defined this whole thing as Y.

00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:33.033
We said what is Y approaching

00:12:33.033 --> 00:12:36.500
as X approaches zero from
the positive direction?

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.666
Well we figured out that
the natural log of Y

00:12:38.666 --> 00:12:41.567
is approaching one as X approaches zero

00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:42.667
from the positive direction.

00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:46.366
That means that Y must be approaching E.

00:12:47.612 --> 00:12:49.633
This tells us that this thing,

00:12:49.633 --> 00:12:51.566
this thing right over here

00:12:51.566 --> 00:12:54.733
is equal to E

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:56.566
which is somewhat mind blowing.

00:12:56.566 --> 00:12:58.433
We seen other, the E is popping up

00:12:58.433 --> 00:13:00.600
and it's involving sine of X

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.934
and of course natural log of X,

00:13:01.934 --> 00:13:03.633
you expect E to be involved somehow.

00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:08.166
It is a pretty fascinating
problem in my mind.
