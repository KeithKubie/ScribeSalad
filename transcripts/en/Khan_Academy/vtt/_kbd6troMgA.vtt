00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.830
You're watching some type
of hot air balloon show,

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.430
and you're curious about
how quickly one hot air

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.030
balloon in particular is rising.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.080
And you have some
information at your disposal.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.170
You know the spot on the
ground that is directly

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.267
below the hot air balloon.

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:17.850
Let's say it took
off from that point,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.130
it's just been going
straight up ever since.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.700
And you know, you've
measured it out,

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.310
that you're 500 meters
away from there.

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.992
So you know that you are
500 meters away from that.

00:00:29.992 --> 00:00:31.700
And you're also able
to measure the angle

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.700
between the horizontal
and the hot air balloon.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.241
You could do that
with, I don't know,

00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:36.890
I'm not exactly
a surveyor, but I

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.767
guess a viewfinder or
something like that.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.350
So you're able to-- and I'm not
sure if that's the right tool,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.016
but there are tools
that you can measure

00:00:43.016 --> 00:00:47.270
the angles between the
horizontal and something that's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.680
not on the horizontal.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.090
So you know that this
angle right over here

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.630
is pi over 4 radians,
or 45 degrees.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.090
We're going to
keep it pi over 4,

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.256
because when you take
derivatives of trig functions,

00:00:59.256 --> 00:01:02.000
you assume that you're
dealing with radians.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.269
So right over here, this
is pi over 4 radians.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.530
And you also are able to measure
the rate at which this angle is

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.400
changing.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:20.390
So this is changing at
0.2 radians per minute.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.124
Now my question to
you, or the question

00:01:22.124 --> 00:01:24.540
that you're trying to figure
out as you watch this hot air

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.820
balloon, is how fast
is it rising right now?

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.500
How fast is it rising
just as the angle

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.750
between the horizontal and
kind of the line between you

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.250
and the hot air balloon
is pi over 4 radians,

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.330
and that angle is changing
at 0.2 radians per minute?

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.760
So let's think
about what we know

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.590
and what we're
trying to figure out.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.920
So we know a couple of things.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.210
We know that theta
is equal to pi over 4

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.210
if we call theta the
angle right over here.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.420
So this is theta.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.610
We also know the rate at
which data is changing.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.210
We know d theta.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.270
Let me do this in yellow.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.848
We know d theta dt is equal
to 0.2 radians per minute.

00:02:07.848 --> 00:02:09.389
Now what are we
trying to figure out?

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:11.472
Well, we're trying to
figure out the rate at which

00:02:11.472 --> 00:02:13.420
the height of the
balloon is changing.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.320
So if you call
this distance right

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:23.470
over here h, what we want
to figure out is dh dt.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.090
That's what we don't know.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.560
So what we'd want
to come up with

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.550
is a relationship between dh
dt, d theta dt, and maybe theta,

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.695
if we need it.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.070
Or another way to
think about it,

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.540
if we can come up with
the relationship between h

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.700
and theta, then we could take
the derivative with respect

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.320
to t, and we'll probably get
a relationship between all

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.530
of this stuff.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.980
So what's the relationship
between theta and h?

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.950
Well, it's a little
bit of trigonometry.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.970
We know we're trying
to figure out h.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.740
We already know what this
length is right over here.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.050
We know opposite over adjacent.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.050
That's the definition
of tangent.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.740
So let's write that down.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.680
So we know that the
tangent of theta

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.220
is equal to the opposite
side-- the opposite side is

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.230
equal to h-- over the
adjacent side, which

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.860
we know is going
to be a fixed 500.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.670
So there you have a relationship
between theta and h.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.560
And then to figure out a
relationship between d theta

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.950
dt, the rate at which theta
changes with respect to t,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.500
and the rate at which h
changes with respect to t,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.270
we just have to
take the derivative

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.590
of both sides of this with
respect to t implicitly.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.680
So let's do that.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.640
And actually, let me move over
this h over 500 a little bit.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.520
So let me move it
over a little bit

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.360
so I have space to show
the derivative operator.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.270
So let's write it like that.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.390
And now let's take the
derivative with respect to t.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:58.185
So d dt.

00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:00.810
I'm going to take the derivative
with respect to t on the left.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.768
We're going to take the
derivative with respect

00:04:02.768 --> 00:04:04.429
to t on the right.

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:05.970
So what's the
derivative with respect

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.130
to t of tangent of theta?

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.270
Well, we're just going to
apply the chain rule here.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.870
It's going to be
first the derivative

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.610
of the tangent of theta with
respect to theta, which is just

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.829
secant squared of theta,
times the derivative of theta

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.080
with respect to t,
times d theta dt.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.470
Once again, this is
just the derivative

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.950
of the tangent, the tangent
of something with respect

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.660
to that something
times the derivative

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.924
of the something
with respect to t.

00:04:42.924 --> 00:04:44.590
Derivative of tangent
theta with respect

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.230
to theta times the derivative
theta with respect to t

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.790
gives us the derivative of
tangent of theta with respect

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.110
to t, which is what
we want when we

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.900
use this type of a
derivative operator.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.816
We're taking the derivative
with respect to t,

00:04:57.816 --> 00:05:00.250
not just the derivative
with respect to theta.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.750
Fair enough.

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.400
So this is the left hand side.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.460
And then the right hand
side becomes, well,

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.370
it's just going to
be 1 over 500 dh dt.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.740
So 1 over 500 dh dt.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.130
We're literally saying
it's just 1 over 500 times

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.850
the derivative of h
with respect to t.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.730
But now we have
our relationship.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.870
We have the relationship
that we actually care about.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.960
We have a relationship between
the rate at which the height is

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.125
changing with respect
to time and the rate

00:05:30.125 --> 00:05:32.280
at which the angle is
changing with respect to time

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.210
and our angle at any moment.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.850
So we can just take these values
up here, throw it in here,

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.690
and then solve for the unknown.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.470
So let's do that.

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.270
Let's do that right over here.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.730
So we get secant
squared of theta.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.440
So we get secant squared.

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.090
Right now our
theta is pi over 4.

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.534
Secant squared of pi over 4.

00:05:50.534 --> 00:05:52.200
Let me write those
colors in to show you

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.420
that I'm putting
these values in.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.050
Secant squared of pi over 4.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.150
Secant times d theta dt.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:03.970
Well, that is just 0.2.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.120
So times 0.2.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:14.419
And then this is going to
be equal to 1 over 500.

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:15.460
And we want to make sure.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.700
Since this is in
radians per minute,

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.170
we're going to get meters per.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.692
And this is meters
right over here.

00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:22.900
We're going to get meters
per minute right over here.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.140
We just want to make sure we
know what our units are doing.

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.160
I haven't written the units
here to save some space.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:33.196
But we get 1 over
500 times dh dt.

00:06:33.196 --> 00:06:34.570
So if we want to
solve for dh dt,

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.790
we can multiply
both sides by 500,

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.530
and you get the rate at
which our height is changing

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.240
is equal to 500
times, let's see,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.280
secant squared of pi over 4.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.924
That is 1 over cosine
squared of pi over 4.

00:06:49.924 --> 00:06:51.090
Let me write this over here.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.810
Cosine of pi over 4 is
square root of 2 over 2.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:06.490
Cosine squared of pi over 4 is
going to be equal to 2 over 4,

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.450
which is equal to 1/2.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.850
And so secant squared of pi
over 4 is just 1 over that,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.810
is equal to 2.

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:17.830
So this is going to be
equal to-- let me rewrite

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.790
this instead of-- so the
secant squared of pi over 4--

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:23.290
let me erase this
right over here.

00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:26.770
Secant squared of pi over 4,
all of this business right

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:28.700
over here simplifies to 2.

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.594
So times 2 times 0.2 times 0.2.

00:07:34.594 --> 00:07:35.760
So what is this going to be?

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.570
This is going to
be 500 times 0.4.

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.650
So this is equal to
500 times-- let me just

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.360
write a dot instead--
times 0.4, which

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.520
is equal to-- let me make
sure I get this right.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.755
This would be with two 0's
and one behind the decimal.

00:07:54.755 --> 00:07:55.730
Yep, there you go.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:57.930
It would be 200.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.770
So the rate at which our
height is changing with respect

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:09.920
to time right at that moment
is 200 meters per minute.

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:16.810
dh dt is equal to 200
meters per minute.
