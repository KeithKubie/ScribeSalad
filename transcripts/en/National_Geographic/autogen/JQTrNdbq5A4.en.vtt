like all seasons summer is the result of
an astronomical fact of life

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:16.930
an astronomical fact of life
 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.830
an astronomical fact of life
the earth is tilted on its axis 23 and a

the earth is tilted on its axis 23 and a
 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.730
the earth is tilted on its axis 23 and a
half degrees as the planet moves in its

half degrees as the planet moves in its
 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.950
half degrees as the planet moves in its
yearly orbit that angle comes as the

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960
yearly orbit that angle comes as the
 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.510
yearly orbit that angle comes as the
position of the northern hemisphere to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520
position of the northern hemisphere to
 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.420
position of the northern hemisphere to
change relative to the Sun in the winter

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430
change relative to the Sun in the winter
 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.430
change relative to the Sun in the winter
it's tilted away from the Sun in the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440
it's tilted away from the Sun in the
 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.640
it's tilted away from the Sun in the
summer it angles towards the center

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650
summer it angles towards the center
 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.650
summer it angles towards the center
because of the planets tilt during the

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660
because of the planets tilt during the
 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.600
because of the planets tilt during the
summer sunlight hits the earth at a more

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610
summer sunlight hits the earth at a more
 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.720
summer sunlight hits the earth at a more
direct angle so the warming effect of

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730
direct angle so the warming effect of
 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.070
direct angle so the warming effect of
the sunlight is more intense plus the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:50.080
the sunlight is more intense plus the
 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.930
the sunlight is more intense plus the
Sun is at its highest point in the sky

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940
Sun is at its highest point in the sky
 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.060
Sun is at its highest point in the sky
so there are more hours of sunlight to

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070
so there are more hours of sunlight to
 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.630
so there are more hours of sunlight to
