00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:04.610
This program is a presentation of UCTV for

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:11.610
educational and non-commercial use only.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.510
When James Parkinson's originally
described Parkinson's disease it was

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.730
thought just to be a movement disorder.
This is a disease

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.460
that needs to be recognized early because there are treatments that might affect

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.949
the natural history and may slow down the
course of the disease.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.040
Yeah I wasn't very happy about being
diagnosed. I felt like I was young,

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.230
I felt like I was healthy, I felt like I
took care of myself.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.300
I saw my orthopedic surgeon because I was feeling a lot of pain in my leg.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.269
and he pretty much told me it was all in my
head. I think it's important to

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.600
understand what Parkinson's is.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.020
It is a chronic disease but it's one
that you can live with

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.830
and you could have a long and fulfilling
life with it.  You know when you're sick,

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.950
usually you get better?

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.030
I thought, well you know, okay so this

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.979
is a problem, but you know it'll probably get
better -  which is of course

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.720
totally wrong. All the treatments we have right now deal with symptoms.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.100
They're basically bandaids for the
disease. They don't address the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.420
underlying disease which just keeps
getting worse,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.429
anyway. You know I feel like I can
accommodate whatever comes along

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:39.920
you ready to my minuses soul

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.260
that'll

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.310
a person out with a break the bicycles

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.000
but what about my body it the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.610
life expectancy is almost the same as
for people who don't have

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.150
Artist Series typically patients do not
die

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.390
from Parkinson's disease they die with
Parkinson's disease

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.960
some interest in my bed just pull the
covers over my head going to do this the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.620
interstate

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.440
and I'm but that doesn't happen very
often

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.099
and

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.790
the next a cap and joy comes in the
morning and

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.790
and the darkness is over and I face
another day

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.879
with mishandling see you do this many
people don't understand what parkinson's

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:29.860
disease is

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.890
follow it with you parkinson's disease
is the accounts have a group of symptoms

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.900
and signs

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.920
that together constitute parkinsonism in
the absence of any

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.329
obvious unknown cause without evidence a
more widespread disease

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.980
parkinson's disease is a characteristic
clinical disorder

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.010
a notable for three major symptoms

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.959
a one is a tremor which is often the
first one that appears very

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.299
characteristic tremor

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:59.790
another is Brady can usually which is
slowness of movement

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.150
and the last is rigidity or stiffness
and those are the characteristic

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.000
features and its

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.650
it's not just those three symptoms it's
the way in which they begin

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.840
it's the way that they progress it's a
%uh it too

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.769
it's a larger picture which is
recognizable by many clinical trials

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.750
as idiopathic Parkinson's disease with
your right hand can you this big and

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.079
fast with the pointer

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.680
damages keep going it is due to a loss

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.970
love a number nerve transmitters
including dopamine

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.489
dopamine it was pretty is in the cells
with the generate an

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.819
in this region close attention i grandi
brain is one of those chemicals that its

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.840
required to keep those wires connected
is also worth to

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.319
mation is a progressive disease that
patients usually develop a very mild

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.970
form of the disease that

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.120
gets worse and worse with time is more
is more the cells

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.069
the generated after out timers disease
this is the second most common

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:59.739
you a degenerative disease that too is
in probably in the United States

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.530
at this time there are more than a
million people affected

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.889
it's a disease that occurs little bit
more commonly in men than women

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.419
it occurs with advancing age and it
leads to increasing disability

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.599
unless patients have treated and even
then there may be some limitation

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:20.959
had to get a new hobby a political ally
I read more

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.639
I get involved in politics in a way if
carville it look at other things that

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.610
are important in life

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.750
and ever more appreciation for things it
is a everyone I know has Parkinson's has

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.349
a dog and I just think that

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.969
they keep you going and move a min at

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:41.000
they don't care that African said I'm

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.750
pastor a church in San Francisco the
decision to tell my congregation was

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.010
very difficult it has been a tremendous

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.120
challenge to faith

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.169
because I thought I had it all figured
out

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.409
don't worry about it and try and just

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:07.110
lead your life to the fullest possible
extent

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.110
cool as training for a marathon and

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.509
my legs are cramping up and I had

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:16.869
just dolls with the trouble running
where had been Prime three or four

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:17.919
months power

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:22.409
and had successfully run the New York
Marathon parkinson's disease is a highly

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:23.669
variable disease

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.789
we see patients who had Parkinson's
disease for thirty and forty years after

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:28.860
diagnosis

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.020
are some our stock walking into the
clinic in other patients

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.939
I have greater disability the only
sometimes I really have

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:40.839
other series at the moment is currently
have them sometimes the term

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:45.479
for the fact is that most patients are
very individualistic

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.680
and the progression of the disease can
be completely different

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.029
parkinson's effects the right side of my
body and side I get

00:05:52.029 --> 00:05:55.830
but it hasn't progressed much in the
past five years when patients initially

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.209
come and they usually have had symptoms
from one to two years prior to coming

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:02.189
into the evaluation

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.110
so usually they're complaining have some
big symptoms

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.180
they're not necessarily completely
indicative the Parkinson's disease

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.830
so you want to do it a sterile
neurological evaluation to make sure

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.169
that what you're looking at

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:23.749
really truly is parkinson's disease fold
your arms and you arms folded stand-up

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:27.339
great unfold throughout happiness walk
down the cartel

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:30.620
good night he turned around

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.999
well I was dragging my at legal a break

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:37.599
I was limping a little bit I noticed

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.169
in mind and and I'm tremors

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:44.349
finely when my wife thought one day we
went to the

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:47.699
internist right away said I think if
parkinson's

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:53.059
I said there's this I'm healthy and
nobody in my family is ever had

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:54.459
Parkinson's I couldn't be

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:58.249
it should be noted that bad about 30
percent of patients

00:06:58.249 --> 00:07:02.639
who come in and get diagnosed do not
have a tremor

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.979
mainly I was holding my arm and

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:10.249
happened you the my hand never had any
trouble

00:07:10.249 --> 00:07:13.779
it is a complex interplay I've have
symptoms and

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:18.019
findings might be on greater clumsiness
with a hand

00:07:18.019 --> 00:07:21.039
or an irregular footstep that develops

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.089
overtime could you make a spiral like
that

00:07:24.089 --> 00:07:27.439
and 75 percent in people there is often
a tremor

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:30.709
that develops that maybe intermittent

00:07:30.709 --> 00:07:34.550
and is usually most apparent when the
hand is in the lap

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.009
or suspended 11 is walking might

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:42.550
people exist to freeze took me awhile to

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.659
2 I'm phrase ice to fall backward

00:07:46.659 --> 00:07:49.919
seeks 7

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:53.829
eight times a day constantly a kid

00:07:53.829 --> 00:07:58.019
for Windows boy who's this I'm gonna
push you back would like this

00:07:58.019 --> 00:08:01.519
I want you to resist me alright I won't
let you fall

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:05.260
who any go

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:08.590
the in Iraq well done

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.610
I promise you I catch you thank goodness
I did some individuals with Parkinson's

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.750
will experience some type of causing the
problem

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:19.850
over the course of their illness
typically at the time of diagnosis this

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.930
tends to be relatively mild

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.820
been made just involve slate attention
difficulties

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.870
perhaps difficulties with multitasking

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:32.840
doing more than one thing at a time one
of the things have noticed

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:38.050
visit I can't divide my attention when
I'm doing something

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:43.740
me the walking prime talking about 30
percent of people with Parkinson's

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:44.320
disease

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:48.350
again to develop a significant
impairment of cognitive function

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.120
that commonly thats late in the course
of the disease

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.580
sleep disturbances are quite common in
Parkinson's disease

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.020
and fairly commonly patients or their
families become aware that their speech

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:01.250
is somewhat softer

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.590
depression and anxiety maybe

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.730
the most disabling symptoms they
definitely

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:13.130
have bad days and more days then
parkinson's it goes with depression and

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:14.830
that's where the same today

00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:18.890
keep my eye on an I know my doctor keeps
his eye on for me

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:23.110
for one other things the doctor and I've
told me I'm

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.290
that I really appreciate it heat said
that if you

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:31.350
research all things that might happen
you can anticipate it in the brain is a

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.690
funny thing in that sometimes you might
anticipate something that's not actually

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:35.630
there

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.860
because I don't know when something's
knew I have to ask him

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.920
is this what's supposed to happen is
this normal

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.550
you know the feeling go

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.410
somebody polling cold

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.180
I so what they're on your hand that the
feeling

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.450
it was hot too to accept it and in the
beginning I D nev.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.640
sets if the other at symptoms that they
are

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.370
you know really into feel good night
everyday life

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:10.440
positions often have as much difficulty

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.770
as diagnosing parkinson's disease as

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.840
patients families do in recognizing that
something actually is wrong

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.870
other than simply the advance a fifty
years I was at my

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:26.160
GP for me annual physical when he asked
me what this

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:30.270
shaking my going on what was that all
about and I

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:34.970
frankly didn't know so he sent me off to
a neurologist who

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:38.270
gave me the diagnosis in it was

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.310
kinda hard for me to to accept that that
mean

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:45.780
and I didn't for well I think I'm my
continued on justice

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.480
ignoring the fact that I had until
certain things became or more for a

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.060
problem

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.770
many patients want to come and see us
because they

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:56.940
I'm I they have uncertainties about the
diagnosis

00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.530
I or want a second opinion and that
really is

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:04.940
an important world and I believe we play
I think I had an inkling that things

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:05.660
were coming

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.680
remember one time in particular I was
was very upset

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.700
at work my whole body started shaking I

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.830
out on its pretty weird I so my
orthopedic surgeon because it's really

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:17.990
not a pain in my leg

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:22.500
and he pretty much from is on my head
and it wasn't until I had a little

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.330
tremor

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.780
in my hand which I thought was low blood
sugar that a

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:31.810
the hand after for between our largest
letter that Christine

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:36.760
Anna he did a for as a test in these
that I think you know I'm a gonna say

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:41.460
and I was like but on my head and it
wasn't on my head it was

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:46.750
parkinson's the diagnosis a parkinson's
disease is a clinical diagnosis

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:51.070
there's no pass that can say you do you
do not have parkinson's disease

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:55.240
Parliament down slowly king following it
I think it's important

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:00.710
that primary care doctors undertake a
general neurological examination to

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.400
exclude an underlying

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.710
neurological cause for the patience
sometimes

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:10.600
I've remember and I'm waking in the
middle of the night night

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:13.820
I thought this has all been a dream and

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:17.190
I stayed awake for several hours

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:21.280
thinking and praying and then remembered
I think that

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.930
it started to hit me and I cried and I'm

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:28.160
at that moment everything seems to be
darkest

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.920
you know because it's unknown I was

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:38.330
Creed sometimes it is difficult for the
patient themself

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:42.450
to really acknowledge what's going on in
part of that

00:12:42.450 --> 00:12:46.750
maybe because there are certain changes
in the brain which make it difficult for

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.800
people to fully appreciate

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.500
their own symptoms over the

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.640
time I just but become

00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.590
accepting the fact that that's who I am
and this is where I'm I am in my life

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:07.410
and I'm you know I'm disappointed it
sank into some things I would really

00:13:07.410 --> 00:13:08.460
like to do but

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.650
me off I'm other things you know bases a
lot left

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:18.910
got a lot of time left in my life

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:22.190
we have identified a series of jeans
which we now know

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.290
to cause Parkinson's disease well we
know

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.140
that one or the other genes that's been
implicated in Parkinson's disease

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:33.890
that gene product called alpha-synuclein
accumulates in the brain basically

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:38.830
everybody with Parkinson's this simply
making more of this protein moreover the

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.270
normal alpha-synuclein protein

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.460
is sufficient to cause Parkinson's
disease

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:48.050
many of us believe that the cause of
parkinson's disease

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:52.090
late space to a genetic susceptibility
and also perhaps

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:56.500
exposure to some toxin no other in the
environment

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:59.780
there are basically two hypotheses that
we've had over the years about the

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.710
pathogenesis a parkinson's disease

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:04.910
one actually concerns dopamine itself

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.590
it's the dopamine neurons which
degenerating parkinson's disease which

00:14:08.590 --> 00:14:12.530
disappear and as a result patients have
a dopamine deficiency

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:16.610
but at the same time we know the
dopamine is actually a pretty toxic

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:17.650
compound

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:22.220
it's a normal neurotransmitter all over
brains but it's actually quite toxic

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:26.920
and for most people that don't get the
disease they can handle the toxin

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.510
but for people with Parkinson's disease
they can't handle the talks to me more

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:32.650
and the dopamine itself

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.920
ends up killing the cells that make it
which results in

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:40.420
a dopamine deficiency the other factor
is this protein alpha-synuclein

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:44.330
and we know that this protein
alpha-synuclein doesn't just accumulate

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:47.540
and kill dopamine neurons it accumulates
in many

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:51.600
other neurons in the nervous system and
that accounts for probably a lot of the

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.860
cognitive problems

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:56.570
and other problems that Parkinson's
patients get and so the idea is that if

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.110
the new clean goes up

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.450
it's going to force the ball before it
kills cells

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:06.070
impair all kinds of neural circuits and
the behaviour your brain as a whole

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.750
before you ever lost any neurons and
that it basically starts as a functional

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:11.680
disturbance

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.900
which eventually results in the death of
some cells

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.460
such as dopamine neurons in this
actually changes the way we think about

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.970
Parkinson's disease

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:24.670
and so we think this gives a great
inside and a a way to

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:28.150
intervene in the disease before that has
progressed very far

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:32.120
such as they would come up stay up from
is anything to happen iraq's

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.870
yeah me show you didn't okay

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.490
the real challenge now is not just to
find treatment for the symptoms

00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:43.620
but to try and treatment for the
underlying disease

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.750
so we really need understand that
underlying problem for we can do

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:51.710
something about

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:55.720
the medical treatment primarily is with
medications

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:00.130
that treat the symptoms so they don't
treat the underlying disorder

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:05.380
it may be that some medications actually
slow the progression of the disease

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:09.050
I'm on something called as a like that
are

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.150
is supposed to delay the the progression
of the disease

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.490
but it also iPhone

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:19.089
has alleviated some symptoms typically

00:16:19.089 --> 00:16:22.420
overtime patients may start to respond

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.950
less well to medication because the
disease is advanced

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:29.060
vulnerability heard the phenomenal

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.910
8 cinema peeled 5

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.500
company and playing a quick

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:40.920
everyday treatment has been named at

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:45.570
replacing the dopamine that is deficient
in Parkinson's disease

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:51.200
and one can do that in two ways one can
give what's called a dopamine agonist

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.560
that's a drug that acts like to help me
but actually isn't

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.930
all one can give the precursor dopamine
that the body then converted to dopamine

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.720
and that's the drug called leave a doper
probably the most effective drug

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.530
for the treatment of the symptoms did
the diseases leave a dope

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:12.740
if the girl it in what way wanna take a
pill

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:16.920
Sanomat four times a day your pics 3

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:20.050
generally that kiss me under control

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.920
and work around that killed box in Miami

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.220
pocket so I remember my medication

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.810
medication or are worth worth having

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:34.360
you havin fun fact that there are the
desirable

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.820
or near the balloting job yeah after
ballot

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:42.290
do you want to do something or you now
wanna them from Firefly

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.300
one of the complications are leave a
dope a therapy lso's

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.720
Sanomat therapy is that camp in May

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.210
cause abnormal movements we call these
abnormal movements disc I'm easy is

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:59.010
those pages may well benefit from
surgery deep brain stimulation

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.970
that the terminal recommended so gently

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:08.440
in I was scandal it I was scared outta
my mind

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:12.100
so I decided

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.910
bad though the third really and whatever
happens happens

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:20.540
the mean girl menso

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:23.760
unbelievable I mean it was like a
different person

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.790
deep brain stimulation or DBS

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:31.780
is essentially a pacemaker but instead
of going to the heart

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:35.220
it goes to the brain and were able to

00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:38.700
affect the activity in a certain part
the brain

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:42.960
that is involved in the generation the
symptoms of Parkinson's disease

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.480
and we can make some other symptoms of
Parkinson's better by using this

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.190
technique

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.420
I don't fall anymore an own

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:53.970
I've been went on vacation the summer

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.810
to Memphis Tennessee

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:01.080
there is such a thing as waiting too
long

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:06.050
to do surgery if the a patient's
symptoms have progressed to the point

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.830
where medications are no longer affected
at all

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:13.510
it means that surgery will be no longer
a factor my Walkman right now

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:16.740
it's stored in the garage collecting
best

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:20.750
after DBS a patient still has
Parkinson's

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.320
their parkinson's will continue to
progress despite the fact that they're

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.420
being stimulated

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:28.810
and so it's not a disease altering

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.550
treatment there is

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.700
emerging research that supports the idea
that

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.730
an active lifestyle may forestall on

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:42.210
progression of Parkinson's disease it
also gives

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:45.720
the patient a sense that they are doing
something

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.200
to fight their disease have taken up
yoga

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.580
because the stretching the things that
provide

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:59.260
some summer really I can walk into your
with to play in a

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:03.670
trailing arm and I'll even I'm walking
normally TV go do more often

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:07.400
her I strongly counsel patience

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.310
to develop an exercise routine that he
is sacred

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:15.260
that his one of their priorities in any
day

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.840
cleaning up yeah I think exercise

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.990
is probably when is the number one
things people can do

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:26.900
it helps cognition it helps generate new
stem cells and neurons in the brain

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:33.900
it also helps people's arm movement
issues as well

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:40.030
I have a blog it'd from it's getting
seven hundred thousand hits

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.780
and so it's interesting to me how many
people read about it but I find that

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.140
really therapeutic to

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:51.950
Gillard from my feeling that but it also
allows my friends to look at it and not

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:52.510
have to

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:55.990
here for me but know how I'm feeling
rationally

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:59.190
becomes for troop leader well

00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.040
about four years after I I and a support
group

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:06.860
you know the fact that PC worried now to
support me

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.170
and my problems that it means a lot

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:14.230
we have an online support group as a
Facebook thing it's about

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:19.420
18 women who are are I guess the onset
Parkinson's they're all kinda

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:23.760
the one rule is you have to try to
remain positive and we trying to feed

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.880
off each other's negative things but
that's really helped me out a lot

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:31.720
to know them alone I wish God would save
this can be a bad day so beware

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.810
it just doesn't happen that way hi it

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:39.350
all of a sudden I need someone to help
me do something or just to be nice to me

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:42.870
and this is this is

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.930
it's a surprise the unknown

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:49.530
is very difficult for me I'm

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:53.360
and so i i accept kind and I embrace it

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.160
I needed I want people to

00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:04.160
helping

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:08.910
I think UCSF is unique in that its
general mission really supports the

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.770
mission at the Parkinson center

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:15.720
we do outreach we do teaching were
involved in teaching residents and

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.610
fellows

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:22.860
we have experts in the field and these
experts actually see the patience

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:27.000
we have a multidisciplinary experts as
well

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.350
which bring their knowledge base to air
treatment of patients

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.850
and we have some very exciting
cutting-edge research

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:38.030
into the green is the metformin blue is

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:42.260
the kitchen I months a came to terms
with it that's when I

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:46.820
decided I'm gonna go to UC with date me
know what's going on

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:50.700
apparently cutting edge and I want to be
part of that there are many clinical

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.250
trials a potential

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:55.500
that therapeutic agents underway

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.990
and if patients want to take part in
these trials only have to contact us

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:03.820
my group has been working over the years
in trying three deliver drugs directly

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:04.600
to the brain

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.309
using your surgical technology so using
this technology now to the word

00:23:09.309 --> 00:23:12.800
the well victors I i want to talk I'll
try here

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.330
you see if and I had a a

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:21.920
gene transfer therapy where were they
injected the gene into bar I brain

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.010
the stimulated into produce lead over me

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:29.380
and a it produced the result

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.710
I'm happy I did the because they gave me
a chance to

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:37.130
contribute something to try it even
though it isn't

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:41.240
they are here there may be another step
in learning

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.820
more about the and embittered

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:50.710
perfect people if Justin Rose Hall
Council being able to

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:56.870
onto the divers absences to the brain
that can rejuvenate

00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:00.280
the cells or give rise to the cells
which

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.900
are within the brain and is a stem cells
that may be able to actually pick up the

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.940
function of the

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:09.200
new round it has died and his ultimate
goal

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:13.170
and I don't think I'm imagining things
and we have prove

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:16.790
home the design actually can take place

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:22.580
because parkinson's is within a small
area in the brain it's a good candidate

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:26.900
for stem cell research there are many
fundamental questions that need to be

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.090
answered before

00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:31.320
stem cell therapy could be brought into
the clinically

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.830
part of that is we have to be cautious
and

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:38.330
so the stakes are high I mean that could
really be

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:41.850
a credibly good news for

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:45.179
for a patient with Parkinson's disease
I'm open to anything

00:24:45.179 --> 00:24:48.560
I'll do anything anything that is coming
down any kinda

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.450
new medication please put me on it

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:57.670
you know and one of them in fact is
being really negative for me

00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:00.870
really exacerbated the symptoms

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:07.870
but I don't care because I'd I if if
it's out there I wanna find it

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.780
said

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:17.640
goes time in my life to see other night
them the word came on you know I'm so

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.890
happy these days

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.990
wife is very good you know even know
North

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:26.299
her cup tits thing

00:25:26.299 --> 00:25:28.980
unit expect enter into industry

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:32.080
it is they have so much hope in a lake
really

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:36.320
Chile believe they'll finally care and
that conveyed to me is a

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:42.090
message status key thing I'm me
believing in for

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:45.200
strong medicine

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:48.240
it's possible to live without confound

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:53.799
and feel am a normal I and that pic
Antonio

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:58.669
yourself in your home in the family I
think what I would like other people to

00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:59.750
do with to

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:05.690
to get involved includes to become
militant about it didn't try to find a

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:06.149
way to

00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:10.799
to solve this problem parkinson's will
probably be

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:14.399
the first neurodegenerative disorder for
which we find a cure

00:26:14.399 --> 00:26:17.580
because it's very discreet a

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.830
and compared to the other
neurodegenerative disorders we know

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:24.059
quite a bit about it this is a disease
for which has

00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:27.320
every reason to be optimistic there are
many different

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.169
therapeutic developments being explored
that I think hold

00:26:31.169 --> 00:26:34.399
a great promise for the future that good
things

00:26:34.399 --> 00:26:37.830
that is you can't fight this

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:41.000
you can resist I'm not saying Kim's

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.139
I have not been able to stop it someone
can tell me how to stop it

00:26:44.139 --> 00:26:47.529
please tell me stopper I feel is is

00:26:47.529 --> 00:26:51.730
positive mental attitude

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:54.809
believing that that

00:26:54.809 --> 00:26:58.490
things are going to get better I'm I
believe

00:26:58.490 --> 00:27:01.510
that they're gonna find a cure for this
thing

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.919
and and this will not be the way that I
can

00:27:04.919 --> 00:27:08.580
sold those kind of hope you know

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.799
and seen wonderful thing

00:27:11.799 --> 00:27:16.919
like success on my comp

00:27:16.919 --> 00:27:19.600
my children succeed him

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.690
my wife happy

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.890
the singer's user incredible things and
if I can just keep eyes on that

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:32.890
rather than the original diagnosis I can
make

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.299
it

00:27:41.299 --> 00:27:48.299
said

00:27:56.159 --> 00:27:58.639
old

00:27:58.639 --> 00:28:01.480
school

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:08.480
cool up

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:01.289
in
