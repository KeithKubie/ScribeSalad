00:00:01.683 --> 00:00:03.483
Male: Enamel paints are
essentially household paints

00:00:03.483 --> 00:00:05.916
or automotive paints,
and they've been used

00:00:05.916 --> 00:00:07.684
by artists for a long
time as early as well,

00:00:07.684 --> 00:00:09.591
Pablo Picasso.

00:00:09.591 --> 00:00:11.687
In the early 20th century many abstract

00:00:11.687 --> 00:00:13.992
expressionist painters used it, but enamel

00:00:13.992 --> 00:00:15.497
is a tricky term because
it doesn't really tell you

00:00:15.497 --> 00:00:17.299
what type of paint you're talking about,

00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:20.183
but rather the properties of that paint.

00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:22.712
There is alkyd enamel paints.

00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:24.873
There is acrylic enamel paint.

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:27.177
There are latex enamel paints.

00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:30.511
It just means that actually
the paint is quite fluid

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:33.042
and you can see that it
has a very low viscosity

00:00:33.042 --> 00:00:35.349
as I'm pouring it from the can here.

00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:36.467
It also means that the paint has a high

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:37.585
covering power.

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:39.651
So, that for consumers
at home painting walls

00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:41.966
one coat should do the
trick so you shouldn't see

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:44.681
brush strokes and things
like that on your wall.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:47.004
It also means that the
paint is self leveling,

00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:48.261
very, very flat.

00:00:48.297 --> 00:00:51.767
Usually dries to a hard,
often glossy finish.
