00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.630
Joanna, there is a study that shows one in 60 dads end

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.275
up raising a child that doesn't belong to him. So non-paternity is obviously

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:12.820
an issue at fairly high prevalence in United States in general and

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.570
possibly the world in general. How

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.270
does 23andMe deal with issues of non-paternity?

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.880
&gt;&gt; Well, I've heard estimates similar to that

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.494
a big range of estimates. from 2% to

00:00:25.494 --> 00:00:30.660
10% of, of kids. are

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.830
not aware of who their biological father is. So this is certainly a big issue

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.830
for 23andMe. because it's one of the most high impact

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.750
results that someone who signs up for 23andMe can get.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.040
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.800
&gt;&gt; And before people sign up it's very important

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.180
that they consider the possibility of making a discovery about

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.510
biological relationships in their family that they

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.420
didn't previously know about. And so, and that's

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.480
why when we launched the service, from the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.130
very beginning, we, in our Terms of Service,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.740
we said. be, you should be aware that

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.870
you may learn things about yourself that, that

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.040
you find uncomfortable, that are disturbing, including that

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.300
your biological father is not your biological father

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.060
that the person you know to be your father is not

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.460
your biological father. So we were very explicit from the very beginning

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.900
that this is a possibility. And so that, the people are

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.820
aware that that is something that can come out of DNA analyses.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.620
&gt;&gt; And so are people, do you find

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.210
many people not aware that the personal genetic

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.130
services offered at 23, I mean, is essentially,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.330
in a way can be like a paternity test?

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.556
&gt;&gt; Well,

00:01:41.556 --> 00:01:46.920
many, Organizations that do official paternity testing are

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.080
doing it in a way that it the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.116
evidence will hold up in a court. So it's a bit it's a bit of a different

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:57.780
process. So for 23andMe customers it's more like

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.160
something they just discover right when they're exploring

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.560
their data. And the main way that people

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.730
discover non-paternity is if they find that their genetic

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.970
relationship to another family member is not

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.280
what they had anticipated. That, that they are,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.510
instead of being a full sibling with someone

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.840
they think that's their sibling, they're a half

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.400
sibling, because they have different fathers. So

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.520
that's not an, unusual, and. one resource that

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.540
we provide is we provide a forum, a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.600
discussion forum where many of our customers put

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.470
out their questions to other members of the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:39.820
23andMe community. And that's where we've seen evidence

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.370
of people discovering an opportunity. And very often

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.670
they have questions like, how do I check with,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.180
out, to find out whether this is true or not. How do I handle conversations with

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.870
other members of my family? And, other members

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.690
of the 23andMe community often come forward with advice

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.900
on, you know, who else should be tested in the family how to, you know, approach

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.250
other family members and I've seen people reporting

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.040
cases where they've said, I'm not going to tell my dad that

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.520
I've discovered this, because he's been my dad all my life. And

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.570
and there's no need for us to change that.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.589
&gt;&gt; Sure, I, I imagine.

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:24.950
&gt;&gt; And so people make these big

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.150
personal decisions, once they get this this information.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.960
&gt;&gt; Now is there any way for 23andMe to actually track

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.560
this discovery rate, or is it just a sort of organic thing?

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.120
&gt;&gt; So we do not do any formal

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.970
tracking, it's really if someone comes forward with

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.670
a story, And said, and tells us and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.680
said and tells us that they made this discovery.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.700
That's the only way we actually find it out. So it does happen, we have

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.750
seen people coming forward with stories about

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.560
discovering that their father's not their genetic father.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.654
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:55.654 --> 00:03:58.260
&gt;&gt; But it's sort of the two sides of

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.910
the coin. We've, we've also had cases where people

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.820
have discovered their father's not their genetic father. But

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.630
then they've actually gone on to discover their biological father,

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.630
&gt;&gt; So it becomes sort of a story of discovery.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.300
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.890
&gt;&gt; And not

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:10.980
just a loss.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.210
&gt;&gt; they've actually found their biological

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.230
relatives through DNA as well. And, so,

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.940
it's all part of the big picture that you know DNA is all

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.710
about families and you can discover that relationships aren't as you think they

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.380
are and you can find new relationships that you didn't weren't aware of before.
