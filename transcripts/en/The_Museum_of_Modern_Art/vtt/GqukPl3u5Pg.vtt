00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.799
We tend to think art is found in a museum,
but it almost never begins there.

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:08.130
This video is called Places &amp; Spaces.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.929
A theme we will explore using three works.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:22.060
St. Paul de Mausole in the south of France
was converted into an insane asylum in the

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.060
early 1800s.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.009
As far as mental hospitals go, St. Paul was
pretty nice.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.150
Gardens.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.289
Mountains.

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.580
Tall trees.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.870
Quiet village.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.940
In 1889, St. Paul became home to Vincent van
Gogh.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.280
A struggling artist in his mid-thirties who
checked himself in after a mental break-down.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.559
It's interesting when you think about being
in this sort of enclosed space but yet you're

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.030
looking out into this very expansive landscape.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.969
What does that do to your mental state?

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.579
As part of his treatment, van Gogh was encouraged
to continue painting.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.640
So he painted.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.809
His hallway.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:59.809
His ward.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:00.879
His doctor.

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.699
But he struggled with the night sky.

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.990
Van Gogh began experimenting.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.370
He combined many different views from around
St. Paul.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.370
Mountains.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.130
Cyprus trees.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.650
Houses.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.080
He used color.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.680
He used brush strokes.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.500
The result: perhaps the most famous modern
landscape in the history of modern landscapes.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.430
I'm sure it really captivated and confused
people, and I think that's one of the things

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.690
that's really great about art.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.660
It pushes people and at the same time, kind
of meets you where you are.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.910
Van Gogh painted the night sky in a way never
seen before.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:58.430
Not still but turbulent, like van Gogh himself.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.220
Fifty years later, a different kind of turbulence
was hitting France.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.430
Paris fell to the Nazis and Dutch born painter
Piet Mondrian was forced to flee.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.860
He was in his late 60s when he arrived in
New York City.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.610
It was love at first sight.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.850
Mondrian was fascinated.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.060
The skyscrapers.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.280
The electric lights.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.980
The people.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.590
And the music.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.770
In Europe Mondrian was a ballroom dancer.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.950
He listened to foxtrot music.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.730
He was a respected painter known for his increasingly
minimal style.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.250
In New York he listens to jazz.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.620
He dances to Boogie Woogie.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.480
At the age of 68, his style changes again
and he paints this.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.020
His love letter to New York.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:03:02.500
Broadway Boogie Woogie.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.870
In the 1950s Niagara Falls was where you went
on your honeymoon, got your hydroelectric

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.340
power and generally enjoyed all the benefits
of a post World War II economy.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.740
Twenty years later, Niagara Falls was not
where you went on your honeymoon.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.200
Industry jobs going abroad.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.890
Hundreds of condemned houses.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.380
Niagara Falls was looking like a lot of American
cities.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.920
And that's what brought Gordon Matta-Clark
there in 1974.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.661
Matta-Clark got a degree in architecture and
immediately realized he wasn't going to be

00:03:30.661 --> 00:03:32.800
an architect.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.430
He's messing things up, he's blurring boundaries,
he's doing things that are really unexpected.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.760
He used buildings to create his art and to
draw attention.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.030
Matta-Clark in Bingo takes a derelict house,
something that was slated for destruction

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.620
anyway but then destroys it in a really fascinating
way.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.490
It took ten days for Matta-Clark to turn the
front of the house into nine equal sized squares.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:57.480
Like a bingo board.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.920
He's inviting us to shift our attention to
something that you know, a lot of people don't

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.920
see.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.530
He's not taking super sleek buildings to do
this with.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.940
No, this is the crumbling, forgotten, swept
under the rug.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.330
Of the nine pieces, these three were put in
a museum.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.180
These five were thrown out of the back of
his truck.

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.600
And the last piece, the center square, remained.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.900
Until it was destroyed by a bulldozer, along
with the rest of the house, a few minutes

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.160
later.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:34.490
The place Gordon Matta-Clark created Bingo,
the place Vincent van Gogh created "Starry

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.970
Night," the place Piet Mondrian made "Broadway
Boogie Woogie."
