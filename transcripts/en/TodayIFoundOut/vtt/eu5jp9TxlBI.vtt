00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.660
Product placement is a subtle art and when
it’s done well, a few seconds of footage

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.939
can instantly raise the profile of a given
brand.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.020
Perhaps the best known example of this is
the use of Reece’s Pieces in E.T., which

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.660
saw a 65% boost in sales almost overnight.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.320
This makes it kind of fitting that arguably
the worst example of product placement in

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.110
a movie appeared in a shameless rip-off of
E.T. called Mac and Me.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.180
(Even the title was taken from E.T., as the
working title for E.T. had once been E.T.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.180
and Me.)

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:50.240
Released in 1988, six years after E.T., to
a chorus of zero and one star reviews, Mac

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.310
and Me has become somewhat infamous in film
circles for being one of the single worst

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:55.710
movies ever made.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.410
(Despite the editor of this article having
extremely fond recollections of the film as

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:00.410
a child…

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.619
I see now that this must be like Knight Rider;
if you loved that show as a kid, do yourself

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:08.790
a favour and don’t try to re-watch it as
an adult…)

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.149
While critics of the time panned almost every
aspect of the Mac and Me, the most common

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.860
complaint amongst the sea of bile directed
towards this cinematic monstrosity was the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.370
ludicrous amount of painfully obvious product
placement it contained.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.650
Particular attention was drawn to the inexplicable
amount of screen-time dedicated to both Coca-Cola

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.580
and McDonald’s, which are prominently featured
in almost every key scene in the entire movie.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.220
For those who’ve not seen this cinematic
classic, as noted, the film’s “plot”

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.180
is an unabashed knock-off of E.T.’s, focusing
on a stranded alien called MAC (which is an

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.500
acronym for Mysterious Alien Creature, and
totally “not” a ham-fisted allusion to

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.299
anything to do with McDonald’s…) who befriends
a wheelchair bound young man called Eric Cruise

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.880
while trying to reunite itself with its family.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.350
If that wasn’t on the nose enough, the alien
is also being pursued by a shady government

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.350
agency.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.190
The two films even had a near identical budget
of $13 million for Mac and Me vs. $10 million

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.190
for E.T.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.539
(When adjusting for inflation for the 1988
Mac and Me and the 1982 E.T., that comes out

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.799
to $26 million and $25 million respectively
today.)

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:17.900
This brings us to the product placement.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.620
For starters, one of the trailers for the
film started with a direct message from Ronald

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.410
McDonald who is shown reading a copy of the
script which is the same color scheme as his

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.410
outfit.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.230
Ronald also featured heavily in commercials
and posters for the film, in some cases only

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.130
having his billing preceded by the logo for
the company that produced the film.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.350
Ronald also briefly appears in the film’s
most infamous scene, which features an impromptu

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:46.660
almost 10 minute long choreographed breakdance
featuring dozens of dancers inside and around

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.680
a McDonald’s restaurant that is never adequately
explained.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.300
This continues even as the plot unfolds around
the dancers who are oblivious to the government

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.580
stooges chasing a boy and his alien friend
disguised in a teddy bear outfit.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.120
But we’re not done yet- as if having about
10% of the film’s runtime spent inside a

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.849
McDonald’s full of people exuberantly dancing
wasn’t overt enough, the film also features

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.900
a main character who works at McDonald’s
and wears her uniform in every scene she appears

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.900
in, most of which she wasn’t at work for.

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.610
That’s not to mention the Oscar-worthy dialogue
in which the family discusses how incredibly

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.550
good Big Macs are.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.129
As for Coca-Cola, along with being prominently
featured in several scenes, either in characters’

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.730
hands or handily placed McDonald’s cups,
it ends up being a key plot point later in

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.670
the movie when the main character uses it
to revive Mac’s ailing alien parents.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.430
Yes, this movie features a scene in which
a character is shown bringing someone back

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.530
to life by pouring Coca-Cola into their dying
mouth.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.020
This is then immediately followed by a scene
showing the same aliens risking detection

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.940
to buy more Coca-Cola.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.060
Coca-Cola, along with Skittles are also the
only things the eponymous Mac is shown to

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.379
consume, with the latter being used to lure
him out of hiding like a grotesque parody

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.670
of the Reece’s Pieces scene in E.T.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.280
The film also features a rather prominent
plug for the department store Sears, when

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.690
it is revealed the main character’s mother
relocated her entire family to another state

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.630
because she was offered a job there.

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.660
Unsurprisingly from all this, the director
and screenwriter of the film, Stewart Raffill,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.300
noted the genesis of the film was hardly conducive
to producing quality entertainment, despite

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.389
its relatively high budget for the time:

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.389
Mac and Me?

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.569
That was another movie where somebody called
me up and he was a producer who had worked

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:38.800
on quite a few films.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.610
He’d made a lot of big movies, but he decided
he want to make his own movie.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.080
And he raised the money from one of the main
partners at McDonalds—I think, like, the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.880
produce provider for McDonalds—and he put
up the money to do that movie with the understanding

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.599
that the proceeds from that movie would go
to the Ronald McDonald Foundation.

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:55.960
So I was hired out of the blue.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.639
And the producer asked me to come down to
the office.

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.969
So I did and he had a whole crew there, a
whole crew on the payroll.

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:03.150
It was amazing.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.699
He had the transportation captain.

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:05.819
The camera department head.

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:06.819
The AD.

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:07.819
The Production Manager.

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.639
He had everybody already hired and I said,
“Well, what’s the script?”

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:13.119
And he said, “We don’t have a script.

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:14.560
I don’t like the script.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.569
You have to write the script.

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.520
You’re gonna have to write it quick so prep
the movie and write the script on the weekends.”

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.470
Yeah, so I’d go and lock myself in a hotel
on Friday night, write ’til Monday, anticipate

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.659
what the locations were going to be, go out
and find the locations, design the aliens

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:28.659
and all that stuff.

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:31.080
It was kind of a messy way to make a movie.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.910
(Note: the producer in question, R.J. Louis,
among many other movies, also produced The

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.449
Karate Kid, Karate Kid Part II, and Ocean’s
Eleven.)

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.759
One thing we can say for certain though is
that although this movie has been rightly

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:52.360
panned and called one of the worst movies
of all time, it does feature a silver lining-

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.349
Jade Calegory, the actor who played the main
character, Eric Cruise.

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.520
Now for most actors this role would have been
an embarrassing footnote they’d rather not

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:02.520
discuss.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.099
(Fun fact: this movie was the first one Jennifer
Aniston was ever in.)

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.969
For Calegory, though, it was one of the defining
moments in his young life, because, like his

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:15.569
character, he too is disabled, having been
born with spina bifida.

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:16.569
Why is this important?

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.149
Well, to begin with, disabled characters in
Hollywood films are almost always played by

00:06:20.149 --> 00:06:24.849
people who have no such disability, and this
was even more so the case in the 1980s.

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.370
But far more importantly, the film never makes
a big deal about the character’s handicap.

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.330
It isn’t an integral part of his character
or plot and it isn’t played for laughs or

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.770
sympathy; he’s refreshingly, and very purposefully,
portrayed as just a normal kid doing otherwise

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.710
normal things until he encounters his little
alien friend.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.219
The fact that he’s in a wheelchair isn’t
even commented on by any character in the

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:47.219
movie.

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:51.520
Moreover, the fact that the kid was in a wheelchair
both in the film and in real life wasn’t

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.910
overtly mentioned in the marketing campaigns
either.

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.129
As Raffill note, “…when they finished
it was as if the fact that they used a real

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.559
encumbered person to play the [character]
didn’t mean anything to even the people

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:03.199
who lived in the world.”

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:07.560
While in a perfect world this shouldn’t
be notable in any way, as noted in a LA Times

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.000
article from the time of the film’s release,
this was (and still is) a huge deal because

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.669
it marked one of the exceptionally few times
in film history where a disabled actor had

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:20.719
secured a role for a character that wasn’t
“written disabled” and didn’t have the

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:25.080
disability made into a defining character
trait or plot element.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.869
In stark contrast to this, Calegory later
noted when he showed up for other auditions

00:07:28.869 --> 00:07:32.999
to play various disabled characters, not only
were the characters always “written disabled”,

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:37.349
but it was generally very obvious that the
casting directors had no interest in hiring

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:39.339
an actual disabled person.

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:43.459
“They were just kind of bringing disabled
people in there just to say they did, you

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:44.459
know what I mean?”

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:48.389
Fitting then that in Mac and Me they found
a boy, Calegory, who’d never acted before

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:52.639
at the time and whose only real qualifications
for the role was that he was a kid who had

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:57.539
a disability, but was otherwise pretty much
like any other young boy- exactly the message

00:07:57.539 --> 00:07:58.689
they were going for.

00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:02.610
Speaking of this, according to his mother,
among Calegory’s many other childhood exploits,

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:06.770
when he was five years old and literally only
a few minutes out of the hospital after surgery

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:10.479
and still in a full body cast, she turned
her back on him for just a moment… only

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:15.389
to turn back to find him flying by precariously
perched spread-eagle on a skateboard he’d

00:08:15.389 --> 00:08:16.389
found somewhere.

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:18.610
Calegory later noted of his attitude on life:

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.800
You shouldn’t dwell on what you can’t
do.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.139
Focus on what you can do.

00:08:22.139 --> 00:08:26.779
And the more you see what you can do, the
more you come to realize there are no limitations

00:08:26.779 --> 00:08:29.550
in life.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:33.870
In a 1988 interview, a then 12-year-old Jade
Calegory revealed that he’d gotten so sick

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:37.770
of answering the question “Why are you in
a wheelchair” that his stock response was

00:08:37.770 --> 00:09:08.440
to look the person asking in the eye and say
“Vietnam”.
