00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.180
well don't forget about him with the you
know thing in his tooth not to others -

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:01.190
know thing in his tooth not to others -
 

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.929
know thing in his tooth not to others -
that's right

00:11:01.929 --> 00:11:01.939
that's right
 

00:11:01.939 --> 00:11:03.609
that's right
or like when he has to strike so far

00:11:03.609 --> 00:11:03.619
or like when he has to strike so far
 

00:11:03.619 --> 00:11:04.839
or like when he has to strike so far
there's only so far he gets stretched

00:11:04.839 --> 00:11:04.849
there's only so far he gets stretched
 

00:11:04.849 --> 00:11:06.159
there's only so far he gets stretched
through the maze and so I mean it's like

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:06.169
through the maze and so I mean it's like
 

00:11:06.169 --> 00:11:09.189
through the maze and so I mean it's like
they're usually very good at that but

00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:09.199
they're usually very good at that but
 

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:10.539
they're usually very good at that but
you know like I said they didn't even

00:11:10.539 --> 00:11:10.549
you know like I said they didn't even
 

00:11:10.549 --> 00:11:12.759
you know like I said they didn't even
give it that well I'll have to do a say

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:12.769
give it that well I'll have to do a say
 

00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:14.439
give it that well I'll have to do a say
if that stuff touches you you could you

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:14.449
if that stuff touches you you could you
 

00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:17.859
if that stuff touches you you could you
could die yeah some way they would do it

00:11:17.859 --> 00:11:17.869
could die yeah some way they would do it
 

00:11:17.869 --> 00:11:21.819
could die yeah some way they would do it
yeah um I think the whole reason why

00:11:21.819 --> 00:11:21.829
yeah um I think the whole reason why
 

00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:26.319
yeah um I think the whole reason why
people's was sabotaging everything was

00:11:26.319 --> 00:11:26.329
people's was sabotaging everything was
 

00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:31.749
people's was sabotaging everything was
to make them dislike James if they

00:11:31.749 --> 00:11:31.759
to make them dislike James if they
 

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:33.639
to make them dislike James if they
didn't like James and they didn't trust

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:33.649
didn't like James and they didn't trust
 

00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:38.319
didn't like James and they didn't trust
James him being killed off wouldn't be

00:11:38.319 --> 00:11:38.329
James him being killed off wouldn't be
 

00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:41.379
James him being killed off wouldn't be
as heartbreaking or hard to deal with

00:11:41.379 --> 00:11:41.389
as heartbreaking or hard to deal with
 

00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:43.569
as heartbreaking or hard to deal with
but it still wasn't even then she max

00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:43.579
but it still wasn't even then she max
 

00:11:43.579 --> 00:11:45.460
but it still wasn't even then she max
him out I mean it's like why wasn't that

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:45.470
him out I mean it's like why wasn't that
 

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.529
him out I mean it's like why wasn't that
help why wasn't that choice number one

00:11:47.529 --> 00:11:47.539
help why wasn't that choice number one
 

00:11:47.539 --> 00:11:49.929
help why wasn't that choice number one
just knock them out and then talk to

00:11:49.929 --> 00:11:49.939
just knock them out and then talk to
 

00:11:49.939 --> 00:11:55.659
just knock them out and then talk to
James about thank you God there being an

00:11:55.659 --> 00:11:55.669
James about thank you God there being an
 

00:11:55.669 --> 00:11:59.289
James about thank you God there being an
episode it's just you know naturally I

00:11:59.289 --> 00:11:59.299
episode it's just you know naturally I
 

00:11:59.299 --> 00:12:01.599
episode it's just you know naturally I
think that's what the whole point was

00:12:01.599 --> 00:12:01.609
think that's what the whole point was
 

00:12:01.609 --> 00:12:05.049
think that's what the whole point was
and she started kind of not it wasn't

00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:05.059
and she started kind of not it wasn't
 

00:12:05.059 --> 00:12:08.919
and she started kind of not it wasn't
working so well so I mean that's my

00:12:08.919 --> 00:12:08.929
working so well so I mean that's my
 

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:10.929
working so well so I mean that's my
guess of why she was sabotaging and

00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:10.939
guess of why she was sabotaging and
 

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:13.479
guess of why she was sabotaging and
making James look bad I could be

00:12:13.479 --> 00:12:13.489
making James look bad I could be
 

00:12:13.489 --> 00:12:15.129
making James look bad I could be
completely wrong they can be completely

00:12:15.129 --> 00:12:15.139
completely wrong they can be completely
 

00:12:15.139 --> 00:12:17.859
completely wrong they can be completely
off base here but it just seems logical

00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:17.869
off base here but it just seems logical
 

00:12:17.869 --> 00:12:21.489
off base here but it just seems logical
that yeah if you're gonna have to get

00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:21.499
that yeah if you're gonna have to get
 

00:12:21.499 --> 00:12:22.689
that yeah if you're gonna have to get
rid of someone you might as well start

00:12:22.689 --> 00:12:22.699
rid of someone you might as well start
 

00:12:22.699 --> 00:12:24.729
rid of someone you might as well start
disliking them so therefore the

00:12:24.729 --> 00:12:24.739
disliking them so therefore the
 

00:12:24.739 --> 00:12:26.259
disliking them so therefore the
disconnect is and let's remember they

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:26.269
disconnect is and let's remember they
 

00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:29.109
disconnect is and let's remember they
just met him for the first time it makes

about as much sense as any of the other

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:30.529
about as much sense as any of the other
 

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:33.809
about as much sense as any of the other
stuff that doesn't make sense I

00:12:33.809 --> 00:12:33.819
stuff that doesn't make sense I
 

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:36.819
stuff that doesn't make sense I
understand I won't argue that but I will

00:12:36.819 --> 00:12:36.829
