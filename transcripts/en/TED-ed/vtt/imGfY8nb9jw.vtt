00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:16.452
One day, I found myself
at the top of a mountain,

00:00:16.476 --> 00:00:20.658
one descent to go, one last chance
to fulfill a lifelong dream.

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:23.408
I wasn't even old enough
to walk into a PG-13 movie alone

00:00:23.432 --> 00:00:24.702
when my dream took roots.

00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:25.877
Yet there I stood,

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:27.439
my three teammates by my side,

00:00:27.463 --> 00:00:29.321
facing the opportunity to make history.

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:31.521
My mind wandered, just for half a second,

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:34.467
but that half-second was filled
with a lifetime of memories,

00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:37.941
and two decisions that brought me
here to the top of the mountain.

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:40.686
I made the first decision
after a very challenging period

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.114
in my career as an athlete --

00:00:42.138 --> 00:00:44.616
five years of recurring injuries
as a track athlete.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.377
Five years -- that's a long time
to dedicate to anything.

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:48.910
But as much as I loved track,

00:00:48.934 --> 00:00:52.077
the injuries were slowly killing
my drive and my dreams.

00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:54.095
My injuries had me feeling like a failure

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:55.599
at a sport I was once great at.

00:00:55.623 --> 00:00:58.667
The last of the series of injuries
required major elbow surgery.

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.691
As I sat on my couch, days out of surgery,

00:01:00.715 --> 00:01:02.843
I thought of an old coach
and mentor's words,

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:05.123
comparing me to a great
bobsledder he once knew.

00:01:05.147 --> 00:01:06.790
"Bobsled? No way!"

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:09.616
But after year upon year
of not reaching the goals

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.901
I set for myself in track,

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:12.124
it was time for a change.

00:01:12.148 --> 00:01:14.266
So I reached out
to the US Olympic Committee,

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.965
and they told me to start training.

00:01:15.989 --> 00:01:17.512
I was going to be a bobsledder!

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:19.071
I didn't know anything about it,

00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:20.864
but the first decision had been made.

00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:23.485
There I was, in what felt like
a blink of an eye later,

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.520
about to push my four-man
sled with my team

00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:27.660
to the chance of Olympic gold,
Olympic glory.

00:01:28.226 --> 00:01:30.570
"Back set! Front set! Ready and --"

00:01:30.594 --> 00:01:32.273
the driver yelled, and off we went.

00:01:32.297 --> 00:01:33.598
We dug as deep as we could,

00:01:33.622 --> 00:01:36.782
and as the cadence of our steps increased
and the sled accelerated,

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.664
we left everything we had on the track,

00:01:38.688 --> 00:01:41.360
before leaving the ice
and boarding our Night Train sled.

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:42.976
And a calm came over me.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.576
And once in the sled,
as it was picking up speed,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.998
for just another millisecond,

00:01:47.022 --> 00:01:49.099
my mind went back
to that day on the couch.

00:01:49.123 --> 00:01:51.853
"How can I train for the bobsled
team without getting hurt

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:53.456
over and over again like before?"

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.397
I looked in the mirror
and realized I still wanted to compete.

00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:57.667
I still wanted to succeed.

00:01:57.691 --> 00:02:00.037
But I had to face the reality
that my getting hurt

00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:01.504
wasn't to be blamed elsewhere.

00:02:01.528 --> 00:02:04.553
I realized that if I had a problem
it was up to me to change it,

00:02:04.577 --> 00:02:06.651
and that what I had
been doing all this time

00:02:06.675 --> 00:02:08.149
may not have been best for me.

00:02:08.173 --> 00:02:10.371
I had to confront my reality
and make a change,

00:02:10.395 --> 00:02:11.976
and that was the second decision.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.101
The decision in my mind not to get hurt
anymore had many layers,

00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.493
but it mostly had to do
with taking responsibility

00:02:17.517 --> 00:02:19.091
for all the variables in my life.

00:02:19.115 --> 00:02:21.619
If I thought something
I would do or something I felt

00:02:21.643 --> 00:02:24.325
would lead me to injury,
then it most certainly would.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.080
I would have to have
a fundamental shift in mindset.

00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:30.759
I learned to let go of the fears I had
trained myself to have over the years

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.692
and decided to trust myself and my body

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:35.724
to push through situations I had
thought insurmountable before.

00:02:35.748 --> 00:02:37.787
What followed those five years of injuries

00:02:37.811 --> 00:02:40.153
were nine years of not missing
one race I entered

00:02:40.177 --> 00:02:42.878
for the USA National and Olympic teams.

00:02:42.902 --> 00:02:45.362
Because I made a decision,
then another one,

00:02:45.386 --> 00:02:47.362
and held true to those two decisions,

00:02:47.386 --> 00:02:50.813
I found myself back with my team
approaching 90 miles per hour.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.222
And as we came around the last corners,
I could hear the crowd cheering

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:57.362
and the cowbells blaring, and a hard
"You!" coming from the masses

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:59.249
as we passed by at 95 miles an hour.

00:02:59.273 --> 00:03:02.532
But someone wasn't yelling "You!"
at us, they were yelling "USA!"

00:03:02.556 --> 00:03:05.384
We were moving so fast,
we only heard the first piece of it.

00:03:05.408 --> 00:03:07.060
We then came around the last bend,

00:03:07.084 --> 00:03:09.603
and when we all looked up,
the clock simply read "1."

00:03:09.627 --> 00:03:11.913
We had done it; we were
Olympic gold medalists.

00:03:11.937 --> 00:03:13.380
We were the best in the world.

00:03:13.404 --> 00:03:14.800
My hands went up immediately,

00:03:14.824 --> 00:03:18.325
as the moment I had been waiting for
my entire life had finally come true.

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.141
And as our sled slowly came to a stop

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:22.387
and I looked into the crowd
to see my mom, dad,

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.471
sister and family
and friends crying for me,

00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:27.703
I knew my decisions had been worth
the sacrifice, worth the fear.

00:03:27.727 --> 00:03:30.982
Two decisions and those five minutes
sitting on that couch

00:03:31.006 --> 00:03:32.364
began to change my life,

00:03:32.388 --> 00:03:34.591
and sticking to them fulfilled my dreams.

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:36.639
It was those decisions
and standing by them

00:03:36.663 --> 00:03:40.024
that ultimately gave me the confidence
to perform at the Olympic games.

00:03:40.048 --> 00:03:42.619
What two decisions
can you make and stick to

00:03:42.643 --> 00:03:44.592
that will change your life forever?

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:47.316
I challenge you to look
at what you're doing in your life

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.314
and think of what you dream to do.
