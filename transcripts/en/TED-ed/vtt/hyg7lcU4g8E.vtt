00:00:08.082 --> 00:00:10.615
You spend weeks studying 
for an important test.

00:00:10.615 --> 00:00:14.124
On the big day, you wait nervously
as your teacher hands it out.

00:00:14.124 --> 00:00:18.680
You’re working your way through, 
when you’re asked to define ‘ataraxia.’

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.832
You know you’ve seen it before, 
but your mind goes blank.

00:00:21.832 --> 00:00:23.695
What just happened?

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:25.427
The answer lies in 
the complex relationship

00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:27.377
between stress and memory.

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:29.171
There are many types 
and degrees of stress

00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:30.427
and different kinds of memory,

00:00:30.427 --> 00:00:32.798
but we’re going to focus on 
how short-term stress

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:35.225
impacts your memory for facts.

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:39.403
To start, it helps to understand 
how this kind of memory works.

00:00:39.403 --> 00:00:41.736
Facts you read, hear, or study

00:00:41.736 --> 00:00:45.067
become memories through
a process with three main steps.

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:46.736
First comes acquisition:

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:49.336
the moment you encounter
a new piece of information.

00:00:49.336 --> 00:00:53.247
Each sensory experience activates 
a unique set of brain areas.

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:55.246
In order to become lasting memories,

00:00:55.246 --> 00:00:57.001
these sensory experiences

00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.532
have to be consolidated 
by the hippocampus,

00:00:59.532 --> 00:01:00.987
influenced by the amygdala,

00:01:00.987 --> 00:01:05.395
which emphasizes experiences 
associated with strong emotions.

00:01:05.395 --> 00:01:07.399
The hippocampus then encodes memories,

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.091
probably by strengthening 
the synaptic connections

00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:13.414
stimulated during 
the original sensory experience.

00:01:13.414 --> 00:01:15.104
Once a memory has been encoded,

00:01:15.104 --> 00:01:17.842
it can be remembered, 
or retrieved, later.

00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:19.863
Memories are stored all over the brain,

00:01:19.863 --> 00:01:24.297
and it’s likely the prefrontal cortex 
that signals for their retrieval.

00:01:24.297 --> 00:01:27.558
So how does stress 
affect each of these stages?

00:01:27.558 --> 00:01:28.936
In the first two stages,

00:01:28.936 --> 00:01:32.429
moderate stress can actually 
help experiences enter your memory.

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:34.914
Your brain responds to stressful stimuli

00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:38.425
by releasing hormones 
known as corticosteroids,

00:01:38.425 --> 00:01:40.981
which activate a process 
of threat-detection

00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:43.614
and threat-response in the amygdala.

00:01:43.614 --> 00:01:45.520
The amygdala prompts your hippocampus

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.945
to consolidate the stress-inducing 
experience into a memory.

00:01:48.945 --> 00:01:52.428
Meanwhile, the flood 
of corticosteroids from stress

00:01:52.428 --> 00:01:54.049
stimulates your hippocampus,

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.698
also prompting memory consolidation.

00:01:56.698 --> 00:01:58.932
But even though some stress 
can be helpful,

00:01:58.932 --> 00:02:02.116
extreme and chronic stress 
can have the opposite effect.

00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:06.695
Researchers have tested this by injecting
rats directly with stress hormones.

00:02:06.695 --> 00:02:10.071
As they gradually increased 
the dose of corticosteroids,

00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:13.325
the rats’ performance on
memory tests increased at first,

00:02:13.325 --> 00:02:15.660
but dropped off at higher doses.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.210
In humans, we see a similar 
positive effect with moderate stress.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.176
But that only appears when 
the stress is related to the memory task—

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:26.997
so while time pressure might 
help you memorize a list,

00:02:26.997 --> 00:02:29.526
having a friend scare you will not.

00:02:29.526 --> 00:02:31.721
And the weeks, months, or even years

00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:35.841
of sustained corticosteroids 
that result from chronic stress

00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:37.765
can damage the hippocampus

00:02:37.765 --> 00:02:41.143
and decrease your ability 
to form new memories.

00:02:41.143 --> 00:02:44.853
It would be nice if some stress 
also helped us remember facts,

00:02:44.853 --> 00:02:47.619
but unfortunately, the opposite is true.

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:50.553
The act of remembering relies 
on the prefrontal cortex,

00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:53.688
which governs thought, 
attention, and reasoning.

00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:56.592
When corticosteroids 
stimulate the amygdala,

00:02:56.592 --> 00:02:59.815
the amygdala inhibits, 
or lessens the activity of,

00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:01.598
the prefrontal cortex.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:05.643
The reason for this inhibition
is so the fight/flight/freeze response

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:10.451
can overrule slower, more reasoned 
thought in a dangerous situation.

00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:12.753
But that can also have 
the unfortunate effect

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:15.447
of making your mind 
go blank during a test.

00:03:15.447 --> 00:03:19.216
And then the act of trying to remember
can itself be a stressor,

00:03:19.216 --> 00:03:22.723
leading to a vicious cycle 
of more corticosteroid release

00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:25.684
and an even smaller chance of remembering.

00:03:25.684 --> 00:03:28.633
So what can you do to turn stress 
to your advantage

00:03:28.633 --> 00:03:31.561
and stay calm and collected 
when it matters the most?

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:35.356
First, if you know a stressful
situation like a test is coming,

00:03:35.356 --> 00:03:38.882
try preparing in conditions similar 
to the stressful environment.

00:03:38.882 --> 00:03:40.424
Novelty can be a stressor.

00:03:40.424 --> 00:03:43.001
Completing practice questions 
under time pressure,

00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.626
or seated at a desk 
rather than on a couch,

00:03:45.626 --> 00:03:48.171
can make your stress response
to these circumstances

00:03:48.171 --> 00:03:50.473
less sensitive during the test itself.

00:03:50.473 --> 00:03:52.791
Exercise is another useful tool.

00:03:52.791 --> 00:03:55.042
Increasing your heart 
and breathing rate

00:03:55.042 --> 00:03:57.098
is linked to chemical changes 
in your brain

00:03:57.098 --> 00:04:00.633
that help reduce anxiety 
and increase your sense of well-being.

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:04.069
Regular exercise is also widely 
thought to improve sleeping patterns,

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.439
which comes in handy 
the night before a test.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.058
And on the actual test day,

00:04:08.058 --> 00:04:12.960
try taking deep breaths to counteract 
your body’s flight/fight/freeze response.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.455
Deep breathing exercises have shown
measurable reduction in test anxiety

00:04:17.455 --> 00:04:21.354
in groups ranging from
third graders to nursing students.

00:04:21.354 --> 00:04:24.807
So the next time you find your mind 
going blank at a critical moment,

00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:27.543
take a few deep breaths 
until you remember ataraxia:

00:04:27.543 --> 00:04:30.578
a state of calmness, free from anxiety.
