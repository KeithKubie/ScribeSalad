00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.072
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:04.530
JOE BINNEY: I'm
Joe Binney, and I'm

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.110
VP of product
engineering at Robinhood.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.200
Robinhood is the free
stock trading app.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.100
Every other stock trading
service charges $5 to $10.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.170
We do it for $0.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.870
Robinhood today has
over a million users.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.870
And we've been able to grow
with a very small team.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.670
Android users love Robinhood.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.680
We've more than
doubled our user base.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.580
And with 4.6 stars, Robinhood
is the highest-rated stock

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.986
brokerage on the Play store.

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:33.050
DAN HILL: I'm Dan Hill.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.532
I'm an Android
developer at Robinhood.

00:00:35.532 --> 00:00:36.740
We're an Android team of two.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.210
We kind of pride ourselves
on staying agile and being

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.260
very fast.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.500
In Android Studios, there's
speed and stability.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.560
It really lets us stay
in the zone for longer

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.190
and not have to kind of worry
about the administration.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.795
I mean, the mark of a good
tool is that it's not visible,

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:50.670
it's not in your way.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.430
It's just there.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.620
And it's something
that you can use.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.620
One of my favorite things
about Android Studios,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.994
all the shortcuts
that it offers.

00:00:56.994 --> 00:00:58.950
There is one that's
really great.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.310
It's a shortcut to
look up shortcuts.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.270
And basically it will
display it in line

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.060
with what the
keyboard shortcut is.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.540
Or you can kind
of use it to learn

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.970
all the different shortcuts.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.240
The new emulator is fast.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.870
You can hardware accelerate
and you use your machine's GPU

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.929
to make it faster.

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:16.470
One of my favorite
things to show off

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.455
is the trade animation.

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:19.110
It's really satisfying
to kind of swipe

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.510
up, kind of see your trade
metaphorically go out.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.314
Very tactical way to
interact with the stock.

00:01:24.314 --> 00:01:25.980
JOE BINNEY: Having
really powerful tools

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.515
enables our very small team
to have a large impact.

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:30.890
DAN HILL: In
Android Development,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.400
we're always
jumping around files

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.250
and learning different config
files and Java classes.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.530
And Android Studio has
always held responsive enough

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.320
to go at the speed
that you want to go.
