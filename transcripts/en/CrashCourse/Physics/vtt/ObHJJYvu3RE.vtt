00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.260
Every discipline of science has its very own
special language --

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.160
the way it communicates the ideas that it investigates.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.830
For example, biology finds order in the world,
by giving every living thing a name, in Latin.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.450
Chemistry has a system of prefixes, suffixes,
and numerals to tell you, in a word or two,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.050
the exact composition of an atom, or a compound.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.900
But physics has to communicate its ideas differently.

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:25.929
The language of physics, is mathematics.

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.519
Because, if you’re trying to describe how
the world works, you really have to know how

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.009
things relate to each other in a
mathematical way.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.309
For example, we've been talking a lot about position, velocity, and acceleration, and how they're all connected.

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.029
Velocity is a measure of your change in position, and acceleration is a measure of your  change in velocity.

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:46.100
They’re connected -- one quality will describe
how the other is changing.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.300
And the way we describe change in mathematics
is through calculus.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.640
Calculus explains how and why things change,
using derivatives,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.410
which help you determine how an equation
is changing, as well as with integrals,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.410
which you can use to calculate the area
under a curve.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.920
Derivatives and integrals themselves are closely
connected. But let's start with derivatives.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.680
You probably won't be able to go straight
from this lesson to your calculus final.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.800
But hopefully, in about 10 minutes, you WILL be
able to understand some of the maths that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.270
scientists have been using to think about
physics, for the last 400 years or so.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.670
And you'll ALSO have a NEW way to fight speeding
tickets. You know, just in case.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:31.110
[Theme Music]

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.880
Last time, we talked about that unfortunate
incident where you got a speeding ticket.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.560
Your speedometer was broken, but because we
knew your acceleration, we were able to calculate

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.880
how fast you were going when the cops pulled
you over.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.899
So now, let's talk about what happens next.

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.630
Say the police drive off. You're ready to
get back on the road, so you hit the gas and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.149
zoom forward, moving faster and faster.

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.309
But in this scenario, we don't know your acceleration;

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:56.529
we only know how much your position is
changing over time.

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:00.079
In this instance, your position happens
to be equal to the amount of time you’ve

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.529
been driving, squared. So we’d write that
as the equation x = t^2.

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:10.509
20 seconds in, you pass a detector with a
sign that tells you your speed. You keep driving,

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.229
foot still on the gas, before you realize
what number you saw on the sign.

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:22.349
And…OH NO! You JUST got a speeding ticket in the last episode, for doing 126 kmh in a 100 kmh zone,

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.140
and now the sign says you’re going even
FASTER!

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.620
Now you want to know if the number on the
detector is accurate -- in other words, you want

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.580
to find your velocity, at the exact moment
you passed it.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.320
That velocity is just a measure of your
change in position -- its derivative.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.300
So, to find your velocity, we’ll need to
find the derivative of your position.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.910
And in order to determine THAT, we first need
to talk about limits.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.260
Not speed limits -- I mean the derivatives
kind. (pause) I’ll explain...

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.840
Limits are based on the idea that if you have
a an equation on a graph, you can often predict

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.060
what it's going to look like at one point, just by knowing what it looks like at the surrounding points.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.600
For example: let’s say you have a graph
of x = t^2 -- from our speeding scenario above

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.240
And you want to find out how your position is changing at the exact moment that time is equal to zero.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.420
That's what we'd call the limit as t approaches
zero.

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.220
So you take a look at what's happening AROUND
t = 0.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.520
At t = 1, x is 1.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.940
At t = 0.5, x is 0.25.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.200
And at t = 0.1, x is 0.01.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.570
You can probably tell that as we get closer
and closer to t = 0, your value of x is getting

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.110
closer to zero, too. That’s what mathematicians
mean when they talk about a limit.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.580
Limits are useful because they can help predict
what happens as you make intervals smaller.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:43.680
An interval is just a range on a graph, it's
the space between two points on the horizontal axis.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.790
So the first thing we can try is calculating
your AVERAGE velocity over the interval from

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.180
15 to 20 seconds.
To do that, we use an equation that we talked

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.680
about last time --
your average velocity, which is equal to the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.600
change in your position --
divided by the change in time.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.190
That turns out to be 35 ms.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:03.910
Problem is, it’s still just an average -- it’s
not EXACTLY how fast you were going after

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.300
20 seconds of acceleration, when you passed
the detector.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.069
Because of limits, we know that you could
get a little closer to the right number by

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.660
calculating your average over smaller and
smaller intervals. Then you’d see that the

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.250
number seemed to be getting closer and closer
to 40 meters per second.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.940
Which means that you’re going to need to
slow wayyyy down if you don’t want to get

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.080
your SECOND speeding ticket of the day.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.400
But that's the idea of derivatives: you can
use infinitely tiny intervals to figure out

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.320
exactly how an equation is changing at any
moment.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.970
You can even come up with an equation to describe
the change. That's exactly what velocity is

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.430
-- an equation that describes change in position.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.800
And acceleration describes change in velocity.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.630
So we'd call velocity the derivative of position,
and acceleration the derivative of velocity.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.690
Now, when it comes to how you can express
a derivative in writing, mathematicians have

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.120
come up with shortcuts.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.840
Like what's known as the Power Rule.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.320
As the name suggests, it’s used for equations
with variables raised to powers, or exponents

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.840
-- as long as the exponent is a number.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.520
For example, x = t^2 would work with the power
rule, because t is raised to the power of 2.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.060
The power rule says that for these kinds of
equations, to calculate the derivative, all

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.030
you need is one weird trick.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.210
Take the number of that exponent -- in this
case, two -- and stick it in front of the

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.260
variable. Then you subtract 1 from the exponent.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.470
And that's your derivative!

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.180
So the derivative of x = t^2 is just 2t. Which
means that no matter how many seconds you’ve

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.330
had your foot on the gas, your velocity will
be 2t -- so, double the number of seconds.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:36.550
After 5 seconds, you were going a modest 10
ms. But after 20 seconds, you were going a

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.740
full 40 ms. Which is not good. We'd write
that like this, where dxdt is just a way of

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.740
saying that we're taking the derivative of
the part of the equation that involves t.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.860
Or, as a mathematician would put it, we're
taking the derivative of x with respect to t.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.300
You'll also sometimes see this written in
a different way:

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.710
If F of T is equal to T squared, then F prime
of T is equal to two T.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.880
Now let’s try to find a couple more derivatives
using the power rule.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.880
x = 7t^6 is another power-style equation:
it has a variable, t, raised to a power, 6,

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.760
with a number in front of it: 7. The first
thing we do is take the exponent, and stick

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.090
it in front of the variable.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:19.740
But there's already a number in front of t
... 7. So we end up multiplying them: 7 times

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:26.980
6 is 42. Then we subtract 1 from the power
that t is raised to. So we end up with 42t^5.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.880
Same goes for equations where the exponents
are fractions or decimals. So the derivative

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.740
of t^½ is half t to the negative one half.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.660
It works for negative exponents, too -- the
derivative of t^-2 is just negative 2 t to

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.620
the negative third.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.320
Now, there are a few more equations whose
derivatives you should understand.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.460
Trigonometry -- which we use to calculate
the angles and sides of triangles -- is going

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.340
to come up a lot in physics, because we'll
be using right angle triangles all the time.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.949
So it's a good idea to know how to find the
derivatives of sin(x) and cos(x).

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:04.220
Sine tells you that if you have a right angle triangle,
and x is an angle in that triangle, then sin(x)

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.979
will be the (length of the side opposite,
that angle), divided by the (hypotenuse).

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:12.970
Cosine does the same thing, just with the
(side next to the angle) divided by the (hypotenuse).

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.419
So their graphs tell you what those ratios
will be, depending on the angle.

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:20.460
We can actually try to guess the derivative
of sin(x) just by looking at its graph.

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:25.210
You can see that the curve has turning points
every so often, at x = -90 degrees, x = 90

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:29.639
degrees, and so on -- repeating every 180
degrees.

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:35.000
Meaning, at those points, the equations aren't
changing at all -- so the derivative at these

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.410
turning points is also going to be exactly
zero.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.930
Let's pull up another graph where we'll plot
the derivative, and put little dots where

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:42.330
we know it'll be zero.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:49.300
Now, what's happening between those turning
points? Well, from -270 to -90 degrees, sin(x)

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:49.940
is decreasing.

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:54.449
In other words, its change -- and therefore
its derivative -- must be negative.

00:07:54.449 --> 00:08:01.391
Then, from -90 to 90 degrees, sin(x) is increasing
-- so it'll have a positive derivative. And so on...

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.350
There are actually a lot more clues in this
graph to help us find the derivative, but

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.680
we already know enough to make a decent guess.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.660
If we smoothly connect the dots on the graph
of our derivative, keeping in mind where the

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:16.250
curve should be positive and where it should
be negative … hey, this derivative is looking

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.800
a whole lot like the graph of cos(x)!

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.979
That’s because it is. The derivative of
sine is just cosine, and that is going to

00:08:22.979 --> 00:08:24.080
come up a LOT.

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:28.430
So will these, which you can work out on your
own by repeating what we just did with the

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.400
graphs of sin(x) and cos(x).

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.469
Another important derivative that comes up
a lot is a very special case, and that’s

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:38.640
e^x The derivative of e^x is
just…. e^x.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.420
Yep, that’s it. No matter what.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:45.080
In fact, that’s one way to define e, which
is kind of like pi in the sense that it’s

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:51.750
a simple letter representing a very specific,
irrational number -- about 2.718, but with

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.399
more digits after the decimal point that go
on forever.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.350
It has all sorts of uses in calculus, but
it also shows up when you’re studying things

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.070
like finance and probability.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:04.190
Armed with all these ways to find derivatives,
you could take pretty much any equation of

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:08.270
your position and calculate its derivative
-- and therefore your velocity.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:12.100
In the same way, you could take the derivative
of your velocity and find your acceleration.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.009
But there's still a whole other part of calculus
that we haven't talked about yet -- integrals

00:09:17.009 --> 00:09:18.910
-- which will let you do this backwards.

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:23.420
With integrals, you can use your acceleration to find your velocity, and your velocity to find your position.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.860
But we'll save that for next time.

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:29.280
Today, you learned about limits, and that derivatives use them to describe how an equation is changing.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.980
We also talked about a few different kinds of derivatives: powers, constants, trigonometry, and e^x.
