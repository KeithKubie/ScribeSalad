documentation of his experiments with
 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.150
documentation of his experiments with
his imagination and what he would do is

regained that Faculty although I think

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650
regained that Faculty although I think
 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.870
regained that Faculty although I think
with you MIT was a faculty that have

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
with you MIT was a faculty that have
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.050
with you MIT was a faculty that have
never really disappeared and he had

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060
never really disappeared and he had
 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.870
never really disappeared and he had
figures of imagination that came to him

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
figures of imagination that came to him
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.660
figures of imagination that came to him
that he could speak with and he spoke

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
that he could speak with and he spoke
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.820
that he could speak with and he spoke
with these figures of imagination and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830
with these figures of imagination and
 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.950
with these figures of imagination and
documented that over a very long period

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960
documented that over a very long period
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.310
documented that over a very long period
of time and that was originally that was

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320
of time and that was originally that was
 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.869
of time and that was originally that was
eventually distilled into a book called

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
eventually distilled into a book called
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.729
eventually distilled into a book called
the red book which was published about

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739
the red book which was published about
 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.369
the red book which was published about
three or four years ago and it was a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379
three or four years ago and it was a
 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.630
three or four years ago and it was a
book that young regarded as the central

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
book that young regarded as the central
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.680
book that young regarded as the central
source from which all his inspiration

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690
source from which all his inspiration
 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.010
source from which all his inspiration
emerged I'm a sort of the way it looks

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020
emerged I'm a sort of the way it looks
 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.040
emerged I'm a sort of the way it looks
to me is that we embody a lot of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
to me is that we embody a lot of
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.830
to me is that we embody a lot of
information in our action right and our

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840
information in our action right and our
 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.250
information in our action right and our
action has developed as a consequence of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
action has developed as a consequence of
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.190
action has developed as a consequence of
imitating other people and not only the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200
imitating other people and not only the
 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.050
imitating other people and not only the
people the people around us but of

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
people the people around us but of
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.429
people the people around us but of
course the people around us imitated the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
course the people around us imitated the
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.719
course the people around us imitated the
people who came before them and those

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729
people who came before them and those
 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640
people who came before them and those
people in MIT ated the people who came

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
people in MIT ated the people who came
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.130
people in MIT ated the people who came
before them and so on so far back that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
before them and so on so far back that
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.590
before them and so on so far back that
it's as far back as you can go and so

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
it's as far back as you can go and so
 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.200
it's as far back as you can go and so
you embody these patterns of behavior

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
you embody these patterns of behavior
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.359
you embody these patterns of behavior
that are extremely informative that you

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
that are extremely informative that you
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.370
that are extremely informative that you
don't understand that are a consequence

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380
don't understand that are a consequence
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.990
don't understand that are a consequence
of collective imitation across the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
of collective imitation across the
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.660
of collective imitation across the
centuries and so then those patterns can

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
centuries and so then those patterns can
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.999
centuries and so then those patterns can
become manifest as figures of the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
become manifest as figures of the
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.819
become manifest as figures of the
imagination and those figures of

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
imagination and those figures of
 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.399
imagination and those figures of
imagination are the distillation zuv

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409
imagination are the distillation zuv
 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.510
imagination are the distillation zuv
patterns of behavior and so as the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520
patterns of behavior and so as the
 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.370

it's culturally transmitted this content

it's culturally transmitted this content
that's evolved and so these figures of

that's evolved and so these figures of
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.569
that's evolved and so these figures of
the imagination can reveal the structure

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
the imagination can reveal the structure
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.480
the imagination can reveal the structure
of reality to you and that's what

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490
of reality to you and that's what
 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.920
of reality to you and that's what
happened with Jung and that's what he

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930
happened with Jung and that's what he
 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.420
happened with Jung and that's what he
described in the red book and that was

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
described in the red book and that was
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.619
described in the red book and that was
what permeated his psychology a

what permeated his psychology a
 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.520
what permeated his psychology a
