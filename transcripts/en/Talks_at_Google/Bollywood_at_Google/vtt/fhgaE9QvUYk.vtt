JOHNNY LEVER: Thank you, sir.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.550

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.830

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.580
So thank you very
much for coming here.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.850
As you can see, all
these people have

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.080
joined us to listen
to you, learn

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.050
about your life a
little bit, maybe

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.460
ask you some tough questions.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.440
So sir, let's get started here.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.310
So you've been a comedian
most of your life.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.672
Is comedy something
that you can learn ,

00:00:52.672 --> 00:00:54.380
or is it something
that you're born with,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.110
so either you're funny or not?

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.160
JOHNNY LEVER: [SPEAKING HINDI]

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.790
Born.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.248
MALE SPEAKER: You
are born with it.

00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:05.820
OK.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.390
JOHNNY LEVER: I think so,
because I was two years old,

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.850
and my mommy used to tell me
I used to copy my grandfather.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.730
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:01:44.162 --> 00:01:46.370
MALE SPEAKER: But sir, in
Bollywood these days, a lot

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.210
of actors are doing
comedy roles, right?

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.290
And at the same time,
there are comedians

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.690
such as yourself [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.660
So what is the difference
between a comedian and just

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.320
a lead actor who's doing
a comedy role as far as--

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.600
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.570
JOHNNY LEVER: Everybody
wants to do comedy.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.610
People want to laugh.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.164
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.380
Not only for comedian.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.745
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:02:52.275 --> 00:02:55.780
[APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER]

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.160
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.920
MALE SPEAKER: So you have
done more than 400 films

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.130
in your career in
Bollywood, and you've also

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.230
done many stage performances.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.070
Is there any star
or group of stars

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.940
that you enjoy
working with, that you

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.360
think is much easier to be funny
with some people versus others?

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.760
JOHNNY LEVER: I
enjoy with Govinda.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.400
I enjoy working with
Govinda, because--

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.850
[CHEERS]

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.516
MALE SPEAKER: Govinda
fans in the crowd.

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.470
JOHNNY LEVER: I worked
with him in many movies.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.600
Then Shah Rukh
Khan, Anil Kapoor.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.580
And I work with everyone--
Salman Khan, Akshay.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.970
I enjoy with them, but I enjoy
more with Govinda and Shah Rukh

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.950
Khan.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.755
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:03:49.755 --> 00:03:51.130
So at this point,
guys, if anyone

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.570
has questions in the crowd,
please raise your hand,

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.680
and there's a microphone there.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.730

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.710
and making people laugh?

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:08.490

Sir, these days,
actually, YouTube

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.870
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:25.780
Why don't you join

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.087
So Jamie, I am actually
very interested in knowing

00:38:35.087 --> 00:38:35.795
[SPEAKING HINDI].

00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:50.910
And more importantly,
[SPEAKING HINDI], or

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:54.740
did he let you fall
and learn on your own?

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:55.990
JAMIE LEVER: [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:57.360
I was in London at that point.

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.420
I was studying.

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.480
I was doing my post-graduation.

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:02.520
And [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.810
I was doing a couple of other
things also [SPEAKING HINDI] is

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:10.330
to watch a lot of things and is
to also do my little bit plays

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:11.920
[HINDI] on the side.

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.840
And while I was there, my
comedy show [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.340
And I just felt like,
you know, [HINDI].

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:22.250
I should be on that
stage, and I should

00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:23.950
have that mic in
my hand, and I know

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.556
that I can do a better job.

00:39:25.556 --> 00:39:26.570
Oops.

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:28.180
I know I can do a
better job of that.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:30.860
So [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:33.900
And then I just at that
time, [HINDI] father,

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:35.690
he just happened
to be in London.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:36.356
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:41.970
I want to do comedy.

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:43.470
And then he's like
[SPEAKING HINDI].

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:44.719
JOHNNY LEVER: [SPEAKING HINDI]

JAMIE LEVER: [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.960
I just wrote them
down. [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.171

[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:14.611
I'm just saying all this,
and then [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:41:14.611 --> 00:41:16.860
And people just stood up,
and they started applauding.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.567
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:41:18.567 --> 00:41:19.900
And then I started doing comedy.

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:21.720
JOHNNY LEVER: [SPEAKING HINDI]

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:28.890

You're seeing her grow in the

00:42:43.530 --> 00:42:45.800
JOHNNY LEVER: [SPEAKING HINDI]

00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:56.890
JAMIE LEVER: [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:04.550
And I thought [HINDI], my father
would tell me [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.390
Figure it out.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:18.487
[SPEAKING HINDI] newly
opened [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:43:18.487 --> 00:43:20.570
And I just called them,
and I said, you know what?

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:22.720
I'm a new comedian and
struggling and trying

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.360
to figure out, so can
I perform? [HINDI],

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.740
OK, we'll give you a slot.

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.800

liked me [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:43:31.867 --> 00:43:33.450
And then after that,
[SPEAKING HINDI].

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.800
I just went and secretly
gave my audition.

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:42.864
They really liked me.

00:43:42.864 --> 00:43:43.530

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:53.070
We need you on the show.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:56.890
And in fact, [SPEAKING HINDI].

00:43:56.890 --> 00:44:00.160

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:06.280

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:17.450
But they just came
[SPEAKING HINDI].

00:44:24.507 --> 00:44:26.090
And they were
interviewing me and all.

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:30.660

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:33.534
And we were talking.

00:44:33.534 --> 00:44:35.450

MALE SPEAKER: So Jamie, your
dad has an amazing legacy.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:51.320
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:53.676
How much pressure
does that put on you?

00:45:53.676 --> 00:45:56.300
JAMIE LEVER: It's a huge
responsibility, because [HINDI]

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.620
expect, and there's so
much competition today,

00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:00.120
so people expect a lot.

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.390
But the good thing is that he's
been in this field for so long,

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:05.300
and he's made so
many people laugh,

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:08.260
and people love him so much
that they've accepted me also

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.280
with the same love.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:12.180
And every time I come onstage,
they give me-- they smile,

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.280
and they applaud, so it
feels really special.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:15.030
I feel welcomed.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:19.090
I feel really happy
to be in this place.

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:23.260
But I know [SPEAKING HINDI],
I have to work really hard,

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:24.780
and there's a lot
of competition,

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.030
so I'm working on that.

00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:27.620
I'm just-- I keep preparing.

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:28.720
I keep studying.

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.160
I keep learning.

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.450
