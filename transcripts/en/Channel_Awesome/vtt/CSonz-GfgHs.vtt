00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.780
(intro music)

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.400
As most of you know, when you become a critic, you drink this magic juice that

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.680
immediately makes you smarter than everyone else.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.700
Once this liquid is consumed, you suddenly become a member of the Critic League.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.560
Meaning your opinion matters ninety percent more than that of the common riffraff.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.700
Your senses are hightened, your brain becomes bigger,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.440
and you miraculously know what's best for everyone in the world.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.320
This is the promise of the Tree of Life.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.180
We celebrate a day of peace~ (singing)

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.340
(wrong buzzer sound)

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.160
Alright, as many of you probably figured out, that's not how things work.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.280
Odd for me to say, I know, but the idea of critics is kind of a strange one.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.840
It's so often that we compare our thoughts to the critics,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.520
and probably more than once you've disagreed with them.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.580
You either liked something they hated, or hated something they liked.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.420
This usually forces people to fall into one of two categories.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.780
Someone that says, "Screw the critics! They don't speak for the people and are a bunch of stuck up egg heads."

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.100
Or the people that say, "Screw the masses! They wouldn't know art if the Mona Lisa kicked them in the balls."

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.420
But what you might be surprised at is films that are considered classics today,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.560
were not only seen as such by critics when they first came out.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.160
Did you know "Psycho", "The Shining", and "Fight Club" all got negative reviews when they first premiered?

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.660
These are movies people watch all the time.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.540
They're practically considered masterworks! Yet, very few critics liked them when they came to theaters.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.680
With that said, did you also know that

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.720
"Signs", "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", &amp; "Phantom Menace" all got positive reviews when they first came out?

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.360
Good lord, how can you trust anyone with these kinds of mindsets?

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.520
Part of what people forget though is that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.720
critics are just people,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.260
and like anyone they can be emotionally swayed.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.840
Hell, that's what movies are supposed to do, emotionally sway you.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.860
But how can audiences and critics differ so much?

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.860
Well, there's a few things to keep in mind:

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.060
One is, as a viewer, you can choose which movies you want to see.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.820
So if something looks bad, you can easily skip over it.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.820
Critics usually can't.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.560
They have to sit through a shit ton of movies, including the bad ones,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.200
and usually have to see ten times the amount

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.840
that normal people see.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.740
Seeing so many, so often can easily have an effect on how you view them.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.760
You notice more clichés, you pick up more of where the story is going to go mostly because you've seen it done,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.000
over and over and over.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.160
"Let her go!" (repeating)

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.640
Movies can get away with a lot of repeating though because they want to impress the mass majority,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.700
not the critics.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.900
So films can use the same tropes several times because it will take a mass audience

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.020
longer to catch onto it and get bored by it because... well, they don't see movies as much as critics do.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.700
"I should have killed you when I had the chance" (repeating)

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.000
With that said, because critics see movies so much, they might be able to pick up on certain techniques

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
that are impressive to them but... not the usual movie goer.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.920
"Birdman" was a hit with critics for different reasons than it might be with audiences.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.040
The film is set up to look like one continuous shot,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.120
which many audiences wouldn't catch onto.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.580
A critic might be marveling at all the effort that had to into making it look like one shot with no edits,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.300
Where the everyday viewer might just notice that things look and flow a little different that usual,

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.980
even if they don't know why.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.380
In both cases, it worked to the films advantage,

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.160
as it was so strange and dream-like for both audiences, and critics, both loved it.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:22.760
In some respects,

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.820
that's true for "The Phantom Menace" as well.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.240
It's a bad film, especially when compared to it's predecessors. But critics liked it when it first came out

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.320
because they thought the technology and visuals were breathtaking.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.120
And at the time, they kind of were.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.060
Now, we can see the computers are overused, but back then we never saw a film that just surrounded itself in

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.300
so much of that technology, at least not to this extent.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.960
And all given the same things the critics has to see over and over, yeah, this would be a little refreshing.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.140
But many people were upset that they couldn't connect with the story or characters.

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.400
At least, they eventually said that.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.200
Many people were so sucked in by the hype that for a long time they convinced themselves that they liked it,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.180
Even though, later, they come around admitting that they really don't.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.520
Critics can be the same way.

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.220
Audiences forget that because critics are people, they as well can be emotional,

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.560
and they can get sucked into the hype-train as well.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.060
So, the idea that critics are always going to be right, doesn't make the most logical sense.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.800
But wait a minute, isn't that one of the reasons we have critics? To see past all the emotion and focus

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.560
on the stuff that's gonna be timeless?

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:24.500
Yes and no.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.280
Movies are all about giving you an emotional experience,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.140
and that's gonna be different for everybody,

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.980
especially over time.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.220
Films like "Forrest Gump", "American Beauty" and "Saving Private Ryan" were seen as heart felt powerhouses.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.900
But nowadays, they might be seen as corny, clichéd and even kind of inappropriate.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:47.120
Each film though, touched on something that was relevant at the time.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.460
It made a connection with the mass public in a way people's emotions wanted to experience them then.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.260
This includes critics mindset at that time period as well.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.640
But there are films that everyone can agree, just aren't for critics.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.080
Movies like "Ace Ventura", "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and "Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas" were all panned by critics.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.780
But it's pretty obvious they weren't
made to be liked by them.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.420
"Ace Ventura" worked on an immature level that spoke to the inner silliness of most kids.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.700
"Ninja Turtles" was great for fans of the cartoon but was just too damn ridiculous to grab someone

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.160
looking to be challenged.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.100
And "Fear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas", by design, is meant to not be liked and keep you in a raunchy

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.949
and uncomfortable place.

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:33.309
These films hit their specific audiences perfectly where any other rational human being with

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:36.289
little context would see them as insane ravings.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.540
If anything, we'd be more concerned if critics DID like these movies.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:46.200
But that makes it even stranger/kind of enjoyable when they like something you wouldn't think they would like.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.240
Did you know that "Beavis and Butt-head do America" actually got good reviews?

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.620
In fact it came out the same weekend as a drama called "Ghosts of Mississippi",

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:01.280
With gigantic actors involved. But critics said it was melodramatic and trying too hard to be an Oscar grab.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:08.060
Meaning that the movie usually loved by critics was being beaten out by the one usually despised by critics.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:15.480
It was so weird to see this dramatic true story about race being beaten out by "Beavis &amp; Butt-head Do America"!

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:21.460
"I was taken with their adolescent awkwardness, vibrato, and vulnerability therefore, a modest recommendation

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:23.539
of 'Beavis and Butt-Head' do America for me."

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.399
"I recommend it too, I enjoyed it a lot."

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.460
But that's not the only one, films like "There's Something About Mary", "The Mask" and even the most obvious

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:36.080
commercial with "The Lego Movie", all got good reviews. These are films many would guess critics

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.430
wouldn't like for being too lowbrow, but something extended beyond the normal

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.469
boring rubble and connected with their
inner immaturity. They were just too

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:48.129
charming and, in their own way, too smart to turn down.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.880
But even I, as a critic, have to acknowledge that there's a lot of enjoyable films with bad reviews

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.649
that I just don't understand.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:00.180
Why was "Hook" hated by critics? I can understand it having problems and not fully enjoying it,

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.340
but this movie was slammed.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.420
Comedies like UHF seemed harmless enough, but the critics railroaded it like nobody's business!

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.360
Weird Al even asked if he ran over all
the critics' dogs, he couldn't believe the harshness.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:17.460
They can even seem inconsistent, like critics really enjoyed the first "Rush Hour" film but hated the sequels

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.920
cause they said Chris Tucker was too
loud and talked too much.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.000
Did you see the first film?!

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.760
And don't get me wrong, I can totally understand not liking these movies, but claiming the others are doing

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.380
something that the first one wasn't,
when it so clearly was?

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.820
This is just confusing.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.840
And then there's ones you'd swear they're picking on just because they feel they're supposed to as critics.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.040
I know tons of people that watch the "Hotel Transylvania" movies every Halloween.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:50.220
But because it's an Adam Sandler comedy with immature humor, it's almost like they feel obligated

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.980
that they have to give it a negative review,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.580
Even if it's totally fine.

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.280
A slapstick starring a little kid?
Well, gotta hate that on arrival!

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.940
Oh! It's a Christmas classic now? Well, uhm...
you were all brainwashed!

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.920
Rightfully so, nobody controls your opinions but yourself, but if that's the case,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.120
why do we even have critics?

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.440
Do they even have a purpose? Couldn't
we just get rid of them all?

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.110
Not so fast, destructive hand of God. I
have a point.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.700
Critics in many respects are not only
supposed to cover an event,

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.200
I mean, they are journalists and films can be events,

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.220
But they're supposed to offer a point of view that you've never considered before.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.800
Would you get angry at someone for writing a philosophy on life even it's different from yours?

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.640
It's not just something you're supposed to blindly agree with,

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.670
but it's something that's supposed to give you a piece of mind.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.440
Movies are essentially art-a reflection of life in unique and entertaining ways.

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.180
A critic is supposed to help you explore it in a way that maybe you haven't before.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:53.180
Someone can watch "Animal Farm" and like it fine, just seeing it as a story about a bunch of animals that rise

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.400
up against the human owners.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:59.280
But when you're told the whole story is symbolic of Russian Communism and the rise of Stalin,

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.900
You can suddenly experience it from a completely different level and enjoy it in a whole new way.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.020
Critics are also not just one big entity.
It's like saying the Internet is one person.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.860
Hell, if it was, it'd be one emotionally drunk asshole.

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:17.760
It's a lot of people with a lot of opinions and while many of them do follow certain patterns for the reasons

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.300
I listed earlier, everybody is different.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.780
It's all subjective so nobody can really be wrong.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.960
If you like "Ace Ventura", go ahead and like it.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.400
If you hate "Saving Private Ryan", go ahead and hate it.

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.840
The important thing is how well
you share and communicate.

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:34.780
That's what makes you a stronger human being.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:39.160
And that's what a good critic should do: Teach you how to communicate better,

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.160
not agree, but convey.

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.340
There's been plenty of times I disagree
with critics, audiences, or both.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.160
I sure don't understand why everybody likes the live-action Jungle Book,

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:53.180
But I also really enjoyed the movie Ender's Game, despite that being hated by everybody.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.220
My thoughts are gonna be different from your thoughts and chances are it's gonna happen a lot.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:58.440
But that's good.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.140
Share your thoughts, compare them.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.000
Don't let anyone say there's a right way or wrong way to enjoy something,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.280
because there is no right way or wrong way.

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:10.660
This is one of the reasons film has lasted for so long because it speaks to everybody differently.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.480
It's not science, it's not mathematics,

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.060
it always has been what you allow it to be.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.640
So figure out what speaks to you, why it speaks to you, and best of all,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.520
how you can share it with others who might have a similar or completely different experience.

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.700
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:37.200

Hello, Doug Walker here doing the charity shout-out.
I think a lot of you know this charity,

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.520
but if you don't, you're about to see some very awesome people.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:37.060
This is the World Wildlife Fund. For fifty years, they've been protecting the future of nature.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.160
Being the world's leading conservation organization, they work in a hundred countries and are supported

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.540
by 1.2 million members in the United States, and close to 5 million globally.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.780
Their unique way of working combines global reach with a foundation in science,

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:58.420
involving action at every level from local to global and ensures the delivery of innovative solutions

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:06.460
that meet the needs both people and nature. From forests, to oceans, to wildlife, to food, to fresh water, to climate.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.120
There isn't anything they don't try to protect.

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.420
Take a look at their site or their YouTube channel and see all you can do to keep their cause strong.
