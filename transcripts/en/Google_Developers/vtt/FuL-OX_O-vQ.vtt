MANOMARKS: Hi.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.820
I'm ManoMarks, developer
advocate on the Google Maps API

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.650
team.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.280
This is the first video in a
series of four videos designed

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.612
to get you started with the
Google Maps JavaScript API.

00:00:19.612 --> 00:00:21.070
At the end of this
series, you will

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.670
have a fully functional
Google Map in your app.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.110
In this series, we will cover
creating your first map,

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.580
getting an API key,
loading the maps API,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.270
and we'll walk through the code.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.100
This video will show you how
to create your first map.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.230
You'll need a web browser, an
internet connection, and a text

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.420
editor.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.250
Many people use Text
Edit or Notepad.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.850
In this episode, I'll
use Sublime Text 2.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.790
First, put your browser to the
Google Maps API sample code.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.760
You can do that by clicking
on the annotation here.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.120
You see a page with the
map centered in Australia.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.090
Click on the JavaScript
plus HTML tab,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.550
and then select
and copy the code.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.170
Open your text editor
and paste the text.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.660
Now save the file somewhere as
an HTML file with the extension

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:12.890
.html.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.260
For testing purposes,
I'm always lazy

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.080
and save to the desktop, where
I know I'll find it later.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.650
Double click on the file
to open it in a browser.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.501
You should see your map
as a tab in your browser.

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:27.000
OK.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.576
Let's customize this by
changing the start location.

00:01:30.576 --> 00:01:32.780
What we want to do
is change the center

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.590
of the map and the zoom bubble.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.090
First, let's choose a latitude
and longitude pair to use.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.240
You can use any
latitude longitude pair

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.160
in decimal form
for this purpose.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.840
I'm going to use 0, 0.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.340
OK.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.250
Now say it and go back
to the web browser,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.070
and reload the page.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.470
You should see a map like this.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.520
Pretty much all water.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.470
What we've done is chosen a spot
off the West Coast of Africa.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.380
We zoomed in too
far to see anything.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.830
So go back to the text editor
and change the zoom parameter

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.490
from eight to six.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.410
Now reload the page,

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.720
You'll see that you're
zoomed farther out.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.320
In the Google Maps
API, lower zoom levels

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.095
are farther away from the
map, while higher zoom

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:16.420
levels are closer.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.120
So level zero shows the map
of the Earth fully zoomed out.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.680
Zoom level 19 will show a map
with streets and buildings.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.520
OK.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.250
You've made your first map.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.160
In the next video, I'll show
you how to create an API key.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.570
Using an API key enables you to
monitor your application's maps

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.780
API usage, and ensures
that Google can contact you

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.430
about your application
if necessary.
