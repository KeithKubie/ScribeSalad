00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.089
Sunday!

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:02.089
Sunday!

00:00:02.089 --> 00:00:03.089
Sunday!

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:04.290
Watch Molly take on Putsie in the epic Battle
of the Baboons!

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.410
We'll sell you the whole seat, but you'll
only need the edge!

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.530
Hey fellow primates, it’s Natalia for DNews!

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.699
You’ve probably heard of alpha males...fighting
tooth and nail for dominance in their group,

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.230
but did you know that alpha females also exist?

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.180
At the Toronto Zoo a group of female olive
baboons have been embroiled in their own ‘Game

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.300
of Baboons’.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.160
It began over a year ago with the death of
Boss Lady, the alpha female.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.910
Her 16-year old daughter Betty took over the
position of alpha female.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.280
But also soon died of natural causes.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.480
The next in line to be alpha female was Betty’s
daughter, Molly, much to the chagrin of an

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.579
older female named Putsie who, at 18, is three
times Molly’s age.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.579
And so the fighting for power began!

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.780
The struggle for the throne turned violent
and has resulted in six of the twelve female

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.489
baboons suffering from minor to severe lacerations;
some so serious they required surgery.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.670
Zookeepers closed the exhibit temporarily
because they were afraid the public, unaware

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.770
of baboon politics and behavior, would be
concerned for the animals’ safety.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.329
So how does this work?

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.149
Olive baboons live in matrilineal matrilocal
groups which means females stay in the group

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.380
as they mature, while males leave to join
a new group.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.140
Unlike males who fight for dominance, females
inherit their social status from their mothers,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.810
much like a monarchy.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.100
Therefore if you are the oldest daughter born
to an alpha female olive baboon and she dies,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.560
then -voila- you become alpha female!

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.709
Currently both females share the throne, as
it appears they have come to a truce.

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.680
Molly, researchers surmise, is most likely
waiting for ol’ Putsie’s imminent demise

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.490
so she can assume ALL the power.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.701
It’s like Mean Girls meets Game of Thrones
meets Big Baboon House.

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:38.701
It would be interesting to see how this battle
has affected the stress levels of these badass

00:01:38.701 --> 00:01:39.701
baboon broads.

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:42.579
In one study, researchers found that the lowest
ranked males showed relatively high amounts

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:43.579
of stress.

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.509
Although another study discovered that alpha
males also suffer from high levels of stress

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:49.749
when the there was instability in the group.

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:53.189
In the case of the male baboons, they do not
inherit their social status and therefore

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.810
have to continually fight to remain on top
or strive to get to the top from the bottom,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.679
so higher stress levels make sense.

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.240
So, perhaps it’s not always good to be the
king?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.959
The same long-term study that discovered that
low ranking males suffered from high levels

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.849
of stress also yielded other fascinating finds
about the plasticity of baboon behavior.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.900
The study was conducted by Stanford primatologist
and neurologist Robert Saplosky, which he

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.290
chronicled in his book “A Primate’s Memoir”.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.959
Sapolsky followed a troop of 62 olive baboons
over several seasons in Kenya affectionately

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.709
called the Forest Troop.

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.510
The group endured great losses after its dominant
males ate tainted meat.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.599
And so, one by one, the belligerent baboon
bullies died out leaving a group of mild-mannered

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:36.430
baboons The result was surprising - instead
of fighting to rebuild the baboon hierarchy,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.680
the remainder of the troop were even-tempered.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.239
And the troop has stayed that way for more
than two decades, with newcomer males quickly

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.030
taught the unusually genial ways of the troop.

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.680
For baboons- a species with deeply rooted
hierarchical social structure, this is quite

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.829
surprising.

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.930
This study supports the idea that social behavior
is not transmitted biologically, but learned

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.790
and shared through example and teaching, i.e.
behavior is strongly influenced by culture.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.230
Similarly, Molly and Putsie’s uncommon truce
is also a unique example of how flexible baboon

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.420
behavior can be.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.692
In the case of Toronto’s battling alpha
females, it’s unclear how this will all

00:03:10.692 --> 00:03:12.460
finally work itself out.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.120
Perhaps Putsie and Molly will continue to
reign in peace, or maybe another coup will

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.120
erupt.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.620
And if Putsie is the female instigating the
violence, maybe this brutal behavior will

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.849
die out when she finally expires.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.060
Regardless, the Toronto zoo has no plans to
intervene, they want them to work it out on

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:56.890
their own.
