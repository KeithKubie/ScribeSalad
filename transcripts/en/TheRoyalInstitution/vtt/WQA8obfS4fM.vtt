00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.520
Humans have a range of emotions.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.020
Some, like happiness, seem to be innate,

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.280
but others, like disgust, are learnt from
experience.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:17.250
In this activity you and your kids will try
to 'unlearn' something that disgusts you.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:36.440
Alright, today, we're going to be doing an
activity all about emotions.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.000
So I'm going to show you some pictures of
people's faces,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.600
and I want you tell me what emotion you think
they're having.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.320
So what emotion do you think he's having?

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.320
Angry.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.330
And why do you think he's angry?

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.060
Because of the way he's putting his face,
like...

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.390
And what things make you angry?

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.820
When my sister touches my stuff that I don't
want her to touch.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.330
Okay! What about this one?

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:01.330
Happy!

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.330
And why do you think he's happy?

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.850
Because he's smiling and his eyes are shut.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.710
And what makes you happy?

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.760
Chocolate.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.530
Chocolate is nice...

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.760
I've got another one to show you, but just
before, I am a bit hungry...

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.290
Disgusting! Eww!

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.860
Do you want to touch it?

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.860
No!

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.070
Give it a little touch...

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.300
No!

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:27.010
That's a sausage...

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.010
It's quite nice!

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.120
It looks like a sausage.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:38.940
Do you wanna bite some? Have a little bit,
have a little bit, have a little bit!

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.090
So, you wouldn't eat that?

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.810
What about... this?

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.810
Yes!

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.660
And what's the differences between those?

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.479
That is nice and that is disgusting.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.760
One is poo so it has already been digested,
and this one hasn't.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.760
Raisins, biscuits, chocolate...

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.280
What can you see in there?

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.170
I can see biscuit crumbs, and that's the chocolate
and raisins.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:18.129
So we're gonna have a go and see if we can
make this stuff look like this.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.120
Okay!

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.770
Experience has taught us that nappies don't
contain anything good, let alone delicious.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.770
Experience has taught us that nappies don’t
contain anything good,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:28.770
let alone delicious.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.390
So when confronted with an open nappy,

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.560
and someone willing to eat it’s contents,
we feel disgusted.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.620
However, when Sahara makes her own poo,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.680
she should become confident in its edible
qualities,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.409
losing the sense of disgust she felt before.

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.189
It’s really simple to make these at home.

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.049
All you have to do is chop up some chocolate
bars and place them in a bowl.

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.269
And then carefully crush up some biscuits,

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:58.769
placing them inside a bag helps control the
mess.

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.860
Next add some golden syrup into the bowl.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:10.430
Then put the bowl in the microwave for 30
seconds at a time,

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.510
Stirring until melted.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.530
Okay! So I'm gonna give it the first stir...

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.859
After this add in crushed biscuits and dried
fruit, if you like.

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:32.449
Then give the whole thing a good stir.

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:37.269
When cool enough to handle, mould your mix
into a classic sausage shape,

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.939
or your preferred poo style.

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:46.540
For maximum disgust we find serving on some
toilet paper or a nappy really helps!

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.180
(We recommend using a clean one though…)

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.150
Sahara’s willingness to handle the mixture

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.089
is already a sign of her diminishing sense
of disgust for this stuff.

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.480
The more she handles it the more familiar
she will be.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.059
This is because disgust feels like a natural
response it has to be learnt.

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.069
After carrying out the activity,

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:17.819
Sahara has taught herself that the fake poo
is actually made from delicious chocolate.

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:20.730
So what makes it change?

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.740
What makes it change is that we've made it
now,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.909
so now I know what it's actually made of,
and I'm not disgusted by it any more.

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.759
I know it's made of chocolate and biscuits
and stuff,

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:35.759
instead of poo.

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:40.229
It teaches you the difference between different
emotions,

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.710
like you're emotions can change very easily.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.360
And it's not very hard to change our emotions.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.020
Would you like to have a go showing it to
someone else?

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.020
Yeah!

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.220
Shall we get your sister over?

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.090
After completing the activity it can be fun

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.460
to get your kids to show these fake poos to
someone who hasn’t seen them

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.539
So they can see for themselves the differences
in emotional response!

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:10.780
No! No! No!

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.500
Me and Sahara had a lot of fun doing this
activity today.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.569
It was quite interesting for me to see Sahara
thinking about emotions

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:22.909
and how they can change,

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:26.669
and how different information can affect the
emotions you feel.

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.139
Now if you'd like to have a go doing this
activity,

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.190
you can download some infosheets on the Ri
website,

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:51.219
and don't forget to like and subscribe!
