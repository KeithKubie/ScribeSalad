in there to kind of distribute the
 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.420
in there to kind of distribute the
weight a little bit and give it a little

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430
weight a little bit and give it a little
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.520
weight a little bit and give it a little
bit more weight to it a little bit more

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530

take it apart and
glue those on the inside so we're just

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620
glue those on the inside so we're just
 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.140
glue those on the inside so we're just
going to know my name's mr. some screws

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
going to know my name's mr. some screws
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.120
going to know my name's mr. some screws
already so guess that of the process of

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
already so guess that of the process of
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.220
already so guess that of the process of
taking it apart alright so I have my two

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230
taking it apart alright so I have my two
 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.440
taking it apart alright so I have my two
halves which was actually kind of more

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450
halves which was actually kind of more
 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.060
halves which was actually kind of more
of a panic than I thought it was going

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070
of a panic than I thought it was going
 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.240
of a panic than I thought it was going
to be I took all the screws out but it

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250

of adhesive in certain areas to kind of

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140
of adhesive in certain areas to kind of
 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.020
of adhesive in certain areas to kind of
hold it together yeah so just be careful

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030
hold it together yeah so just be careful
 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.030

I'm just going to be taking I have a
 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.650
I'm just going to be taking I have a
couple pieces of threaded rod and some

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660
couple pieces of threaded rod and some
 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.690
couple pieces of threaded rod and some
nuts here that I'm just going to be

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700
nuts here that I'm just going to be
 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:11.460
nuts here that I'm just going to be
placing into the gun and we'll glue that

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470
placing into the gun and we'll glue that
 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.280
placing into the gun and we'll glue that
into place and then put that on and then

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290
into place and then put that on and then
 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.260
into place and then put that on and then
let you give it some weight again this

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270
let you give it some weight again this
 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.840

is purely up to use as an extra step

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850
is purely up to use as an extra step
 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.600

don't care if it what light weight or
 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.180
don't care if it what light weight or
anything like that then by all means

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190
anything like that then by all means
 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.560
anything like that then by all means
don't bother take it apart because it

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
don't bother take it apart because it
 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.000
don't bother take it apart because it
was more of a pain in the neck then

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010
was more of a pain in the neck then
 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.520
was more of a pain in the neck then
probably shows us so I noticed on the

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530
probably shows us so I noticed on the
 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.660
probably shows us so I noticed on the

holes or some fluting like on the side
 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.960
holes or some fluting like on the side
here on the top and bottom there are

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970
here on the top and bottom there are
 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.990
here on the top and bottom there are
five little detailed kind of holes

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000
five little detailed kind of holes
 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.550
five little detailed kind of holes
whatever I'm going to go ahead and draw

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560
whatever I'm going to go ahead and draw
 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.890
whatever I'm going to go ahead and draw
it on here and drill the holes out and

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900
it on here and drill the holes out and
 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.860
it on here and drill the holes out and
kind of probably using my rotary tool or

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870
kind of probably using my rotary tool or
 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.700
kind of probably using my rotary tool or
some files kind of make those little

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710
some files kind of make those little
 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.260
some files kind of make those little
details on there and put a piece of

keep kind of working it with your thumb

something soft you can really kind of
 

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:25.490

work out all those little creases and

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:25.500
work out all those little creases and
 

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:28.699
work out all those little creases and
stuff like that yeah I dusted the the

00:15:28.699 --> 00:15:28.709
stuff like that yeah I dusted the the
 

00:15:28.709 --> 00:15:31.699
stuff like that yeah I dusted the the
tip with a bit of a nickel which kind of

00:15:31.699 --> 00:15:31.709
tip with a bit of a nickel which kind of
 

00:15:31.709 --> 00:15:34.610
tip with a bit of a nickel which kind of
gives it a nice variance there it kind

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:34.620
gives it a nice variance there it kind
 

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:37.699
gives it a nice variance there it kind
of dulls the tip and I think then if we

00:15:37.699 --> 00:15:37.709
of dulls the tip and I think then if we
 

00:15:37.709 --> 00:15:40.970
of dulls the tip and I think then if we
do a little bit of dry brushing to kind

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:40.980
do a little bit of dry brushing to kind
 

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.800
do a little bit of dry brushing to kind
of blew it maybe just a little bit on

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:45.170

so if you're good at airbrushing you
 

00:16:14.939 --> 00:16:17.479

tint of the blue thing on how the light

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:37.439
tint of the blue thing on how the light
 

00:16:37.439 --> 00:16:42.319

hits it and depending on how dark you

00:16:42.319 --> 00:16:42.329
hits it and depending on how dark you
 

00:16:42.329 --> 00:16:47.649
hits it and depending on how dark you
want to go just add the blue and then

00:16:47.649 --> 00:16:47.659
want to go just add the blue and then
 

00:16:47.659 --> 00:16:55.989
want to go just add the blue and then
wipe it off leaving kind of like an edge

00:16:55.989 --> 00:16:55.999
wipe it off leaving kind of like an edge
 

00:16:55.999 --> 00:16:59.509
wipe it off leaving kind of like an edge
there along the side there so that is

00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519
there along the side there so that is
 

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:03.529
there along the side there so that is
like bluer kind of further in you go and

00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:03.539
like bluer kind of further in you go and
 

00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:07.179
like bluer kind of further in you go and
then the edge here is still very

00:17:07.179 --> 00:17:07.189
then the edge here is still very
 

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:10.759

it's burning the further down it goes

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:14.990
