00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:05.005
( intro music )

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.844
( muffled radio noises )

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:15.415
( swooshing sound )

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.220
( electronic hum )

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.158
( audience applause )

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.561
Dr. Kevin Hand: Thank you.

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.996
Thank you.

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:37.203 line:0%
The question of whether or
not life exists beyond Earth

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:41.841 line:0%
is one of humanity's
oldest, and I would argue,

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:46.846 line:0%
most profound, and yet
unanswered, questions.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:52.885
And the search for
life beyond Earth

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:59.859
is, in part, the story of
this lonely little planet

00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:05.999
reaching out into
our solar system,

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:10.302 line:0%
searching for possible
signs of life elsewhere.

00:01:10.302 --> 00:01:12.405 line:0%
We've been undertaking
this exploration

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.708 line:0%
for just over 50 years now.

00:01:15.708 --> 00:01:19.445 line:0%
And through that
exploration we've just begun

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:24.116
to understand not only
which worlds out there

00:01:24.116 --> 00:01:28.621
might be habitable,
but we've also begun

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.758
to better characterize
how our own planet

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:37.229
sets bounds on habitability
for life as we know it.

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.899
What I'd like to focus in
on are some of the worlds

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.969
that we've come to appreciate

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.771
just within the
past 10 to 20 years,

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:50.776
which on the surface
you might not expect

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:52.444
that these are habitable worlds,

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:56.815
but when you get to understand
what's going on inside,

00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:58.784
it turns out that these worlds,

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:02.054
worlds like Europa,
Ganymede, Callisto,

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:07.192
Titan, Enceladus, and even
Neptune's curious moon Triton,

00:02:07.192 --> 00:02:09.929
these are the worlds
that I like to refer to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.732
as the ocean worlds
of our solar system.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:15.701
Shown here of course at
the center is the Earth,

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:19.105
the ocean world that we
know and love the most.

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:22.575
But around the Earth I've
placed these icy worlds

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:26.712
of the outer solar system,
moons that are covered with ice,

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.948
yet beneath their icy shells,

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.283
we have very good
reason to believe that

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:38.491
vast potentially global
liquid water reservoirs exist.

00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.626
These ocean worlds of
the outer solar system

00:02:40.626 --> 00:02:42.795
are really transforming
our understanding

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:45.965
of what it means for
a world to be habitable.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:49.102
In the early days of astronomy
and planetary science,

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.336
we had this sort of

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:52.604
"Goldilocks" scenario
for habitability.

00:02:52.604 --> 00:02:55.474
The Venus, Earth, Mars system

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:59.211
defined what it meant for
a planet to be habitable.

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:01.213
In order for a world
to be habitable,

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:03.215
you had to have a nice
liquid water ocean

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:07.086
on the surface, in contact
with an atmosphere.

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:10.089
In order for that
condition to be satisfied,

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.392
your world needed to be
at just the right distance

00:03:13.392 --> 00:03:16.662
from the parent star,
in our case, the Sun,

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:19.732
such that you had enough
energy from your parent star

00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:23.602
to maintain that liquid
water ocean on the surface.

00:03:23.602 --> 00:03:26.338
If you were Venus, you were
too close, and you got too hot.

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:27.840
If you were Mars, you
were too far away,

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.108
and you were too cold,

00:03:29.108 --> 00:03:31.443
but if you were the
Earth's sun distance,

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:33.212
you were right at
that "Goldilocks"

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:36.849
sweet spot for habitability.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.952
But these moons of the
outer solar system,

00:03:39.952 --> 00:03:43.423
they're giving us a
sort of new Goldilocks.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:46.225
At no place is this
better exemplified

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:49.595
than at the Jovian system,

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:52.899
where Io, shown here,

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:54.933
kind of takes the
place of Venus.

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:59.371
Io is the most volcanically
active body in the solar system.

00:03:59.371 --> 00:04:01.006
What you're seeing in the inset,

00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:03.509
in the upper part of Io there,

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:07.780
is a volcanic plume, a volcanic
eruption occurring on Io.

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:12.985
Io is more volcanically
active than the Earth.

00:04:12.985 --> 00:04:18.023
There are likely volcanoes
erupting on Io right now.

00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:20.826
Io is so volcanically active,

00:04:20.826 --> 00:04:22.461
not because it's got
energy from the Sun.

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:23.830
It's so volcanically active

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.498
because of the
tidal tug and pull

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:29.835
that it experiences
as it orbits Jupiter,

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:35.141
which is some 318 times
as massive as the Earth.

00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:38.477
In the Jovian system we
have this new Goldilocks,

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:43.782
where maintaining liquid
water is made possible

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:47.186 line:0%
not by energy from
your parent star,

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:51.023
but instead it's
maintained largely by

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:54.526
the tidal tug and pull,
the mechanical energy

00:04:54.526 --> 00:04:58.431
of these moons getting
flexed and stretched

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:00.565
as they orbit
Jupiter, and Saturn

00:05:00.565 --> 00:05:02.034
and Neptune, Uranus, possibly.

00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:05.537
In the Jovian system
we've got this new Goldilocks,

00:05:05.537 --> 00:05:08.074
where Io is kind of like Venus.

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:10.843
In the early days, Io
may have had some water,

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:13.112
but now it's lost any
water that it once had.

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.914
It's too tidally active.

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:17.816
All the yellows, the reds,
the whites that you see,

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:20.853
that's all from these
volcanic eruptions.

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:23.055
Callisto, at the outer end,

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:25.925
though we think Callisto
does have an ocean,

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:30.595
Callisto's ocean is overlain
by a very thick ice shell.

00:05:30.595 --> 00:05:32.798
That ice shell is also very old,

00:05:32.798 --> 00:05:35.000
as evidenced by all
those little pock marks

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.269
on Callisto's surface.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:38.303
Those are impact craters,

00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:39.872
which to a planetary scientist,

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.974
indicates old age.

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:45.244
But in the middle we've
got Europa and Ganymede.

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:48.614
Europa in particular
we think may occupy

00:05:48.614 --> 00:05:51.717
this new sweet spot of
the new Goldilocks zone,

00:05:51.717 --> 00:05:53.986
where it's got just
the right amount

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:56.922
of tidal energy
dissipation to sustain

00:05:56.922 --> 00:06:01.460
this liquid water ocean in
contact with a rocky seafloor

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.696
so that it can have
the elements and energy

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:07.233
needed for life, and it's
overlain by an ice shell

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:10.169
that is maybe a few to
as much as 10 or 15 or so

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:11.670
kilometers in thickness.

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.274
An ice shell that
maybe provides a window

00:06:15.274 --> 00:06:18.577
into the subsurface ocean.

00:06:18.577 --> 00:06:19.911
These ocean worlds of course,

00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.713
from an astrobiology standpoint,

00:06:21.713 --> 00:06:23.816
from a search-for-life-elsewhere
standpoint,

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:26.485
are so compelling because
if we've learned anything

00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:28.220
about life on Earth, it's that

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.889
where you find the liquid water,

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.657
you generally find life.

00:06:31.657 --> 00:06:33.959
From life
in extreme environments,

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:36.796
like hydrothermal vents,

00:06:36.796 --> 00:06:39.465
hot springs in the rift
valleys, to Antarctica,

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:41.133
from life in extreme
environments,

00:06:41.133 --> 00:06:43.703
to life of extreme lifestyles.

00:06:43.703 --> 00:06:46.338
(audience laughter)

00:06:46.338 --> 00:06:49.642
All life on Earth
depends on liquid water.

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:52.511
But I like to show this
image for another reason,

00:06:52.511 --> 00:06:54.413
and that is that part
of the motivation,

00:06:54.413 --> 00:06:57.549
part of what
underlines my passion

00:06:57.549 --> 00:06:59.718
for exploring these worlds,

00:06:59.718 --> 00:07:03.389
is that for all of the
diversity of life on Earth,

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:06.993
from the craziest of
microbe in the deep ocean,

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:10.662
to the most bizarre of
rock stars on the surface,

00:07:10.662 --> 00:07:13.265
all life on Earth is connected

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:16.135
by the same tree of life.

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:18.504
All of life on
Earth as we know it

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:21.540
is connected by the
DNA, RNA, protein

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.911
and even ATP paradigm,
for how life works.

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:25.877
I want to know,

00:07:25.877 --> 00:07:28.314
is there a different
biochemistry out there?

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:29.315
Is there a different way

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:31.250
to get the business of life
done?

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.518
Is there a place
in our solar system

00:07:33.518 --> 00:07:36.755
where life has
originated independent

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:38.357
from life here on Earth?

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:40.459
Is there a second
origin out there?

00:07:40.459 --> 00:07:43.396
I think these ocean worlds
of the outer solar system

00:07:43.396 --> 00:07:45.397
are the prime places to go

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:47.533
and potentially
answer this question.

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:49.734
Europa, Enceladus, Titan,

00:07:49.734 --> 00:07:52.071
all these moons are so fantastic

00:07:52.071 --> 00:07:54.072
in the context of
trying to answer

00:07:54.072 --> 00:07:57.610
this very primordial question.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.213
So what's next?

00:08:00.213 --> 00:08:06.218
I'll begin with a little
bit of my dream of dreams.

00:08:06.218 --> 00:08:12.190 line:0%
In my dream of dreams, we
send a highly capable lander,

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:15.560 line:0%
to navigate to the
surface of Europa.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.396 line:0%
This would have to be
engineered such that

00:08:18.396 --> 00:08:22.001 line:0%
it could negotiate the canyons

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:24.169 line:0%
and the cliffs of Europa,

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.505 line:0%
find some spot on the surface

00:08:26.505 --> 00:08:30.308 line:0%
where there are no
icy rocks or boulders,

00:08:30.308 --> 00:08:35.848 line:0%
put down the lander safely,
and then deploy a melt probe.

00:08:35.848 --> 00:08:38.683 line:0%
This melt probe would
then have a heat source

00:08:38.683 --> 00:08:42.421 line:0%
that allows it to go
through this ice shell,

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:46.958 line:0%
penetrating through the
many kilometers of ice,

00:08:46.958 --> 00:08:50.228 line:0%
eventually reaching
down to the ocean below.

00:08:50.228 --> 00:08:53.065 line:0%
After that it
deploys the nose cone,

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:56.735 line:0%
and an autonomous
underwater vehicle

00:08:56.735 --> 00:08:59.304 line:0%
now navigates the ocean.

00:08:59.304 --> 00:09:01.573 line:0%
There's no joysticking
this from JPL,

00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:03.576 line:0%
( audience laughter )
so this little guy's

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:05.177 line:0%
got to figure out its way

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:06.345 line:0%
to the bottom of the ocean,

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:08.447 line:0%
and in at least this
Hollywood version,

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:10.416 line:0%
this is an excerpt from
"Aliens of the Deep,"

00:09:10.416 --> 00:09:12.184 line:0%
an IMAX film I
was involved with,

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:14.120 line:0%
in this Hollywood version,
in the dream of dreams,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.489 line:0%
we make contact with these
charismatic macrofauna,

00:09:17.489 --> 00:09:20.159 line:0%
( audience laughter )
that ...

00:09:21.694 --> 00:09:25.030 line:0%
( laughs )
That's not real, sadly.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:27.867
As I mentioned, this
is my dream of dreams.

00:09:29.167 --> 00:09:32.238
Scaling back from that,
we are at the shores

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:36.008
of getting ready to
hopefully set sail

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:38.544
with new missions to
worlds like Europa,

00:09:38.544 --> 00:09:42.081
sending missions
that will fly by,

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.116
look at the surface,
take pictures,

00:09:44.116 --> 00:09:47.086
make chemical analyses,
and possibly even

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:50.789
use special radar
to see the interface

00:09:50.789 --> 00:09:52.624
between the ice
shell and the ocean.

00:09:52.624 --> 00:09:55.561
Then we'll send
landers and melt probes

00:09:55.561 --> 00:09:58.731
and submersibles in the
years to come after that.

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:03.168
Part of what I get to do
at the Jet Propulsion Lab

00:10:03.168 --> 00:10:06.972
and with NASA is kind of
build the earliest precursors,

00:10:06.972 --> 00:10:11.977
the earliest robots
that we might someday

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:13.378
send to a world like Europa.

00:10:13.378 --> 00:10:14.913
I'd like to share with you now

00:10:14.913 --> 00:10:17.216
a piece that was put
together by Mark Thiessen

00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:19.285
and others here at
National Geographic,

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:22.188
that shows you a
tiny step forward

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:24.055
in the technological
developments

00:10:24.055 --> 00:10:25.924
that will someday lead toward

00:10:25.924 --> 00:10:29.361
exploring Europa's ocean,
but today we're utilizing

00:10:29.361 --> 00:10:32.731
to explore extreme
environments here on Earth.

00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:34.967

 early precursor</i>

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:46.845
<i> of something that we may
 someday fly to Europa.</i>

00:10:46.845 --> 00:10:49.915
<i> The Buoyant Rover for
 Under-Ice Exploration</i>

00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:52.851

00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:57.757
<i> and rove as if the underside

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:10.669
<i> these lakes that

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:13.805
<i> and freeze down,

00:11:13.805 --> 00:11:16.375
<i> of life in an
 extreme environment,</i>

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:18.076
<i> that can help guide
 us in assessing</i>

00:11:18.076 --> 00:11:21.580
<i> whether or not a world like
 Europa could harbor life.</i>

00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:28.620
All right.

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.989
<i> We cut a hole in the ice,</i>

00:11:30.989 --> 00:11:32.891
<i> put the rover
 underneath the ice,</i>

00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:37.963
<i> and then left it out
 there to rove around.</i>

00:11:37.963 --> 00:11:40.732
<i> We went back to a
 nice, warm Quonset hut,</i>

00:11:40.732 --> 00:11:42.534
<i> and our team was even
 able to hand over</i>

00:11:42.534 --> 00:11:45.071
<i> control to engineers
 down in JPL.</i>

00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:48.741
(ambient music)

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:51.777
<i> We think this truly
 was the first time ever</i>

00:11:51.777 --> 00:11:56.248
<i> that an underwater,
 under-ice, untethered,</i>

00:11:56.248 --> 00:12:01.187

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:06.691
<i> Our work has this
 wonderful marriage</i>

00:12:06.691 --> 00:12:09.027
<i> of advancing our understanding</i>

00:12:09.027 --> 00:12:10.662
<i> of what's happening
 on our own planet,</i>

00:12:10.662 --> 00:12:13.032
<i> while simultaneously

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:14.533
<i> into our exploration of</i>

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:17.036
<i> potentially habitable
 worlds beyond Earth.</i>

00:12:18.337 --> 00:12:20.973
( rover scrapes across ice )

00:12:22.774 --> 00:12:27.012
( audience applause )

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.882
Dr. Kevin Hand: Thank you.
I'll finish.

00:12:29.882 --> 00:12:32.317
You've seen a lot
of great images

00:12:32.317 --> 00:12:35.954
from our history of
solar system exploration,

00:12:35.954 --> 00:12:40.625
but I'd like to close
with my favorite image

00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:43.995
from the history of
solar system exploration.

00:12:43.995 --> 00:12:48.367
It's an image carved
by the hand of Galileo.

00:12:48.367 --> 00:12:52.871
An image carved
some 400 years ago.

00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:55.307
Shown at center you see Jupiter,

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:58.777
and around Jupiter you
see four tiny little dots.

00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:02.414
Initially when Galileo turned
his telescope to the sky

00:13:02.414 --> 00:13:05.184
and observed these
four tiny little dots

00:13:05.184 --> 00:13:10.923
around Jupiter, he named
them the Medician Stars,

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:12.257
the stars of Medici.

00:13:12.257 --> 00:13:14.460
He did so because
the Medici family

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.894
was funding his research.

00:13:15.894 --> 00:13:17.196
( audience laughter )

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:18.797
And Galileo was no idiot.

00:13:18.797 --> 00:13:20.532
( audience laughter )

00:13:20.532 --> 00:13:23.202
But as he charted the motion

00:13:23.202 --> 00:13:25.137
of these little points of
light night after night,

00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:28.273
he noticed that they moved.

00:13:28.273 --> 00:13:30.175
He began to realize
that they in fact

00:13:30.175 --> 00:13:32.411
were not stars,
but they're moons.

00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:34.513
And if they were moons
going around Jupiter,

00:13:34.513 --> 00:13:36.648
then that meant
that not everything

00:13:36.648 --> 00:13:38.851
rotated around the Earth.

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:43.155
Through his careful charting
of Jupiter and its moons,

00:13:43.155 --> 00:13:45.924
Galileo helped put the
final nail in the coffin

00:13:45.924 --> 00:13:48.661
of Aristotelian
cosmology, this idea

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:51.096
that everything goes
around the Earth.

00:13:51.096 --> 00:13:54.700
He really opened the doorway
to the Copernican revolution.

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.836
This idea, of course,
that we go around our sun,

00:13:57.836 --> 00:14:00.338
our sun is a star, and
the stars that we see

00:14:00.338 --> 00:14:03.842
might be suns to other worlds.

00:14:03.842 --> 00:14:06.644
In the decades that
would follow Galileo,

00:14:06.644 --> 00:14:09.715
we would come to appreciate that

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:13.452
the laws of physics apply
not just here on Earth,

00:14:13.452 --> 00:14:16.822
but also to worlds
and wonders elsewhere.

00:14:16.822 --> 00:14:19.158
In the decades after that
and the centuries after that,

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:21.860
with the development of new
telescopes and new tools,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.430
things like spectroscopy,
we would come to appreciate

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.832
that the principles
of chemistry apply

00:14:27.832 --> 00:14:30.169
not just here on Earth but also

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:32.838
to these worlds and
wonders elsewhere.

00:14:32.838 --> 00:14:34.472
Then, with the advent
of the space age,

00:14:34.472 --> 00:14:36.542
and our exploration
of worlds like Mercury

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.211
and Venus and Mars, we
would come to appreciate

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:42.548
that the principles
of geology also work

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:45.283
not just here but
on these worlds

00:14:45.283 --> 00:14:48.853
and wonders beyond the Earth.

00:14:48.853 --> 00:14:51.323
But when it comes to
the fundamental science

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:54.659
of biology we have
yet to make that leap.

00:14:54.659 --> 00:14:56.461
We have yet to
understand whether or not

00:14:56.461 --> 00:14:59.064
this bizarre phenomenon
that we call life

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:02.134
works beyond Earth.

00:15:02.134 --> 00:15:04.102
We have every reason to
believe that it should.

00:15:04.102 --> 00:15:05.571
Our study of life here on Earth

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.839
and our exploration of
these worlds elsewhere

00:15:07.839 --> 00:15:09.942
indicate that we think
some of these worlds

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:12.310
should be habitable, based
on what we've learned

00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:14.279
about life here,
but we have not yet

00:15:14.279 --> 00:15:16.982
done that experiment.

00:15:16.982 --> 00:15:19.818
Part of what excites me about
the time in which we live

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:24.056
is that for the first time
in the history of humanity,

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:26.591
for the first time since we've
looked up at the night sky

00:15:26.591 --> 00:15:28.192
and asked that
primordial question

00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:30.462
of "Is there life out there?"

00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:32.764
we have the tools
and technology,

00:15:32.764 --> 00:15:34.666
the scientific and
technological capability,

00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:38.536
to do the experiment,
to see whether or not

00:15:38.536 --> 00:15:41.540
biology works beyond our Earth,

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.542
to see whether or
not this phenomenon

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:45.444
we know and love called life

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:48.480
works on worlds and
wonders elsewhere.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.082
So I hope that in
much the same way

00:15:51.082 --> 00:15:53.084
that we can look at this image

00:15:53.084 --> 00:15:55.387
and appreciate the revolution

00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:58.223
that was catalyzed
by the observations

00:15:58.223 --> 00:16:01.560
and the research that
Galileo and everyone did

00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:05.363
some 400 years ago, I
hope that our descendants,

00:16:05.363 --> 00:16:09.100
some 400 years from now,

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.670
will look back at our time,

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:15.106
and they will be able
to say, "It was then,

00:16:15.106 --> 00:16:17.376
it was during that time,

00:16:17.376 --> 00:16:20.579
that humanity did
the exploration,

00:16:20.579 --> 00:16:22.714
developed the tools
and technology,

00:16:22.714 --> 00:16:24.817
and made the discoveries

00:16:24.817 --> 00:16:27.419
that brought our
universe to life."

00:16:27.419 --> 00:16:28.620
Thank you.

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.089
( audience applause )

00:16:30.089 --> 00:16:33.292
