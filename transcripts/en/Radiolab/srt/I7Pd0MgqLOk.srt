1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,240
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm
Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,

2
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:05,250
the podcast remixed.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,501
So here's the thing,

4
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:11,810
we make this show and we worry
about each and every word ever.

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,880
Each sound, every breath, the
really what we're hoping for

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,520
is it the stuff ends up in your head and
just become some set of thoughts that

7
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:22,820
we could have never imagined.
So with that in mind,

8
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:26,590
a couple months ago we teamed up with
the site called Indaba music. Yup.

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,340
To host a radio lab remix
contest. But we did was,

10
00:00:31,341 --> 00:00:36,260
we put out a bunch of our stories but as
multi-track versions so that the voice,

11
00:00:36,261 --> 00:00:40,490
the interviews, the music, everything
is separated out on its own track.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,460
People could take what we've done
and do anything they want with us,

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,860
anything. And they did.

14
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:50,270
And our job was to pick
a bunch of winners.

15
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,950
Here we are with the
results of the first ever,

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,430
not necessarily annual Radiolab

17
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,470
remix contests. Yes. Five months straight.

18
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:01,030
You flipped through
magazines while sitting on

19
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,520
136 submissions, every
style that you can imagine.

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,290
And we're going to play a couple for you
right now. Some of the winners right?

21
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,190
So let's just jump in with
the grand prize winner.

22
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,240
So one of the pieces that we offered a
as remixed material was this one in the

23
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:21,760
afterlife, you relive
all your experiences,

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,910
but this time with the events we shuffled
into a new order is from our afterlife

25
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:30,430
show. And it was a story called sum,

26
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:33,820
which was written by David Eagleman
read for us by actor Jeffrey Tambor.

27
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:38,410
And the idea of the story was to imagine
a version of the afterlife where all

28
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:43,411
the moments of your life would be clumped
together by category for five months

29
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:45,760
straight. You flip through
magazines while sitting on a toilet.

30
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:50,110
You take all your painted ones,
all 27 intense hours of it. Boom.

31
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,380
The story itself isn't, it's okay. It's
kind of a, it's a a remix in a way.

32
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,030
Yeah,

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,270
it's a really funny story and point it
at times and a lot of people chose to

34
00:01:58,271 --> 00:02:02,980
remix this story, including our grand
prize winner. My Name is David Minnick.

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,840
That's him. Is that all you want?
We'll hear more from David Mannequin.

36
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,010
Just a second. First,
let's hear his remix.

37
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:11,920
This is some written by David
Eagleman. Read by Jeffrey Tambor,

38
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:15,520
originally produced by Radiolab and
remixed by David Minnick. Alright, try it.

39
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,853
Take two

40
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,260
in the afterlife. Here we
live. All your experiences

41
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,690
with the events. Lori
shuffled into a new border.

42
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,640
You see all the moments that share a
quality. Our group together. For instance,

43
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,240
board staring out the bus window, sitting
in an airport. Two years of boredom,

44
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,600
staring out the bus window, sitting
in an airport, two years porch,

45
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,280
staring out the bus window, sitting
in this airport, two years porch,

46
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,410
staring out the bus window.
Sitting in this two years.

47
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,703
[inaudible]

48
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:02,890
two years or every other Sydney airport,

49
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,490
two years, every other
bus. Monroe City Airport.

50
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,180
Two years [inaudible]

51
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,510
18 months waiting in line.
18 months waiting. 18 months,

52
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,090
18 months, waiting in line waiting.

53
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,810
[inaudible] wait, wait, wait. Do you mind?

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,130
Thank you. He loves waiting
in line. Waiting in line,

55
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,930
waiting in line, waiting
and waiting and waiting.

56
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:45,680
15 months

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,490
looking for lost items,
looking for lost items,

58
00:03:49,491 --> 00:03:53,150
looking for lost items,
looking for lost and private.

59
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:57,740
15 months looking for lost
items, looking for lost items,

60
00:03:57,741 --> 00:04:02,150
looking for lost items. Looking
for lost by the 15 months.

61
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,990
Eight items, lost items,

62
00:04:05,991 --> 00:04:10,720
looking for items, looking
for lost items. Seven months,

63
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,980
having sex, having sex,
having sex, having sex,

64
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,340
having sex, having sex, having sex,

65
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,870
having Sarah, having sex, having
sex, having sex, having sex,

66
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:28,260
having sex, having sex.

67
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,330
And yet it's because you can't take
a shower until it's time to take it.

68
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,630
The marathon, shower,

69
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,440
hundred day shower, shower, Gel,

70
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,680
shower, shower,

71
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,913
shower.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,700
Okay. I would like to do a whole show
like that. I've never been to it myself.

73
00:04:55,701 --> 00:04:57,770
If we did a wholesale
like that. Really? Oh,

74
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,350
cause you know why it's two Broadway
for you. I'm realizing this. For me,

75
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:03,130
this was like, it was the
best. It was like, it was um,

76
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,010
it was Broadway in a
way that made me hurt.

77
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:12,290
But it was also like, it was
also just a feat of composing.

78
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,240
If I could wake up in the morning and say,

79
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,640
I think I'm going to
go to the bathroom now.

80
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,050
I think I'm going to go to the
bathroom now. Oh, I'd kill myself.

81
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:24,380
That if you feel wonderful for me. Hello.
Hey, hey. Is this David? Yes it is.

82
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:28,190
How are you? Hi David. This is Jad.
Hi Jen. We you like your thing a lot.

83
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,130
That was really something. Thank
you so much Ella. Truthfully,

84
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:34,970
we kind of disagreed. Robert loved
it. I was amazed at what you've done,

85
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,120
but it was a little too Broadway
from me. That's not my fault.

86
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,120
You got to talk to Jeffrey tambor
about that. Oh No, I'm not, I'm not,

87
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,620
I don't like showtunes either. But
uh, his voice was already musical.

88
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:50,360
David explained to us that each line of
tambourines reed would guide him to a

89
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:52,940
new melody and a new style
cause he's, he's an actor,

90
00:05:52,941 --> 00:05:57,940
he's a really good actor and so his
voice actually follows a pitch pad five

91
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,120
months

92
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,460
straight.

93
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,160
You flip through magazines while sitting
on a toilet with different magazines

94
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,970
about sitting on a toilet
for five months. Right.

95
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,190
You flip through magazine glass.

96
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,400
A lot of them actually
suggested the type of music,

97
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:09,350
like driving the street
in front of your house,

98
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,380
driving the street in front of
your house was already in rhythm.

99
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,230
Driving the stream in front of that one.

100
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:19,060
I could actually hear the first time
driving the street in front of your house.

101
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,790
If you listen to the melody enough times
and then you start putting chords to

102
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,660
it, it inevitably suggest
some sort of style of music.

103
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,270
Last five weeks driving
cost, five weeks driving,

104
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:34,510
last five weeks go by because lost lost

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,250
two weeks. Wondering what's
happened when you die in two weeks.

106
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,920
Wondering what's happened. Two
weeks wondering what's happening.

107
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,220
Really die six days clipping your
nails, six days clipping your nails,

108
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,540
six days clapping your nails.

109
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,750
I just wanted the, the whole idea of the,

110
00:06:46,751 --> 00:06:50,260
of the story to be
manifested in, in music.

111
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:53,530
So you've actually feel the long lengths
of time when it's two years of doing

112
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:57,820
this, a little less when it's 18
months, staring into the refrigerator,

113
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,250
15 hours writing your signature, et
Cetera, and to get shorter and shorter,

114
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,940
seven hours

115
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,773
vomiting.

116
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,960
And then when he describes,
um, that you imagine your life,

117
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,210
all the events in your life
being in different order,

118
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,770
like real life actually is on earth. Uh,

119
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:19,310
I just wanted to cut from one
thing to another, to another,

120
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:22,220
to another and random orders sort
of the way life actually works.

121
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,950
This part of the afterlife,

122
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:27,610
you imagine something
analogous to your earthly life.

123
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,680
Reading books and the thought cars
crashed explicitly watching commercials.

124
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,300
A life where episodes are split into
tiny showers, swallowable pieces,

125
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,350
swallowing swollen moments
do not endure. You sleep.

126
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,620
One experiences the joy of jumping
from one event to the next,

127
00:07:44,621 --> 00:07:49,621
like a child sitting in thought hopping
from spot to spot in this cut on the

128
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,530
earnings here working they was born.
For instance, flipping your nails,

129
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,920
staring out the bus window,
waiting for a green light tower,

130
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:01,980
having sex reading books popping from
spot to spot or it's crest count of money

131
00:08:02,921 --> 00:08:04,720
swallowing, swallowing your eyes, hurting,

132
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,730
paying two lasers staring into the
refrigerator without opening your eyes.

133
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,853
Shower.

134
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,110
Well, I'll tell him
about a 60 hours hours,

135
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,090
60 straight hours. Oh No, no,
no, no. I've got three kids.

136
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:24,750
I can't say up that 60 hours
over a period of a few weeks.

137
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,800
My actual job was a piano teacher and a
church organist and I teach a couple of

138
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,780
music theory courses at a
two year college. That's
what I actually get paid for.

139
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:36,570
I don't get paid for
this time. It's just fun.

140
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,550
How often do you do this kind of thing?

141
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,410
I've entered probably about
30 contests since 2009 really?

142
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,870
What sorts of contexts? Um, well there's,

143
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:50,070
there's the snoop dog contest and
I turned it into a pirate song.

144
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,070
Pirate Shanti. I just had him
singing over pirate music changes

145
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,660
rhythm to make it a sea shanty

146
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,320
suitcase. It's what they say is if they
knew me, oh my head, like a two feet.

147
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,980
My n***a key kid, that's my
little buddy. Toss him holes up.

148
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,990
It gets them cutting.
Cutting. What's it like?

149
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,860
Mine's just kinda tight
a long way from Huston.

150
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,580
They to like let, so David Minnick
was our grand prize winner.

151
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:18,760
He gets $500 ticket to the live show
and a backup from Robert. I didn't,

152
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:21,740
I didn't know. I didn't know I was doing
backdrop. Just, I just put that in.

153
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,660
But now it's on tape.
You got to do it. Okay.

154
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,930
And let me just say one thing
before we do any more winters,

155
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,580
and this is in reference to
the whole Broadway thing.

156
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:32,660
If we're going to be representative of
the kinds of things that we got in most

157
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:36,290
of the submissions, like I would say
about a hundred of them sounded like this.

158
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,563
Wait,

159
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:48,350
listening to radio radio from

160
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,253
Jay

161
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,880
four on the floor at tech. No.
Which I gotta admit, you know,

162
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:59,230
not being a Broadway guy. I sort of
liked this stuff. You like this stuff?

163
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,840
Yeah. I mean lower the lights, but the
smoke machine on. I'm all about that one.

164
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,760
I actually, this and this stuff like
this when I'm writing. Really? Yeah.

165
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,070
It's just like the sound of energy.

166
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,940
I am so sorry for you because not
only do you lack any Broadway,

167
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:19,150
but you believe in techno. I just
think it's a tasted little loop.

168
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,180
It's a great loop. How do I know you?

169
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,860
Please, please.

170
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,960
Okay. We'll be right back and we will
have the runners up. Some of them.

171
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,760
Pretty fabulous critic
taken the crown and uh,

172
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,700
one of our remixers actually ended
up being Paul Miller, Aka DJ Spooky.

173
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:43,510
He threw together a break beat, uh, based
on some material from our limits show.

174
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,320
And uh, here it is. Do Loving me.

175

Okay, so we're back with the results
from the radio lab remix competition.

195
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:11,370
We just heard our grand prize
winner. Now the runners up

196
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,050
[inaudible].

197
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:16,410
This first one is from a
fellow named Jeff Barr.

198
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,190
He's actually the editor for a really
cool podcast name risk and he calls this

199
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:23,940
one pacing about the
lab that the, you know,

200
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,430
the Dale

201
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,780
123-FOUR-FIVE-6789

202
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,690
41827347750

203
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:40,973
1200777777

204
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,383
you

205
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,003
okay?

206
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,060
I really got tuned into this, Jeff,

207
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,100
the sounds that aren't meant to be
music, but come off as music to me,

208
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:16,520
so I just play with that
and turn it into songs.

209
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Mother never occurred to me that there
might be any big slice of chocolate.

210
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,730
There was blah, blah, blah.

211
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:37,420
There was blah, blah,
blah, blah. There was

212
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:41,343
no good.

213
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:45,060
No, it gets judged. I know will
look told them where we are.

214
00:13:45,061 --> 00:13:49,060
You know it gets Japan. I know will
look, told them wherever we are.

215
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:52,930
You fucking know it gets
jealous. I know who we are.

216
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,960
You know it gets [inaudible]
told them. Right.

217
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,483
[inaudible]

218
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,280
wow, good. That made me think of,

219
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,030
it's like if Radiolab were an actual
place in some alternate dimension,

220
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:18,990
that would be like the sound of the
dead space between thoughts where you're

221
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:20,160
just pacing around,

222
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:23,850
right or or maybe or perhaps it's what
the studio is dreaming about when you're

223
00:14:23,851 --> 00:14:28,740
not in it. Oh, like that random
sounds like it means random.

224
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,210
That is random. Sounds like
it means random. That is

225
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,210
sound like it means

226
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,760
seven [inaudible]

227
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,330
and of course there are other award
winning [inaudible] runners up out there.

228
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,390
Winners and you can listen to them.
The ones we've chosen on our website,

229
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,480
also an endeavors website, but
we now have, I got to say here,

230
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:52,580
the one that really, really delighted

231
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,280
us, we, it's neither a runner
up nor the grand prize winner.

232
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,760
Maybe we would call this the
director's choice. Yes, exactly.

233
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,880
The director's choice. So
the, just to set this one up,

234
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:05,660
we had a show about vertigo
actually about the disease.

235
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,740
We turned up an essay from a Burton
rouget Shea or the New Yorker who pretty

236
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:12,770
much invented the whole genre
of like medical mysteries.

237
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,080
Anyhow, many, many years ago,

238
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:17,800
he interviews this woman about something
she's going through and writes an

239
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:22,630
article about it and we had actually
actress hope Davis dramatize the readings.

240
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:24,010
I've been home about an hour.

241
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,970
Dinner was ready and waiting in the
oven and I was sitting at the piano,

242
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,043
not really.

243
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,930
Basically in this essay, this
woman loses control of her body,

244
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:37,200
started across the room.
I felt the floor sort of

245
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,050
shake, good heavens.
I said, what was that?

246
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,010
Things begin to tilt. The world
gets very strange and out of scale.

247
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:50,880
Her arms begin to feel like they're
lengthening and then contracting.

248
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,150
She just completely loses her
relationship to the planet earth.

249
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,510
Frank just looked at me. His
face was a perfect blank.

250
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:02,580
He made some remark about old buildings
stretching and settling and handed me my

251
00:16:02,581 --> 00:16:06,000
drink. No, she's suffering from
a disease, uh, called Vertigo.

252
00:16:06,001 --> 00:16:07,970
That's what the whole essay is about. Uh,

253
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,890
the surprising symptoms that
happen when you get vertigo.

254
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:15,300
Listen to what these two remixers,
these two guys who did this next remix.

255
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:18,870
Listen to how they take that
idea of vertigo and flip it.

256
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,690
Everything was quite ordinary. I know

257
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:36,550
we was the presence in a suit.
He was smelling solid concern.

258
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,970
She could tell the way he moved.

259
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:42,470
He said confidence and safe with every
breath he effort was the leave just let

260
00:16:42,471 --> 00:16:46,130
loose from the tree. No idea what
she was supposed to be or to do.

261
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,540
She was just an outline.

262
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,770
Some notes on some loose leaf paper and
paper was something he knew how to use.

263
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,560
He worked for the paper,
capturing the tools,

264
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,930
a molder of material out looking
for Omni was [inaudible].

265
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,300
She wasn't a few sprinkles. Somebody
is, every movement is a blue box,

266
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,820
became her new sky. They
spread across the room.

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,300
They bled over the [inaudible] for
vision. And her view was a huge,

268
00:17:08,301 --> 00:17:09,890
that covered the few things she thought.

269
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:14,891
She knew to close that overflow to face
and change the way she moved floors on

270
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,370
the floor shake.

271
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,570
It went down and up.

272
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:27,280
It was as if I were sinking into the floor

273
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,680
and the floor was like, it would
do under my foot and I would sink.

274
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,200
So can you guys introduce yourselves?
Oh, my name is mark out for you.

275
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:42,610
And I go by Demio as a producer in
the world of production. So she,

276
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,150
Schibsted Chang and I'm, my name is
Ryan Vinson. I go by sketch lightly.

277
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:52,440
And that's the whole world of
hip hop music. Changan de Ching.

278
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,210
So Ryan's the rapper on this thing.
And Mark's the guy who makes the music.

279
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:00,720
Well I think all I gave him at
first was like listen to the stems.

280
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:05,790
I think I can write something about this
interpreting vertigo as something about

281
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:07,880
love and positives and negatives. Um,

282
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:11,460
and he kind of went from there
and made all of the music.

283
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,340
Yeah, it was Kinda, it's Kinda, I
don't know, came out of nowhere.

284
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:19,120
So I was just trying to make something
that would fit with his style.

285
00:18:19,121 --> 00:18:22,690
So now how did you go up with
the idea of, of taking vertigo,

286
00:18:22,691 --> 00:18:27,130
which is a disease where you lose your
balance and your relationship to gravity

287
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,760
and making that about love and
losing yourself in another person?

288
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,610
Yeah, I dunno, I'm listening
to the other pieces, uh,

289
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:39,470
that were submitted before mine. People
would either just leave all the vocals,

290
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:43,700
basically the same and just do different
musical arrangements underneath.

291
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,940
And then there were some that would
take the vocals and chop them up in all

292
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:50,900
crazy ways and it was really awesome to
listen to. But being a fan of the show,

293
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:54,100
I guess I kind of missed the
story sometimes. Like just the,

294
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:55,300
the feeling from the stories.

295
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,390
I try to think of a way that I could
kind of sit in between there. So, um,

296
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,670
just the idea of vertigo,

297
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:05,120
just the feelings described in the
original piece made me think of love,

298
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,020
not knowing where you, how
the space works anymore.

299
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,950
I think it's a lot like the way
people describe falling in love where

300
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,300
everything seems different.
Right, exactly. Um, is that just,

301
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:21,490
I think that made sense to you in the
abstract or were you drawing from personal

302
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,633
ah,

303
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,830
personal experience or something?
I don't know. Is there something,

304
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,180
something behind that?

305
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,550
I guess it's definitely a
drawing from personal experience,

306
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:31,730
but I guess these two guys have been
in love for a very, very long time.

307
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,740
That's what it kind of
congressional thing.

308
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,020
And you could tell if you
ever see us in the same room,

309
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:40,850
you both start cranking up
towards me and then I can,

310
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,600
I'll start moving. And I

311
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,440
know that's an honest question, isn't it?
Did you, is there a real into that or,

312
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,640
yeah, no, there is. Um, so when I heard
the feeling described in the piece,

313
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:55,760
I was like, my question to myself
was why can I relate to this?

314
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,310
Like why does that make sense to
me? Cause I've never been there.

315
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,500
I've never had vertigo. But for me I
guess, um, I mean getting really personal.

316
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:07,910
Um, I mean I'm, I'm divorced,
I'm really young and divorced.

317
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:12,680
I guess I'm up from most
people. Um, but just, um,

318
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,860
the second verse talks a lot about
this unsure feeling when you,

319
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,270
your identity becomes
lost in someone else. Um,

320
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,260
when you're not sure where you stop
and they begin and that can be a really

321
00:20:27,261 --> 00:20:31,490
great thing, but also can
be really troubling. And um,

322
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,600
when you're not sure what you
are on your own anymore, I guess.

323
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,030
And I guess I've, I
have gone through that.

324
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,470
It all happened so quickly. Head's
spinning. Trump the wedding ring,

325
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,610
she was his completely in, he was her
everything and she was everything in term,

326
00:20:46,611 --> 00:20:48,130
but only in turn she was

327
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:50,140
Frank's wife first and nobody said,

328
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,250
and second she was someone who she
couldn't quite pin down the woman that she

329
00:20:54,251 --> 00:20:56,260
was before she lost herself in his smile.

330
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,580
He was so handsome and successful in her
husband and had to say something about

331
00:21:00,581 --> 00:21:01,900
the woman who loved him. Right?

332
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,650
These were the questions that kept
her up at night, eyes wide at the sky,

333
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:09,130
wondering what it would be like if
the Sun's light can strike them all.

334
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:12,790
She shuttered shut, arise and
pressed herself against us.

335
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,230
I was conscious of a new dimension.

336
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,830
I had a new relationship to space my face.

337
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,760
My whole body felt no shame.

338
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,690
I seem to be completely at the
mercy of some outside force.

339
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,440
I was in war.

340
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,813
Right.

341
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,900
Oh, you're right. That's not a person
who's safe. It's not a happy feeling.

342
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,370
So in that scenario, I don't want
to be too literal about this,

343
00:21:50,371 --> 00:21:52,200
but who are you?

344
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:56,880
You're talking from the perspective
of the woman about a guy named frank.

345
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,060
I assume that you're closer spiritually
to the woman's perspective in this case.

346
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,463
Right? I guess I would say,

347
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,640
I would say I would more closely
associate to the female character,

348
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:10,790
right? Yeah. She just has these
all these thoughts and questions,

349
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:12,830
but then the last line
is like she shuttered,

350
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,050
shut her eyes and pressed
herself against his side.

351
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,440
So she's kind of brushing those away
because it was scary and going back to a

352
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:24,290
security and comfort, but we don't
yet know whether she's going to get,

353
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:29,090
you know, going to go solo. She's very
each when, thank you. Paying attention,

354
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,340
Diane. No, it's like it's a very
subtle like line at the end that,

355
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,393
I dunno,

356
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:39,290
I meant it to be that way because I
didn't want it to feel decisive that you

357
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,830
wrote this from the perspective of
somebody who's in the middle of it. Right.

358
00:22:42,831 --> 00:22:45,770
I guess from the perspective of someone
who's in the middle of it and not sure

359
00:22:45,771 --> 00:22:48,080
if she even really wants
to be on the outside of it,

360
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,040
but feels like maybe she should.

361
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:51,500
Oh, it's a,

362
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:58,210
it's a strange place to be at
the mercy of some outside force.

363
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,900
I guess. I sat there for a long time.

364
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,140
[inaudible]

365
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,110
he, it's real. It's with kind of like
humbling about that whole thing for me.

366
00:23:18,111 --> 00:23:21,710
Is it like they found something that was
in the story that we didn't even know

367
00:23:21,711 --> 00:23:24,890
was in there at that thing. It's
kind of beautiful. Yeah. Well she,

368
00:23:24,891 --> 00:23:26,960
that's the thing. When
Liz idea was created,

369
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,960
it wasn't created by me because I
thought it was insane. I thought,

370
00:23:29,961 --> 00:23:34,961
why would people in the business of their
lives go into our raw material and re

371
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,020
sculpted? I said, nobody is
going to do that. It's just dumb.

372
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:42,280
But the fact that 136 people
took the time to do it. Yeah.

373
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:47,370
It brought so much talent and energy and
end and cleverness and interestingness

374
00:23:47,601 --> 00:23:51,380
to the whole thing. It's quite, it's
just, I don't know what to call it. Well,

375
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,440
I think it's kind of wonderful is
what it is. Yeah, it's just cool.

376
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,430
So thank you to everybody
that entered. Thank you.

377
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:01,220
And thank you to Indaba for
making this possible for us.

378
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,110
You can hear a bunch of the remixes on
an Davos website that's Indaba music.com

379
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,890
and they run a site that's
really extraordinary because
it gets a whole bunch of

380
00:24:09,891 --> 00:24:13,520
people who love music. I love mixing
music together. Yeah. So thank you.

381
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,180
Indaba yeah, I'm Jen
[inaudible]. I'm Robert Krulwich.

382
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,830
Thank you for re listening.
