TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.540
Timothy Jordan, your
friendly developer advocate,

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.200
here at Google I/O 2017.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.682
I'm in the machine
learning area,

00:00:12.682 --> 00:00:14.890
and we're gonna check out
a lot of really cool stuff.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.810
A reminder before I get to it.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.760
If you'd like to see
any of this footage,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.520
or any of the other Sandbox
tours that I've been doing,

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.910
go to g.co/io/guide.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.770
First off, I'd like to check
out the Cloud TPU in person.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:39.860
Wow.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.735
So much heat sink.

00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:53.550
MAGNUS: This look
like a skyscrapers.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.740
It's like a miniature
city down there.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.441
It's amazing.

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.690
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This is
seriously one of the best Tron

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.850
moments I've had in years.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.860
MAGNUS: This is among
the most amazing things

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.870
I've ever seen in my life.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.070
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK, Magnus.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.240
Everybody, this is Magnus.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.420
You may know him from,
well, being Magnus,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.420
and all sorts of things.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.960
Hi, Magnus.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.900
MAGNUS: Hi, how are you?

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.000
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm
doing super well.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.070
So you've been hanging out with
all this really cool machine

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.329
learning stuff all day long.

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:18.870
MAGNUS: Yeah.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.440
That's right.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.740
We've been here all day
doing different machine

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.379
learning stuff.

00:01:22.379 --> 00:01:24.420
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'd like
to check out some of it,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.600
and just play with it.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.100
MAGNUS: OK.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.260
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's
try AI Duets first.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.820
So what is this?

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.100
MAGNUS: So you can actually
play on these things,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.240
and then the network
generates something back.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.889
Yeah.

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:37.680
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.139
So it's kind of like the
machine playing music with you.

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.680
MAGNUS: Yeah.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.560
It's kind of constructing
music based on what you play.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.864
It's trying to create something
similar, but still different.

00:01:46.864 --> 00:01:48.530
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK I
want to try it out.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.516
MAGNUS: Yeah.

00:01:49.516 --> 00:01:52.967
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.215
That's a lot of fun.

00:02:21.215 --> 00:02:22.590
It feels a little
like that scene

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.259
in "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind."

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.800
MAGNUS: Yeah.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.929
Absolutely.

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:27.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All
right, so there's

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.490
one other thing
that I would like

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.739
to check out while we're here.

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.260
And that's the candy sorter.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.760
MAGNUS: Yes.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.940
It's an amazing thing.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.780
It consists of so many different
machine learning technologies

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.572
in one single demo.

00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:38.196
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Should
we check it out?

00:02:38.196 --> 00:02:39.334
MAGNUS: Yeah, for sure.

00:02:39.334 --> 00:02:40.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
As promised, we're

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.980
gonna check out
the candy sorter.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.540
What is a candy
sorter, you may ask?

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.724
Well, Dave's here to
tell us what that is.

00:02:46.724 --> 00:02:47.390
DAVE: OK, great.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.460
So what we're gonna
show here is how

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.920
you can infuse machine
learning into your apps

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.670
without actually being
a data scientist.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.420
And the way we're gonna
do it is through candy

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.839
and through labels.

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:59.630
Now, what we've done
is we've gone through,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.070
we've trained a model up
in the cloud that for--

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.930
basically, we've taken
an existing model,

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.060
and we've trained it for candy.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.490
So we've put labels,
and next to candies.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.050
And we've got a
little camera here

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.270
that's taking
pictures of the candy.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.750
And we put labels that have
been associated with the candy.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.140
We sent it up to the Google
Cloud Machine Learning engine,

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.200
and we've trained the model,
we used the Inception V3 model,

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.824
and using transfer learning.

00:03:26.824 --> 00:03:28.490
And so what we're
gonna show now is, now

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.380
that the model's been
trained, is actually

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.920
the serving of the model.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.252
So I'm gonna take candy
here and just throw it out

00:03:34.252 --> 00:03:35.210
in front of the camera.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:36.950
And this is just
any random candy

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.870
that we have trained
this model for.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.160
So I like gum.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.970
I want to make sure there's
plenty of gum out there.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.432
And you'll want to make sure
there's a little bit of space

00:03:46.432 --> 00:03:47.140
in between there.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:55.850
And again, when we train this,
this image, it has been--

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.840
it has been a
well-trained model that

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.000
has been modified with these
images and these labels.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.380
You can even write your own
labels, which is awesome.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.480
So now it's trained.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.010
Now the fun part
of this is actually

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.360
the serving, the prediction.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.520
So you're gonna
speak into this mike,

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.765
you're gonna hit this
little mike button here,

00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:15.140
you're gonna speak
into this mike

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.120
and ask for some kind of candy.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.966
And it's gonna make
a call to our API,

00:04:19.966 --> 00:04:22.590
it's gonna understand the text--
it's gonna do a Speech API, so

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.211
speech-to-text
API, and then it's

00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:25.960
gonna understand the
intent of what you're

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.970
asking for using our natural
language processing API,

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.640
and then it's going to
make a prediction based

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.700
upon the model that's
sitting out in the cloud.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.110
And the best part
is, hopefully--

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:37.100
cross your fingers--

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.600
it's gonna give you-- it's gonna
pick-- make the prediction,

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.120
pick it, and then
give it to you.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.780
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:42.279
OK.

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.770
DAVE: All right, so click on
that, and speak into the mike.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.530
TIMOTHY JORDAN: May
I have some gum?

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.090
DAVE: So it understood what
you said, May I have some gum.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.214
Now it's going through
natural language processing.

00:04:57.214 --> 00:05:00.740
It's identifying the noun,
the noun there, and gum.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.150
So now it's trying to--

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.490
it will then match, based
upon the model that's

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.280
been modified--

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.140
come on, come on, come on--

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.300
and it is picking chewing gum.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.850
And there, the camera identified
Extra long-lasting watermelon

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:17.640
gum.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.350
Now, the camera's-- the--

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.982
and over, and there's your gum.

00:05:24.982 --> 00:05:26.190
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's great.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.875
DAVE: Machine
learning in and out.

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:29.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So I
get to keep this, right?

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.370
DAVE: Yeah, actually, I've got
like seven boxes back there.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.230
So please, everybody take one.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.100
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Dave, thanks so much.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.225
DAVE: All right, thank you.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.780
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That
was pretty great.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.450
All right, so that is the
machine learning area.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.660
I hope you've enjoyed these
experiences as much as I had.

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.600
It's really cool to see machine
learning up close and personal,

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.300
see how it can be used in
real life through these demos.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.300
And I hope it inspires
you to do some cool stuff

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.600
with TensorFlow and with Cloud.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.330
See you later.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.380
