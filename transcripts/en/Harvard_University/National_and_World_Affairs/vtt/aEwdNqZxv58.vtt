It was interesting to me when Senator Kennedy
talked about president kennedy he never called

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.229
him my brother and he never called him Jack he
always call him president kennedy

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:13.509
and uh...  gave him that honor and it was
very touching to me because we often sit

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:19.529
in his is inner office in the capital and
on the wall was the handwritten note that uh...

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.219
Jack had written to his mother when ted was
born asking him if he could be Ted's godfather

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:29.179
and so your in this room and you can't
get away from just the history of the family

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.220
and the legacy and the memory but he always
referred to as brother as President Kennedy
