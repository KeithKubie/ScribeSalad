00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.640
BRADY HARAN: What's your
favorite number, and why?

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.120
Please leave a comment under
this video so I can

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.130
compare them all.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.770
And in the meantime, here are
the answers given by some of

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.900
the top people on YouTube.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.040
Now, I had to interview some
of these people in unusual

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.260
locations, like up trees
and in toilets.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.790
So it's a bit of a hodgepodge.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.600
But it's also a bit of fun.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.360
DEREK MULLER: I'm Derek Muller
from Veritasium.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.755
And my favorite number is i--

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:25.550
HANK GREEN: We're in the
toilets at YouTube.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.050
DEREK MULLER: --the square
root of negative 1.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.265
HANK GREEN: I'm Hank Green of
SciShow and also CrashCourse

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:32.890
and Vlogbrothers.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.970
And I'm a big fan
of the number 2.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.710
STEVE SPANGLER: So my name
is Steve Spangler.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.340
MICHAEL STEVENS: I am Michael
from the channel Vsauce.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.520
STEVE SPANGLER: I grew
up in a family of

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.710
professional magicians.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.160
MICHAEL STEVENS: My favorite
number is the number 17,

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.820
because I love making 7's with
this little guy in the middle,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.150
so that you know it's not a 1.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.350
It's something that my dad
always did, and I just adopted

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.560
without ever thinking
about it.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.910
STEVE SPANGLER: Number 13 has
to be my absolute all time

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:02.650
favorite number.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.230
ANGELA LIN: Hi, I'm Angela
from YouTube EDU.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.570
STEVE SPANGLER: If you really
wanted to see a real

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.730
magician's magic wand, it's
exactly 13 inches long.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.700
ANGELA LIN: My number is 7.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.780
And I know it's kind of generic,
but when I was really

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.040
young, people told me that
it was a lucky number.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.330
MICHAEL STEVENS: 17 was also the
channel of Nickelodeon in

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.310
Stillwell, Kansas,
where I grew up.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.420
ANGELA LIN: So then I played
a bunch of sports.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.520
And every single sport that I
played-- volleyball, tennis,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.420
whatever it was--
my number was 7.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.950
BRADY HARAN: Michael from Vsauce
has a little line.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.285
But you--

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:29.835
ANGELA LIN: You know, I
went through a phase--

00:01:29.835 --> 00:01:31.570
I went through a phase
where I definitely

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.920
drew it with the line.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.020
And then I just decided, you
know what, simpler is better.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.380
ALEX DAINIS: I'm Alex
from BiteSciZed, and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.790
my number is 27.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.560
ANGELA LIN: Every year
on 7/7, on July 7, I

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.570
do something special.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.850
So I started it on 7/7/07.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.750
And I remember I went kayaking
that day, because I'd never

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.910
been kayaking before.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.220
ALEX DAINIS: As I was growing
up, my favorite number was

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.910
actually always my
brother's age.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.900
But when I was 13, I decided
that was silly.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.150
And so the last one stuck.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.130
And so my favorite number
has always stuck at 27.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.545
BRADY HARAN: Oh, you do
one of those things.

00:02:00.545 --> 00:02:01.400
ALEX DAINIS: I do.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.875
I do.

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:02.240
BRADY HARAN: Why?

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.110
ALEX DAINIS: I don't know.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.530
I think it kind of
distinguishes it.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.230
Sometimes my handwriting
is terrible.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.670
And so my 7's look like 1's.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.979
So I'll toss a little
dash on it.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.580
MICHAEL STEVENS: And 17 is also

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.045
significant for another reason.

00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:14.410
How come I can't remember it?

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.670
It's prime.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.950
What was the other thing?

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.100
This is called not
respecting your

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.780
favorite number well enough.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:21.310
DESTIN: I'm Destin.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.660
My number is 21.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.860
It's really hard
to explain why.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:26.910
MIKE RUGNETTA: My name
is Mike Rugnetta

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.310
from PBS Idea Channel.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.105
And my number is 1024.

00:02:34.105 --> 00:02:36.620
BRADY HARAN: Hang on, why'd
you-- what's with that?

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.680
MIKE RUGNETTA: Zero fill.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.840
It's a compulsion just from
handwriting so many-- my

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.235
handwriting is really bad.

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:43.670
CAITLIN HENDRICKSON:
I'm Caitlin

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.330
Hendrickson, work at YouTube.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.110
My number is 16.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.780
JOHN GREEN: Hi, I'm John Green
of the Vlogbrothers, and my

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.610
favorite number is 37, because
it was the dorm room that I

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.070
first lived in when I went
to boarding school.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.580
CAITLIN HENDRICKSON: Growing
up, I wanted to drive.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.600
So 16 in the US is when
you can drive.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.550
BRADY HARAN: Do you do
that with your 7's?

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.890
MIKE RUGNETTA: I do.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:05.730
I do that with my 7's.

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.935
And I do my 1's like
this, too.

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:09.060
BRADY HARAN: All right, dude.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.980
1024-- why?

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.450
MIKE RUGNETTA: 1024.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.410
It's a very sort of nice, round
number in computing.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.710
Having a degree in computer
science, it has a magical

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.300
quality about it, I guess.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.015
ALEX DAINIS: So actually, I
also have a little bit of

00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:23.510
synesthesia.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.240
So numbers have colors for me.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.500
So 2 is green, and
7 is yellow.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.260
So 27 is actually a very
greenish yellow number.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.580
DESTIN: You've heard
of synesthesia.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.970
I don't have it, but I
think it's amazing.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.770
To me, there's a certain

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.940
sharpnesses for certain numbers.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:38.650
HENRY REICH: My name's Henry.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.910
I make MinutePhysics videos.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.320
And my favorite number is j.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.290
MICHAEL STEVENS: My first kiss
wasn't until I was 18.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.810
So it was the last full year
I live before I knew

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.500
what lips felt like.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.630
CAITLIN HENDRICKSON: And I
always wanted to have a sweet

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.770
16 birthday party, which my
parents never gave me.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.020
But I'll make up for that maybe,
when I turn 30 in a

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.250
couple of years.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.000
MICHAEL STEVENS: Oh, then the
17th floor is the floor that I

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.120
lived on in New York, when
I lived in Brooklyn.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.080
But I almost actually lived on
the 16th floor, because the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.030
building skipped the 13th.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.236
The elevators went right from
11 to 12 to 14, 15, 16, 17.

00:04:19.236 --> 00:04:20.130
Boom.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.990
He's been with me my whole
life, basically.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.870
DESTIN: So certain numbers
are sharper than others.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.630
So, like, a 1 would
be kind of sharp.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.410
A 2 is very dull.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.060
But a 3 is very, very high.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.410
They have this sharpness
to them.

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.210
I don't know what it is.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.750
So it's like this.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.030
And if I take 3 and 7
and multiply them

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.930
together, I get 21.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.140
And for some reason, 21 seems
to be this very bright,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.070
cheerful, proper number.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.760
BRADY HARAN: So how high will 21
be on the sharpness scale.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.580
DESTIN: Oh, it's way up here.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.250
It's like, it's off the page.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.990
PATRICK JONES: Hi,
I'm PatrickJMT.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.180
And my favorite number,
or one of my

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.580
favorite numbers, is 1729.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.420
HENRY REICH: Now, before you say
j isn't a number, I mean,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.250
j is a number.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.150
COLIN GREGORY PALMER GREY: I'm
CGPGrey, and my favorite

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.930
number is 0.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:12.380
I like 0 because it's not
an obvious number.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.310
You can have counting
systems--

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.230
there's one thing, two things,
three things, four things.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.120
But mathematics existed for a
long time without having a 0

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.770
as part of it.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.780
So it's a number, but
it also isn't

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.410
anything in and of itself.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.700
VI HART: I'm Vi Hart.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.920
You have to tell me what a
number is if I'm going to

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.170
choose one.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.660
All right, I'm having
trouble with this.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:37.520
HENRY REICH: Similar to the way
i is the square root of

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.160
negative 1.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.120
But what it actually means is
that i squared is negative 1.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.040
J squared is plus 1.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.420
But j is not 1.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.520
COLIN GREGORY PALMER GREY: But
one of the other things that I

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.690
like about 0 is that it's the
kind of unsung workhorse of

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:50.760
the mathematical world.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.710
You have 0.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.240
And then if you want to make
10, you put a one in

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.210
front of that 0.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.660
And now we have 10 things.

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.360
And people focus on the 1.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.590
But it's really the 0 that
is doing all the work

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.910
to make that a 10.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.630
And then the same thing
with 100 or 100,000.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.990
We keep adding 0's.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.470
We keep adding nothing,
but making the

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.330
numbers much, much larger.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.840
VI HART: Students in school
are like, oh, what's i?

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.040
That's not really a number.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.240
And then there's j.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.060
j's a good one.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.280
It's already taken.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.570
BRADY HARAN: You know that
Derek-- you can see on there

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.440
that Derek chose i.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.080
You chose j.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.590
What's the difference?

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:25.820
Why'd you pick that one?

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.000
HENRY REICH: Who wants to pick
the team that's going to win

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.230
all the time?

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.950
Who wants to pick the New
York Yankees, you know?

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.255
You want to pick the underdog.

00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:33.590
You don't want to pick what
everyone else has

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:34.900
already gone for.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.360
VI HART: Star, which
is not a number.

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.820
It's like a number.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.760
The thing is it's smaller than
all the positive numbers, and

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.530
it's larger than all the
negative numbers,

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.020
but it's not 0.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.595
It gets confused with the 0.

00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:51.110
This is one of those weird
things you get in

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.040
combinatorial game theory.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.890
And I like it.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.190
I think the very not-numberness
of it, I think

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.550
that's what appeals about a lot
of these numbers to us,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.985
like the weirdness of j,
the weirdness of i, the

00:07:05.985 --> 00:07:07.000
weirdness of 0.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.670
COLIN GREGORY PALMER GREY: I
like 0's non-obviousness and

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:10.845
its incredible usefulness.

00:07:10.845 --> 00:07:13.010
BRADY HARAN: Does j exist?

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.340
HENRY REICH: Does j exist?

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.010
I mean, does any number exist?

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.620
-So what we're going to be
talking about today is whether

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.950
or not numbers exist.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.530
We're going to be thinking about
three different schools

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:26.750
of thought on this.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.720
BRADY HARAN: Don't forget to
leave your favorite number and

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.200
the reason under the video.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.640
And if you're wondering what
I'm going to do with this,

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.910
well, I don't exactly
know yet.

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.390
But when I decide, I'll probably
let you know via the

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:40.790
numberphile Facebook
and Twitter.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.360
So make sure you're following
us on there.
