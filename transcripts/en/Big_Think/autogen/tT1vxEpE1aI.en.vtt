are gutted and huge chunks of

finished you now have no brain in your

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920
finished you now have no brain in your
 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.639
finished you now have no brain in your
head and here's a robot with a complete

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649
head and here's a robot with a complete
 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.880

the most ambitious ways to transfer

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710
the most ambitious ways to transfer
 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.790
the most ambitious ways to transfer
consciousness from our body to another

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800
consciousness from our body to another
 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.339
consciousness from our body to another
body and then the question is is that

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349
body and then the question is is that
 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:14.550
body and then the question is is that
really you well there's another way to

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560
really you well there's another way to
 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.680
really you well there's another way to
do it and that way was explore

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690
do it and that way was explore
 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.240
do it and that way was explore
in the sixth day with Arnold

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250
in the sixth day with Arnold
 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.670
in the sixth day with Arnold
Schwarzenegger in that movie the bad

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680
Schwarzenegger in that movie the bad
 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.310
Schwarzenegger in that movie the bad
guys get killed but each bad guy was

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320
guys get killed but each bad guy was
 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.180
guys get killed but each bad guy was
cloned cloned and somebody was able to

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190
cloned cloned and somebody was able to
 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.390
cloned cloned and somebody was able to
somehow photograph all the memories of

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400
somehow photograph all the memories of
 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.080
somehow photograph all the memories of
our brain and insert these memories into

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090
our brain and insert these memories into
 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.810
our brain and insert these memories into
the clone now we don't know how to do

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820
the clone now we don't know how to do
 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.670

that obviously that's way beyond our

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680
that obviously that's way beyond our
 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.130
that obviously that's way beyond our
technology so don't expect Arnold

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140
technology so don't expect Arnold
 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.710
technology so don't expect Arnold
Schwarzenegger to come back fully formed

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720
Schwarzenegger to come back fully formed
 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.990
Schwarzenegger to come back fully formed
with all his memories as a clone that's

with all his memories as a clone that's
 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.270
with all his memories as a clone that's
not going to happen anytime soon however

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280
not going to happen anytime soon however
 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.280
not going to happen anytime soon however
the initial steps are once again being

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290
the initial steps are once again being
 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.220
the initial steps are once again being
made at Caltech for example they've been

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230
made at Caltech for example they've been
 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.270
made at Caltech for example they've been
able to take a mouse brain and look at a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280
able to take a mouse brain and look at a
 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.010
able to take a mouse brain and look at a
certain part of the brain where memories

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020
certain part of the brain where memories
 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.040
certain part of the brain where memories
are processed memories are processed at

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050
are processed memories are processed at
 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.380
are processed memories are processed at
the very center of our brain and they've

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390
the very center of our brain and they've
 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.240
the very center of our brain and they've
been able to duplicate the functions of

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250
been able to duplicate the functions of
 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.000
been able to duplicate the functions of
that with its chip so again this does

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010
that with its chip so again this does
 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.890
that with its chip so again this does
not mean that we can encode memories

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900
not mean that we can encode memories
 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.320
not mean that we can encode memories
with a chip but it does mean that we've

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330
with a chip but it does mean that we've
 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.430
with a chip but it does mean that we've
been able to take the information

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440
been able to take the information
 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.400
been able to take the information
storage of a mouse brain and have a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410
storage of a mouse brain and have a
 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.130
storage of a mouse brain and have a
silicon chip duplicate those functions

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140
silicon chip duplicate those functions
 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.040
silicon chip duplicate those functions
and so what Mouse consciousness created

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050
and so what Mouse consciousness created
 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.650
and so what Mouse consciousness created
in the process I don't know I don't know

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660
in the process I don't know I don't know
 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.970
in the process I don't know I don't know
whether there are mouse's conscious or

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980
whether there are mouse's conscious or
 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.850
whether there are mouse's conscious or
not but it does mean that at least in

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860
not but it does mean that at least in
 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.280
not but it does mean that at least in
principle maybe it's possible to

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290
principle maybe it's possible to
 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.680
principle maybe it's possible to
transfer our consciousness and at some

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690
transfer our consciousness and at some
 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.850
transfer our consciousness and at some
point maybe even become immortal
