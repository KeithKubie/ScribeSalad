00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.370
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the dome where today!

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.069
We're gonna be doing some experiments using salt and seeing what happens if we melt it down in our foundry some other channels have already

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.149
Done some experiments using molten salt, and I figured it was our turn to give it a shot so today

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.360
We're going to take a look at melting salt and see what we can learn about it

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.949
We'll see how long it takes to melt in our foundry, and we'll see how long it stays a liquid

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.369
We'll take a look at what it looks like when it is a liquid how thick is it?

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.389
What color is it and just try and learn what molten salt is like?

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.170
Of course we will need to be careful because table salt melts at almost

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:33.210
1500 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.270
So by the time its liquid is going to be dangerously hot

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.480
depending on how our

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.940
Experiments go today in the future

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.660
We may try pouring molten salt into things onto things or dipping things into the molten salt itself. Let's fire up the foundry

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.600
All right our salt is now molten and it took 17

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.749
Maybe 18 minutes to get to the point where it was really nice and liquid

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.580
And then we let it sit in our foundry for just a couple minutes more to make sure that we really got it up to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.260
Temperature now. I'll use the tongs

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.429
I'll take the whole crucible out of the foundry, and I'll set it on the bottom of a pot

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.660
I had turned over. That'll give us a nice metal base, so it will just burn the ground that it's sitting on

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.910
It might burn some of the coating on my metal pot but

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.640
It's hot

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.499
It's a quick demonstration of how hot this is is just piece of wood. Let's dip that in and see what happens to it

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.579
Instantly lights on fire let's try that again

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.769
Instantly lights on fire again. Take the metal tongs, and I dip those in

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.479
Light on fire

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.499
But they get coated with salt pretty nice. It's just a thin

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.399
layer of salt built up on the tongs right there as

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.299
It cools off. It's still putting off some orange glow

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.580
But it's getting less and less

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.690
And I'm starting to be able to see down through it like I can see the bottom of the crucible

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.890
So I think this stuff is pretty clear in terms of color. That's a very thin viscosity

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.790
The way that moves around in the container. It's almost water lightly

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.589
Salt is not so liquid once we scoop it out. I think it's definitely cooling down now we have almost like a salt

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.320
Slush, it doesn't look quite as warm, but you can see that it still burns the piece of wood almost immediately

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.809
So it is cooler, but it's not cold

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.389
Let's pour a little bit more salt on top of this and throw it back in the furnace get it back to nice and runny

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:06.159
This time we'll put the lid on

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.209
That might speed up the process the fact that our crucible is already extremely hot should also make it go faster

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:18.269
Over where we have the foundry inside the dome. It's actually quite dark

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.858
There's not a ton of light getting and except through the main door so we've moved over here by the door

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.589
To get a lot more light because the salt

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.289
I don't think will always be glowing orange that much

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.739
You may have seen that as soon as I took some of the salt out of the crucible

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.719
It didn't look like it was glowing anymore

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.099
And I think it's just because it was so dark that we could see that light being put off so to get a better sense

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.929
Of what it looks like with normal lighting we're gonna pour our salt into this pot over here

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.749
and see what color it is see how viscous it is and just

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.169
Learn about what happens if you pour it out of the crucible into another container

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.259
So just by bringing it over here into where we have a little bit more sunlight

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.918
Suddenly the crucible doesn't look like it's all glowing orange nearly as much

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:12.299
It's still very warm, and it's still putting off a little bit of orange color. That's considerably less all right so now

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.059
We've got our salt, which does still look orange in here?

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:18.899
But let's pour it out into our pot and see what color it looks there

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.079
Look how thin and runny that is is the liquid

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.699
I'm just gonna pour all of it here we go

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.710
There you go, that's not orange anymore, it's just

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.400
That really has the consistency of water or something

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.400
That's so thin wow it is rapidly cooling off though leave that you can see the salt forming on the sides

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.349
It's getting almost a slushy consistency already. It's only been a few seconds

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.510
And there you go now

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.129
It's starting to form into just crystals again the stuff that I poured onto the bottom of the pot

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.590
Cooled down first of course because it was in contact with the metal surface, and the metal surface was cool

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.240
And it's cooled down enough and started to shrink that I think it's just completely free

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.499
It's not stuck to the bottom of the pot. It's just a piece of salt

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.099
Shaking around in there. We also have this one High Point

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:24.540
That's right where I poured it on and I think because it was landing right there first sort of built up a little spot

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.839
This is pretty loose. Let's see if we can tip the whole thing out

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:36.069
Seems to come off our pot completely

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.900
Somewhat smooth on the bottom

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.830
pretty rough on the top

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.909
We can see that it no longer has the white color that the salt did when we're pouring it out of its container originally

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.149
I'm pretty sure that what is happening is our salt is actually

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:57.819
Picking up a little bit of the trace chemicals and elements inside our crucible and our crucible is made of graphite

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.250
So it could be pulling carbon right out of the graphite and that might be what's giving us this grey color

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.729
it also might have something to do with the cooling temperature and

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.639
Situation in which it forms back into a crystal. Well. It's making a lot of cool noises

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.699
It's making lots of clicking sounds and since it's sitting on top of the metal pot upside down

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:24.189
I think that's sort of amplifying our sound a little bit. There was a spot of salt here that splashed out

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:29.589
I'm not touching it either right now because it's still very hot I've got this little stick of ice

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.929
I think is probably an icicle okay

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.060
It's interesting a little white trail

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.449
I think that's where from a tiny bit of the salt gets dissolved and then recrystallizes quickly from the water

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.440
Salt and ice is fun to play with we might have to do some more experiments with that in the future all

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:07.409
Right our salt has now cooled down. It's been sitting here for

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:10.499
20-30 minutes to get to the point where it was safe to touch

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.459
I think so we now just have this biscuit of cooled salt

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:19.979
That's gone back to a crystal formation obviously no longer liquid, but it doesn't look like how it did before it melted

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:24.149
That's for sure. See it's about a quarter of an inch thick maybe a little less

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.190
I'm gonna crack it in half and see what looks like on the inside

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.909
We've got some interesting layers going on

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:37.109
This first layer here where it cooled most rapidly as it landed on the pan that almost looks like it's just a clear layer. I

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:42.089
Think you could almost see through that nice and smooth that first layer

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.359
Maybe a sixteenth of an inch thick and then we have some salt crystal

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.750
That is a little bit more opaque colored on the top half

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:52.560
So it's an interesting division, but we've definitely got a crystalline

00:07:53.139 --> 00:08:00.359
Structure that's formed here. It's some part of it. I'm not sure if salt is capable of cooling into a non crystalline structure or not

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.940
Not very durable I can pretty easily just break it in my hands

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.489
And it doesn't really seem like

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:14.759
it takes the shape of what I poured it into. This for example is the bottom and our pot is pretty smooth on the bottom but we've

00:08:14.759 --> 00:08:20.878
got lots of bumps and wrinkles and spots where it looked like as it cooled it sort of contorted a little bit, so

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.750
unfortunately, I don't think salt would make a very good casting material.

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:30.810
I've got one more test that I feel like I need to try inspired by poking that piece of poured out salt with our icicle

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.800
and watching how much it hissed and sizzled.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:39.570
I'm gonna try melting down some more salt and then dropping a piece of ice into the molten salt see what will happen.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.769
I suspect that the ice will turn the water and then to steam so fast

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:46.380
That it's kind of gonna make the salt spray out of there

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.929
so I'm gonna make sure that I can stand a good distance away as

00:08:49.029 --> 00:08:54.419
I drop that ice cube in there. Now this time, we're trying out the kosher salt, which

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:59.979
I think is pretty much exactly the same as the other salt is just slightly larger pieces

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.679
I've got a little chunk of ice on my shovel

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:09.069
And I'm gonna use that

00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:14.099
To drop the ice down into the molten salt because I don't want to be very close to it when it drops in in case

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.100
It splashes up everywhere

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:37.319
It popped right out I'm gonna drop it back in it rejects it every time

00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:49.888
You just keep jumping out. There's barely any salt in there all right one more time. I missed

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:56.949
That's funny

00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:59.699
You can see how much salt gets shot out

00:09:59.699 --> 00:10:05.579
These are little beads of salt that I think cooled down someone in the air because it's a cool down. They're probably still very hot

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:12.779
Not much salt left in our container at this point molten salt pretty fun to play with it's very fun consistency

00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:16.558
It glows orange as we take it out of the kiln at least while we're in the darkness of the dome

00:10:16.689 --> 00:10:18.689
It kind of rejected the ice, cube

00:10:18.689 --> 00:10:22.829
We drop that in and they were just pop right back out four times in a row that ice cube

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:27.659
Just got launched out of the crucible and it cools off very quickly after we pour it out

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:31.439
It's fun to see how it forms those crystalline structures on the inside

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:36.359
even though it gets a little bit dirty and doesn't have the same nice white color as it did when we poured it into the

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.179
crucible

00:10:37.179 --> 00:10:38.579
and speaking of crucibles

00:10:38.579 --> 00:10:44.878
I think we've now added a bit of molten salt that has solidified down onto the bottom of it that should ship off pretty easily

00:10:46.179 --> 00:10:48.509
Hey guys. Thanks for watching if you're not a subscriber yet
