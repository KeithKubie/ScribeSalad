00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.140
We're on problem 198.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:17.190
If 1/2 plus 1/3, plus 1/4 is
equal to 13/x, which of the

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.840
following must be an integer?

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.420
Fascinating.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.590
So let's see what
they're saying.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.940
I don't know.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.510
I'm tempted to just
work through this.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.150
So if I get a common denominator
here, the common

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.540
denominator is going to be 12.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.330
1/2 is 6/12 plus 4/12,
plus 3/12.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.110
6 plus 4, plus 3, is 13.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.470
So, that equals 13/12.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.080
So that tell us that
x is equal to 13.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.950
I'm sorry.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.950
That tells us that
x is equal to 12.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.510
It's the denominator.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.260
OK, so they give us a
couple of choices.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.140
Choice one, x/8.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.820
Is that an integer?

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.190
No, 12 divided by 8
is not an integer.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.400
It's 1 and 1/2.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.050
Choice two, x divided by 12.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.130
Is that an integer?

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.900
Yeah, sure.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.480
I mean 12 divided by
12 is equal to 1.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.980
So, that works.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.220
Choice three, x divided by 24.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.580
No, x is 12.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.700
So, x divided by 24 is 1/2.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.660
So, two only is the answer,
and that is choice B.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.430
Problem 199.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.510
And they have drawn a graph,
which I will draw.

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.390
So that's a y-axis.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.260
And there's an x-axis.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.790
And that's y.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.670
That is x.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.320
See, in the rectangular
coordinate system above, the

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.440
line, y equals x is the
perpendicular bisector of

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.510
segment AB, not shown.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.860
OK, so let me draw this
y equals x graph.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.420
Start there.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.720
Nope.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.820
I thought I was using the
line tool, but I'm not.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.970
Let me use the line tool.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.000
That's the y equals x graph.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.890
y is equal to x.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.160
And they draw point A.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.190
The place they drew it, it looks
like it's roughly at the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.460
point 2, 3.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.500
I don't know if that's going
to become relevant.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.530
2, 1, 2, 3.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.810
So A looks like it's
at the point 2,3.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.870
I don't know if we
can assume that.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.170
The line, y equals x, is a
perpendicular bisector of AB,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.720
and they don't show us B.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.140
And the x-axis is the
perpendicular bisector of BC.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.730
All right.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.720
Not shown.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.440
If the coordinates of point A
are 2 comma 3-- OK, we were

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.050
right; A is 2 comma
3-- what are the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.330
coordinates of point C?

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.270
OK, perpendicular bisector means
there's some line that's

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.100
exactly perpendicular to
this line, where it

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.850
splits it in half.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.410
So if you think about it,
point A is at 2, 3.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.070
So where would B have to be in
order for the line between A

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.950
and B to be perpendicular to
this line, and to be split

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.560
directly in half?

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.650
Well, it would be at the point--
I mean, you could just

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.140
eyeball it-- it'd be at
the point 3 comma 2.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.980
If we're at the point 3 comma 2,
there's a lot of, I guess,

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.090
intuitive reasons why you could
think that this would be

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.340
the perpendicular bisector.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.170
We know y equals x is a
perpendicular bisector.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.960
The first is, you can see that
the slope of this line-- you

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.970
could calculate it if you want--
the slope of this line

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.340
is negative 1.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.960
And I don't know if you remember
in calculus class,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.025
but if you have the slope of
one line-- so the slope of

00:03:35.025 --> 00:03:38.900
this line is 1-- the slope of
a perpendicular line will be

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.390
the negative inverse
of this slope.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.830
That's something that,
hopefully, you learned in

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.470
calculus-- oh, in algebra
a long time ago.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.110
So, the negative inverse
of 1 is negative 1.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.270
So this line has a slope
of negative 1.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.670
And you could make a bunch
of arguments for why it's

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.690
equidistant.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.720
Both of these points are on
the same line, and they're

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.490
equidistant from the
point 2 comma 2.

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.960
So that's why, you know, that
it's the bisector, that this

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.860
distance is equal to
this distance.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.800
And, frankly, on the GMAT,
you're doing it fast. You

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.370
don't have to do a
rigorous proof.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.210
You can eyeball it.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.640
You could say, oh, you know,
those are going to be equal.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.030
I'm just going to take the
mirror image and go on the

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.790
other side.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.020
So this is point B.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.130
And they tell us that the x-axis
is a perpendicular

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.930
bisector of segment BC.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.260
OK, so x is going to be

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.290
perpendicular to this new line.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.610
So this new line has to be
parallel to the y-axis.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.120
So this new line is going
to go like that.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.100
And whatever the distance is
between B and the x-axis has

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.800
to be the distance between
x-axis and C.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.200
So B is two above the x-axis, so
C is going to be two below

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.570
the x-axis.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.360
So that's where C is.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.450
And x, at that point,
is equal to 3.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.920
And so this y would be
equal to negative 2.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.220
So what are the coordinates
of point C?

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.680
3, negative 2.

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.450
And that is choice D.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:00.870
Interesting problem.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.200
Problem 200.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.200
A store currently charges
the same price for each

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.990
towel that it sells.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.530
If the current price of each
towel were to increase by $1,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.160
10 fewer of the towels could
be bought for $120,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.810
excluding sales tax.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.560
What is the current price
of each towel?

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.410
So let's say the current
price of each towel.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.570
So if we take 120 and we divide
it by the current price

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.990
of each towel, we could buy,
I don't know, n towels.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.050
Now, they're saying that if we
had $120, and if we were to

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.740
increase the price by $1-- so
now the new price is p plus 1;

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.860
now I can't buy n towels
anymore-- they're saying I can

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.370
only buy 10 fewer towels.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.920
So I can only buy n
minus 10 towels.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.590
Now we have two equations
and two unknowns.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.420
Well, they're not linear
equations, but I think we

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.130
should be able to solve them
one way or the other.

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:25.300
So here we get p times
n is equal to 120.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.190
And here, let's see, we can
multiply-- we have 120 is

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.620
equal to p plus 1,
times n minus 10.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:51.570
So that's equal to p times n,
minus 10p, plus n, minus 10.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.570
And so both of these are equal
to 120, so we could set them

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:55.590
equal to each other.

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.130
Both of these are
equal to 120.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.960
So we could use both
of these equations.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:09.800
Say pn is equal to pn minus
10p, plus n, minus 10.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.850
So let's see if we can make
any headway here.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.640
I could subtract pn
from both sides.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:26.116
So I get 0 is equal to minus
10p, plus n, minus 10.

00:07:26.116 --> 00:07:30.910
And let's see, I could add 10p
to both sides, and I get 10p

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:38.050
is equal to n minus 10.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.290
Well, what's n?

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.890
Actually, I shouldn't have
substituted like this.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:44.330
I'm kind of doing it
a little messily.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.810
But we can do another
substitution.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:51.870
n is equal to 120/p, so
that should help us.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.870
The real way I should have done
it is-- well, actually,

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.970
no, this is I think the
easiest way to do it.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.180
10p.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.350
n is 120/p.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.620
A lot of times you just have to
go forth with the algebra

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.670
and see what happens.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.100
Minus 10.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.520
And let's multiply both sides
of the equation by p.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:13.210
So you get 10 is equal-- sorry,
10p squared is equal to

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:17.890
120 minus 10p.

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.990
Let's divide both sides by 10
just to get rid of them.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.900
So you get p squared is
equal to 12, minus p.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.750
Let's take these on to
the left-hand side.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:32.320
So you get p squared plus p,
minus 12, is equal to 0.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.720
We have a quadratic.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.720
We can just factor it.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:41.260
That is p plus 4, times p
minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.290
What two numbers, when you
add them, equal plus 1?

00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:45.930
The coefficient there.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.050
When you multiply them they
equal negative 12.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:50.130
That's just practice you got
in algebra doing that.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:51.530
So that's p plus 4,
times p, minus 3.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:57.030
So p could be minus 4, or
p could be equal to 3.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.220
And p can't be might minus 4
unless he was giving away the

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.770
towels, he was paying people
to take the towels, which

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.920
isn't the case.

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:04.820
We're assuming that
price is positive.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.660
So the price had to be $3,
which, luckily enough, after

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.810
doing all that algebra,
is one of the choices.

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.360
Choice C.

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.200
Next question.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.780
201.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.120
I think I have time
to do this one.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.520
201.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:34.270
If the sum of n consecutive
integers is 0, --this is my ad

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.600
hoc notation-- which of the
following must be true?

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.900
n consecutive integers is 0.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.330
n must be an even number.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.410
So let's think a lot about,
like, our even

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.750
and odd type of talk.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:10:00.540
So we know that an even
plus an even is even.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:05.390
And we know that an odd plus
an odd is also even.

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:06.730
And you could prove
it to yourself.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.650
You could try a bunch
of numbers.

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.950
Or if you just write an odd as
2k plus 1, and you add it to

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:15.240
another 2m plus 1, 2k-- that
becomes 2 times k,

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.590
plus m, plus 2.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:18.980
So, that's an even number.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:20.430
It's divisible by 2.

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:22.460
So an plus an odd is even.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:25.530
And so the only way you're going
to get an odd number is

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:30.090
if you have an even
plus an odd.

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.690
Now, the only way you're going
to have an even plus an odd--

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.270
so we're summing n consecutive
numbers.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.950
So, I don't know, let's call
it number 1, plus number 2,

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:42.830
plus number 3.

00:10:42.830 --> 00:10:46.360
Let's think about it a couple
of different ways.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.710
If this number is odd, then this
number is obviously even,

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.310
and then this number is odd.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:59.990
Now, if we're taking the sum
of an even number, if n is

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:03.880
even, we're going to get the
same number of evens and odds.

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:10.010
So n could be 2.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.610
If n could be 2, we're going to
have one even and one odd

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:13.560
no matter what, right?

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.080
This could be odd.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.700
This could be even.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.710
Or this could be even and
this could be odd.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.210
And if n is 2, which is an
even number, we can very

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:23.780
easily-- you know an odd plus
an even is an odd number.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:32.750
So, they say if the sum of n
consecutive integers is 0--

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:33.670
oh, you know what?

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.240
I completely missed
that point.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.810
Let me continue this
in the next video.
