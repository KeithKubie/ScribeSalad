00:00:00.728 --> 00:00:01.789
Voiceover: What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:04.439
is discuss what it means to be a metal,

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:06.946
or metallic in nature.

00:00:06.946 --> 00:00:09.336
First, let's just think about the metals

00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:10.794
that we encounter in everyday life,

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:12.247
or based on our experience
the things that we

00:00:12.247 --> 00:00:14.625
associate with being a metal.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.004
The elements that really
jump out at us as metals

00:00:17.004 --> 00:00:18.649
or we always refer to,
"Hey, that's a metal,

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:23.421
"or that's metallic,"
are things like iron,

00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:31.699
or nickel, or copper, or silver, or gold,

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:32.786
or aluminum, or at least for me,

00:00:32.786 --> 00:00:34.374
these are the ones that
immediately pop out.

00:00:34.374 --> 00:00:37.062
I've seen these things before,

00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:40.035
and they all feel like metals to me,

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:43.158
but also think about what's
true about these things

00:00:43.158 --> 00:00:44.418
and as we'll see many other elements

00:00:44.418 --> 00:00:46.615
on the periodic table that give them

00:00:46.615 --> 00:00:47.660
this metallic nature.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.705
What do we associate with
having a metallic nature?

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:53.842
One is that these things can be shiny.

00:00:53.842 --> 00:00:56.199
These things tend to be shiny.

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.336
There's kind of a gloss
when light shines on it.

00:00:59.336 --> 00:01:00.691
They're not just kind of a matte color.

00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:02.942
They look metallic literally.

00:01:02.942 --> 00:01:04.296
That's sometimes a word
that's used for it.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.866
It has a metallic shininess to it.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.163
Another thing that we associate with it

00:01:08.163 --> 00:01:11.120
is that they tend to be fairly dense.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.168
If I take a metal, a block of a metal

00:01:13.168 --> 00:01:14.322
and if I drop it into water,

00:01:14.322 --> 00:01:16.519
I imagine that sinking, not floating

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:18.283
on top of the water.

00:01:18.283 --> 00:01:20.617
We also imagine them having a very high

00:01:20.617 --> 00:01:23.003
melting point, that they tend to be solid

00:01:23.003 --> 00:01:24.512
at room temperature.

00:01:24.512 --> 00:01:28.937
Solid at room temperature.

00:01:28.937 --> 00:01:31.388
As we'll see, this is true of all metals

00:01:31.388 --> 00:01:34.322
except for one of them which is mercury

00:01:34.322 --> 00:01:36.447
which is shiny but at room temperature

00:01:36.447 --> 00:01:41.249
as you might be familiar
is in its liquid form.

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.061
Now the other things that
I associate with a metal

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.657
is that I can make things out of them.

00:01:44.657 --> 00:01:47.886
I can bend them and shape
them in different ways.

00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:48.933
I think of aluminum foil.

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:49.652
I can bend it.

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:51.536
It's not just going to crack.

00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:54.265
I can bend it and put it
into different shapes.

00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:56.229
Even things like iron it might take

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:57.831
a lot of pressure to do it,

00:01:57.831 --> 00:01:59.959
but they're bendable, they're malleable,

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:02.654
and definitely things like
gold and silver and copper

00:02:02.654 --> 00:02:05.550
you can actually mold into
different types of jewelry.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.169
If you put pressure on it,

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:09.380
it's more likely to bend than crack

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.971
and just kind of shear off.

00:02:10.971 --> 00:02:15.463
So let's put malleability.
They're malleable.

00:02:16.162 --> 00:02:18.025
The other thing I associate with metals

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:20.270
is that they conduct electricity well.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.027
Conduct electricity.

00:02:24.027 --> 00:02:26.244
A place that you'll see metal in your life

00:02:26.244 --> 00:02:27.640
is if you open up your electronics

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.897
you'll see wires that might
be made out of copper,

00:02:29.897 --> 00:02:31.168
or you might have components that are made

00:02:31.168 --> 00:02:33.538
out of other metals like gold, or silver,

00:02:33.538 --> 00:02:35.689
or whatever else.

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.506
Given that these are
some of the properties

00:02:38.506 --> 00:02:40.068
that we associate with metals,

00:02:40.068 --> 00:02:41.171
let's think about what's happening

00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:45.060
at the atomic level to give these elements

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.531
these properties.

00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:48.816
The way I think about it let's just

00:02:48.816 --> 00:02:50.460
go with copper for a second.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.669
Let's just imagine a block of copper

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:55.426
at the atomic level.

00:02:55.426 --> 00:02:57.030
Let's say this is one copper nucleus

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.572
right over there,

00:02:58.572 --> 00:03:01.326
and it has its sea of electrons.

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:05.135
It has its sea of electrons,

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:06.380
or not its sea of electrons.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.673
It has all of its electrons
in their various orbitals.

00:03:08.673 --> 00:03:10.903
We'll talk about sea of
electrons in a second,

00:03:10.903 --> 00:03:12.951
but this is kind of its cloud of electrons

00:03:12.951 --> 00:03:14.056
I should say.

00:03:14.056 --> 00:03:15.747
So this is electron cloud.

00:03:15.747 --> 00:03:18.014
The electrons are just
jumping around in this cloud.

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:20.493
It's really a probability density,

00:03:20.493 --> 00:03:22.141
or there's kind of a certain probability

00:03:22.141 --> 00:03:24.695
that could be at any point in that cloud.

00:03:24.695 --> 00:03:27.946
Let's imagine a big solid piece of copper.

00:03:27.946 --> 00:03:30.540
You would have a bunch of these.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.632
You would have a bunch
of these all together,

00:03:34.632 --> 00:03:37.820
all forming the solid.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.343
What allows metals to be malleable,

00:03:41.343 --> 00:03:44.980
to do things like conduct electricity

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.259
which is the movement of electrons,

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:50.208
is essentially that they're very willing

00:03:50.208 --> 00:03:52.127
to share electrons with each other.

00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:54.568
By sharing electrons, so you can imagine

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:56.247
this is one copper atom
and that's another,

00:03:56.247 --> 00:03:58.297
let's say they're sharing some electrons,

00:03:58.297 --> 00:03:59.753
that's what allows the electricity

00:03:59.753 --> 00:04:01.825
or this flow of electrons to happen.

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.417
If these electrons are loosely bound,

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:06.922
then if you put a potential
difference of voltage,

00:04:06.922 --> 00:04:09.208
let's say that you put
a potential difference

00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:11.165
so that this side is more negative,

00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:13.193
and then this side is more positive,

00:04:13.193 --> 00:04:14.292
then the electrons are going to want

00:04:14.292 --> 00:04:15.773
to get away from the negative charge,

00:04:15.773 --> 00:04:18.019
and move towards the positive charge.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.892
If they're relatively freely bound,

00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:23.179
they can kind of move from one cloud

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.204
to the next.

00:04:24.204 --> 00:04:26.035
You kind of end up having
what's often called

00:04:26.035 --> 00:04:27.880
a sea of electrons.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.413
Let me write that down.

00:04:29.413 --> 00:04:36.668
You have a sea of
electrons which would make

00:04:36.668 --> 00:04:37.992
this conductive and that's why you see

00:04:37.992 --> 00:04:40.941
so much wire made out of copper.

00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:42.470
The sea of electrons is also what

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.077
makes it malleable.

00:04:44.077 --> 00:04:46.908
If someone on this side were to put

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:47.889
a lot of pressure this way,

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.306
and on that side put a
lot of pressure that way,

00:04:50.306 --> 00:04:52.789
things that are rigid
would just kind of crack

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.220
and break, right, would
just break right over there,

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.384
but because you have the sea of electrons

00:04:58.384 --> 00:04:59.573
it allows it to be malleable.

00:04:59.573 --> 00:05:01.512
This part might just
bend down a little bit,

00:05:01.512 --> 00:05:03.171
that part might bend up,

00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:05.183
but they're not going
to, the metallic bond

00:05:05.183 --> 00:05:07.137
is not going to break.

00:05:07.137 --> 00:05:08.932
Given that this metallic nature

00:05:08.932 --> 00:05:10.708
really comes from the willingness

00:05:10.708 --> 00:05:14.654
of these atoms to share
electrons with each other,

00:05:14.654 --> 00:05:16.590
to create the sea of electrons,

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.756
I encourage you to pause this video

00:05:18.756 --> 00:05:22.465
and think about which atoms
on the periodic table,

00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:24.536
or which elements are
more likely to do that,

00:05:24.536 --> 00:05:27.747
to share electrons with
others and with each other.

00:05:27.747 --> 00:05:29.187
Really, this is the same principle

00:05:29.187 --> 00:05:31.199
that we thought about ionization energy,

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.819
and electronegativity.

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:36.259
So pause the video.

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.661
I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:05:39.661 --> 00:05:42.939
So which elements are most likely

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:44.718
to share electrons?

00:05:44.718 --> 00:05:47.268
We've already seen that
if we're on the left side

00:05:47.268 --> 00:05:48.895
of the periodic table of elements,

00:05:48.895 --> 00:05:50.660
Group One for example,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.365
they only have one valence electron.

00:05:53.365 --> 00:05:54.519
It would be very hard for them

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:58.080
to get enough electrons to
complete that outer shell.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.097
If they get rid of that
one valence electron,

00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:02.826
they can go to a more stable state.

00:06:02.826 --> 00:06:05.744
They really want to give away electrons,

00:06:05.744 --> 00:06:07.634
and the ones over here, they're so close

00:06:07.634 --> 00:06:10.035
if we talk about the halogens,

00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:11.763
they're one electron away from completing

00:06:11.763 --> 00:06:12.844
their outer shell.

00:06:12.844 --> 00:06:14.617
They're greedy. They want
to hog these electrons.

00:06:14.617 --> 00:06:16.084
They tend to be electronegative.

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:17.803
The noble gases, they're done.

00:06:17.803 --> 00:06:19.508
They definitely don't
want to share electrons

00:06:19.508 --> 00:06:20.222
with anyone.

00:06:20.222 --> 00:06:22.965
They're kind of in a very stable state.

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:24.429
Now, the other thing
that we've talked about

00:06:24.429 --> 00:06:27.219
is as we go down a group,

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:30.752
our atoms are getting larger,
and larger, and larger.

00:06:30.752 --> 00:06:33.226
So the outermost, that 55th electron

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:35.950
in cesium is much more loosely bound

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.637
because it's further away than say

00:06:38.637 --> 00:06:40.615
the third electron in lithium.

00:06:40.615 --> 00:06:42.312
So just as we saw as the elements

00:06:42.312 --> 00:06:46.090
in this bottom left have a
very low ionization energy.

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:48.647
It doesn't take much energy to remove

00:06:48.647 --> 00:06:50.486
an electron from them,

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:52.219
these are the ones that are most likely

00:06:52.219 --> 00:06:53.037
to share electrons,

00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:55.920
and these actually have the
highest metallic nature.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:05.112
So high metallic, high metallic nature.

00:07:05.112 --> 00:07:07.847
The ones on the top right,

00:07:07.847 --> 00:07:09.740
these are going to be the opposite.

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.143
They're very unlikely to share electrons.

00:07:12.143 --> 00:07:14.058
They're very electronegative.

00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:16.558
They have a very high ionization energy.

00:07:16.558 --> 00:07:20.457
They have a low metallic nature.

00:07:20.457 --> 00:07:22.088
I could imagine some things are popping

00:07:22.088 --> 00:07:23.697
into your brain at this point.

00:07:23.697 --> 00:07:26.516
We started thinking of the elements

00:07:26.516 --> 00:07:30.784
that in our everyday life
we associate with metals,

00:07:30.784 --> 00:07:32.372
but what I'm saying is
that these things over

00:07:32.372 --> 00:07:34.330
have an even higher metallic nature,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.676
but what about something like calcium.

00:07:35.676 --> 00:07:37.940
Every day what I imagined
when I typically,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.834
or when a lot of people imagine calcium,

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:41.406
they think of kind of a chalky,

00:07:41.406 --> 00:07:43.957
a white chalky substance, very rigid,

00:07:43.957 --> 00:07:46.364
not very malleable, not very good,

00:07:46.364 --> 00:07:47.831
not very shiny, not very good

00:07:47.831 --> 00:07:48.879
at conducting electricity.

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:50.266
Based on what I just told you,

00:07:50.266 --> 00:07:52.220
this would have a higher metallic nature

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.379
than something like aluminum.

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:55.181
What you have to remind yourself

00:07:55.181 --> 00:07:57.738
is that what you see is
not actually pure calcium,

00:07:57.738 --> 00:07:59.356
that kind of chalky thing.

00:07:59.356 --> 00:08:01.024
That's calcium carbonate.

00:08:01.024 --> 00:08:02.758
Pure calcium, actually, this is actually

00:08:02.758 --> 00:08:04.798
a picture of pure calcium.

00:08:04.798 --> 00:08:09.287
It is shiny. It does have
these metallic properties.

00:08:09.287 --> 00:08:11.889
The general trend here
is that all of these,

00:08:11.889 --> 00:08:13.926
these are very high in metallic nature,

00:08:13.926 --> 00:08:15.491
and these are very low metallic nature

00:08:15.491 --> 00:08:16.759
which also makes you probably realize

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:19.151
while most of the periodic table

00:08:19.151 --> 00:08:20.993
is a metal of some form.

00:08:20.993 --> 00:08:22.778
If aluminum is a metal,

00:08:22.778 --> 00:08:24.748
and all of these things have a higher,

00:08:24.748 --> 00:08:27.780
have a higher metallic nature
than all of this stuff,

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.484
all of this stuff are metals,

00:08:29.484 --> 00:08:30.516
and that is the case.

00:08:30.516 --> 00:08:32.026
The S block, the D block, the F block,

00:08:34.655 --> 00:08:36.397
these are all metals.

00:08:36.397 --> 00:08:39.475
Then a good chunk of the P block,

00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:41.157
a good chunk of the P block

00:08:41.157 --> 00:08:43.816
are considered metals,
and then these are kind of

00:08:43.816 --> 00:08:46.661
sometimes referred to as metalloids,

00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:50.333
Only this section of the periodic table

00:08:50.333 --> 00:08:51.885
is not considered a metal.

00:08:51.885 --> 00:08:52.599
That makes sense.

00:08:52.599 --> 00:08:53.803
Nobel gases, they are gases.

00:08:53.803 --> 00:08:55.104
They don't, they're not very reactive.

00:08:55.104 --> 00:08:57.240
they don't bond so they don't form

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:58.783
kind of a structure that can even do

00:08:58.783 --> 00:09:00.155
this type of thing.

00:09:00.155 --> 00:09:02.344
These other ones over here even carbon

00:09:02.344 --> 00:09:05.168
when it is formed a lattice,

00:09:05.168 --> 00:09:07.908
it does not conduct electricity well.

00:09:07.908 --> 00:09:11.260
It tends to not be so malleable

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.987
if you think about
something like a diamond,

00:09:12.987 --> 00:09:14.785
or if you think about, well, a diamond

00:09:14.785 --> 00:09:16.648
might be the best example of that.

00:09:16.648 --> 00:09:18.352
Anyway, hopefully this gives you a sense

00:09:18.352 --> 00:09:21.205
of metallic nature and the trends

00:09:21.205 --> 00:09:22.255
in the periodic table.

00:09:22.255 --> 00:09:25.171
High metallic nature, and
as you go to the top right,

00:09:25.171 --> 23:59:59.999
lower and lower metallic nature.
