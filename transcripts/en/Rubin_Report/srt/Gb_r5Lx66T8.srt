1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,290
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,270
joining me today as an entrepreneur.

3
00:00:06,271 --> 00:00:10,350
There are co founder of clarity capitol
and the author of God in the crowd,

4
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:14,550
21st century Judaism talking and welcome
to the Rubin report. Thank you, Dave.

5
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,850
So there's a lot that I want to talk to
you about here because I mentioned to

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,060
you right before we started that most
of the conversations that I've had here

7
00:00:21,061 --> 00:00:25,620
about religion have come from
a Christian perspective. Uh,

8
00:00:25,621 --> 00:00:29,910
so adding a Jewish element to this I
thought would be interesting. Uh, your,

9
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,160
your story is kind of fascinating.

10
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:37,161
You're a Jew from Florida and yet your
religious awakening was because of a

11
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:41,860
Christian minister in New England. Am I
getting that correct? Yeah, that's right.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,230
Let's start there.

13
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,380
So I, I grew up in boarding
schools, mainly New Hampshire,

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,230
so born in Florida and grew up
there until age 10. But then, uh,

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:51,820
then New Hampshire and um,
you know,

16
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:56,470
I got into Judaism for today describes
as the wrong the wrong reasons. Uh,

17
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,310
I don't know if you've seen the picture
of the boy in the Warsaw ghetto with his

18
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:04,680
hands, kind of iconic picture that I
saw that when I was 16 years old and it

19
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,760
immediately became where there was looking
at the picture wrong. You know, it's,

20
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:11,990
it's, it's framed in a way that almost
begs this juxtaposition between the,

21
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:15,400
the boys innocence and it
was six or seven years old,

22
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:18,070
angelic face and the Nazi barbarism.

23
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,560
You can see on the right
side of the picture you've
got the Nazis and with their

24
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:24,310
guns pointed in his, in his
direction. And that never spoke to me.

25
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,550
And I tried to muster anger and
hatred for these Nazis. I couldn't,

26
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,850
all I saw was irrelevance.
You know, this, you know,

27
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:32,320
I didn't have a good
sense of Jewish history,

28
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:34,900
but enough of a sense to realize this is,
that was just,

29
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:38,260
that generation is manifestation
of an age old phenomenon.

30
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:42,210
The cheese just keeps coming back. It was
in Iraq during the far, who'd you know,

31
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,630
two years earlier. It was with Russian
Cossacks, you know, 30 years earlier this,

32
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,710
this keeps happening.
Um,

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,850
but if you look at the left side of
the picture and you can Google it,

34
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:54,070
boy in the Warsaw ghetto, I think
it's the first thing that comes up.

35
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,250
You see the boy's family
and they're being,

36
00:01:57,251 --> 00:01:59,260
I think that evacuated from the building.

37
00:01:59,261 --> 00:02:04,030
This is the liquidation of the ghetto
in 1943 and they're in this state of

38
00:02:04,031 --> 00:02:05,550
shocked submission.
Uh,

39
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,870
you've see it in their body
language and their expressions.

40
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,870
And I was furious at them for having
aggregated their responsibility to this

41
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:17,320
boy. How could they not have had a
contingency plan there? The Jews had,

42
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:21,130
they convinced themselves that they were
Polish and here they were about to be

43
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:23,560
marched off to their deaths. As far as
I know, everyone in that picture was,

44
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:26,800
was dead within, within weeks. Um,

45
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,520
but it only took me a week to realize
I'm probably as close as h in age to the

46
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:36,790
parents as I entered the child.
What's my contingency plan?

47
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:41,890
And for the first time I started thinking
of myself as a Jew and I come from a

48
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:43,990
typical American home. All three
of my older brothers, married,

49
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:45,640
non Jewish women were,

50
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,060
we were pretty much shake out
the way American Judaism does.

51
00:02:49,061 --> 00:02:52,410
And we had no training. I had no
familiarity with Judaism at the time.

52
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,210
So you didn't grow up religious
in any particular right now

53
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,350
I guess not if you going
to boarding school in the
northeast. Right, right. Yeah.

54
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,423
So,

55
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:03,790
so what happened then? You
have this wake up. So I,

56
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:07,420
so Reverend Thompson was the school
chaplain. It was a, if Exeter,

57
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:10,960
it's a prep school in New Hampshire.
Uh,

58
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,680
he was a congregationalist minister.
It's a branch of Calvinism.

59
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:19,040
That was the kind of original religion
in the Massachusetts Bay colony.

60
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,350
Very open, very old testament focused. Um,

61
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:28,210
and he knew a lot about Judaism and he
arranged a, a weekly Shabbat dinner,

62
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,020
uh, for the, for the Jewish kids,
which I started going to after that.

63
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:35,440
It never really meant anything to me up
until that, that, that, that, that moment,

64
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,890
um, and got me into, I don't know if
it's exactly a religion, but a, a,

65
00:03:40,891 --> 00:03:45,010
a sort of a spirituality that's tied to
this ritual of Shabbat as sort of a mode

66
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:47,770
shift. Um, and you know,

67
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:50,320
from that point I kind of
dug into everything I could,

68
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:53,320
took every class that had to do with
Judaism. I read them the Old Testament.

69
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,120
I can,
um,

70
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,270
never became a believer in the
kind of classical sense in,

71
00:03:59,271 --> 00:04:02,230
in the god of scripture. I'm
still still haven't, haven't, uh,

72
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,960
been able to, to access that,
but found my way to Israel,

73
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,670
uh, through that. Yeah. And you ended
up in the Israeli air force. Yeah.

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:18,130
Yeah. That's quite a jump from strangers
to face. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

75
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,950
What was that like? Um, we're just doing
the biographical stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

76
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,030
Uh, you know, it, it certainly,
it wasn't the plan. I mean, I, I,

77
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,950
I became enamored with Zionism on
a summer tour, kind of a, on a,

78
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,260
something like a birthright type program.

79
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,510
The summer after I saw that
picture and I fell in love.

80
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:42,840
I think that's the best way
to describe it. You know,

81
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,250
suspended pretty much all logic.

82
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,310
And I think the notion that got me is
this was the opposite of what I saw in

83
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:54,070
that picture. And it took me until
the end to realize that, that the,

84
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:57,550
that the thing that struck me the most
was the lack of dignity in that picture.

85
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,040
We had no agency,
we were just victims.

86
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:03,490
And it was just such a terrible way to
kind of define ourselves and think of

87
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:06,940
ourselves as a people.
And you know,

88
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:10,960
when I asked Jewish friends at Exeter
or even my, my, my family, you know,

89
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,220
is there a contingency plan? What do
we do? And my grandfather was German.

90
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:19,090
I think he conceived of himself when he
was, you know, my age at the time, uh,

91
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,360
as German way before he was Jewish,
until he was notified.

92
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:26,120
You're no longer German. Uh, and
luckily that happened in 1936 and 1990,

93
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,910
39 so he could still leave. Um,
what happens if we get that call?

94
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,450
What's our, what's our plan? And people
thought that was a crazy question.

95
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:34,870
That's just not,

96
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,080
it's just not a pleasant thing to have
to think about who talks about that.

97
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,090
And in Israel,

98
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:44,050
I saw people who had not just asked that
question with all the courage that it

99
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:46,700
takes to, you know, you need to
muster in order to ask. But they,

100
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:50,710
they'd answered it and he was dignity
and it was, it was intoxicating to me.

101
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,300
And so I,
I,

102
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,050
at that point I think realized I was
going to make my way somehow to Israel

103
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:59,570
whether I was going to live there
or just be very involved. Um,

104
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,090
and when I finally did move,
you know,

105
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:06,890
I understood that military service was
kind of the ticket to full membership. Um,

106
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:10,130
and so I, I did what
I was told. I ended up

107
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,030
and, but ending up in the air force is
not an easy route for that ticket. Yeah.

108
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:16,670
Turns probably the most complex
route, I would imagine. Yeah, it was,

109
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:19,190
at the time it was, it was
very calm, very complicated,

110
00:06:19,191 --> 00:06:20,140
and it certainly wasn't an nap.

111
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:24,780
She'll fit. Uh, for me, I'm required a lot
of, a lot of adjustments along the way.

112
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,150
Um, but, uh, but that, that,
that is where I ended up. Yeah.

113
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,690
And kind of what I think brought me to
the book ultimately is that, you know,

114
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,400
I found myself,
um,

115
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,680
it's such a focused and
intense experience, you know,

116
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:43,510
the academies is just extremely, uh, um,

117
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,440
it's just a concentrated source of
knowledge and skills dump. Uh, and,

118
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,020
and it doesn't let up after you,

119
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:54,780
you graduate that I really never had
time to examine what is this, what, what,

120
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,010
what exactly am I pursuing?
What is Judaism? What is
Israel? I didn't know Israel.

121
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,690
I knew a very narrow cut,

122
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,800
the kind of the several hundred people
in the aircrew community and he was,

123
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:07,070
so that's why I knew it was Israel for
me. And it's not reflective of, of,

124
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:12,070
of society. And you know,
it took me probably,

125
00:07:12,071 --> 00:07:15,930
you know, eight or nine years of service
to kind of step back and say, okay,

126
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:19,770
now can I at the time to
investigate what this is. Um,

127
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,890
and that was actually a moment of crisis
because I had already done things that

128
00:07:22,891 --> 00:07:27,390
I couldn't take back. I mean,
you know, there's a very
combat intensive decade, uh,

129
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,870
the 1990s in Israel. Um, you know what,

130
00:07:31,871 --> 00:07:35,460
what it started sort of as a romantic
sort of teach for America or Peace Corps

131
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:40,410
type type adventure for a college kid
ended up being something that I couldn't,

132
00:07:40,411 --> 00:07:40,951
couldn't erase.

133
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:44,790
There's things I could not take back and
I had to really understand what it is

134
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:48,360
that, that I was, I was doing there
and I started kind of a search.

135
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:50,230
And what is Judaism exactly?
Yeah.

136
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,080
All right.
So that's a perfect set up on a,

137
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:54,480
on a personal note for everything that
the book is about and that we're going to

138
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:54,871
talk about here.

139
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:57,690
So first I was trying to think of the
right way to do this interview because

140
00:07:57,691 --> 00:08:01,890
it's a little weird talking about Judaism
in a religious sense because it's an

141
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:04,680
ethnicity and a culture and a religion.

142
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,810
And usually when people
are talking about religion,

143
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:09,870
you can remove those two other things
because people are from all parts of the

144
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:13,770
world. And have different, uh, you
know, traditions and all of that,

145
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:18,480
but Jews have the same traditions and
those are at least at some level related

146
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:19,410
to religion and all that.

147
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:24,411
So what's the easiest way to start that
conversation about culture and tradition

148
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:27,810
and religion? All, all in one mixed bag?

149
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:32,880
Well that is very much at the heart of
this book is that we were called upon the

150
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:37,881
generations of Jews who are alive today
are called upon to redefine Judaism.

151
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,750
And the, and what kind of the
premise I start with is in our story,

152
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,270
it's almost a 4,000 year story.

153
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:49,890
We have two episodes of fundamental
reinvention Judaism's constantly evolving.

154
00:08:49,891 --> 00:08:52,290
We've always changed. There's no
generation that it'd be quite the same.

155
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,240
Judy's with their kids that they
inherited from their parents,

156
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,760
but there were two
fundamental reinventions.

157
00:08:56,761 --> 00:09:01,530
One is the exodus where we leave Egypt
unclear what we are exactly where some

158
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:04,830
group, but it's unclear
exactly what, what it is. Um,

159
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,050
and 40 years later arrive in the
promise land with sovereignty,

160
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:10,561
right?

161
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:13,860
We control ourselves and we're governed
by a book of law which will stay with us

162
00:09:13,861 --> 00:09:17,400
for, for as long as I've story
laughs and it's still with us today.

163
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,120
It's a fundamental reconfiguration
of, of, of what this is,

164
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:25,910
what this enterprise is Judaism. And
the second is the Roman expulsion, uh,

165
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,160
from, from Israel. And in the year one 35,

166
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,620
which is a bright,

167
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:35,400
the end of sovereignty in Israel at the
end of a geographic cause you didn't all

168
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:39,570
show up there in 1948.
We did that later. Okay,

169
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:42,090
let's just dispel that right
now. Yes, we for exactly. Okay.

170
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,500
So here we are a people configured very
much like any other people around us,

171
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:49,920
the Phoenicians and Nabataeans, we looked
like any province of the Roman Empire,

172
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:54,370
uh, in, in, in most
ways. And then off we go,

173
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:58,080
we're scattered to hundreds
of nodes around the world, uh,

174
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:02,430
with an already complex orthodoxy that
was to continue evolving dramatically

175
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:06,990
over the next 2000 years. No
central conductor, no pope.

176
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,840
The officiating over our evolution.

177
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,690
Almost no contact between
most of the notes, right?

178
00:10:12,691 --> 00:10:15,540
If you are often some shtetl in
Poland and I was in Casa Blanca,

179
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,450
we didn't even know about each other
and we certainly were not in touch with

180
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,830
each other for most of that period.

181
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:26,820
What I would bet against the idea that
there'd be a coherent identity called Jew

182
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,700
1800 years after that
event. It is, you know,

183
00:10:29,701 --> 00:10:32,910
it's something that I think
bears in investigation. Um,

184
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,670
but you think there's a reason for that.
And that's what this book is about. I do.

185
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:39,710
And I think that was the
second fundamental reinvention.
We, we're not, we, we, we,

186
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:43,020
we reconfigured ourselves at that point
where we became a people that was about

187
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,050
a set of questions and
debating a set of questions,

188
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:48,990
ethical questions at
which we still do today.

189
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,800
I think we're on the eve of a
third fundamental reinvention.

190
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,210
And that comes from the fact,
or were, or at least the,

191
00:10:57,211 --> 00:11:02,211
what I posit is that antisemitism is no
longer defining force for the Jews for

192
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:06,000
1800 years. It was we most,
for most of that period,

193
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:09,720
we didn't have the choice to be, you
know, we talk about religion, you know,

194
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,540
we use the word faith and religion sort
of interchangeably in the United say,

195
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,720
Hey, there's not a central
component of Judaism. Uh,

196
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,250
it not in the way we define ourselves
and not the way we were defined. Know,

197
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,230
no one asks you what you believe before
you stepped into the gas chambers, right?

198
00:11:22,231 --> 00:11:24,510
That was a, you could be
secular, you could be an atheist,

199
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:27,520
you can be getting matter. You were
a Jew. So it wasn't a religion,

200
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,540
it wasn't a faith. Uh, that, that,
that, and I think in that sense,

201
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:33,060
the Nazis got us right
in many ways is it's not,

202
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,480
not really about whether
we believe or not. Um,

203
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,780
which is why they're seemingly
are so many Jewish atheist,

204
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,800
which we can get into how that works and
has worked throughout Jewish history.

205
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:47,970
I mean, faith is not a precondition
to, uh, to Jewish observance,

206
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:52,920
even orthodox Jewish observance. But
what we're facing today, I think is,

207
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,900
is certainly not precedented
in the last 2000 years,

208
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,220
is that 90% of us live in the
United States and in Israel.

209
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,070
Two jurisdictions that I think are
largely devoid of antisemitism in,

210
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,110
in any practical day to day way.
I, I have, uh, you know, uh,

211
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,050
maybe a correction is on the left.

212
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,810
There is something happening today
that we should maybe talk about.

213
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:16,860
It's a fault in the book. I'm,
I'm maybe too dismissive of, of a,

214
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,760
of that and I hope it's a
passing, you know, fed. But
essentially in this country,

215
00:12:21,761 --> 00:12:23,470
being Jewish is a choice today.

216
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,970
It wasn't for our grandparents generation
were Jewish kind of in the sense that

217
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:31,300
you are in Europe today, right? If you're
French, a French Jew, you're a Jew.

218
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,360
I mean to, to, to, to other French people
that, that, that, that that's how we're,

219
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:38,890
we're, we're, uh, looked at, in this
country, you are truly an American.

220
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,040
And in Israel you are truly Israeli.
Judaism is a choice.

221
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,620
That's our challenge.

222
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,160
It's a huge opportunity because for the
first time I think we can write our own

223
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:51,010
script throughout the Jewish world,
not just in Israel.

224
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,060
We can decide what this is,
what is this enterprise. Um,

225
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,190
but it's also a threat because right now
and if we see what's happening in this

226
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:02,230
country and it's much easier
to track it in this country,

227
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:07,930
we're voting with our feet.
We are marrying ourselves
out of existence. Uh, which,

228
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,900
you know, the, for the First Section of
the book, sculpture, there'd be Jews.

229
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,950
I think we have to start with
that fundamental question
and ask it honestly and

230
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:15,700
bravely.
Yeah.

231
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,490
So, so why is your answer
to that question? Yeah.

232
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:21,730
Because I think a certain amount of
people would say, all right, well that,

233
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:23,950
so I would,
I was going to ask you this at the end,

234
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:26,230
but when I had my first sit
down with Sam Harris, who's,

235
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,980
who's obviously one of the most well
known atheists, but he was born Jewish,

236
00:13:29,981 --> 00:13:33,190
I don't think he considers himself
Jewish in a, in any real sense,

237
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:36,430
but I don't want to speak for him
specifically. We did talk about this.

238
00:13:36,431 --> 00:13:40,210
There's a couple of years ago and he
said that there would be a nice end story

239
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:40,841
to the Jews,

240
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:44,200
which is that they would all give up on
all of the superstition and all the rest

241
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:46,120
of it and just sort of evolve out of it.

242
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:50,590
And that would be a pleasant ending
that that's his basic premise on that.

243
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:54,730
But that's not your premise. Um, so
I'd love to hear, so why is the answer

244
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,820
well for what I think I would agree
with is if we are going to end,

245
00:13:57,821 --> 00:13:59,770
that's the best way to do it for sure.

246
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,460
Okay. Uh, the atheist is the dreamer,

247
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,470
but, but I would say,
look, I mean, when I,

248
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,140
when I look at what Sam Harris
has, I think tried to do,
um, over time, which to me,

249
00:14:12,141 --> 00:14:13,400
and I don't know if he'd put it this way,

250
00:14:13,401 --> 00:14:16,910
but to me it's very much a inventing
a religion that doesn't require faith,

251
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,710
right? Or an ethical system. Maybe
religion is, is the wrong word. And that,

252
00:14:21,711 --> 00:14:25,390
you know, there's a lot that's wired in
us from the Savannah, right? A lot of of,

253
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:30,020
of, of, of altruism, altruism
and morality that is wired.

254
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,470
And let's build on that. Let's take
the golden rule as a sort of a, as a,

255
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:38,210
as a starting point. Um, and,
and build on that. I like that.

256
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,640
I think the issue with it is,
you know,

257
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,500
I use the wisdom of crowds
as a, as, as a sort of,

258
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:49,400
as a framework for Jewish governance
in diaspora. And I believe in that.

259
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:53,290
I think there is something
quite compelling about this
notion of, of, of, of, of,

260
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:57,150
of a group defining itself in governance
and governing itself through, uh,

261
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:02,070
through crowd wisdom. It's a great kind
of noise cancellation, um, uh, mechanism.

262
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:02,990
And this is what you'd say is,

263
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:07,130
is sort of the lack of the top down part
of Judaism because there is no pope,

264
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:11,450
not everybody's or we're not all pointing
one way for this or looking for wisdom

265
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:14,170
in that direction. Correct. It's
coming from the people. Yeah. It's,

266
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:17,270
it requires diversity,
requires independent thought that,

267
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,960
that that's Jewish at it's [inaudible].

268
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:20,650
Hmm.

269
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,900
One of the issues and you see
this in markets all the time,

270
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:25,510
markets at the end of the day,
financial markets are, are you know,

271
00:15:25,511 --> 00:15:29,050
in in many ways an exercise in, in crowd
wisdom. We're trying to divine the truth.

272
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:30,370
What is the value of that stock?

273
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:32,950
What is the present value of
future earnings of this company?

274
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,950
That's what we're all trying to
guess at, uh, at, at its essence.

275
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:40,110
And one thing you'll find is
if you look at it long term,

276
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,840
if you look at chart the s and p 500 for
the last hundred years, all right? Uh,

277
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,900
you'll see that the incredible
how closely, you know,

278
00:15:46,901 --> 00:15:50,380
if you look at the actual present value
of future earnings and retrospective of,

279
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:54,220
of the, of the securities in
that, in that, in that index, uh,

280
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:58,480
you'll find that the market is incredibly
good at getting it right over long

281
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:02,800
periods of time. But zoom in on any
short timeframe, right? Three years,

282
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,560
five years, it's always
wrong, almost always wrong.

283
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,080
The market is almost always wrong
in, in, in the, in the short term.

284
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,460
So the notion of, of inventing a, a,

285
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,470
a code of ethics from scratch leaves
us hostage to the sensibilities of our

286
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:21,220
generation. You know, I often has
to tell it's a tough question say,

287
00:16:21,221 --> 00:16:26,200
but had I been born a Lutheran in
Germany, uh, and come of age in the 1930s,

288
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,750
can I say I would definitely would
not have joined, uh, the, uh, that,

289
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:31,180
that the Nazi movement,
of course not most people,

290
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,950
most people are verbal question to face,

291
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:34,690
but I think it's an important
one to think about it, right?

292
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,290
So we're all hostage to kind of
the prevailing winds of our era.

293
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,840
What I think Judaism does and the reason
I think it has valued not just to Jews

294
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:46,150
but,
but to humanity is it as a

295
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:52,860
methodically recorded history of
the evolution of our ethics as,

296
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,110
as, as, as a species, right? It's a,

297
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:59,810
it's a critically important reference
point and it's a unique reference.

298
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:03,890
Right now there's a record of, of papal
edicts that also goes back a long way.

299
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:08,150
And I think it's also extremely
valuable. It's different though, right?

300
00:17:08,151 --> 00:17:12,110
It's the opinion of one man,
very learned man in general. But,

301
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,730
but it's one man.
Well,

302
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,770
we have now is a snapshot of the crowd
wisdom of a generation on questions that,

303
00:17:18,861 --> 00:17:19,694
you know,

304
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,920
and Judy is always [inaudible] always
great about kind of highlighting the,

305
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,670
the two tensions, right? Hillel
and Sean, you go into a wedding,

306
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:30,710
you're introduced to the bride, uh, and
the people or person introduced me as his,

307
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,530
isn't she beautiful? And you don't think
she's beautiful. What do you say? Okay,

308
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:38,070
so Sean, I will say, well, the, the most
important guiding ethic is truth, right?

309
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,680
Honesty is, is, is a,
is a, is a critical, uh,

310
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,020
value that we be pursuing. I would come
down on the side of tell the truth. No,

311
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:48,850
I don't think you're beautiful.
That's a tough one. At the wedding,

312
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,230
the wedding yellow was saying how humanity
is a more understand that honesty I'm

313
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:58,020
giving you to do for sure.
I, I get your point. However,

314
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:01,250
here's where I think the optimism that,
that, that is the exercise of Judaism.

315
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:04,140
It has been. Um, uh, I, I think forever,

316
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,850
but we've recorded a history of the
evolution of the both the consensus views

317
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,530
and the dissenting views on a host
of topic. That is Tom would, that is,

318
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:14,610
that is that exercise.

319
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,720
So when we use a term like justice today,

320
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,590
justice is not a natural phenomenon.
It's a human invention.

321
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,960
And we could have invented
in a lot of different ways.

322
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,520
We did invent it in a
lot of different ways,

323
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,060
are kind of prevailing concept of justice
100 years ago is quite different from

324
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:30,894
what it is today.

325
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,010
And let's have the humility to admit
that a hundred years from now we will

326
00:18:35,011 --> 00:18:37,410
probably evolve significantly further.

327
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,830
The fact that we have a record of
the trajectory of that evolution,

328
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,610
I'll show some justice, but on,
on hundreds of ethical questions.

329
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:48,560
That's a gift of Judaism. And to
me personally, I've yet to meet.

330
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:52,100
It's a privilege to be a
link in that chain. I, I want
that. I mean, that's, that,

331
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:55,380
that's exciting to me. So that is why
when you have three Jews at the table,

332
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:59,130
you have four opinions based on 100%
yes, that's right. It's annoying,

333
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,500
but it's got,

334
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,800
it was loud and there's a lot of
yelling involved. So, all right,

335
00:19:03,801 --> 00:19:05,450
so there's a lot to do there,

336
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:08,750
but let's just go to the god
part of that first because,

337
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,240
because there is this
interesting phenomenon with,

338
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,960
with I think Jews describing
themselves as Jewish atheist.

339
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,650
That's all right. Um, and, uh,

340
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,730
how I think the average person
hearing that would go, well,

341
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:21,630
how does that make any sense?

342
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:25,260
How can you say you were a member of
a religion if you don't believe in the

343
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:26,650
basic tenant of the religion,
right?

344
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,550
You could open up any old testament or
any book that they're going to have at

345
00:19:29,551 --> 00:19:32,640
any synagogue in anywhere,
a lot about God.

346
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:37,080
So how can you be a Jew and then not
necessarily believe, uh, be a believer?

347
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,010
Well, so I think the,
the notion of, of God in,

348
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:45,460
even in Jewish scripture is
actually quite fluid, right? The,

349
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,580
it's not just some guy with a beard
who cares about what you eat. Right?

350
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,900
We refer to that entity and the masculine
and the feminine in the singular and

351
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:57,560
the plural. It's a very
evolving, uh, notion.

352
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,130
And as we get to kind of
the Post Biblical era,

353
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:05,990
I think some of the greatest Jewess sages
of history have questionable faith in

354
00:20:05,991 --> 00:20:09,150
the god of scripture. My monities
himself I'm not convinced is a,

355
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,700
is a true believer in the god of scripture
as, as laid out in the Old Testament.

356
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,870
Um, what I, I do think
though is there is a,

357
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:22,750
there's tremendous value in having a, a
reference point. And to me the notion,

358
00:20:22,751 --> 00:20:27,020
and I think a lot of, um, may
be more, more devout people
will take issue with it.

359
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,360
I understand that and that this is kind
of part of the debate that we have to

360
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:30,194
have

361
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:36,670
an invented God can be just
as meaningful and as valuable,

362
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,920
certainly as a spiritual rallying point,
as a revealed God.

363
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,790
And we can actually work together if
you're a true believer, so to speak.

364
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,790
And I'm not, we can work together. I've
been thinking in terms of, uh, of, uh,

365
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,740
if you and I start a business that makes
circles, that's, that's our product. Uh,

366
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,080
anybody can come in and
order a circle of any size.

367
00:20:53,081 --> 00:20:55,990
You just tell us the radius and we'll
make your, your, your, your, your circle.

368
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,530
We need a point to draw that sort
of circle around, right? Yeah.

369
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,020
We need a point in a radius.
That's it.

370
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,460
Now I could be of the view that we
can put that point on the ceiling,

371
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:09,760
on the floor in space. It doesn't
matter. It really doesn't matter.

372
00:21:09,761 --> 00:21:12,340
As long as we have the radius and a point,
we can make the circle.

373
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,960
You can be of the view that no,

374
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:17,200
I'm sorry that this circle is not kosher
unless the point around which is drawn

375
00:21:17,201 --> 00:21:20,800
is right in the middle of that wall.
We can work together because, okay,

376
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:23,230
so let's do it. Or I don't care where
it goes. You do care where it goes.

377
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:25,690
Let's put it where you want
it. That's fine. As long as,

378
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:28,630
and this is an exercise very
much in love and in humility,

379
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,750
as long as you're okay with the
idea that I think you're crazy,

380
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,640
but that it needs to be in the middle,
that wall.

381
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:38,620
And I'm okay with you think I'm a heretic,
that, uh, that I, I don't, I don't care.

382
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,040
The result is the same. We have our
circle and we can work together.

383
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:46,380
And in many ways I think that is,
that is Judaism. And if, you know, we,

384
00:21:46,381 --> 00:21:50,680
we've conflated faith with religion in
this country and that's a very Christian

385
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,150
notion. It's not a Jewish notion. We,

386
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:57,040
faith is not really a critical
part of, of, of, of Judaism.

387
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,570
So does that explain why someone like
Albert Einstein who certainly, you know,

388
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,490
God doesn't play dice
with the universe who,

389
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,830
so he wasn't a believer in
any sort of traditional sense,

390
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,250
although maybe in the way that
you are describing it. Um,

391
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,000
he was extremely proud of being Jewish
and who was almost the president that he

392
00:22:12,001 --> 00:22:14,490
was going to be the first
president of Israel. Um,

393
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,050
and obviously he lived through a
Germany during the Holocaust. So, um,

394
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,130
or at least was a child at the
beginning of it. So, um, that,

395
00:22:23,131 --> 00:22:25,750
that type of person though seems to exist.
There's a,

396
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:30,030
there's a lot of that you go to hospitals
in New York City where they have like

397
00:22:30,031 --> 00:22:35,031
a Shabbat elevator for doctors and that
seems very strange and yet it's somehow

398
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,340
kind of functions. So that's just
a piece of everything that yeah,

399
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,750
you're talking about basically.
Yeah. I mean, I think, you
know, it's, it's, it sounds,

400
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:45,490
sounds crazy, but operating system
is a, is a, is a better term to me.

401
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,080
It captures Judaism better than
religion does. Right? It's a code, uh,

402
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:54,440
through which we w w uh, through which
rapid or a lens through which we, we, we,

403
00:22:54,441 --> 00:22:58,840
we see the world. Um, we don't have
to see it the same way. It's okay.

404
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:03,640
Yeah. So, so what about the
cultural and traditional part of it?

405
00:23:03,641 --> 00:23:05,950
Because most Jews,
so I grew up in long island.

406
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,770
Everyone was either Jewish or
Greek or Italian basically, but,

407
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,600
but cer a certain ethnic identity that
most of them came from Ellis Island.

408
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:16,000
You know, their grandparents are
saying came from Ellis Island,

409
00:23:16,001 --> 00:23:19,000
eventually lived in Brooklyn or Queens,
and then they made it to long island.

410
00:23:19,001 --> 00:23:21,730
But I grew up, obviously around
a lot of Jewish people. Um,

411
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:25,390
most people weren't religious per se,
but there was a huge cultural identity.

412
00:23:25,391 --> 00:23:27,820
There's a sense of humor,
mostly a sense of humor,

413
00:23:27,821 --> 00:23:29,620
I would say perhaps
more than anything else.

414
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,330
A certain way of talking to each other.

415
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:35,870
There are certain like Seinfeld in
way of looking at the world. Right.

416
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,140
Do you think that is
enough to sustain something

417
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,790
long enough? No, I think it's great.
It's essential. It's, it's more, uh, uh,

418
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,950
an outgrowth of, of the core
than, than, than core itself.

419
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:54,380
Um, but no, it's not. It's,
um, you know, uh, again, we,

420
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:59,340
we need to ask ourselves, do we want
this people to continue, uh, uh,

421
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,630
existing? Uh, if we do,

422
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,890
we need a much more tangible,
much more accessible,

423
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:08,090
much more definable,

424
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:12,620
a source of identity than humor is
difficult to kind of put your finger on.

425
00:24:12,621 --> 00:24:14,120
I mean, I, and, and we know,

426
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,490
we both know what we're talking
about when we say Jewish humor.

427
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,650
We know what we're talking about
when we say Jewish thinking,

428
00:24:18,651 --> 00:24:21,580
this is a Jewish way. If they go below
of looking at a problem or like w we,

429
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,191
we get that.

430
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:26,810
But it is a little bit too nuanced I think
to communicate to certainly to future

431
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:30,230
generations or to, to other
people. So what is it?

432
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:33,120
So what's needed then in this
vision of the future that,

433
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:36,290
that you think would be the
right way to continue this,

434
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,150
this incredible and also tragic story.
W what's the best way to,

435
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,750
right. So the good news is I see
a path to making it, not tragic,

436
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:48,080
but still incredible. Um, and it
is a shift in our story, right?

437
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,650
This is even that right
there is a huge part, right?

438
00:24:51,651 --> 00:24:55,340
It's sort of acknowledging like it's
a little bit weird to look back at the

439
00:24:55,341 --> 00:24:58,730
history of our ancestors and go,
man,

440
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,400
there was a lot of depth here.

441
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,860
There was a lot of horrible things that
happened and I've talked about it many

442
00:25:03,861 --> 00:25:06,290
times. I have family members on both
sides have died in the Holocaust.

443
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,100
I have family members that live in
Israel now. I've, you know, that people,

444
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:14,090
that it's a history of pogroms and
genocides and holocausts and all of these

445
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:17,270
things that make it a little bit tough to,

446
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,950
to look at the future or something like
that. Yeah. Look, I, I hear that. I, um,

447
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,800
you know, I've, I've, I've,

448
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,940
I've had conflicting feelings
on using that history as a,

449
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,030
as an anchor of identity,
even though many of us do,

450
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,700
and for many of us it's still
relevant. You know, to be clear,

451
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,300
you certainly feel Israel is
changing that I suppose. So that's,

452
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,650
that gets to what you said in Israel.

453
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:42,590
You feel it right in Israel that you do
feel that in a way that I don't think

454
00:25:42,591 --> 00:25:45,070
you do in the United States, which
is you're in the Middle East. Yeah.

455
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,950
And our neighbors have not reconciled
themselves with the notion of Jewish

456
00:25:48,951 --> 00:25:53,570
sovereignty. And we see that. And it
might be difficult to see from here,

457
00:25:53,571 --> 00:25:55,880
especially if you, and if it's,
you're not, it's not your day to day.

458
00:25:55,881 --> 00:25:57,890
I understand that. It was crazy. Greedy.

459
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,040
Jews want a country that's about six miles
wide at, won't be in it. Right. Do know,

460
00:26:01,041 --> 00:26:04,290
man. Right. Never write enough,
right? Yeah. I mean, if,

461
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,250
if you kind of look at a few
of it doesn't, it doesn't
take a ton of analysis,

462
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:09,410
but what, what are the other
Jewish options in the Middle East?

463
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:13,910
We have 7.2 million Jews in Israel. Are
they supposed to go back to bed? Baghdad.

464
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,043
Damascus.

465
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,560
Cairo where you're supposed to get the
entire Middle East has been ethnically

466
00:26:18,561 --> 00:26:22,940
cleansed of 100% of its Jews. 100%.
There's one guy in Egypt, isn't there?

467
00:26:22,941 --> 00:26:27,200
Why I read about that? I've met that
one. I'm not, I met the one guy,

468
00:26:27,201 --> 00:26:31,570
I think he's gone but did meet the guy.
Yeah. The guy that claimed he was a Jew,

469
00:26:31,571 --> 00:26:35,180
I don't know. Right, right, right.
So you look at that and you know,

470
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,510
with the tragedy of that,

471
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:40,370
assuming that the Baghdadi
Jewish community is a thousand
years older than Islam

472
00:26:40,371 --> 00:26:44,250
itself and it's been eradicated zero,
uh,

473
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,750
there is no formula for existing
as a Jew in the Middle East,

474
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,580
outside of Israel.
It doesn't work.

475
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:53,980
I mean this th th th there are
no exceptions to that rule, that,

476
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,630
that that's clear enough.
And when you live in Israel,
it's, it, you know, it, uh,

477
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,120
I think it's something that, that,
that, that, that, that's quite clear.

478
00:27:00,121 --> 00:27:05,070
So we're not in a place where we
can escape that anymore now or yet.

479
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:08,580
I think I'm an optimist in terms of,
uh,

480
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,570
Israel's eventual acceptance among the
community of nations in the Middle East.

481
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:13,790
Again,

482
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:16,150
I think there's a lot of reasons to
think that's happening right now,

483
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:20,380
that sort of a whole other show about
geopolitics, I guess, than anything else.

484
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:22,990
But I think they've started
to just accept, wow,

485
00:27:22,991 --> 00:27:26,170
these guys are here and they're actually
giving us water and a whole bunch of

486
00:27:26,171 --> 00:27:27,004
other things

487
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,730
we can do together. Yeah,
yeah. Agreed. Um, so,

488
00:27:31,731 --> 00:27:33,920
so anyhow, I, you know, I, I don't think

489
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:39,770
we can divorce ourselves completely from
our past, nor should we, I think that's,

490
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,500
that, that's fine. But as
an anchor for identity,

491
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,520
particularly in the United
States where, you know, the Ma,

492
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,520
my children's generation in this country
sees the Holocaust is kind of ancient

493
00:27:49,521 --> 00:27:52,710
history. That's not that it has no
bearing on their lives. You know,

494
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:57,530
they see themselves as, you
know, very, very privileged.
Um, you know, well educated,

495
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,790
uh, you know, uh,

496
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,770
Americans with a great future
Americans and Israelis with,

497
00:28:02,771 --> 00:28:06,620
with a great future wherever they end up
in either country, you know, they, um,

498
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,860
so selling them on Jewish identity
through the Holocaust or through,

499
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:12,770
you know,

500
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:17,360
the inquisition or through or through
that part of Jewish history for now is not

501
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:20,420
working. And I hope it continues
not working. Right. I mean,

502
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:22,220
a lot of people have reacted to
the book by saying, you know,

503
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:26,830
one good wave of antisemitism and we
solve your problem. So that's, you know,

504
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,060
I hope, first of all, let's look,
should we hope for that? I mean,

505
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:33,440
that doesn't sound like a, and it's also
pathetic notion of that, that we can't,

506
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,570
without antisemites, there
can't be Jews. I mean,

507
00:28:35,571 --> 00:28:40,571
that's the w w w w there's so
much more to this legacy than,

508
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:45,310
than hatred and persecution so much more.
There's so much richness here and and,

509
00:28:45,311 --> 00:28:47,750
and beauty that we can
develop and now steer.

510
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:51,050
Now that we have the agency to
actually steer ourselves, let's do it.

511
00:28:51,051 --> 00:28:52,910
Let's claim it. This is, this is I, to me,

512
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:56,450
a very exciting moment in Jewish history
with with a threat associated with it.

513
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,810
Okay.

514
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:59,720
Yeah. It's interesting because
right now in America and you,

515
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,100
you referenced this a little bit earlier,

516
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:02,390
that with what's going on with the left,

517
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:06,080
if you were to ask me where
antisemitism is in America right now,

518
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:10,640
are there some KKK members that might
be far right extremists? Yes, there are,

519
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,190
and they've always been here.
I don't think there's any more of them.

520
00:29:13,191 --> 00:29:14,870
I don't think they have
any institutional power.

521
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,930
I think the media makes it seem like
they're everywhere and they're just not,

522
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,900
they call everybody and Nazi. I just
don't think that's real. I don't,

523
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,960
I just simply don't think it's real.
Yeah.

524
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:27,020
Where I am concerned about antisemitism
though is what is happening on the left

525
00:29:27,021 --> 00:29:31,910
that Jews are no longer victims and they
love victimhood because they'd be view

526
00:29:31,911 --> 00:29:34,610
victimhood is virtuous and now
Jews are thought of as white.

527
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,530
So my brown brother-in-law,
Reggie's parents were both refugees,

528
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:43,630
kicked out of their countries, is now
privileged in the, you know, it's,

529
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:47,410
he's a immigrant at our end child
of refugees and, and he's Brown,

530
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:52,560
but he's now privileged and I see a much
more what actually I think is systemic

531
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,310
racism because they're trying to build
this all into the system of how we view

532
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:00,960
each other. I see that really
hardening on the left and,

533
00:30:00,961 --> 00:30:03,430
and I think that's why so many, you
know, I talk about this all the time,

534
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,060
why I see minority groups breaking from
leftism. I see this happening with,

535
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,340
with black people. There's a lot
of evidence that it's happening.

536
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,720
It's how I see it
happening with gay people.

537
00:30:10,721 --> 00:30:12,010
I see it happening with Jewish people.

538
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,800
I think it's happening
with Asian people now. Um,

539
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,460
so in a certain way I'm hopeful
because Jews are going, ah,

540
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:22,120
the old thing maybe isn't
working the way it always has.

541
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,750
So I, I hope I'm not naive. I'm
an optimist on that as well. In,

542
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,990
in that I think the ideologies that have,
you know,

543
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,440
I think for very natural and good
reasons have surfaced, right?

544
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:35,230
We're always going to be overshooting
and undershooting truth. That's,

545
00:30:35,231 --> 00:30:38,800
that's that, that's us more,
you know, human beings, um,

546
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,310
are in many ways self defeating,
right?

547
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:46,850
Intersectionality as an
exclusionary ideology versus as a,

548
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:51,250
as a framework for understanding
social phenomena. I mean,

549
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:54,160
it's collapsing in the face
of Louis Farrakhan right now.

550
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:57,520
How are you supposed to be gay
and still be on board with this?

551
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,370
How are you supposed to be a Jew and
still be on board with this? And I think,

552
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,630
I feel like we're probably even,

553
00:31:02,631 --> 00:31:05,380
I mean if you look at what to
me is a shame because you know,

554
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:09,220
blacks and Jews in this country have
been kindred spirits for over a hundred

555
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,570
years. You know, we found that the NAACP,
this was our fight black education,

556
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,580
that the schools in the south
were Jewish on the resort.

557
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,370
We marched and died in Mississippi.

558
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:19,191
The thing I was going to say,

559
00:31:19,191 --> 00:31:21,680
most of those people in those pictures
marching with Martin Luther King,

560
00:31:21,681 --> 00:31:23,070
most of the white people
were Jewish. Yeah, yeah.

561
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,280
Right.
So this is a false divide,

562
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:29,770
which I think ultimately corrects itself.
I was just speaking to a group, uh,

563
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,260
recently about, um,
black lives matter. Um,

564
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,400
and you know, to me this, this
ultimately has to be self correcting.

565
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:43,430
You take the people who really have been
on your side and have tied your fate to

566
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:48,240
yours and for some reason have decided
that they're on the other side. Right?

567
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:52,080
If you look at the 2016 social policy
agenda of the black lives matter movement,

568
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:55,680
um,
it has one foreign policy clause.

569
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,170
It's there to condemn the genocidal
apartheid state of Israel. Yeah.

570
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,340
It's actually for some reason the
Palestinian population keeps going up.

571
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:06,210
This is the worst. Genocide were
terrible or bad numbers, right? Yeah.

572
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,700
Just can't get anything. Right.
But you kind of look at that.

573
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:11,310
And if black lives matter,
which they do to me, you know,

574
00:32:11,311 --> 00:32:14,790
my wife and I adopted two door Foria
and refugees 10 years ago in Israel.

575
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,860
They live in Israel now.
Uh,

576
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:22,380
there is a genocide going on right now
in Darfur during 300,000 or 400,000

577
00:32:22,381 --> 00:32:24,540
people killed because they are black.

578
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:30,120
The foreign policy agenda that you chose
in a movement who flies the flag of

579
00:32:30,121 --> 00:32:32,550
black lives is not that.
It's,

580
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:37,990
it's that I have to believe is ultimately
going to collapse under the weight its

581
00:32:39,261 --> 00:32:41,710
own, uh, did just an
unreasonableness that doesn't work.

582
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,860
Does it make sense?
Interesting though?

583
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:46,250
Cause I don't see that as a
tension between blacks and
Jews cause I really don't

584
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:49,540
see that changing. I see it. I see
that as a tension between short,

585
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,720
what I would say basically are
crazy leftist versus everyone else.

586
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,360
Pretty much it. Yeah. That just
happens to be a political slice.

587
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:59,420
I don't think that's really a racial
tension. Does that, does that make sense?

588
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,170
Yeah. No, I hear that. I mean
I hit the plus plenty of a,

589
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,660
a black interlocutors who see it
exactly as, as we do, by the way,

590
00:33:05,661 --> 00:33:07,670
who also sake I kinda
like we do about Judaism.

591
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,220
Victim Hood is a terrible
basis for identity.

592
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,520
It's a self defeating and it's a
self fulfilling prophecy. Ultimately,

593
00:33:13,521 --> 00:33:16,670
if you'd let you know, let, let's aspire
to something better than that. Yeah.

594
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,460
By the way, not ignoring
the past, right? There is,

595
00:33:19,461 --> 00:33:22,750
there is a legacy here that we of course
have to acknowledge if we're gonna,

596
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,900
if we're going to do anything about it,

597
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,700
but,
but does that also explain the,

598
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:30,701
the endless sort of focused hatred
of Israel from the modern left and I,

599
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,120
not just in America,
but in virtually every country or the UN,

600
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:37,660
which is basically the biggest crock in
the history of the world. Why they all,

601
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,510
you know, for every one
condemnation of another country,

602
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:42,670
there's 27 against Israel
or something, right? Yeah.

603
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,700
Completely insane that Jews in Israel
are no longer victims and the left loves

604
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:53,200
victims. So now that you're not victims
anymore, you automatically are the enemy.

605
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:56,830
I would argue it's better to not be a
victim and to be alive than to be liked by

606
00:33:56,831 --> 00:34:00,430
a bunch of people who want
you to live like slaves, but,
right. Um, but does that,

607
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:02,470
is it really that simple to boil it down?

608
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,240
Cause I think it's pretty close to that.

609
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:08,400
Okay. I, I, I wish that were
the best explanation for it.

610
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,003
MMM.

611
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,940
I fear that antisemitism,
it might be a better,

612
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,940
a better explanation because there,
there are plenty of countries.

613
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:22,250
Singapore is succeeding
wildly. Incredible. Singapore
is an incredible story.

614
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,000
There no UN resolutions against Singapore.
That's not something that, uh, uh,

615
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:28,810
so,

616
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:32,320
well, no, I mean, I mean the history
of the Jews was, you guys were on the,

617
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,670
you were the, on the victim side of
this whole thing and we liked it.

618
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:37,330
We liked it that way, that
that's the way it was. Right.

619
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:40,180
And there's some weird thing about like
the chosen people think about that.

620
00:34:40,181 --> 00:34:43,150
It's like, ah, I see. I guess they're
not that chosen or something like that.

621
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:46,930
But my favorite line ever rise from
fiddler on the roof, which is, you know,

622
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,890
I know we're the chosen people.

623
00:34:47,891 --> 00:34:51,160
I just wish we could be chosen for
something else. Right. But, but,

624
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:53,410
so I don't mean that in terms of
the success of a country, I think,

625
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:57,430
I mean the uniqueness of the success of
a country that was so associated with

626
00:34:57,431 --> 00:35:01,630
being slaughtered and everything
else that no longer acts as a victim.

627
00:35:01,631 --> 00:35:03,700
That bat flips the
whole thing on its head.

628
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,410
Yeah. Like it could be that,
I mean, I just see the,

629
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:13,700
the suspension of logic in a lot of the
condemnations of Israel that I think

630
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:18,720
you're talking about reminds me very much
of the suspension of logic in classic

631
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,230
European antisemitic tropes,
right. The blood libel,

632
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,630
things that don't really make
sense. Right. That's a [inaudible].

633
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,663
MMM.

634
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,060
It rhymes with that.
And the fact that we're this,

635
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:36,020
the Jews in this case and Jews in that
case seat seems to be not a coincidence.

636
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,800
Yeah. Unfortunately
wished. I, you know, I, I,

637
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,370
and I try to see it differently because
it feels like a cop out to say, oh,

638
00:35:41,371 --> 00:35:46,260
it's antisemitism. Uh, it's tough for
me to find a, an explanation of it.

639
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:49,490
You know, things like, uh, you can't be
a Zionist and a feminist, right? You're,

640
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:53,190
you're gonna pick the first
liberal democracy to elect
a female head of state to

641
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:55,770
say you can't be that and
a feminist as strange,

642
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,190
better women's representation on corporate
boards and incorporate managements

643
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:02,100
than the United States. That's the
country that feminists can't, can't,

644
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:06,570
can't get onboard with when it's
neighborhood is exactly the opposite of,

645
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,100
remind me again, are they
throwing gays off roofs in Israel?

646
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:12,700
Right, exactly. Yeah. Right. I
mean, I think a Tel Aviv for,

647
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,570
forgot which magazine put
it on, uh, number one, uh,

648
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:20,620
gay city on earth. Right?
It's, how is it that, you know,

649
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,090
Spanish pride parade. We'll
boycott Israeli marchers
or the Chicago Dyke March.

650
00:36:25,091 --> 00:36:27,460
We'll throw people out for
having a star of David on the,

651
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,370
these things don't make sense.
And to me,

652
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,630
it very much rhymes with a w with
something from our, from our history.

653
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,330
I think we're at a place where we can,
I don't know,

654
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,200
maybe it's too much to
say safely ignore it,

655
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,530
but it doesn't have to factor into
our lives in any huge way in Israel.

656
00:36:44,531 --> 00:36:48,280
You don't feel that in your day to day,
you don't feel embattled or you know, uh,

657
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,280
um, you know, uh, that, that, that,

658
00:36:51,281 --> 00:36:55,660
that we're not glued to the TV to watch,
you know, UN votes and see what happens.

659
00:36:55,661 --> 00:36:57,970
We can't, okay. We know that story.

660
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,280
We were literally sublimating
that thing anyway.

661
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,790
Yeah, true. Yeah, that's right. So
hopefully these are signs, you know,

662
00:37:04,791 --> 00:37:09,240
cycles that were worked themselves out.
But, you know, um, again, I, I, uh,

663
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,420
I'm kind of a,
almost allergic to the,

664
00:37:11,421 --> 00:37:15,410
to anything that might lead us to
define ourselves on those terms.

665
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,030
Let's not let the haters define us.

666
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,130
We're in a place where we have the
agency to do it ourselves. And that,

667
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,310
that to me is the,
that's the exciting part of this.

668
00:37:22,311 --> 00:37:23,330
But that's why I wrote the book.

669
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,720
So with all this in my own,

670
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:28,200
one of the things that I'm always amazed
by is when they do that happiness index,

671
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:31,230
right? That world happiness
index that comes out every year.

672
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:35,340
Israel is usually somewhere
between like 10 and 15 on that.

673
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,020
And yet if you turn on CNN and all
you ever see or bombs blowing up and

674
00:37:39,021 --> 00:37:41,220
terrorist attacks and buses
blowing up and all that,

675
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,050
now there obviously is some connection
to the good things that you're talking

676
00:37:46,051 --> 00:37:50,550
about and the ability to still be happy
in a pretty rough part of the world.

677
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:54,000
What do you see that as if you believe
in the premise that I'm offering?

678
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,640
Right. Well, I mean you, you've spent
time in Israel. It's, it is a happy place.

679
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:02,910
It's not no Israeli surprised by those,
by those rankings. We w we get it when we,

680
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:07,250
and I, and I think there's a
certain appreciation of that. Yeah.

681
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,520
I think a big piece of it
is community and you know,

682
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,470
a part of why the book is,

683
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:16,010
I think getting the reception that it's
getting right now is there's a thirst

684
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,090
for, for that. Um,

685
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:22,850
in many ways we're losing it or maybe
there's a pendulum that swings between,

686
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,540
you kind of think we can conceive
of ourselves as individuals.

687
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:31,070
We can conceive of ourselves as cells in
an organism called community, religion,

688
00:38:31,071 --> 00:38:35,120
country, what would it, however
you choose to define it. Um,

689
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,110
it seems that we're kind of
on an individualistic, uh,

690
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,700
extreme of the swing of that,
of, of that pendulum today.

691
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,990
And there is a communal itch that needs
to get scratched. I think that's, that,

692
00:38:47,991 --> 00:38:50,170
that that's wired into us, uh, right now.

693
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,640
And one of the things that Israel is
getting right and there are many things

694
00:38:54,641 --> 00:38:57,250
that his is getting wrong. As
I, as I described in the book,

695
00:38:57,670 --> 00:39:02,650
one of the things that Israel is getting
right is it is a community and a sense

696
00:39:02,651 --> 00:39:07,600
of I have your back and you have mine.
We have responsibility for each other.

697
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:10,750
Uh, we're, we're not just
individuals in some rat race.

698
00:39:10,751 --> 00:39:13,720
We are th th th th we are
part of something bigger.

699
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,510
How would you think of
that do you think is a,

700
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:20,920
is a Jewish Jewish ethic per se versus
the fact that everyone has to go to the

701
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:24,860
army, which then would obviously create
a very similar ethic? Yeah, so I,

702
00:39:24,861 --> 00:39:26,950
I think they're both at play.
Um,

703
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,990
it is a profoundly Jewish ethic though.
I kind of, if you look at other diasporas

704
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:38,380
look what this Jewish community in
United States did in the seventies and

705
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,280
eighties on behalf of Soviet Jewry,
right? People they hadn't met before,

706
00:39:42,370 --> 00:39:46,090
people that if they hadn't had any
association with for generations, uh,

707
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:49,660
but still felt that these are people
we need to stick our necks out for and

708
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:54,270
write checks for and March four and
protest for a and get them out and liquid

709
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,670
Israeli Jewry did write a population of
four and a half million people absorbed

710
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,430
over a million immigrants
in a year and a half.

711
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:04,990
It's a huge nut to swallow from if a
fiscal perspective from a social and, and,

712
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,710
and did it unquestioningly of course
it was the obvious thing where we were

713
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,990
going to do, we do look out
for each other. And that is a,

714
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,670
that is a Jewish notion to look what
we did for Yemeni jewelry and Ethiopian

715
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,570
Jewry and Iraqi Jewry.
We take responsibility for each other.

716
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:23,230
So that is a very Jewish ethic
and it permeates Israeli society.

717
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:26,020
You can feel that. And that's,
uh, that's part of it. And Yeah,

718
00:40:26,021 --> 00:40:29,360
and I think part of it is through
military service. Right? You, you,

719
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:34,180
you do get exposed in a real,
uh, many of us do, at least in a,

720
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:38,980
in a, in a, in a frontal way to people
who have genocidal intentions towards you.

721
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,740
Luckily they don't have the means to,
to, to fulfill those, um, the, the, the,

722
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,180
those intentions, but they're pretty
obvious. I mean, it's not something you,

723
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,370
anybody who serves, we'll
see that. I don't think that.

724
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,680
So does that make you happy? I don't know,
but certainly fought, forges a sense of,

725
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,380
of community, I think. Yeah. Um,

726
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:01,330
you have some stories about combat and
how that relates to all of this. Yeah.

727
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:06,240
I mean, uh, you, you know, one of the
things I try to talk about is, you know,

728
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,730
if we're going to revive a
Jewish spark, which, you know,

729
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,060
I think two or three generations of Jews
in Israel and the United States have

730
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:17,440
tried to extinguish, um, uh, in many ways.
What are the starting points, you know,

731
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,560
what are their embers that we can figure?
What do you mean by that?

732
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:23,190
That two or three generations
of Jews have tried to Accenture?

733
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,890
You mean just sort of run from
religion or also if you look at it?

734
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:31,690
So I segment Israeli society and it's my
segmentation. I, I just pay, people have,

735
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,580
you know,
issues with this specific segmentation.

736
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:38,450
But I do see it and I think a
lot of people see it as well. Um,

737
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,780
when we look at the notion
of Jewish statehood,

738
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,760
there are three separate constituencies
in Israel that are defined in my view by

739
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,680
what their vision is for Jewish statehood.

740
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:51,750
And these are visions that
were never reconciled. They
should have been but, but,

741
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:53,450
but they weren't. Instead, in 1947,

742
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:56,570
we came up with an agreement to split
them into different communities and that's

743
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:57,590
how we are in Israel today.

744
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,940
There was a community they call the
secularists that really want a harbor,

745
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,140
a safe, safe haven for the Jews
that is structured as a democracy.

746
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,150
That's pretty much it.
That was hurtles, vision.

747
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,250
That's how Bob's vision with
some Jewish trappings, you know,

748
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,360
the national holiday should be Jewish
holidays, but not much more than that.

749
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:16,640
We're not going to have the government
prescribed religious practice to the

750
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:20,540
citizenry. That's, that's the
secular verse vision. There
was a theocratic vision,

751
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,213
um,

752
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:26,950
which had very few adherence in 1947 when
the status quo agreement with which is

753
00:42:26,951 --> 00:42:30,950
the agreement that's cemented those
constituencies into different camps.

754
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,150
There are very few adherence with
almost no political ambitions today.

755
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:39,620
That group is big and growing massively
and has maximalist political ambitions

756
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,080
to turn Israel into a theocracy.

757
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,390
And then there's what I call
a territorial as vision,

758
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,530
which says the whole land of Israel is a,
is a,

759
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:49,490
a god given gift.

760
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:54,520
And there is no human prerogative
in relinquishing it, right?

761
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,440
We can't step away from it. These
are three competing camps, uh, in,

762
00:42:59,441 --> 00:43:02,180
in, in Israeli society. Uh,

763
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,600
whose views were going
to have to reconcile.

764
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:08,420
When I talk about
extinguishing Judaism though,

765
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:13,540
it was the secularist who ruled Israel
certainly until 1977 and I would argue to

766
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:18,230
great extents to, to, to this day, and
the original secularists were Russians,

767
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,350
right? The arc is the architects of
Jewish statehood. We're central Europeans,

768
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:25,880
right? Hungarians, Austrians, you
know, her Hertzel, uh, [inaudible], uh,

769
00:43:25,881 --> 00:43:27,320
Israel's angle that that crowd,

770
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,490
the actual builders were Russians.

771
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,820
They were the eastern Europeans who
were escaping pogroms when they came to

772
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:35,654
Israel.

773
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:40,750
And these guys came at the dawn of
Bolshevism and the czar was their enemy.

774
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,290
And you know, the, the,

775
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:47,270
the Bolshevik resolute revolution was
largely Jewish from the leadership down to

776
00:43:47,271 --> 00:43:49,250
the, to, to the, to the,
to the ground troops.

777
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:53,750
Antisemitism was so embedded in Russia
that it became very quickly clear as

778
00:43:53,751 --> 00:43:55,550
Trotsky under understood to light.

779
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,550
We're still the Jews and we're
not welcome in this enterprise.

780
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:02,790
But people who have had drunk,
that socialist Koolaid came to Israel and,

781
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:05,980
and that was the elite of our country
for the first, you know, 50 years of,

782
00:44:05,981 --> 00:44:08,180
of its existence and
certainly pre-state right.

783
00:44:08,181 --> 00:44:11,120
The kibbutzniks the guys who taught
me to be in Israeli, right. The,

784
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:14,840
the guys who I was with at the academy,
we're primarily kibbutzniks. That was,

785
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:15,830
that was Israel's elite.

786
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,510
So they were like small scale socialists
at some level either. Yeah. I mean,

787
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,850
when I, I'd spend weekends on, you know,

788
00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:26,780
my friends keep with same and there was
a Komisar that was a title in the boots.

789
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:30,300
I don't know how small scale, I
mean, this was, uh, uh, that, that,

790
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:34,260
that ethic has more or less died.
But what's, what's interesting is

791
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:38,660
there was a baby that was thrown out with
the bathwater when they came to Israel

792
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,720
is that these people are fanatical about
expunging any vestige of a European

793
00:44:43,761 --> 00:44:45,500
antisemitic stereotype in Israel.

794
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:50,710
We were going to be muscular and feisty
and we're not going to lock ourselves in

795
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:52,910
a head or studying taught
mode or anything like that.

796
00:44:52,911 --> 00:44:56,660
We're going to be out in the
fields farming and fighting
and defending our, our,

797
00:44:56,661 --> 00:45:00,650
our land was, and in many ways, I
think it was an abrogation of, of, of,

798
00:45:00,651 --> 00:45:03,320
of many things that are Jewish by the way.
You can be both,

799
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:06,500
right and you can stand up for yourself
and also study. You can, you can do both.

800
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,833
Um,

801
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,000
one of the stories I tell in the book
or just kind of interesting is my first

802
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:13,501
year I,
you know,

803
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:16,960
I did nothing Jewish growing up except
for fasting on Yom Kippor for whatever

804
00:45:16,961 --> 00:45:19,540
reason. It was kind of an easy
thing to understand. We're Jews.

805
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:22,470
We fast on Yom Kippur. That's our
thing. I did nothing else. I was a,

806
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:24,730
but I did that and it was kind
of, I don't know, a challenge.

807
00:45:24,731 --> 00:45:27,030
I don't know what it
was, but that the, uh,

808
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,420
the first time I didn't fasten your group,

809
00:45:28,421 --> 00:45:32,960
who was my first Yankee Kippor at the
academy. It was a feast. It was a feast.

810
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,470
I knew board the kibbutzniks,
you know, made a write in
the book. Uh, you know, uh,

811
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:40,580
grilled cheese sandwiches was the
thing which was really ham and cheese.

812
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:44,170
So I didn't want to shock anybody
but of what it was. Wow. So they,

813
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:46,300
so you illustrate that point,

814
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:50,860
meaning that they were really going out
of their way to erase any connection to

815
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:55,480
religion even though they had come to
a country to be safe because they were

816
00:45:55,481 --> 00:45:59,410
persecuted for their religion. I mean,
there's like real psychological stuff,

817
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,540
but here's the interesting irony is

818
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:09,140
he was a very unknownst
attempt to erase that history.

819
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,720
You don't keep pro was
still an anchor point.

820
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:15,020
It was a day of rebellion
against our ancestors.

821
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:18,680
So we were still orbiting the
same death star, so to speak.

822
00:46:18,681 --> 00:46:20,840
We just in the opposite order.
But we hadn't gone off into space,

823
00:46:20,841 --> 00:46:24,740
which is actually really good news if
you want to rekindle a Judaism. And,

824
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:29,850
and I think a lot of the ethic of the
Israel Defense Forces is Jewish despite

825
00:46:29,991 --> 00:46:34,850
itself. Um, and you know, so, so one,
one of the, you know, toward the,

826
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,560
when I started flying in reserves was a
very kind of ethically fraught period in

827
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,640
for the air force in Israel. And, and
these are dilemmas that now, you know,

828
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:46,490
our colleagues in the US
air force and navy face,

829
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:49,790
and then the British air force
we're all facing these day,

830
00:46:49,791 --> 00:46:54,230
which is how do you fight a war in
civilian areas when your enemy can dictate

831
00:46:54,231 --> 00:46:56,210
exactly where that war is going to be fun.

832
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:00,110
If you're launching rockets out of
schools and hospitals at civilian targets,

833
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:03,140
how are you supposed to contend with,
with that challenge?

834
00:47:03,141 --> 00:47:08,120
And it's tough and there are no
perfect answer to that. Um, but, uh,

835
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:13,160
you know, one of the stories we talk
about is his, uh, there was a, uh,

836
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:13,600
uh,

837
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:18,600
a Hamas planner named [inaudible] who
had been responsible for really hundreds

838
00:47:19,611 --> 00:47:22,640
of, of civilian deaths in Israel. There
was a kind of a way of, of bus bombings,

839
00:47:22,641 --> 00:47:26,630
primarily bus bombings, but
also restaurants, cafes,

840
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:30,460
cause there's like late nineties, this
is early 2006 when we come the second,

841
00:47:30,461 --> 00:47:33,720
second, second Intifada. Exactly. Uh,

842
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:39,510
and we had tried to target this
guy and a number of times and

843
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:42,810
our rules of engagement were,

844
00:47:42,811 --> 00:47:44,850
were clear enough to the
enemies is that are on our ride.

845
00:47:44,851 --> 00:47:46,300
It was a very kind of
a cat and mouse game.

846
00:47:46,301 --> 00:47:50,380
As we kinda got more nuanced in
finessing the rules of engagement.

847
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:52,300
It only took a few weeks
for the other side.

848
00:47:52,301 --> 00:47:56,590
It was whether it was his Bella and in
Lebanon or Hamas in Gaza to understand,

849
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:01,300
um, how close could we bomb to civilian
targets? How close could we bomb to UN,

850
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:04,450
uh, facilities, what types of munitions
we could use in these situation?

851
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,520
There's kind of very clear
and we tipped our hand in, in,

852
00:48:07,521 --> 00:48:08,580
in many ways I think maybe

853
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,840
so when we see this on the media,

854
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:14,470
during the war that Israel has bombed all
of this stuff and they show you all of

855
00:48:14,471 --> 00:48:17,510
this destruction, you're really
missing the subutex. I mean,

856
00:48:17,511 --> 00:48:19,570
I think a certain amount of people,
I try to tweet about it,

857
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:22,880
at least these show that, you know, they
dropped, they dropped leaflets saying,

858
00:48:22,881 --> 00:48:26,210
you guys gotta get out of this house
because there's people, you know,

859
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:27,800
text messages, text message. I mean,

860
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:31,100
no army in the history of the world
would do anything like this ever.

861
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,580
You Israelis keep doing it and there,
and as you're saying,

862
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:38,060
they're enemies actually take advantage
of that over intentionally. They,

863
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,790
which is now they put bombs in
hospitals and they say, well,

864
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:43,910
what are you going to do knowing that
the world will be more than happy to

865
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:44,953
condemn the Jews,

866
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:49,320
right. By the way, which to me is okay
to ignore it. It's okay to ignore it.

867
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:51,630
We need to defend ourselves and you know,

868
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,690
you mean ignore the media outrage or
something? Yeah, yeah. I mean it's, it's,

869
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,050
it's there and I think we sometimes pay
a little bit too much attention to it.

870
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:03,900
The same critics weren't doing much when
we were being exterminated right now

871
00:49:03,901 --> 00:49:07,440
that we're defending ourselves,
we're going to not take their advice.

872
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,980
We're going to do this the way we
want to do it ethically, ethically,

873
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:15,030
but not to appease a European critic
or the UN or anything like that,

874
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:19,380
but to do this Jewishly and there is a
way to do it and it's not clean and it's

875
00:49:19,381 --> 00:49:23,370
not simple and these dilemmas are real
and you're not going to solve them in any

876
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:26,430
perfect way. Uh, so you know, the, the,

877
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,390
you know,

878
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,880
the kid get the kind of frustration
of not being able to get this guy and

879
00:49:32,881 --> 00:49:37,881
watching buses blow up children killed
over and over again with his fingerprints

880
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:41,910
on, on, on, on, on each of these
is a very tough thing to go.

881
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:46,500
When we finally got a shot at him,
uh, there was an intelligence failure,

882
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,740
uh, and we hit the house that he was
in. It was on the outskirts of, of a,

883
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:53,840
of Gaza City. Uh, but 14 people
were there and that we'd,

884
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,050
and none of them were civilians
and Israel erupted and outrage.

885
00:49:58,110 --> 00:49:58,920
And this is not therapy.

886
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:02,210
We don't need the UN in the Europeans to
tell us when those problems, right? Yeah.

887
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:06,750
Two class action lawsuits against the
Israeli air force by Jewish Israeli civil

888
00:50:06,751 --> 00:50:11,670
rights groups. Um, 27
pilots quitting, right?

889
00:50:11,671 --> 00:50:14,890
It was the kind of famous, the pilot's
letter, which was kind of a pub,

890
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,140
the open letter published in the
newspaper saying, we're, we're,

891
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:20,220
we're stepping down from active service.
Uh,

892
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,610
and this became a morale
crisis in the air force.

893
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:27,910
And the way we addressed it, and this
to me is it's sort of the connection,

894
00:50:27,911 --> 00:50:30,590
it's why these, these stories
are, are, are, are in there,

895
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:32,630
is done hollow too with the time was,

896
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:37,631
was the commander of chief of the air
force did a tour of the various bases and

897
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:42,830
wings of, of, of the air
force to do a debriefing.
Debriefing is a, is a, is a, a,

898
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:47,870
um, almost a religious ritual in the
Israeli air force. It's a very, very,

899
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:52,900
uh, rigorous, painful,
methodical kind of, uh, um,

900
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:57,020
for every ton Bluetick exercise of going
through everything that went wrong.

901
00:50:57,050 --> 00:51:00,230
Some of the things that went right but
mainly went, went wrong. And how do we,

902
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,420
how do we improve? And, and it, it, it's a

903
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:07,520
rank blind and he put himself out there
and he came to our, where the wing that,

904
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:09,530
that, that, that, that
conducted the operation.

905
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:14,000
And so he started with us and they were
about 50 people in the room and we had

906
00:51:14,001 --> 00:51:17,300
an almost all night session,
which started with his debriefing but,

907
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:21,140
but progress very quickly into a kind
of an ethical debate as to how do we

908
00:51:21,141 --> 00:51:25,520
conduct ourselves. Um,
and the way I describe it,

909
00:51:25,521 --> 00:51:28,250
which I think some of my colleagues who
read a thing could think of was it's

910
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:32,270
pretty accurate. And it was the
2002, so sometimes fast. Um,

911
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,780
a friend of mine from theU
s navy read it and said,

912
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:40,610
what you guys conducted would be
mutiny in, in, in our organization.

913
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,073
And I understand that,

914
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:45,680
I understand it because it was a complete
subversion of the hierarchy in pursuit

915
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:49,480
of a truth and ethical
truth, which is elusive. Um,

916
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:54,440
but it is a very Jewish way to conduct
yourself. It's not hierarchical.

917
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,830
It is a crowds wisdom that is guiding us.

918
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,800
And that doesn't mean you're
going to get perfect answers.

919
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:04,100
And our answers have not been perfect
since then, but they've improved.

920
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:09,080
And we're also, it provided real
clarity on how we navigate this dilemma.

921
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:13,610
What do we define as Optima?
Right? You can't, on the one hand,

922
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,380
please the virtue of truth and
tell the bride that she's ugly.

923
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,680
Uh, and at the same time,
the virtue of humanity,

924
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:25,490
you're going to have to navigate Optima
and that's life, right? And against it,

925
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,640
it's a very Jewish exercise and it's
how we conduct ourselves to say that we

926
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,570
solved, we solved that, but this, this
is the way we muddle through, um, in,

927
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:37,571
in Judaism and to me that there's value
in that it was not extinguished by our

928
00:52:38,331 --> 00:52:42,140
socialists founders. So it's
interesting that you said that, um,

929
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:47,380
that we should just ignore
or that Israelis should just
ignore the media portion

930
00:52:47,451 --> 00:52:47,721
of this.

931
00:52:47,721 --> 00:52:51,020
Cause that always seems to be a huge
part of any of this in the Middle East at

932
00:52:51,021 --> 00:52:52,700
any time. It's like, oh, every it,

933
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:57,760
there's just this endless focus or this
absurdly tiny piece of land with no,

934
00:52:57,891 --> 00:52:59,330
virtually no natural resources.

935
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,310
I guess they found natural
gas in the last 10 years,

936
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:04,880
but for most of their history
had no, certainly had no oil. Um,

937
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:09,290
this like obsessive focus where it's like
they're just kind of live in and going

938
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:10,280
on and doing their thing.

939
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,940
And I guess maybe we should all probably
pay less attention to the media.

940
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,690
I think that that's probably the Jews
are doing a great job of controlling the

941
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:21,610
media, I guess. That's
right. That's right. Yeah.

942
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,400
We've lost control of the media.
That's,

943
00:53:23,401 --> 00:53:25,980
that's the bigger problem here
too by the, to be clear, we joke,

944
00:53:25,981 --> 00:53:30,330
I have a Palestinian business part, right?
Uh, Macona in a Palestinian business.

945
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,710
We joke about this, the Palestinians
get this as well. By the way. I,

946
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:37,360
and I think my partner
was, it was, today's is a,

947
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:41,850
is a close friend I think also sees it
as part of the Palestinian problem is

948
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:46,300
that, you know, I'm a, I'm
a pro Palestine guy. I,

949
00:53:46,301 --> 00:53:48,240
I'd love to see a
Palestinian state tomorrow.

950
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,640
The challenge for the Palestinians
is very much the same as it is.

951
00:53:53,641 --> 00:53:58,641
Our challenge is they need
to define themselves in a
framework that is something

952
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,800
other than victimhood take away the Jews.

953
00:54:01,801 --> 00:54:06,420
What are the Palestinians exactly that
if they continue to define themselves

954
00:54:06,421 --> 00:54:09,810
with us as the backdrop,
then never going to be anybody.

955
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:14,310
And there's so much potential to build
something exciting, uh, uh, in Palestine.

956
00:54:14,311 --> 00:54:16,910
And in many ways when we
talk about the media, I mean,

957
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,650
maybe it's too strong a term,
we should ignore it. Um,

958
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:23,970
we're all complicit in that,

959
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:28,740
in perpetuating that human failure in
the Middle East. We're complicit in it.

960
00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:33,910
We're placing no demands on the Arab
world to take some sort of responsibility

961
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:36,150
for its future. It's so easy to say, oh,

962
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:40,260
it's the Jews' fault over and over
again at some point that rings hollow in

963
00:54:40,261 --> 00:54:43,490
Israel. So we start ignoring it in the
Arab world. You know, if, if you're,

964
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,250
if you're, it's a very
intoxicating notion, right?

965
00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:48,740
Is If someone sells you victimhood,

966
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,660
it's something that's kind of easy to
embrace, but at the end of the day,

967
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:52,494
it's toxic.

968
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,720
You should steer away from
it. Yeah. And interestingly,

969
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:58,080
I think that does ring back to the
way you were defining sort of an old

970
00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:03,110
antisemitism that's now thrust on Israel
because Egypt can bomb the hell out of

971
00:55:03,181 --> 00:55:06,510
the border of Gaza and blow up tunnels
and do whatever they want. No one cares.

972
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:10,290
Saudi Arabia can bomb the hell out of
Yemen and kill thousands and thousands of

973
00:55:10,291 --> 00:55:13,920
people and cause of famine and nobody
cares. Genocide in Darfur. Yeah.

974
00:55:13,921 --> 00:55:18,030
And so there's this odd asymmetry
there. Uh, well there's an asymmetry.

975
00:55:18,031 --> 00:55:20,700
There's literally symmetry
in the powers of both sides,

976
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:22,530
which is being used against each other.

977
00:55:22,531 --> 00:55:25,780
And then there's an asymmetry of media
and everything else. So it does have that,

978
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:27,480
that one through line that these,

979
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,090
these weird people kind of
survived through this thing.

980
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:34,940
Look who the, who the real victims
are right there. Black Sudanese there,

981
00:55:34,941 --> 00:55:38,480
Yemeni civilians,
every Iraqi civilians or Syrian civilians.

982
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,000
These are the real victims because
they're not getting attention, right?

983
00:55:41,001 --> 00:55:41,691
We're not, no, no.

984
00:55:41,691 --> 00:55:45,300
You and them resolutions coming in
lately on dark for our or anything.

985
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,370
We're very focused on, on a problem
that I don't think it is a huge problem.

986
00:55:49,371 --> 00:55:51,980
In fact, we're probably contributing
more to its perpetuation, then it's

987
00:55:52,070 --> 00:55:55,450
it's solution. Yeah. All right. So
let's finish with, with some of the,

988
00:55:55,451 --> 00:55:57,770
the future of how this stuff can work out.

989
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,890
I have a sense of how you think it
can work out on the Israeli side.

990
00:56:00,891 --> 00:56:04,770
They just have to sort of keep
going basically, I think, and, and,

991
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:05,840
and sort of reconcile,

992
00:56:05,841 --> 00:56:09,680
I think what you think those
three different pillars
of society are that which

993
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:11,150
is not easy and yeah.
Yeah.

994
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:14,450
Would you say that's a bigger problem
for them than the external pressures?

995
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,490
Much, much bigger. Yeah. In fact,

996
00:56:16,491 --> 00:56:18,260
it's the only thing I'm really
frightened of in Israel.

997
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:21,620
I don't think the
Palestinian issue sinks us.

998
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:23,530
I don't think the Iranians sink us.

999
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:28,060
I don't think the Greater Middle East
thing says we sink ourselves. Um, yeah.

1000
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:33,150
I think the good news is it's
the same medicine in Israel,

1001
00:56:33,281 --> 00:56:36,040
in the United States, it's,
it's gotta be about Judaism.

1002
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,660
We didn't come to start a Jewish state
just to have another democracy in the

1003
00:56:40,661 --> 00:56:44,080
world. This is the Jewish state.
It's the nation state of the Jews.

1004
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:48,040
What does that mean for Dave Rubin,
who's not a citizen of that state?

1005
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,720
But as a Jew, we are the
his self proclaimed nation
state. What does that mean?

1006
00:56:52,721 --> 00:56:54,130
What's our responsibility to him?

1007
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:59,020
These are questions that we haven't really
answered and they're not just Israeli

1008
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:01,360
questions. They're, they're,
they're Jewish questions.

1009
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,970
So ultimately I think we're all engaged.

1010
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,510
Israeli American and rest of
world Jewry in the same exercise,

1011
00:57:07,511 --> 00:57:09,160
which is good news because we don't have,
you know,

1012
00:57:09,161 --> 00:57:11,110
a dozen different prescriptions.
It's one, it's one.

1013
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:15,250
The exercise is we need to define
Judaism for the 21st century.

1014
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:19,600
What does that mean exactly?
Who's in, who's out? How'd
you get in? Had you leave?

1015
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:25,120
Um, and what I, I don't actually
put down a definition for Judaism.

1016
00:57:25,121 --> 00:57:28,270
I put down a mechanism
because the definition should
evolve. It should be static.

1017
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:30,700
Whatever I say today is
probably wrong to start with,

1018
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:33,460
but certainly we'll be wrong,
you know, 10 years from now,

1019
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:39,030
what's important is that
we have a mechanism for
continuing to refine and hone

1020
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,670
our,
the definition of what Jewish is.

1021
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:46,480
And the last section of the book is
exactly that. I'll leave it as a story

1022
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:51,280
surprise cause because you
wrote a book. I got it. Got It.

1023
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,140
Well, it's been a pleasure
chatting with you, I think.

1024
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:56,160
I think this is a really fascinating
thing because it permeates so many of the

1025
00:57:56,161 --> 00:58:00,240
issues that I talk about just related
because this is related to free speech.

1026
00:58:00,241 --> 00:58:04,620
It's related to oppression and perceived
depression and freedom and liberty and

1027
00:58:04,621 --> 00:58:06,360
all of these things in
history and the rest of it.

1028
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:10,150
So I've thoroughly enjoyed this, so thanks
for coming today. For more on Talia,

1029
00:58:10,151 --> 00:58:14,250
you can follow him on Twitter or like
you're not a big Twitter or Facebook.

1030
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,123
That's wrong.

1031
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:17,570
That's why you got a big smile because
you're not doing Twitter that often.

1032
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:19,830
You can follow them on Twitter.
It's t Keenan.
