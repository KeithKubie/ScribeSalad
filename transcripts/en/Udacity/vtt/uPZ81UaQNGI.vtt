Haven't said much about the process by which light is applied to the surfaces.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.824
One class of methods is to use some form of global illumination algorithm, such

00:00:06.824 --> 00:00:11.016
as path tracing. Another technique is called ambient occlusion, which is more

00:00:11.016 --> 00:00:14.532
concerned with the geometry in the scene. Instead of percolating light through

00:00:14.532 --> 00:00:17.279
the world, ambient occlusion techniques look for crevices, valleys, and other

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.446
areas where light is less likely to penetrate. Here's a simple example of

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:25.439
ambient occlusion. This particular form stores at each vertex how that vertex

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.714
is in a corner or crevice. These values are then interpolated across each cube

00:00:29.714 --> 00:00:34.440
face and blended in. One last thing I should mention. There is a class of

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.112
algorithms for interactive rendering called screen space ambient occlusion or

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:42.412
SSAO. While just an approximation, this effect can look quite convincing and is

00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:43.669
widely used.
