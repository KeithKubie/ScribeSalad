you'll find a page but she won't have
any idea how it relates to anything else

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:36.850
any idea how it relates to anything else
 

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:40.530
any idea how it relates to anything else
so it was it was essential to us to

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:40.540
so it was it was essential to us to
 

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:42.300
so it was it was essential to us to
create something that would not only

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:42.310
create something that would not only
 

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:44.160
create something that would not only
just show it in context but would also

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.170
just show it in context but would also
 

00:13:44.170 --> 00:13:47.580
just show it in context but would also
show the connections because as you can

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:47.590
show the connections because as you can
 

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:48.810
show the connections because as you can
see there are so many different vantage

00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:48.820
see there are so many different vantage
 

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.360
see there are so many different vantage
points and from each one you might learn

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:51.370
points and from each one you might learn
 

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.310
points and from each one you might learn
something slightly different from this

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320
something slightly different from this
 

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.140
something slightly different from this
so and this is although you could do

00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:58.150
so and this is although you could do
 

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.110
so and this is although you could do
that in sort of the analog stage of the

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120
that in sort of the analog stage of the
 

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.580
that in sort of the analog stage of the
material sitting at the reading room

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:02.590
material sitting at the reading room
 

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.430
material sitting at the reading room
table it's very hard it's very hard to

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440
table it's very hard it's very hard to
 

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.830
table it's very hard it's very hard to
keep track of all of that so for

00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:07.840
keep track of all of that so for
 

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.750
keep track of all of that so for
instance we'll just show an example of

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:09.760
instance we'll just show an example of
 

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:10.230
instance we'll just show an example of
this

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240

the sort of embracing start there so we
 

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.940
the sort of embracing start there so we
started kind of in the middle right

now so if we go here and you can search

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:26.660
now so if we go here and you can search
 

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:28.450
now so if we go here and you can search
I mean all these facets that we have on

00:15:28.450 --> 00:15:28.460
I mean all these facets that we have on
 

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.730
I mean all these facets that we have on
the left we went back and forth a lot on

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:30.740
the left we went back and forth a lot on
 

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.070
the left we went back and forth a lot on
what how things would be represented in

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:33.080
what how things would be represented in
 

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.170
what how things would be represented in
terms of searching but we went with a

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:35.180
terms of searching but we went with a
 

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.110
terms of searching but we went with a
single search window and and then you

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120
single search window and and then you
 

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:40.030
single search window and and then you
can refine by the facets that come up on

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040
can refine by the facets that come up on
 

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.980
can refine by the facets that come up on
the side but right now so you go to

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:41.990
the side but right now so you go to
 

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.930
the side but right now so you go to
Leonard Bernstein's

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:51.010
 
so Leonard Bernstein's debut and we'll

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:51.020
so Leonard Bernstein's debut and we'll
 

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.540
so Leonard Bernstein's debut and we'll
explore the document

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:52.550
explore the document

first and this also allowed us this time

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:57.170
first and this also allowed us this time

the audio-video we don't have as you can
 

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.759
the audio-video we don't have as you can
see before from the video that we're

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:03.769
see before from the video that we're
 

00:16:03.769 --> 00:16:05.290
see before from the video that we're
going to be making them available that's

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:05.300
going to be making them available that's
 

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.790
going to be making them available that's
our hope but that is a very different

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800
our hope but that is a very different
 

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.320
our hope but that is a very different
prospect than what we're doing right now

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:08.330
prospect than what we're doing right now
 

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:10.780
prospect than what we're doing right now
with the paper but this allows us then

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:10.790
with the paper but this allows us then
 

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.690
with the paper but this allows us then
to show how the video audio would be

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:13.700
to show how the video audio would be
 

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:20.920
to show how the video audio would be
used in different ways

was a broadcast so the amount of

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:46.290
was a broadcast so the amount of
 

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:47.840
was a broadcast so the amount of
material that we have to put up is

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:47.850
material that we have to put up is
 

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:49.160
material that we have to put up is
really quite amazing

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.170
really quite amazing
 

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.230

engineer would it break down on the
 

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.370
engineer would it break down on the
actual timing so this is another

00:16:57.370 --> 00:16:57.380
actual timing so this is another
 

00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.520
actual timing so this is another
perspective on that event and then also

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:01.530
perspective on that event and then also

with now you can kind of see them but so
how to relate this to other material

and this is a statement that we worked

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:02.370
and this is a statement that we worked
 

00:24:02.370 --> 00:24:07.250

hard at to make sure but now with parts

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260
hard at to make sure but now with parts
 

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:08.660
hard at to make sure but now with parts
available we've just made parts

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:08.670
available we've just made parts
 

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:13.250
available we've just made parts
available in the last few months it's

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260
available in the last few months it's
 

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.960
available in the last few months it's
very interesting to us that there's a

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:14.970
very interesting to us that there's a
 

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.810
very interesting to us that there's a
different sensitivity about parts vs.

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.820
different sensitivity about parts vs.
 

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:20.030
different sensitivity about parts vs.
scores even though it's the same

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:20.040
scores even though it's the same

intellectual continent this is something

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:24.900
intellectual continent this is something
 

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:25.330
intellectual continent this is something
that

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:25.340
that
 

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.400
that
see where this takes us but we've made

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:27.410
see where this takes us but we've made
 

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:31.330
see where this takes us but we've made
all of these available and I really

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:31.340
all of these available and I really
 

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:34.690
all of these available and I really
wasn't sure what the fair use issues

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:34.700
wasn't sure what the fair use issues
 

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.280
wasn't sure what the fair use issues
would be around these kinds of things

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:36.290
would be around these kinds of things
 

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:47.670
would be around these kinds of things
but Jane if you want to talk about that

00:24:47.670 --> 00:24:47.680

kind of executive summary of fair use is
is the nature of the use something that

Philharmonic over the last 150 years so
who are the people who are sitting in

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300
who are the people who are sitting in
 

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:42.080
who are the people who are sitting in
the seats at the Philharmonic over the

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:42.090
the seats at the Philharmonic over the
 

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:43.730
the seats at the Philharmonic over the
over sort of long course of history of

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740
over sort of long course of history of
 

00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:46.010
over sort of long course of history of
New York where are they sitting and

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020
New York where are they sitting and
 

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.330
New York where are they sitting and
where are they from and this gives you a

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:47.340
where are they from and this gives you a
 

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.880
where are they from and this gives you a
sense of some of what the archive looked

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:49.890
sense of some of what the archive looked
 

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:51.500
sense of some of what the archive looked
like that we ended up turning into a

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:51.510
like that we ended up turning into a
 

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:54.320
like that we ended up turning into a
database so it has people's names where

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:54.330
database so it has people's names where
 

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.570
database so it has people's names where
they sit in the hall and how long they

00:42:56.570 --> 00:42:56.580
they sit in the hall and how long they
 

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:58.760
they sit in the hall and how long they
were there this is from those 60s and

00:42:58.760 --> 00:42:58.770
were there this is from those 60s and
 

00:42:58.770 --> 00:42:59.210
were there this is from those 60s and
70s

00:42:59.210 --> 00:42:59.220
70s
 

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:01.880
70s
this this on the left is even a sort of

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:01.890
this this on the left is even a sort of
 

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:03.770
this this on the left is even a sort of
a more an older version of this I think

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780
a more an older version of this I think
 

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:08.690
a more an older version of this I think
this is from and you know you see sort

00:43:08.690 --> 00:43:08.700
this is from and you know you see sort
 

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:12.050
this is from and you know you see sort
of a person's name and then where they

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:12.060
of a person's name and then where they
 

00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.690
of a person's name and then where they
lived in the city of New York and as you

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:14.700
lived in the city of New York and as you
 

00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:16.210
lived in the city of New York and as you
might imagine turning this into a

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:16.220
might imagine turning this into a
 

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:18.950
might imagine turning this into a
database something like an excel file

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960
database something like an excel file
 

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.230
database something like an excel file
basically was an enormous challenge it

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:21.240
basically was an enormous challenge it
 

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.990
basically was an enormous challenge it
took thousands of hours of

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:23.000
took thousands of hours of
 

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.600
took thousands of hours of
undergraduates reading through these and

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:26.610
undergraduates reading through these and
 

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:30.800
undergraduates reading through these and
entering than in but the basic insight

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:30.810
entering than in but the basic insight
 

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:33.170
entering than in but the basic insight
was to say maybe we can think of a halt

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180
was to say maybe we can think of a halt
 

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.070
was to say maybe we can think of a halt
as

00:43:34.070 --> 00:43:34.080
as
 

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:37.430
as
geographic space a set of locations that

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440
geographic space a set of locations that
 

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:39.710
geographic space a set of locations that
people occupy and that we can think

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720
people occupy and that we can think
 

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.120
people occupy and that we can think
about the relationship between that

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.130
about the relationship between that
 

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:43.820
about the relationship between that
Geographic space and other Geographic

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:43.830
Geographic space and other Geographic
 

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.940
Geographic space and other Geographic
spaces like the space of the city and it

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:46.950
spaces like the space of the city and it
 

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.680
spaces like the space of the city and it
might give us a sense of there being

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:48.690
might give us a sense of there being
 

00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.750
might give us a sense of there being
neighborhoods in the hall as just there

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760
neighborhoods in the hall as just there
 

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.870
neighborhoods in the hall as just there
are neighborhoods in the city so maybe

00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880
are neighborhoods in the city so maybe
 

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.400
are neighborhoods in the city so maybe
people in the Upper East Side sit in a

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:55.410
people in the Upper East Side sit in a
 

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:57.320
people in the Upper East Side sit in a
particular place in the hall for example

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:57.330
particular place in the hall for example
 

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:59.150
particular place in the hall for example
but we also have other pieces of

00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160
but we also have other pieces of
 

00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.950
but we also have other pieces of
information that could become sort of

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960
information that could become sort of
 

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.020
information that could become sort of
interesting for us like what was playing

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:03.030
interesting for us like what was playing
 

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:05.570
interesting for us like what was playing
so are there different kinds of

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:05.580
so are there different kinds of
 

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.340
so are there different kinds of
constituencies for different kinds of

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:07.350
constituencies for different kinds of
 

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:11.240
constituencies for different kinds of
concepts and who's going to what and why

00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:11.250
concepts and who's going to what and why
 

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:12.920
concepts and who's going to what and why
and then there are all these little

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:12.930
and then there are all these little
 

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.530
and then there are all these little
natural experiments that happen over the

00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:15.540
natural experiments that happen over the
 

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.570
natural experiments that happen over the
course of the career of the Philharmonic

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:17.580
course of the career of the Philharmonic
 

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:21.230
course of the career of the Philharmonic
so it wasn't the case early in the

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240
so it wasn't the case early in the
 

00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:23.090
so it wasn't the case early in the
Philharmonic history that when you

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:23.100
Philharmonic history that when you
 

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.650
Philharmonic history that when you
bought a subscription to Philharmonic

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660
bought a subscription to Philharmonic
 

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.000
bought a subscription to Philharmonic
you knew what was going to be played for

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:26.010
you knew what was going to be played for
 

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:30.020
you knew what was going to be played for
example it was only until 1952 something

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:30.030
example it was only until 1952 something
 

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:32.510
example it was only until 1952 something
like that where you would know what you

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520
like that where you would know what you
 

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:34.100
like that where you would know what you
were going to listen to when you bought

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:34.110
were going to listen to when you bought
 

00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:37.490
were going to listen to when you bought
a ticket save months in advance and so

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:37.500
a ticket save months in advance and so
 

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.260
a ticket save months in advance and so
this then provided us an opportunity to

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:39.270
this then provided us an opportunity to
 

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:40.970
this then provided us an opportunity to
see maybe their own little taste

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:40.980
see maybe their own little taste
 

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.920
see maybe their own little taste
communities could emerge maybe there are

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:42.930
communities could emerge maybe there are
 

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.750
communities could emerge maybe there are
particular kinds of people who are

00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:44.760
particular kinds of people who are
 

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.290
particular kinds of people who are
interested in only hearing Beethoven and

00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300
interested in only hearing Beethoven and
 

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:49.730
interested in only hearing Beethoven and
Mozart and there are other sets of

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:49.740
Mozart and there are other sets of
 

00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:51.110
Mozart and there are other sets of
people who want to hear something for

00:44:51.110 --> 00:44:51.120
people who want to hear something for
 

00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:52.940
people who want to hear something for
their little more often part where are

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:52.950
their little more often part where are
 

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.110
their little more often part where are
they sitting what are they paying for

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:54.120
they sitting what are they paying for
 

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.730
they sitting what are they paying for
their seats where they from in the city

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:55.740
their seats where they from in the city
 

00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:58.370
their seats where they from in the city
of New York and so just a kind of

00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:58.380
of New York and so just a kind of
 

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.160
of New York and so just a kind of

everybody in the hall so that the hall
 

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:07.190

is Carnegie Hall on our right and on the

is Carnegie Hall on our right and on the
 

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.380
is Carnegie Hall on our right and on the
left little black boxes where do they

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:09.390
left little black boxes where do they
 

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.600
left little black boxes where do they
live in the city of New York so if we

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:11.610
live in the city of New York so if we
 

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:13.310
live in the city of New York so if we
took everybody from the hall and

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:13.320
took everybody from the hall and
 

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.200
took everybody from the hall and
relocated them geographically in New

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:15.210
relocated them geographically in New
 

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:18.020
relocated them geographically in New
York where would they live and not

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:18.030
York where would they live and not
 

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:20.360

surprisingly it shouldn't be that

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:20.370
surprisingly it shouldn't be that
 

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:22.310
surprisingly it shouldn't be that
surprising for us they're living I'm a

as is Chelsea in the Meatpacking

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800

District some of this just has to do

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:36.510
District some of this just has to do
 

00:45:36.510 --> 00:45:37.580
District some of this just has to do
with where people live in the city

00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:37.590
with where people live in the city
 

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:39.740
with where people live in the city
overall but some of it also has to do

00:45:39.740 --> 00:45:39.750
overall but some of it also has to do
 

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:41.090
overall but some of it also has to do
with the distribution of people

00:45:41.090 --> 00:45:41.100
with the distribution of people
 

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.010
with the distribution of people
throughout the City of Newark now we

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:43.020
throughout the City of Newark now we
 

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.170
throughout the City of Newark now we
might ask ourselves what about different

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.180
might ask ourselves what about different
 

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.200
might ask ourselves what about different
areas of the hall

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:46.210
areas of the hall
 

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:48.329
areas of the hall
so what does it look like if we take

00:45:48.329 --> 00:45:48.339
so what does it look like if we take
 

00:45:48.339 --> 00:45:50.339
so what does it look like if we take
people who sit and say in the balcony

00:45:50.339 --> 00:45:50.349
people who sit and say in the balcony
 

00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:54.180
people who sit and say in the balcony
rather than the entire fall and it's not

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:54.190
rather than the entire fall and it's not
 

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:56.550
rather than the entire fall and it's not
that different the balcony people are

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:56.560
that different the balcony people are
 

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:58.020
that different the balcony people are
pretty pretty widely distributed

00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:58.030
pretty pretty widely distributed
 

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.540
pretty pretty widely distributed
throughout the city of New York so

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:00.550
throughout the city of New York so
 

00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:02.640

you'll see on the right the balcony sort

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:02.650
you'll see on the right the balcony sort
 

00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:04.560
you'll see on the right the balcony sort
of blacked out here so those are all of

00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:04.570
of blacked out here so those are all of
 

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.359
of blacked out here so those are all of
the people who sat at the balcony that

00:46:06.359 --> 00:46:06.369
the people who sat at the balcony that
 

00:46:06.369 --> 00:46:08.490
the people who sat at the balcony that
year and on the left-hand side we have a

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:08.500
year and on the left-hand side we have a
 

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:10.079
year and on the left-hand side we have a
kind of a smattering of where they're

00:46:10.079 --> 00:46:10.089
kind of a smattering of where they're
 

00:46:10.089 --> 00:46:12.120
kind of a smattering of where they're
located along the island of Manhattan up

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:12.130
located along the island of Manhattan up
 

00:46:12.130 --> 00:46:14.220
located along the island of Manhattan up
into the Bronx some of them in Brooklyn

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:14.230
into the Bronx some of them in Brooklyn
 

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:18.480
into the Bronx some of them in Brooklyn
and a few even in New Jersey and but we

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:18.490
and a few even in New Jersey and but we
 

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:20.970
and a few even in New Jersey and but we
might compare this by contrast with the

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:20.980
might compare this by contrast with the
 

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:22.829
might compare this by contrast with the
set of people who sit in the boxes that

00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839
set of people who sit in the boxes that
 

00:46:22.839 --> 00:46:26.520
set of people who sit in the boxes that
is the people of the good seats and what

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:26.530
is the people of the good seats and what
 

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.440
is the people of the good seats and what
we notice there's a little red dots on

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:28.450
we notice there's a little red dots on
 

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:29.730
we notice there's a little red dots on
the left is they all live on Fifth

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:29.740
the left is they all live on Fifth
 

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:33.599
the left is they all live on Fifth
Avenue and this becomes a kind of it's

00:46:33.599 --> 00:46:33.609
Avenue and this becomes a kind of it's
 

00:46:33.609 --> 00:46:35.640
Avenue and this becomes a kind of it's
an interesting finding because you could

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:35.650
an interesting finding because you could
 

00:46:35.650 --> 00:46:37.710
an interesting finding because you could
imagine thinking about this over time

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:37.720
imagine thinking about this over time
 

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.310
imagine thinking about this over time
that is I actually didn't predict this

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:41.320
that is I actually didn't predict this
 

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:43.230
that is I actually didn't predict this
because I didn't it didn't occur to me

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240
because I didn't it didn't occur to me
 

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.560
because I didn't it didn't occur to me
how important a 5th Avenue address or

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:46.570
how important a 5th Avenue address or
 

00:46:46.570 --> 00:46:49.079
how important a 5th Avenue address or
proximity to Fifth Avenue would be so

00:46:49.079 --> 00:46:49.089
proximity to Fifth Avenue would be so
 

00:46:49.089 --> 00:46:51.329
proximity to Fifth Avenue would be so
you don't actually see deaths spatial

00:46:51.329 --> 00:46:51.339
you don't actually see deaths spatial
 

00:46:51.339 --> 00:46:52.950
you don't actually see deaths spatial
clustering here you don't see an

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960
clustering here you don't see an
 

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:55.260
clustering here you don't see an
instance where in everybody lives in the

and you know this is to just put them

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:13.960
and you know this is to just put them
 

00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.290
and you know this is to just put them
together so the red dots you can see

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300
 
 

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.670
 
this is not really any kind of analysis

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:20.680
this is not really any kind of analysis
 

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.560
this is not really any kind of analysis
yet so this is just the beginning so

00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:22.570
yet so this is just the beginning so
 

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:25.079
yet so this is just the beginning so
trying to cry generate some descriptive

00:47:25.079 --> 00:47:25.089
trying to cry generate some descriptive
 

00:47:25.089 --> 00:47:26.810
trying to cry generate some descriptive
data that then might turn into some

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:26.820
data that then might turn into some
 

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.030
data that then might turn into some
broader analysis for thinking about the

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:30.040
broader analysis for thinking about the
 

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.040
broader analysis for thinking about the
places in New York Philharmonic within

places in New York Philharmonic within
 

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.620
places in New York Philharmonic within
the city of New York and we're actually

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:34.630
the city of New York and we're actually
 

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:37.380
the city of New York and we're actually
augmenting the archive from the R Manik

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:37.390
augmenting the archive from the R Manik

oh I forgot yeah we have a little they

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200
oh I forgot yeah we have a little they
 

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:47.849
oh I forgot yeah we have a little they
have a Jif so this is a just over the

00:47:47.849 --> 00:47:47.859
have a Jif so this is a just over the
 

00:47:47.859 --> 00:47:50.190
have a Jif so this is a just over the
over the years if we just took the

00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200
over the years if we just took the
 

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.500
over the years if we just took the
people in the boxes

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:52.510
people in the boxes
 

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:54.240
people in the boxes
located so you can see sort of the

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:54.250
located so you can see sort of the
 

00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:56.430
located so you can see sort of the
spatial progression it's not it's a

00:47:56.430 --> 00:47:56.440
spatial progression it's not it's a
 

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.110
spatial progression it's not it's a
pretty picture that develops but this I

00:47:58.110 --> 00:47:58.120
pretty picture that develops but this I
 

00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:01.790
pretty picture that develops but this I
this note I've no big point about this

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800
this note I've no big point about this
 

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.650
this note I've no big point about this
but we're interested in not making this

00:48:04.650 --> 00:48:04.660
but we're interested in not making this

those of you who know the Social
Register it's kind of used to be

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:19.060
Register it's kind of used to be
 

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.570
Register it's kind of used to be
referred to as the study book and the

00:48:21.570 --> 00:48:21.580
referred to as the study book and the
 

00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:24.140
referred to as the study book and the
stud book in part because it was used by

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:24.150
stud book in part because it was used by
 

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.150

gentlemen for daughters
 

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.440
gentlemen for daughters
presumably also daughters for sons and

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:33.450
presumably also daughters for sons and
 

00:48:33.450 --> 00:48:36.120
presumably also daughters for sons and
one of the challenges for for

00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:36.130
one of the challenges for for
 

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:37.800
one of the challenges for for
understanding the Philharmonic in its

00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:37.810
understanding the Philharmonic in its
 

00:48:37.810 --> 00:48:39.660
understanding the Philharmonic in its
place in the broader ecology of New York

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:39.670
place in the broader ecology of New York
 

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:42.180
place in the broader ecology of New York
is if you don't have other accounts of

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:42.190
is if you don't have other accounts of
 

00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:43.440
is if you don't have other accounts of
the broader ecology of New York you

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:43.450
the broader ecology of New York you
 

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:44.940
the broader ecology of New York you
can't really say with the Philharmonic

00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:44.950
can't really say with the Philharmonic
 

00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:46.800
can't really say with the Philharmonic
is because we only have really one case

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:46.810
is because we only have really one case
 

00:48:46.810 --> 00:48:50.510
is because we only have really one case
and so what we're doing at this point is

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520
and so what we're doing at this point is
 

00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:55.380
and so what we're doing at this point is
also working with another archive this

00:48:55.380 --> 00:48:55.390
also working with another archive this
 

00:48:55.390 --> 00:48:57.900
also working with another archive this
is the Social Register so this is the

00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:57.910
is the Social Register so this is the

Social Register from 1897 and then it
has a similar bits of information in it

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:02.800
has a similar bits of information in it
 

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:05.550
has a similar bits of information in it
that is it has a name so we have

00:49:05.550 --> 00:49:05.560
that is it has a name so we have
 

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:10.700
that is it has a name so we have
professor Frank and we know that he

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:10.710
professor Frank and we know that he
 

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:14.040
professor Frank and we know that he
lives in Hoboken New Jersey a member of

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:14.050

listings of organizations that these
 

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:20.910
listings of organizations that these
different people are coming from so this

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920
different people are coming from so this
 

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:22.860
different people are coming from so this
will give us a sort of a portrait of an

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:22.870
will give us a sort of a portrait of an
 

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:25.640
will give us a sort of a portrait of an
elite New York and allow us to juxtapose

00:49:25.640 --> 00:49:25.650
elite New York and allow us to juxtapose
 

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:27.780
elite New York and allow us to juxtapose
some of the people who we think of as

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:27.790
some of the people who we think of as

to sort of see the role that this
 

00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:38.850
to sort of see the role that this
institution has played over say 150

kind of just a brief introduction to
what is a you know hopefully going to be

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:52.390
what is a you know hopefully going to be
 

00:49:52.390 --> 00:49:54.330
what is a you know hopefully going to be
a large-scale research project once we

00:49:54.330 --> 00:49:54.340
a large-scale research project once we
 

00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:56.940
a large-scale research project once we
get into a lot more of the data analysis

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:56.950
get into a lot more of the data analysis
 

00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:58.140
get into a lot more of the data analysis
and have more to present than just

00:49:58.140 --> 00:49:58.150
and have more to present than just
 

00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.470
and have more to present than just
pictures in terms of a tiny slice of the

00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:01.480
pictures in terms of a tiny slice of the
 

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.579
pictures in terms of a tiny slice of the
Philharmonic's archive I mean as a

00:50:03.579 --> 00:50:03.589
Philharmonic's archive I mean as a
 

00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:04.719
Philharmonic's archive I mean as a
since um the archives of the

00:50:04.719 --> 00:50:04.729
since um the archives of the
 

00:50:04.729 --> 00:50:06.459
since um the archives of the
Philharmonic the subscriber lists have

00:50:06.459 --> 00:50:06.469
Philharmonic the subscriber lists have
 

00:50:06.469 --> 00:50:08.950
Philharmonic the subscriber lists have
to be less than you know probably 0.5%

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960
to be less than you know probably 0.5%
 

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:12.160
to be less than you know probably 0.5%
probably even less but it gives us a

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:12.170
probably even less but it gives us a
 

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:15.099
probably even less but it gives us a
kind of moving portrait of the role of

00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:15.109
kind of moving portrait of the role of
 

00:50:15.109 --> 00:50:16.719
kind of moving portrait of the role of
the Philharmonic and a group of people's

00:50:16.719 --> 00:50:16.729
the Philharmonic and a group of people's
 

00:50:16.729 --> 00:50:20.200
the Philharmonic and a group of people's
lives and the location of people in New

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:20.210
lives and the location of people in New
 

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:22.450
lives and the location of people in New
York and how it is that they relate to a

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:22.460
York and how it is that they relate to a
 

00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:30.989
York and how it is that they relate to a
key cultural institution for the city

00:50:30.989 --> 00:50:30.999
 
 

00:50:30.999 --> 00:50:43.059
 
this is a page picked at random yeah

00:50:43.059 --> 00:50:43.069
this is a page picked at random yeah
 

00:50:43.069 --> 00:50:45.969
this is a page picked at random yeah
probably so in the in the early periods

00:50:45.969 --> 00:50:45.979
probably so in the in the early periods
 

00:50:45.979 --> 00:50:48.279
probably so in the in the early periods
what is it there's a 20% overlap of the

00:50:48.279 --> 00:50:48.289
what is it there's a 20% overlap of the
 

00:50:48.289 --> 00:50:49.630
what is it there's a 20% overlap of the
audiences between the Social Register

00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:49.640
audiences between the Social Register
 

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:53.620
audiences between the Social Register
and the Philharmonic and that's going to

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:53.630
and the Philharmonic and that's going to
 

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:55.719
and the Philharmonic and that's going to
decline considerably in time over time

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:55.729
decline considerably in time over time
 

00:50:55.729 --> 00:50:57.670
decline considerably in time over time
so the you know the idea that this is

00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680
so the you know the idea that this is
 

00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:59.049
so the you know the idea that this is
not you know it's obviously not your

00:50:59.049 --> 00:50:59.059
not you know it's obviously not your
 

00:50:59.059 --> 00:51:01.450
not you know it's obviously not your
archive but it's it's thinking about not

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:01.460
archive but it's it's thinking about not
 

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:02.650
archive but it's it's thinking about not
just thinking about the New York

00:51:02.650 --> 00:51:02.660
just thinking about the New York
 

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.749
just thinking about the New York
Philharmonic as an archive of an

00:51:04.749 --> 00:51:04.759
Philharmonic as an archive of an
 

00:51:04.759 --> 00:51:07.089
Philharmonic as an archive of an
institution in New York but as a major

00:51:07.089 --> 00:51:07.099
institution in New York but as a major
 

00:51:07.099 --> 00:51:09.549
institution in New York but as a major
archive about the city of New York that

00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:09.559
archive about the city of New York that
 

00:51:09.559 --> 00:51:12.099
archive about the city of New York that
other things that we have in

00:51:12.099 --> 00:51:12.109
other things that we have in
 

00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:13.870
other things that we have in
relationship to New York's history and

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:13.880
relationship to New York's history and
 

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.089
relationship to New York's history and
America's cultural history can relate to

00:51:16.089 --> 00:51:16.099
America's cultural history can relate to
 

00:51:16.099 --> 00:51:18.999
America's cultural history can relate to
and you know since we have names and

00:51:18.999 --> 00:51:19.009
and you know since we have names and
 

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:20.920
and you know since we have names and
addresses we can we can tie people

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:20.930
addresses we can we can tie people
 

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:23.410
addresses we can we can tie people
together so we know what we'll know at

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:23.420
together so we know what we'll know at
 

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:24.640
together so we know what we'll know at
the end of this is these people are the

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:24.650
the end of this is these people are the
 

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.769
the end of this is these people are the
same you know it's the same person and

00:51:26.769 --> 00:51:26.779
same you know it's the same person and
 

00:51:26.779 --> 00:51:29.589
same you know it's the same person and
to a degree you sort of know this person

00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599
to a degree you sort of know this person
 

00:51:29.599 --> 00:51:31.450
to a degree you sort of know this person
had tickets to this concert critical to

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:31.460
had tickets to this concert critical to
 

00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:33.430
had tickets to this concert critical to
play you know here we're who the

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440
play you know here we're who the
 

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.019
play you know here we're who the
soloists were here's how many times have

00:51:35.019 --> 00:51:35.029
soloists were here's how many times have
 

00:51:35.029 --> 00:51:36.130
soloists were here's how many times have
been played before at the Philharmonic

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:36.140
been played before at the Philharmonic
 

00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.680
been played before at the Philharmonic
here's who sat around them if you think

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:38.690
here's who sat around them if you think
 

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:39.880
here's who sat around them if you think
about the neighborhood in terms of the

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:39.890
about the neighborhood in terms of the
 

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:41.410
about the neighborhood in terms of the
building that they live in we know

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:41.420
building that they live in we know
 

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.579
building that they live in we know
whether or not other people went to

00:51:42.579 --> 00:51:42.589
whether or not other people went to
 

00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:45.009
whether or not other people went to
those concerts so it gives you a kind of

00:51:45.009 --> 00:51:45.019
those concerts so it gives you a kind of
 

00:51:45.019 --> 00:51:48.880
those concerts so it gives you a kind of
like tools for an analysis of the city

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:48.890
like tools for an analysis of the city
 

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:51.789
like tools for an analysis of the city
of New York and you know not just the

00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:51.799
of New York and you know not just the
 

00:51:51.799 --> 00:51:53.529
of New York and you know not just the
city of New York but one of America's

00:51:53.529 --> 00:51:53.539
city of New York but one of America's
 

00:51:53.539 --> 00:51:56.380
city of New York but one of America's
most important cities and cultural

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:56.390
most important cities and cultural
 

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:03.250
most important cities and cultural
institutions

00:52:03.250 --> 00:52:03.260
 
 

00:52:03.260 --> 00:52:07.640
 
yeah so the you know that there's there

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:07.650
yeah so the you know that there's there
 

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:10.550
yeah so the you know that there's there
are all kinds of challenges the we're

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:10.560
are all kinds of challenges the we're
 

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.900
are all kinds of challenges the we're
thinking of this is the Social Register

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:11.910
thinking of this is the Social Register
 

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:14.960
thinking of this is the Social Register
is sort of an elite social group so a

00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:14.970
is sort of an elite social group so a
 

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:17.720
is sort of an elite social group so a
group of Americans that think of

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:17.730
group of Americans that think of
 

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:19.670
group of Americans that think of
themselves as a kind of a social class

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680
themselves as a kind of a social class
 

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.560
themselves as a kind of a social class
that are a kind of an American

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:21.570
that are a kind of an American
 

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:24.830
that are a kind of an American
upper-class but not all of them are

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:24.840
upper-class but not all of them are
 

00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:26.300
upper-class but not all of them are
wealthy and not all wealthy people are

00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:26.310
wealthy and not all wealthy people are
 

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:28.340
wealthy and not all wealthy people are
in the Social Register so one of the

00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:28.350
in the Social Register so one of the
 

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:30.230
in the Social Register so one of the
advantages of having addresses is that

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240
advantages of having addresses is that
 

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.180
advantages of having addresses is that
you can use addresses to do estimates of

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:32.190
you can use addresses to do estimates of
 

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:35.450
you can use addresses to do estimates of
things like wow this is a huge problem

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460
things like wow this is a huge problem
 

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:39.410
things like wow this is a huge problem
in terms of a data problem so getting

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420
in terms of a data problem so getting
 

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:42.140
in terms of a data problem so getting
the actual value of each apartment in

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:42.150
the actual value of each apartment in
 

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:44.030
the actual value of each apartment in
the database I mean I don't know how

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040
the database I mean I don't know how
 

00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:46.040
the database I mean I don't know how
many people we have but we have two

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:46.050
many people we have but we have two
 

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:47.570
many people we have but we have two
hundred seventy-five thousand people is

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:47.580
hundred seventy-five thousand people is
 

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:53.180
hundred seventy-five thousand people is
that right fifty thousand people but in

00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:53.190
that right fifty thousand people but in
 

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:55.370
that right fifty thousand people but in
the entire game yeah okay

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:55.380
the entire game yeah okay
 

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:58.060
the entire game yeah okay
so just imagine taking up fifty thousand

00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:58.070
so just imagine taking up fifty thousand
 

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:00.470
so just imagine taking up fifty thousand
the value of fifty thousand households

00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480
the value of fifty thousand households
 

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:03.770
the value of fifty thousand households
over the over a long term but still we

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:03.780
over the over a long term but still we
 

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:05.900
over the over a long term but still we
can come up with some estimates of zip

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:05.910
can come up with some estimates of zip
 

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:08.540
can come up with some estimates of zip
codes of the average value of houses in

00:53:08.540 --> 00:53:08.550
codes of the average value of houses in
 

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.750
codes of the average value of houses in
areas and then think about social elite

00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760
areas and then think about social elite
 

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.460
areas and then think about social elite
miss that is the ways in which people

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:13.470
miss that is the ways in which people
 

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:15.740
miss that is the ways in which people
are part of a social community cultural

00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:15.750
are part of a social community cultural
 

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:18.440
are part of a social community cultural
participation and wealth of neighborhood

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:18.450
participation and wealth of neighborhood
 

00:53:18.450 --> 00:53:20.510
participation and wealth of neighborhood
and the ways in which those three three

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520
and the ways in which those three three
 

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:23.690
and the ways in which those three three
things sort of relate to one another so

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700
things sort of relate to one another so
 

00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:25.400
things sort of relate to one another so
that's one of the great advantages of

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:25.410
that's one of the great advantages of
 

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:27.290
that's one of the great advantages of
having the aggressives is not just the

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:27.300
having the aggressives is not just the
 

00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.270
having the aggressives is not just the
spatial clustering but our capacity to

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280
spatial clustering but our capacity to
 

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:31.400
spatial clustering but our capacity to
create estimates of economic inequality

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:31.410
create estimates of economic inequality
 

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:35.180
create estimates of economic inequality
or economic position we can also relate

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:35.190
or economic position we can also relate
 

00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:38.690
or economic position we can also relate
that to ticket prices so since we have

00:53:38.690 --> 00:53:38.700
that to ticket prices so since we have
 

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.210
that to ticket prices so since we have
the ticket price data you can imagine

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:41.220
the ticket price data you can imagine
 

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:44.030
the ticket price data you can imagine
that in a hall if we think about just

00:53:44.030 --> 00:53:44.040
that in a hall if we think about just
 

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.480
that in a hall if we think about just
the hall here lots of tickets cost the

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:47.490
the hall here lots of tickets cost the
 

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:50.420
the hall here lots of tickets cost the
same amount of money so it's just it's

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:50.430
same amount of money so it's just it's
 

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:53.930
same amount of money so it's just it's
not the case that every single seat is

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940
not the case that every single seat is
 

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:55.520
not the case that every single seat is
differently priced or that there are

00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:55.530
differently priced or that there are
 

00:53:55.530 --> 00:53:57.380

options for seats they're actually set
 

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:59.780
options for seats they're actually set
in their value and you can see so that

00:53:59.780 --> 00:53:59.790
in their value and you can see so that
 

00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:01.640
in their value and you can see so that
when you occupy a seat you have an

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:01.650
when you occupy a seat you have an
 

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:03.950
when you occupy a seat you have an
option as to where you want to sit now

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960
option as to where you want to sit now
 

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.480
option as to where you want to sit now

some of that is going to be personal
taste but some of it also might be the

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520
taste but some of it also might be the
 

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:10.299
taste but some of it also might be the
kind of place you want to be locate

work off of it and then within a year or
 

00:56:08.479 --> 00:56:15.950
work off of it and then within a year or
so where we'll be putting it online

00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960

Philharmonic well then I'd say about a
 

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:06.090
Philharmonic well then I'd say about a
year something like that so we don't

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:06.100
year something like that so we don't
 

00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.160
year something like that so we don't
have any proprietary control over it in

can you'll be able to download this this

00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:28.930
can you'll be able to download this this
 

00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:31.890
can you'll be able to download this this
data file yourself and do whatever you

00:57:31.890 --> 00:57:31.900
data file yourself and do whatever you

interesting there to see these kinds of
 

00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:33.250
interesting there to see these kinds of
things but the other movie two different

00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:33.260
things but the other movie two different

halls then this crosses over we have the

00:58:35.770 --> 00:58:35.780
halls then this crosses over we have the
 

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:37.690
halls then this crosses over we have the
layouts and of different halls so you

00:58:37.690 --> 00:58:37.700
layouts and of different halls so you
 

00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:40.870
layouts and of different halls so you
can even see and it's not really a part

00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880
can even see and it's not really a part
 

00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.210
can even see and it's not really a part
of she study but like you know did they

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:43.220

in some ways it's a great kind of

00:58:59.400 --> 00:58:59.410
in some ways it's a great kind of
 

00:58:59.410 --> 00:59:07.160
in some ways it's a great kind of
democratization of audience but

00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:07.170
democratization of audience but
 

00:59:07.170 --> 00:59:09.170
democratization of audience but
yeah and I mean there's a there's a

00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:09.180
yeah and I mean there's a there's a
 

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.819
yeah and I mean there's a there's a
qualitative part of this project as well

00:59:10.819 --> 00:59:10.829
qualitative part of this project as well
 

00:59:10.829 --> 00:59:13.370
qualitative part of this project as well
so as much as you know the the first

00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:13.380
so as much as you know the the first
 

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.680
so as much as you know the the first
push was to basically construct this

00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:15.690
push was to basically construct this
 

00:59:15.690 --> 00:59:19.400
push was to basically construct this
database and the second has been to so

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:19.410
database and the second has been to so
 

00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:21.200
database and the second has been to so
we've had somebody read through all of

00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:21.210
we've had somebody read through all of
 

00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:22.640
we've had somebody read through all of
the letters that were written to

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:22.650
the letters that were written to

you know the earliest digital format the

01:21:21.130 --> 01:21:21.140
you know the earliest digital format the
 

01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:23.440

01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:31.600
 
because that's digital bit and we think

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:31.610
because that's digital bit and we think
 

01:21:31.610 --> 01:21:35.430
because that's digital bit and we think
that digital now sometimes is so

01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440
that digital now sometimes is so
 

01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.430
that digital now sometimes is so
