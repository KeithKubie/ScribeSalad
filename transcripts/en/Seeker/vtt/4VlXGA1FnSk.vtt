00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:09.510
Look at that guy, he thinks he's plants!

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.910
Howdy vitamen, vitawomen, and everyone in
between, Trace here with some brain nutrition

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.240
for DNews.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.960
Vitamin D is everywhere in our diets these
days, sort of.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.880
You can get it in cereal, milk, orange juices
and other fortified foods, as well as in fatty

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.200
fish, egg yolks and a few other places.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.760
But, mostly, vitamin D comes from YOU.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.220
From your skin.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.460
You MAKE it.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.360
Vitamin D is actually a group of five fat-soluble
molecules, and in it's main animal version,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.219
Vitamin D3, it promotes absorption of calcium
for our bones.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.879
Without vitamin D, adults can experience osteomalacia
-- pain and weakness, and children can develop

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.969
rickets: a softening of the bone's growth
plates which can lead to bowed legs.

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.090
Bottom line, D3 is real important.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.840
But let's get back to this skin thing.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.900
Plants have photosynthesis, right?

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.809
Well, we have dermal vitamin synthesis!

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.650
Deep in the skin is a steroid called 7-dehydrocholesterol,
and when it's hit by UV B from the sun, the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.340
sun's photons break one of its chemical bonds,
which converts to cholecalciferol -- the science

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.360
name for vitamin D3!

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.990
Once the D3 is created, the liver and kidneys
convert it to it's final form: calcitriol!

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.990
Whew.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.710
It's a process, but it all starts with exposure
from a nuclear fusion ball millions of miles

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.420
away.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.920
Once created in the kidneys, a protein called
DBP -- or vitamin D binding protein -- grabs

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.759
it and transports it to the organs where it
starts cascade of effects from building bones

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.700
by balancing the calcium and phosphate in
the body, to maintaining nervous system function.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.909
Vitamin D is even essential in helping DNA
to express between 100 and 1250 genes!

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.530
There are also studies which hypothesize Vitamin
D or calcitriol helps treat autoimmune diseases,

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.340
diabetes, infections, cognitive degeneration
and cancer; and can prevent heart disease!

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.610
This stuff is apparently awesome!

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.149
Which is why we started putting it everywhere...

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.500
Studies in Boston found in 1900, 80 percent
of children were afflicted with the skeletal

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.700
devastation that is rickets.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.530
All from a lack of vitamin D ingestion!

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.770
So, in the 1930s the U.S. government asked
food companies to add cod liver oil, or vitamin

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.370
D, to their products in a process called fortification;
hoping to eradicate the problem!

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.790
Milk and cereal producers have been adding
vitamin D to their moo juice and flakes ever

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.790
since!

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.620
It worked as rickets has been virtually eliminated
in the West today.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.980
The thing is, remember, there are FIVE FORMS
of vitamin D. And food processors don't add

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.849
D3, the stuff we make in our bodies, they
add a different version: D2 -- ergocalciferol.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.840
PLANT vitamin D, not animal.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.030
Allegedly, our body treats them both the same,
though that debate is ongoing, with some scientists

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.690
saying it's less efficient for the body to
convert, so you need more than if you just

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.690
went outside.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.940
You can get all the D3 you need with as little
as 5 to 15 minutes of direct sunlight on your

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.050
"hands, arms, and face."

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.660
So, for allllll the chatter and praise vitamin
D gets from the media, you can just make it.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.240
However, if you're worried, YES. you can have
too much, but it's hard.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.590
Vitamin D toxicity is more a risk for people
taking vitamin supplements.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:14.500
And can cause an increase calcium levels which
results in heart arrhythmias, decreased appetite

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.500
and increased urination.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.340
It can even cause nausea, vomiting, disorientation
and the like.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.489
Your body is trying to get all that excess
calcium OUT.

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.849
But, you'd have to drink more than 40 cups
of milk per day to exceed the maximum daily

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:30.430
dose So, it's more important to be careful
with calcium supplements, which are also D2,

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.580
again not D3… they work, but remember, debate.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.549
Vitamin D is just one of many vitamins and
minerals the body needs every day.

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.599
It really struck me that the process of making
it from the sun is so complicated!

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.190
Evolution is amazing.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.980
Speaking of all those vitamins… do they
REALLY improve

00:03:47.980 --> 00:04:07.520
Do you stand in the sun for 5 minutes a day?

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.909
Or would you rather just take a pill or drink
a bit of milk?
