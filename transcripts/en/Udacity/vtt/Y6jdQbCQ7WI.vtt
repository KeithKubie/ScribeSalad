00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.952
Scaling is done by updating the replicas
field in our deployment manifest.

00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:08.942
This is a best practice because even
though we could use imperative methods

00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:10.730
like the Cube CTS scale command.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.060
Then there is no state saved anywhere.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.350
Under the hood, deployments create
a replica set to handle Pod creation,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.240
deletion and updates.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.020
Deployments own and
manage the replica sets for us, so

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.450
we don't have to worry
about managing them.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.940
Using our deployments this way,
makes scaling up and

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.870
down as easy as one, two, three.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.530
Let's have show us what this
looks like in practice.
