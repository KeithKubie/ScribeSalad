00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.399
The Language Made Up Entirely of Whistles

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.590
In Spanish, “Silbo Gomero” means “Gomeran
whistling,” which is an apt name for the

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.379
language “spoken” on La Gomera in the
Canary Islands.

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.089
You see, this language is made up entirely
of whistling sounds.

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.070
The language was used by the Guanches—the
aboriginal people of the Canary Islands—long

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.170
before Spanish settlement.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.960
It is a whistled form of the original Guanche
language, which died out around the 17th century.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.410
Not much is known about that spoken language
of those people save for a few words recorded

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.369
in the journals of travellers and a few others
that were integrated into the Spanish spoken

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.860
on the Canary Islands.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.860
It is believed that spoken Guanche had a simple
phonetic pattern that made it easily adaptable

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.860
to whistling.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.070
The language was whistled across the Canary
Islands, popular on Gran Canaria, Tenerife,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.160
and El Hiero as well as La Gomera.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.989
It’s likely that the first Guanches were
from North Africa and brought the idea of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.489
a whistled language with them, as there are
several different whistling languages that

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:53.930
have been recorded there.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.160
From the time of Guanche settlement, the language
evolved into Guanche whistling, and then to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.160
silbo.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.039
Today, silbo is a whistled form of Spanish.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.970
It was adopted in the 16th century after the
last of the Guanches adapted their whistled

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.350
language to Spanish.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.730
The language works by replicating timbre variations
in speech.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.220
One study showed that silbo is recognized
in the “language center” of the brain

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.420
by silbo whistlers, though regular Spanish
speakers who were not silbo whistlers simply

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.290
recognized it as whistling.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.810
As to why such a version of a language would
originally be developed at all, it’s thought

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.299
that silbo was developed as a form of long
distance communication.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.729
The island of La Gomera is awash with hills,
valleys, and ravines.

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.000
A whistle can travel up to two miles across
such a landscape, and the whistler doesn’t

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.490
have to expend as much energy as he would
by hiking or shouting and, in the latter case,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.540
the whistled message is heard farther away
besides.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.640
When La Gomera was largely an agricultural
island, crops and herds of animals like sheep

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.090
would be spread out across the hills, and
herders would use the language to communicate

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.870
with one another across these large distances.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.370
Speaking via whistling still saw widespread
use as late as the 1940s and 50s, when another

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:56.829
purpose was discovered.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.460
If a fire started, the Guardia Civil would
make civilians drop what they were doing to

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.620
help, but the locals wouldn’t get paid for
their work, despite the Guardia receiving

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.620
a payment.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.430
So, locals passed a message along by whistling,
telling others to hide when the Guardia Civil

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.430
approached.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.060
Because the Guardia Civil didn’t understand
silbo, it was a sort of “secret” language

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.310
among the locals.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.910
Unfortunately, economic hardship around the
1950s put silbo-speaking in the decline, as

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.220
most of the whistlers were forced to move
to find better opportunities.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.890
The introduction of roads and the invention
of the mobile phone also contributed to the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.940
decline, as they made silbo largely unnecessary.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.350
By the end of the twentieth century, the whistled
language was dying out.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.860
However, as it is an integral part of the
island’s history, there was interest in

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.150
reviving the language to preserve the culture.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.070
The call for revival was met with mixed emotions,
because many people thought of it as a “peasant”

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.950
language of little use to them.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.090
Despite the protests, every primary school
child on La Gomera today is required to learn

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.440
the whistling language, with it being taught
in the island’s schools.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.010
The revival of silbo has other benefits, too.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.510
Silbo is one of the few whistling languages
that has been studied in-depth, and researchers

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.120
believe that its simplicity (with only 2-4
vowels and 4 consonants) holds the key to

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.510
discovering how other languages developed,
despite not knowing the exact origin of silbo

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:20.950
itself.
