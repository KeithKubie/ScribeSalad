00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.430
These female insects know the burden of carrying
a penis around all the time... because they've

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.279
GOT ONE.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:13.120
Yes, FEMALES with PENISES.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.580
WHAT?!

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.520
Hey everybody Trace here for DNews.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.779
WHY are you a female or male?

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.130
WHAT MAKES YOU ONE OR THE OTHER.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.970
It's not having a penis or vagina, that's
just a CHARACTERISTIC of the sex not the definition.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.900
It's not even who carries the baby!

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.690
As you probably have heard, the male seahorse
carries the babies while the female buggers

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.690
off to...

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:35.050
I'm not sure where to, maybe that's another
DNews.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.750
Anyway, there's no doubt in seahorses which
is the male and which is the female -- and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540
it has NOTHING to do with who carries the
babies.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.540
Any ideas?!

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.940
Okay, I'll give this one to you, males make
sperm, females have eggs.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.030
That's the difference.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.030
That's all.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.600
A new study in Current Biology released today
is challenging everything we know about vaginas

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.600
and penises -- because they're completely
swapped.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.540
The female has a penis but still makes the
eggs, and the male has a vagina!

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.540
It's crazy!

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.770
The cave-dwelling Brazilian insect Neotrogla,
is the first organism ever found to COMPLETELY

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.030
flip-flip the organs, this female bug literally
has a big 'ol penis.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.679
During intercourse, which lasts 40 to 70 hours....
amateurs.

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:20.030
Anyway, during that time, the female puts
its penis... thing called a gynosome into

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.359
the male's vagina.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.840
Once inserted, it gets better ....... The
gynosome inflates and barbs on the exterior

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.600
lock the two nerotrogla together in what sounds
like 40-70 hours of horribleness while the

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.369
female of the species absorbs the sperm along
with a nutrient rich fluid the sperm live

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.109
in.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.960
Then the sperm fertilizes the egg, and that's
where neotrogla babies come from!

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.340
[[STARE]] The scientists believe their low-nutrient
environment led to this unique sexual adaptation.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.689
The female gains nourishment by consuming
the sperm and fluid during copulation, and

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.619
the male gets... well... gets to copulate
for a few days in a row?

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.619
I guess?

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.030
What's the point though, why do we even HAVE
these sex organs.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.320
It's not like the penis or vagina help us
be better hunters or farmers.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.320
Why did they evolve?

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.320
Darwin wrote in 1871 that he believed the
differentiation arose from sexual competition

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.170
... basically we evolved larger members or
brighter feathers because we wanted to attract

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.170
a mate.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.670
In most of the natural world, the males have
the penises, because the eggs live inside

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:14.670
the females.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.850
Penises have evolved to reach into the other
sex's body to deposit that sperm.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.900
But seriously, giant bug dicks?

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.900
What the crap nature?!

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:22.900
The scientists believe this discovery will
allow us to study sexual selection, conflict

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.900
between the sexes, and the evolution of novel
sexual differentiation!

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.900
Of the 8.7 million species on the planet,
this is the ONLY ONE with complete opposite

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.900
evolutionary structures.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.900
How do you feel about it?

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.900
Feeling envious?
