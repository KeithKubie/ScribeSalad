00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.660
Google recently announced their self-driving
cars have been in 11 crashes ever?

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.810
Like… ever.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:18.090
But, I've never been in a car accident so
does that make me better than them?

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.560
This week, the Associated Press reported Google's
self-driving cars were involved in 11 minor

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.160
crashes in six years.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.750
Is that a lot?

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.890
Not according to Google.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.720
They count it as a win that their cars have
driven 1 million automated miles of testing

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.620
in the six years they've been at it, and have
only had these few fender benders.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.629
By comparison, the human population crashes
about 0.3 times for every 100,000 miles, (161,000

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.160
km) per driver according to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.280
Wait a second ... So really, Google’s stats
aren’t that much better at 0.6 per 100,000!

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.850
So why are they spending so much money to
develop a self-driving car that doesn't seem

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.850
safer?

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.379
Because many non-fatal crashes go unreported,
so it’s very likely that point three crashes

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.940
per 100,000 miles isn’t even accurate.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.520
On top of that, 94 percent of ALL crashes
EVER are caused by human failure.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.530
We are the absolute worst at driving.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.590
Cell phone bans don't reduce crashes, drunk
driving prohibitions, speed limits, and the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.870
like don't stop drivers crashing; instead
fatalities are still in the tens of thousands

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.870
every year.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.050
In fact, the reason there were collisions
with the self-driving cars at all was because

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.370
of driver frickin' error!

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.930
Sources say the car has been rear-ended mostly,
but it's also been sideswiped and hit by a

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.030
car that ran a red light or stop sign.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.800
Since the crash specifics are secret, we can't
be certain, but Google says the car was never

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.480
at fault, and eight of those crashes were
on city streets.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.730
If you buy their spin, then yes - the cars
probably ARE safer!

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.640
And private cars are just the tip of the iceberg.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.610
We’re also gonna be seeing autonomous vehicles
in the commercial space.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.660
Earlier this month, auto manufacturer Daimler
unveiled its self-driving semi-truck.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.960
The "Inspiration Truck" can drive itself on
the highway, and only needs a human operator

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.410
in cities.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.119
On top of that, they can network on the road
and drive in a caravan, getting improved gas

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.610
milage as a crew by taking advantage of the
slipstream of the truck in front of them.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.870
Basically, only the truck in front has to
fully cut through the air, the rest "draft"

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.950
and get a mileage boost.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.739
The Bureau of Transportation Statistics estimates
commercial freight logged 3.3 TRILLION ton-miles

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.030
in 2012, and trucks represented 38 percent
of that -- or 1.3 TRILLION miles.That’s

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.540
a lot of ground to cover for the Inspiration
Truck or other similar commercial trucks.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.030
Aside from Google and Daimler, Audi and Nissan
have also developed self-driving cars.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.819
Tesla announced the Model S will have autonomous
features within a few months.

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.040
So the future is pretty much here.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.340
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
ranks self-driving vehicles, and both the

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.250
Google cars and the Inspiration Truck as "Level
3" autonomous vehicles; not unlike an airplane

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.400
on autopilot.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.620
They can travel autonomously, but quote "The
driver is expected to be available for occasional

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.709
control… [given] sufficiently comfortable
transition time."

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.400
So the car can't just toss it to the driver
when someone jumps in front… but then who

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.689
is at fault?

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:17.150
If "driver" wasn't actually driving, and Google
programmed the thing; what happens?

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.470
At this point, no one knows.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.560
California, Nevada, Michigan, Florida, and
Washington, D.C are the only places that license

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.709
for self-driving cars, so far, and there are
only 48 autonomous vehicles registered in

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.189
California; 23 of those are Google's.

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:36.810
In the end these laws are still SO new, and
the technology isn't entirely proven.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.720
Driving a million autonomous miles is piddly
compared to the trillions travelled by truck

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.720
drivers in the U.S. alone.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.480
What do you think?

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.200
Are you looking forward to a future where
you never have to drive yourself?

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.629
How about a future with cars powered by salt
water?

00:03:49.629 --> 00:04:09.930
Julian has more on that in 
this video.
