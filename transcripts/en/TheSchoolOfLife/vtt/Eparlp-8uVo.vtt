00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.400
The moment

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.300
to settle down used to be when you had a bit of spare money and a decent job.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.379
Then when things became more romantic it became all about being

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.719
deeply in love with someone. But both these criteria

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.100
are now heavily outdated. These are the six things

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.960
you need to do to signal you're ready to settle down and have a chance of

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.840
a successful

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.680
long term relationship. The moment to settle down

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.090
is when you finally realize your partner is deeply

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.290
imperfect. They have a hundred different flaws,

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.719
they're maddening in all sorts of ways and are riddled with psychological neurosis

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:41.660
that make them very hard to deal with.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.900
However, there is an important additional realization.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.840
Everyone is in fact like this. Once you get below the charming

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.680
outer surface. No one else will be better. We're a fundamentally

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.960
flawed species.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.910
There's no such thing as a right person, everyone is wrong

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.280
in fascinating and enragingly diverse ways.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.010
We think love is about being understood

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.360
for all the secret vulnerable parts of us that others don't

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.960
grasp. But however much the other seems to understand us

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.560
there will always be huge tracks of our psyches that remain

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.720
utterly incomprehensible to others. No one probably understands

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.500
and can therefore fully sympathize with anyone else.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.729
For a long time it's easy to pretend one's normal,

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.580
even quite easy going. But it's time to settle down when you're mature enough to have an

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.399
active sense of what a liability you are. You're out of control for regular periods,

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.190
you lose perspective, you're anxious all the time. You're mature

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.990
when you can be deeply embarrassed about who you are and are prepared to apologize for the

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.490
fact

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100
on a regular basis.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.859
Confusingly we speak of love as one thing when it's in fact

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.440
two. Being loved and loving.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.240
We should settle down when we are finally ready to stop

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.260
always wanting to be loved and pick up the ropes that far less familiar activity,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.940
actually loving someone. The unhelpful feelings that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.200
love is all about being loved starts in childhood.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.800
To the child it feels as if the parent is simply spontaneously on hand

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.910
to comfort, entertain, feed, clear up

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.500
and remain almost always warm and cheerful. Parents don't reveal to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.660
their kids how often they've bitten their tongue, fought back the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.450
tears, and been too tired to take off their clothes

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.330
after a day of child care. The relationship is almost entirely

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.630
nonreciprocal. Parent and child may both

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.630
love, but each party is on a very different end of

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.130
the axis, unbeknownst to the child. That's why in adulthood

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.480
when we first say we long for love, what we predominately mean

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.040
is that we want to be loved as we all onced loved by a parent.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.600
We want a recreation in adulthood of what it felt like to be ministered to and indulged.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.050
We want someone who will understand our needs, bring us what we want,

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.670
be immensely patient and sympathetic to us, act selflessly

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.000
and make it all better. This is, naturally

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.240
a disaster. For a relationship to work

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.000
we need to move firmly out of the child mode and into

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.300
the parental one.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.760
The romantic person instinctively sees relationships

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.750
in terms of emotions. But what a couple actually get up to together over

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.480
a lifetime

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.860
has much more in common with the workings of a small business.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.420
The two people must clean, chauffeur, cook, fix, throw away,

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.720
hire a budget. None of these activities has any glamour whatsoever within

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.230
the current arrangement of society. Those obliged to do them

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.599
are therefore highly likely to feel that something has gone wrong with their

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.680
lives. That having to involve themselves so closely with them.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.480
And yet these tasks are truly romantic

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.310
in a sense of conducive sustaining of love and are the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.170
bedrock of any successful relationship. At the alter

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.240
new couples should take a mutual vow, "I accept the dignity

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.100
of the ironing board..."

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.370
There's an idea that being loved means that your partner will never

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.830
try to change you. But they should and must want to change you

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.570
because you're deeply imperfect and in need of some severe remolding

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.120
in all sorts of areas. If you're not ready for it, it may look

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.680
like hostility and you may respond defensively. But you're ready to settle down

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.960
when you can bear to have things pointed out to you. You should at

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.070
key points, see them as the theacher and you as the pupil, and vice versa,

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.780
with neither side

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.750
losing their tempers. Relationships are meant to be an education

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.630
towards becoming two better people. Not a process of acceptance for

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:45.510
everything one already is. With these dark and sober criteria in mind

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.400
we can go back into the world of relationships, sure of a brighter,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.400
longer and more realistic future.
