data as developers okay great
 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.819
data as developers okay great
so the app we have running here why

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:19.829
so the app we have running here why
 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.469
so the app we have running here why
don't we go ahead and take a little bit

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479
don't we go ahead and take a little bit
 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.169
don't we go ahead and take a little bit
of a look at it so that people can see

00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:24.179
of a look at it so that people can see
 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.359
of a look at it so that people can see
what we're talking about so what am I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369
what we're talking about so what am I
 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.010
what we're talking about so what am I
looking at right now this is the

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020
looking at right now this is the
 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.399
looking at right now this is the
precipitation a forecast for the UK for

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
precipitation a forecast for the UK for
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.849
precipitation a forecast for the UK for
the next few hours and as you see the

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859
the next few hours and as you see the
 

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.740
the next few hours and as you see the
layers are animating across the map and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
layers are animating across the map and
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.469
layers are animating across the map and
you have bands of rain are coming across

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
you have bands of rain are coming across
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.609
you have bands of rain are coming across
the UK and more yellow the more red the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619
the UK and more yellow the more red the
 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.039
the UK and more yellow the more red the
actual color is on the overlay more rain

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
actual color is on the overlay more rain
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.859
actual color is on the overlay more rain
that's in that area right okay so this

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
that's in that area right okay so this
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.929
that's in that area right okay so this
kind of thing that you would see in

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939
kind of thing that you would see in
 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.370
kind of thing that you would see in
you know no TV broadcast at night or

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380
you know no TV broadcast at night or
 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.779
you know no TV broadcast at night or
something like that and telling you

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789
something like that and telling you
 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.050
something like that and telling you
about what's what's going on okay so how

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060
about what's what's going on okay so how
 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.559
about what's what's going on okay so how
how did you do this animation so when

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569
how did you do this animation so when
 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.949
how did you do this animation so when
the app starts when the views loaded it

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959
the app starts when the views loaded it
 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:09.990
the app starts when the views loaded it
pulls down in the latest forecasts and

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000
pulls down in the latest forecasts and
 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.869
pulls down in the latest forecasts and
the latest observations for the UK and

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:12.879
the latest observations for the UK and
 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:15.089
the latest observations for the UK and
then lines up the end if their images as

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099
then lines up the end if their images as
 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.280
then lines up the end if their images as
an animation and then loops random on

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290
an animation and then loops random on
 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.500
an animation and then loops random on
the map and so you can see this really

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510
the map and so you can see this really
 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.589
the map and so you can see this really
nice a flow of data across a flow of

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599
nice a flow of data across a flow of
 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.660
nice a flow of data across a flow of
Energy's across the map okay and you're

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670
Energy's across the map okay and you're
 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.250
Energy's across the map okay and you're
using ground overlays and you're

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260
using ground overlays and you're
 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.819
using ground overlays and you're
basically just changing the PNG that the

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829
basically just changing the PNG that the
 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:31.170
basically just changing the PNG that the
ground overlay uses yeah that's right

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180
ground overlay uses yeah that's right
 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.360
ground overlay uses yeah that's right
basically go away and fetch up all the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370
basically go away and fetch up all the
 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.000
basically go away and fetch up all the
all the layers of the old images and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010
all the layers of the old images and
 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.509
all the layers of the old images and
animation and when that's preloaded then

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519
animation and when that's preloaded then
 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.220
animation and when that's preloaded then
just start the animation off and for

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230
just start the animation off and for
 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.339
just start the animation off and for
every a loop rent the timer it will

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349
every a loop rent the timer it will
 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.680
every a loop rent the timer it will
insert the ground overlay onto the map

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690
insert the ground overlay onto the map
 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.479
insert the ground overlay onto the map
and it gives us nice illusion of

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489
and it gives us nice illusion of
 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.630
and it gives us nice illusion of
animation cool so what are some of your

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640
animation cool so what are some of your
 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.030
animation cool so what are some of your
favorite your favorite or relates that

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040
favorite your favorite or relates that
 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.699
favorite your favorite or relates that
you've gone here so my might so there's

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709
you've gone here so my might so there's
 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.300
you've gone here so my might so there's
two really awesome overlays here and my

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310
two really awesome overlays here and my
 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.569
two really awesome overlays here and my
favorite is the the clothes in the rain

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579
favorite is the the clothes in the rain
 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:11.909
favorite is the the clothes in the rain
together and as we fetch the images so

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919
together and as we fetch the images so
 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.339
together and as we fetch the images so
it does take a moment to fetch the the

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349
it does take a moment to fetch the the
 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:16.349
it does take a moment to fetch the the
images but once it does it they're

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359
images but once it does it they're
 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:19.500
images but once it does it they're
cached yes is that going run you can see

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510
cached yes is that going run you can see
 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.690
cached yes is that going run you can see
that's actually pretty fast yeah so yeah

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700
that's actually pretty fast yeah so yeah
 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.670
that's actually pretty fast yeah so yeah
go away and fetch all the images so that

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680
go away and fetch all the images so that
 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.400
go away and fetch all the images so that
we don't have this broken cycle of

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410
we don't have this broken cycle of
 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.159
we don't have this broken cycle of
animation we got one a infinite loop of

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169
animation we got one a infinite loop of
 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.110
animation we got one a infinite loop of
the animation of the latest forecast so

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120
the animation of the latest forecast so
 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.750
the animation of the latest forecast so
you have here the cloud cover and the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760
you have here the cloud cover and the
 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.750
you have here the cloud cover and the
rain a cover of the UK forecast for the

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760
rain a cover of the UK forecast for the
 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.170
rain a cover of the UK forecast for the
next few hours and you can barely see

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180
next few hours and you can barely see
 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.449
next few hours and you can barely see
the you yeah exactly yeah this is this

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459
the you yeah exactly yeah this is this
 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.129
the you yeah exactly yeah this is this
is natural for the UK we're always under

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139
is natural for the UK we're always under
 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.869
is natural for the UK we're always under
clothes

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879
 
 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.309
 
so we have this layer which is really

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319
so we have this layer which is really
 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.539
so we have this layer which is really
nice because every time you load this up

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549
nice because every time you load this up
 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:52.440
nice because every time you load this up
it will loads up

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450
it will loads up
 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.690
it will loads up
the forecast for the next 8 12 hours

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700
the forecast for the next 8 12 hours
 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.240
the forecast for the next 8 12 hours
mm-hm and my other favorite is these

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250
mm-hm and my other favorite is these
 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.670
mm-hm and my other favorite is these
observation layers and you have this

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680
observation layers and you have this
 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.009
observation layers and you have this
infrared observation and this is a

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019
infrared observation and this is a
 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.870
infrared observation and this is a
really nice overlay because it's

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880
really nice overlay because it's
 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.980
really nice overlay because it's
actually the MU geez

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:04.990
actually the MU geez
 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.990
actually the MU geez
come from the sass the weather

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000
come from the sass the weather
 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.530
come from the sass the weather
satellites there are looking down on so

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540
satellites there are looking down on so
 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.020
satellites there are looking down on so
it's the unprocessed MPGs that you don't

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030
it's the unprocessed MPGs that you don't
 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.030
it's the unprocessed MPGs that you don't
really get to see on the weather reports

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040
really get to see on the weather reports
 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.580
really get to see on the weather reports
and as you see you have this kind of

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590
and as you see you have this kind of
 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.740
and as you see you have this kind of
inverted looks where you can see the

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750
inverted looks where you can see the
 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.750
inverted looks where you can see the
cloud cover coming across again you

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760
cloud cover coming across again you
 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.420
cloud cover coming across again you
can't really see the UK but eventually

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430
can't really see the UK but eventually
 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.520
can't really see the UK but eventually
when you run the court in different days

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530
when you run the court in different days
 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.500
when you run the court in different days
obviously it's live data so we're

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510
obviously it's live data so we're
 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.180
obviously it's live data so we're
covered in plates you'll see but you can

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190
covered in plates you'll see but you can
 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.760
covered in plates you'll see but you can
see the overlay of the UK and it's a

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770
see the overlay of the UK and it's a
 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.320
see the overlay of the UK and it's a
really good indicator of whether you've

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330
really good indicator of whether you've
 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.060
really good indicator of whether you've
actually put the ground overlay on the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070
actually put the ground overlay on the
 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.740
actually put the ground overlay on the
map correctly well they're all lanes up

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750
map correctly well they're all lanes up
 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.380
map correctly well they're all lanes up
to the bend and boxes so this is an

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390
to the bend and boxes so this is an
 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.880
to the bend and boxes so this is an
interesting one if you take a look at

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890
interesting one if you take a look at
 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.070
interesting one if you take a look at
the rainfall one you can actually see

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080
the rainfall one you can actually see
 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.670
the rainfall one you can actually see
that underneath the animated overlays

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680
that underneath the animated overlays
 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.430
that underneath the animated overlays
you actually have a is it a custom map

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440
you actually have a is it a custom map
 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.950
you actually have a is it a custom map
or a tile overlays it's a tile overlay

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960
or a tile overlays it's a tile overlay
 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.740
or a tile overlays it's a tile overlay
that I've created myself it just allows

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750
that I've created myself it just allows
 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.050
that I've created myself it just allows
us to have this a when we're putting the

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060
us to have this a when we're putting the
 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.020
us to have this a when we're putting the
ground overlays of the actual

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030
ground overlays of the actual
 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.740
ground overlays of the actual
visualization on top of it it just

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750
visualization on top of it it just
 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.330
visualization on top of it it just
Morelos the data to saying and allows to

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340
Morelos the data to saying and allows to
 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.570
Morelos the data to saying and allows to
remove the labels for the places because

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580
remove the labels for the places because
 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.610
remove the labels for the places because
we don't really want to see the labels

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620
we don't really want to see the labels
 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.550
we don't really want to see the labels
and on the map right so just get them in

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560
and on the map right so just get them in
 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.920
and on the map right so just get them in
a nice clean background background there

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930
a nice clean background background there
 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.180
a nice clean background background there

specifically if you want to look at the
the ground overlay documentation you can

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620
the ground overlay documentation you can
 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.190
the ground overlay documentation you can
look here alright well thanks for coming

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200
look here alright well thanks for coming
 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.200
look here alright well thanks for coming
in see no problem files we're having the
