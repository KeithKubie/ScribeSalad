00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
ROB EASTAWAY: Can I show you
the symbol, first of all,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:04.400
because that's kind of
at the center of it.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.300
And I'm going to draw the quick
and dirty zequals, which

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.540
looks like this.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.730
And it's a bit like an equals
sign, but it's zigzaggy.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:21.670
And the reason for that is it's
sort of an approximation

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.580
symbol, but it's more
precise than that.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.220
And the zigzagginess and the
zeds are supposed to make you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.870
kind of think of zeroes
because this technique

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.980
involves lots of zeroes,
especially for big

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.730
calculations.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.910
Really, what we're doing is
reducing every number to one

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.390
significant figure.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.030
And let's start with a really
simple calculation, one of

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.940
your basic times tables
like 3 times 7.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.910
Well, hopefully, everyone
knows that that's 21.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.590
But actually, if we say what it
zequals, then we round it

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.320
to the nearest round number
with one digit

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.110
followed by a zero.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.970
So 3 times 7 zequals 20.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.019
OK, let's take another one.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.350
So 5 times 8 equals--

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.300
bad example.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.563
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:10.563 --> 00:01:11.830
BRADY HARAN: Let's
do one below it.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.100
ROB EASTAWAY: Let's
do one below it.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.590
BRADY HARAN: Even I know
what that zequals.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.880
ROB EASTAWAY: Yeah,
that's right.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.120
Let's do 7 times 8, because no
one can ever remember that.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.450
But I'll tell you
what it equals.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.310
It equals 56, but it zequals
60 because you round it

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.030
ruthlessly to one significant
figure.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.900
BRADY HARAN: It's almost more
work at the moment to do the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.740
zequaling than the equaling.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.050
ROB EASTAWAY: Yeah, I can see
why you'd think that, but if

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.930
we get onto a more complicated
calculation, I think you'll

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.090
begin to see why it's actually
quite handy to just simplify

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.880
everything at the first
opportunity.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.810
Should we do a big one?

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.880
436 times 68.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.310
Well, if we're zequaling this,
the first thing we do is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.290
simplify these numbers.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.620
So that zequals 400 times 70.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.170
So we've simplified both those
to make this calculation,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.090
because then it's just going to
be 4 times 7, and then add

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.169
on all the zeroes at the end.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.110
So that equals--

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.460
well, seven 4 are 28, followed
by three zeroes,

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.680
so it equals 28,000.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.850
But actually, we're being really
ruthless because we

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.070
just want a rough answer.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.760
It zequals 30,000.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.800
So 436 times 68 zequals
30,000.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.820
And you know what?

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.310
That's pretty close to
the right answer.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.770
Just check what the actual
answer is 29,648.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.900
Now, in this case, that
is really close.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.670
So zequals has been amazingly
accurate.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.700
It's not always quite
as accurate as that.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.630
But in fact, in most estimation
challenges, you're

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.130
really looking for something
that's an order of magnitude,

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.810
and zequals works in
most situations.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:57.510
BRADY HARAN: Hi there,
everyone.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.270
I'm going to interrupt my own
video at this point because I

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.460
can hear some of the
numberphiles screaming at the

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.810
screen, upset by this ruthless
rounding, this

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.720
dismissing of digits.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.440
And I can kind of
understand that.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.990
So I spoke to my graphing
expert, Dave Wiley, told him

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.040
about zequals, and he actually
put this together.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.250
This is a graph showing where
zequals is at its strongest

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.350
and also where it's furthest
from the true answer.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.800
I thought it might be worth
a look, and I've put more

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.160
details about it on my blog.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.270
I'll talk about this more at
the end of this video, but

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.190
let's get back to hearing more
about what Rob has to say

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.590
about zequals.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.940
ROB EASTAWAY: I think the most
valuable thing here is it's

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.390
giving you a feel for numbers.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.840
Because there's a lot of
obsession these days with

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.330
people need to learn how to
do long multiplication.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.160
Well, we all use a calculator
for anything difficult these

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.340
days, and we don't need, most of
us, most of the time, to do

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.660
a really accurate calculation.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.730
A calculator can
do that for us.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.680
But we do need to have
a feel for numbers.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.900
And I suspect that many people
who use calculators have no

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.360
idea when the answer comes
out whether that number

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.140
is vaguely or not.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.860
And the great power of zequals
is it just allows you to very

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.959
quickly work out roughly what
the answer is so you can say,

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.579
well, look, is the number I've
come up with, does it even

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.420
make sense?

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.530
Or have I typed something wrong
into this calculator or

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.750
into my laptop or whatever?

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.680
So what this is trying to
generate, more than anything

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.660
else, is a feel for numbers and
the power to be able to

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.240
say, you know what?

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.850
I don't know what exactly the
answer is, but I do know

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.270
roughly what the answer is.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.920
BRADY HARAN: Is this something
people do intuitively anyway?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.940
ROB EASTAWAY: I think they do.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.460
I'm sure--

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.970
I have been estimating
for years.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.270
And I think the difference here,
really, between this and

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.560
any old estimation is just how
ruthlessly you're simplifying

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.150
things to one significant
figure.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.490
So when we did the tables, seven
8's are 56, seven 8's

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.160
zequals 60.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.260
Most people don't think to make
the simplification at

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:02.820
that point.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.180
So I'm just taking it one stage
further to become a bit

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.210
of a rounding extremist.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.550
You could be even more extreme
than zequals, incidentally.

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.730
You could round 60, say,
we'll call it 100.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.180
It's close enough.

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.570
I'm just a little bit short
of that extreme.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.940
I would say I'm not a fifth
decimal place kind of person.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.740
I really am a zequals-y
kind of person.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.180
As a degree, I actually did
engineering, and there it's

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.560
all about having a
feel for numbers.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.280
There's a joke about how you
can tell the difference

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.300
between an engineer and
a mathematician.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.790
So you ask him what pi is.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.110
And a mathematician will say,
it's 3.14 and it goes on

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.845
forever, a transcendental
number.

00:05:42.845 --> 00:05:45.470
Whereas an engineer will say,
well, it's about three.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.730
But let's call it 10 just
to be on the safe side.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.700
BRADY HARAN: Is this the
thin end of a wedge?

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.080
I sometimes think that the
emergence of text messaging

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:56.640
and things like that has
really eroded people's

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.970
spelling ability.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.880
Would the emergence of zequals
in a kind of lazy, rounded

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.160
estimation take away some of the
real skill and craft that

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.350
we want to engender in our
future mathematicians?

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.240
ROB EASTAWAY: I would say
completely the opposite.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.150
If only your typical 14-year-old
frankly even could

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.510
just say off the top of their
head what seven 8's is, that

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.600
it's 56 in the first place,
let alone be able to then

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.970
round it to 60.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.750
So I think this skill is missing
in so much of the

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.340
population.

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:29.550
Let's get them to this stage.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.980
And actually, strangely enough,
I think the ability to

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.505
estimate, even though it's all
rough and ready, sometimes you

00:06:35.505 --> 00:06:38.010
actually need a lot of math
understanding to be able to do

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.410
in the first place.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:42.080
It probably has its most
common application in

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.580
financial stuff, working
something out.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:45.260
You're in a shop.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.150
You're working out a deal.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.900
There's a question I've been
asking teenagers, quite

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.560
interesting to ask them.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.850
You say, right, I've got 70
people, each want a Mars bar,

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.370
and let's say the Mars
bar costs 80p,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.530
and there's 70 people.

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.300
So how much is that
going to cost?

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.720
How much are we going to
have to spend on that?

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.420
And they kind of know
it's seven 8's.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:05.060
Maybe they know seven 8's 56.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.380
But they'll probably say 5
pounds 60, because that sounds

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.890
like about what you'd
spend on Mars bars.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:12.350
So being able to say,
well, hang on a sec.

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:17.485
70 times 80, it's like kind of
50 times 100, and what's that?

00:07:17.485 --> 00:07:20.170
Oh, 5,000, oh, 50, OK.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.550
So it's sort of, does this
answer make sense?

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.660
I can give you an example of
when zequals would perhaps not

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:26.950
be a good idea.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:29.990
For example, if you're taking
your child's temperature and

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.470
you like to use old-fashioned
Fahrenheit for that and say,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:33.920
well, it's 98.4.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.970
Let's zequals that.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.140
Let's call it 100.

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.260
Well, suddenly you're thinking,
well, maybe I should

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.620
take him to the doctor then.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.440
Knowing when it's appropriate to
round numbers and when not

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:44.980
is kind of--

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.720
I've rather hidden that away in
all of the zequals stuff,

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.760
that that is a skill, a life
skill, an experience skill.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.040
I hope they'll see the point.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.130
I hope they'll see that I'm not
some ignorant person who's

00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.820
imposing some impurity on this
great subject, but actually,

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.820
this is a handy tool.

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:05.470
I'm going to guess quite a few
of your viewers actually kind

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.440
of do this with variations
themselves.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.460
So I'm just offering
one technique where

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:11.340
it's a shared language.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.570
We all play the same game.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:13.990
We round to one figure.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.430
But I'm not saying
it's the best.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:17.010
I'm just saying it's
one that's got a

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:19.362
name now and a symbol.

00:08:19.362 --> 00:08:22.070
BRADY HARAN: Now, Rob's got a
book out called "More Maths

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:25.700
for Mums and Dads, The Teenage
Years," and it's in that book

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.480
he talks about zequals.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.560
Zequals is just a very small
part of the book.

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.450
It's full of all sorts of cool
stuff, and I've put a link

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:35.400
under this video if you want
to check that out.

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.539
Also, that graph I talked about
that Dave put together

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.059
where we've had a look
at zequals, you can

00:08:40.059 --> 00:08:41.909
find that on my blog.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.830
Again, links underneath.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:46.240
And if you want to see even more
from this video, where I

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.000
asked Rob even more questions,
stuff that I've left out of

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.070
this video for time reasons,
I've put some of those extra

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.750
questions and answers as an
unlisted Numberphile video,

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.070
and there will be links on the
screen and underneath as well.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.320
So if you're really into this
and you want to hear Rob talk

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.000
about it more, because he's got
a lot to say about it, go

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.250
check that out.
