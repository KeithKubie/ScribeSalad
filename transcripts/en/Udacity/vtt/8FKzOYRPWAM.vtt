00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.480
So the concept of a belief network, sometimes also known

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.170
as Bayes Net. Sometimes also known as Bayesian Network. Sometimes

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.440
also known as a graphical model. And there's other names,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.371
but it's the same idea over and over again. And

00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:14.330
the, and the idea is that what we're going to do

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.350
is we're going to represent the

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.870
conditional independence relationships between all

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.510
the variables in the joint distribution graphically. In terms of

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.970
of a little picture like this, where there's nodes corresponding

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.730
to all the variables. And, edges corresponding to dependencies that

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.010
need to be explicitly represented. So, the way that this

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.820
works is, what we can do is we can fill

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.500
in the prior probability of storm, which we can get by

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.130
just marginalizing out. So we've, we've already done an exercise

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.690
like this. So this is a number you should be able

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.940
to figure out. Then because of vary well, this is

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.240
also true that that you can figure out what the probability

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.890
of lightning is, given storm and also given not storm.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.930
And these are numbers that you can just get by marginalizing

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.230
out. Finally, the probability of thunder, normally you'd have to

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.870
condition that on both storm and lightning. But as we already

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.750
talked about, it's actually conditionally independent of storm given lightning.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.150
So, all we need to figure out is the probability of

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.670
thunder given lightning, and the probability of thunder given not

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.040
lightning. And once we have these, in this case five numbers,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490
that's enough to work out any probability we want

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.210
in the joint, just by multiplying corresponding components together.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.030
So, what I'd like you to do is actually fill in these boxes as a quiz. And to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.220
help you out we copied the numbers over from

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.935
the previous slides so that you actually have the

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:36.290
[LAUGH] values that you need to fill in this

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.900
table. because otherwise that would have been kind of mean.
