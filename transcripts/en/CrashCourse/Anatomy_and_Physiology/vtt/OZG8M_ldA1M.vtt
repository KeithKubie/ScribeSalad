00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.420
What if everything you did, and thought, and
felt could be communicated by pushing a button?

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.810
It’d be like using the world’s simplest
app -- one that just sends out a little ping,

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.969
always at the same volume and length -- to
communicate everything from, “It sure is

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.509
cold in here,” to, “I love churros,” to, “Boy, I
sure would like to breathe sometime soon.”

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:22.440
Well, that is actually exactly how your neurons
send ALL the impulses responsible for every

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.540
one of your actions, thoughts, and emotions.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.960
When a neuron is stimulated enough, it fires
an electrical impulse that zips down its axon

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.100
to its neighboring neurons.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.380
But they’ve only got one signal that they
can send, and it only transmits at one uniform

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.800
strength and speed.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.760
What they can vary is the frequency or number
of pulses -- like this [buzz buzz buzz] is

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.140
distinct from this [buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz
buzz buzz].

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.200
And your brain can translate these signals,
reading them like binary code, organizing

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.600
them by location, sensation, magnitude, and
importance, so that you know the difference

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.680
between “turn up the thermostat” and “Oh
my gosh I’m on fire.”

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.340
That buzz, that nerve impulse, is called the
action potential.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.500
It’s one of the most fundamental aspects of anatomy
and physiology, and really life in general.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.670
It’s happening inside of you right now.
And we want to make sure that you understand

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.150
what all that buzz is about.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.640
Before we delve into how neurons communicate,
we’ve first got to understand a little bit

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.280
of our old friend electricity.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.590
Basically, think of your body as a sack of
batteries.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.030
NO, I mean, you don’t look like a sack of
batteries, I’m just saying that, your body

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.150
as a whole is electrically neutral, with equal
amounts of positive and negative charges floating

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.520
around. But certain areas are more positively
or negatively charged than others.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.530
And because opposite charges attract, we need
barriers, or membranes, to keep positive and

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.049
negative charges separate until we’re ready
to use the energy that their attraction creates.

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.100
In other words, we keep ‘em separated to
build potential.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.840
A battery just sitting on its own has both
a positive and negative end, and the potential

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.020
to release energy. But it doesn’t do anything
until it’s hooked up to a flashlight or

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.009
a phone or a kids’ toy that lets those charges
move toward each other, on the way converting

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:06.250
electricity into light, or sound, or children’s
laughter.

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.720
In much the same way, each neuron in your
body is like its own little battery with its

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.009
own separated charges.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.349
It just needs an event to trigger the action
that brings those charges together.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.060
If you’re thinking that this sounds more
like engineering than anatomy, that might

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.260
not be a bad thing. It might even help to
think of your neurons in the same terms an

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.540
electrician might use.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.690
Voltage, for example, is the measure of potential
energy generated by separated charges. It’s

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.190
measured in volts, but in the case of your body, we
use millivolts because it’s a pretty small amount.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.280
In a cell, we refer to this difference in
charge as the membrane potential. The bigger

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.040
the difference between the positive and negative areas,
the higher the voltage, and the larger the potential.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.379
And just like there’s voltage in your body,
there’s also current -- the flow of electricity

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:51.979
from one point to another. The amount of charge in a
current is related both to its voltage and its resistance.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.440
Resistance is just whatever’s getting in
the way of the current. Something with a high

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.620
resistance is an insulator, like plastic, and something
with a low resistance is a conductor, like metal.

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.620
Now, when we talk about these concepts in
terms of you, we’re typically talking about

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.930
how currents indicate the flow of positively
or negatively charged ions across the resistance

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.400
of your cells’ membranes.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.220
And again, these membranes separate the charges,
so they’re what provide the potential to

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.519
convert the electricity into something useful.

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.819
K, now that we’ve got Electricity 101 down, let's
see how it works inside your nervous system.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.019
A resting neuron is like a battery just sitting
in that sack that is you. When it’s just

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.870
sitting there, it’s more negative on the
inside of the cell, relative to the extracellular

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.879
space around it.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.139
This difference is known as the neuron’s
resting membrane potential, and it sits at

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.840
around -70 millivolts.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.540
Where do those charges come from?

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.240
Outside of a resting neuron, there’s a bunch
of positive sodium ions floating around, just

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.620
lingering outside the membrane.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.519
Inside, the neuron holds potassium ions that
are positive as well, but they’re mingled

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.680
with bigger, negatively-charged proteins.
And since there are more sodium ions outside

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.400
than there are potassium ions inside, the
cell’s interior has an overall negative charge.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.400
When a neuron has a negative membrane potential
like this, it is said to be polarized.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.989
Now, these ions didn’t just show up in this
arrangement on their own. This is all orchestrated

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.269
by one of the most important bits of machinery in your
nervous system, the sodium-potassium pump.

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.029
This little protein straddles the membrane
of the neuron, and there are tons of them

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:22.869
all along the axon. For every two potassium
ions it pumps into the cell, it pumps out

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:24.199
three sodium ions.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.979
This creates a difference in the concentration
of sodium and potassium, and a difference

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:31.309
in charges -- making it more positive outside
the neuron.

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:35.589
This difference is an electrochemical gradient,
and you probably know enough about biology

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:41.509
by now to know that NATURE HATES GRADIENTS!
It wants to even out all of those inequalities,

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.639
in concentration and in charge, to restore
balance.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.770
But the only way to even out that gradient,
is for the ions to pass across the membrane.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.180
Thankfully, the sodium-potassium pump isn’t
the only way in or out of the cell -- the

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.139
membrane is also riddled with ion channels,
large proteins that can provide safe passage

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:00.389
across the membrane, when their respective
gates are open.

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.309
And these gates open and close for different reasons,
depending on their structure and purpose.

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:09.820
Most are voltage-gated channels, which open
at certain membrane potentials, and close

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.659
at others. For example, sodium channels in
your neurons like to open around -55 mV.

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:19.580
But some others are ligand gated channels
-- they only open up when a specific neurotransmitter,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.919
like serotonin, or a hormone latches on to
it.

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.379
And then we also have mechanically gated
channels, which open in response to

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.200
physically stretching the membrane.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.800
In any case, when the gates do open, ions
quickly diffuse across that membrane down

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.860
their electrochemical gradient, evening out
the concentrations, and running away from

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.699
other positively charged ions.

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.539
This movement of ions is the key to all electrical
events in neurons, and thus is the force behind

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.180
every. single. thing. we think, do, and feel.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.879
Of course, not all of your body’s electrical
responses are the same. And neither are the

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:50.830
flows of ions going in and out of your neurons.

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.339
If only a few channels open, and only a bit
of sodium enters the cell, that causes just

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:59.270
a little change in the membrane potential
in a localized part of the cell. This is called

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.559
a graded potential.

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:04.279
But in order to send long-distance signals
all the way along an axon, you need a bigger

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:07.839
change -- one big enough to trigger those
voltage-gated channels.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.680
That is an action potential!

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.420
And your best bet for making that happen is
to depolarize that resting neuron -- I mean,

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.439
cause a big enough change in its membrane
potential that it’ll trigger the voltage-gated

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.379
channels to open.

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.529
It all starts with your neuron sitting there
at resting state. All of the ion channels

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.969
are closed, and the inner voltage is resting
at -70 mV.

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:31.560
And then something happens! Some environmental
stimulus occurs -- say like a spider brushes

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:35.929
up against a tiny hair on your knee -- triggering
those sodium channels to open, increasing

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:37.129
the charge inside the membrane.

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:41.460
Now, the stimulus -- and the resulting change
-- have to be strong enough to cross a threshold

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.939
for the true action potential to kick in and
that threshold is about -55 mV.

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:51.349
Remember that number. Because this is an all-or-
nothing phenomenon. If the stimulus is too weak, and

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.249
the change doesn’t hit that level, it’s
like a false alarm -- the neuron just returns

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:56.220
to its resting state.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.020
But kind of like Doc Brown hitting 1.21 gigawatts
in the Delorean, once it hits that threshold

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.780
-- you’re not going to travel in time, but
you are going to see some serious action potential.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.279
At that threshold, the voltage-gated sodium
channels open, and there are tons of these,

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:14.809
so all of the positive sodium ions rush in,
making the cell massively depolarized -- so

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:18.809
much so that it actually goes positive, up
to about positive 40 mV.

00:07:18.809 --> 00:07:21.740
This is action potential in … action.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.020
It’s really just a temporary reversal of
a membrane potential -- a brief depolarization

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:27.770
caused by changes in currents.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:32.189
And unlike graded potentials, which are small
and localized, an action potential kicks off

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:36.179
a biological chain reaction, which sends that
electrical signal down the axon.

00:07:36.179 --> 00:07:40.819
Because each of your neurons has lots of voltage-gated
sodium channels. So when a few in one area

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:45.189
open, that local current is strong enough
to change the voltage around them. And that

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:49.319
triggers their neighbors, which triggers the
voltage around them, and so on down the line.

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:53.909
As soon as all that’s underway, the process
of repolarization kicks in. This time the

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:58.649
voltage-gated potassium ion channels open
up, letting those potassium ions flow out,

00:07:58.649 --> 00:08:00.569
in an attempt to rebalance the charges.

00:08:00.569 --> 00:08:05.339
If anything, it goes too far at first, and
the membrane briefly goes through hyperpolarization:

00:08:05.339 --> 00:08:11.270
Its voltage drops to -75 or so mV, before
all of the gates close and the sodium-potassium

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.080
pumps take over and bring things back to their
resting level.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.499
Now when part of an axon is in the middle
of all this, and its ion channels are open,

00:08:18.499 --> 00:08:23.379
it can’t respond to any other stimulus,
no matter how strong. This is called the refractory

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:27.479
period, and it’s there to help prevent signals
from traveling in both directions down the

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:28.559
axon at once.

00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:34.139
So that is the surprisingly simple app that your
nervous system uses to let you experience the world.

00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:37.859
And because the voltages in this process are
always pretty much the same -- the initial threshold

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:43.580
around -55 mV, and the peak at depolarization
at +40 mV -- your neurons only communicate

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.700
in a single, monotone buzz.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.300
It doesn’t matter if it’s a spider on
your knee or an elephant, a paper cut or stab

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.040
wound, the strength of that action potential
is always the same.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.790
What does change is the frequency of the buzz.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:01.100
A weak stimulus tends to trigger less frequent
action potentials. And that includes if the

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.930
stimulus is coming from you, like your brain
telling your muscles to perform some task.

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:10.120
If I need to do something delicate, like pick
up an egg, the signal is low-frequency: [buzz...buzz...buzz...]

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:14.240
But a more intense signal -- like trying to
crush a can -- increases the frequency of

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.870
those action potentials to tell your muscles
to contract harder, and the message turns

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.330
into something that you can’t ignore -- [buzzbuzzbuzzbuzz]

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.120
Action potentials also vary by speed, or conduction
velocity.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:27.360
They’re fastest in pathways that govern
things like reflexes, for example, but they’re

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.520
slower in places like your glands, guts, and
blood vessels.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.540
And the factor that affects a neuron’s transmission
speed the most, is whether there’s a myelin

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.970
sheath on its axon.

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.740
Axons coated in insulating myelin conduct
impulses faster than non-myelinated ones,

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.839
partly because, instead of just triggering
one channel at a time in a chain reaction,

00:09:44.839 --> 00:09:48.769
a current can effectively leap from one gap
in the myelin to the next.

00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:53.610
These little gaps are the delightfully named
Nodes of Ranvier, and this kind of propagation

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:57.190
is known as saltatory conduction, from the
Latin word for “leaping.”

00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:01.079
But what happens when an action potential
hits the end of its axon and is ready to do

00:10:01.079 --> 00:10:04.459
more than leap … and jump all the way to
another neuron?

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.540
That you will find out next time!

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:10.850
Today you learned how your body is kinda like
a big bag o’ batteries, and how ion channels

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:15.500
in your neurons regulate this electrochemistry
to create an action potential, from resting

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.480
state to depolarization to repolarization
and a brief bout of hyperpolarization.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.139
One more thing before you leave.

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:43.389
We like Crash Course a lot and we hope that
you like Crash Course a lot, but I kind of

00:10:43.389 --> 00:10:48.060
feel like Crash Course is only useful for
a certain segment of the population. Like,

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:51.980
once you get to a certain age, then it's good
and then forever it can be helpful to people.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.540
But younger people, not so much.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.680
And so we are creating Crash Course Kids.
Hosted by Sabrina Cruz from NerdyAndQuirky,

00:10:58.689 --> 00:11:02.170
Crash Course Kids will start out focusing
on fifth grade science, but will keep expanding

00:11:02.170 --> 00:11:04.240
to other topics as the the channel grows.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.480
Sabrina will be talking about food chains,
and gravity, and how the sun works, and how

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.800
plants eat, and why flamingos are pink, and
many other topics.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.209
Oh, and another note: teachers, you can rest
assured that we've got you covered. There

00:11:14.209 --> 00:11:17.709
will be info about the standards we've used
to make sure that we're doing our very best

00:11:17.709 --> 00:11:22.449
to help you out. So, if you are a teacher
or you know a teacher or you know a child

00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:26.229
or you know someone who has a child or you've
ever seen a child, you can tell them to go

00:11:26.229 --> 00:11:31.139
to youtube.com/CrashCourseKids and subscribe
and you can go do that as well if you would

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:33.379
find that kind of content useful or interesting.
