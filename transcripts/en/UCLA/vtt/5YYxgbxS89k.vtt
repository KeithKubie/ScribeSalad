If we was the problem then we are the solution to a lot of the violence that’s going on in the streets in L.A.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.740
We ought to be able to create safer
neighborhoods, safer parks.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.320
Parks that shouldn’t be known for a shoot-up gallery.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.600
So, Reynaldo got this idea some time ago that one way to bring peace to the neighborhoods…

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.720
there’s always fighting…the gangs are
 always fighting with each other…

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.240
he said, ‘let’s play some baseball.’

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.560
And I thought, hmmm, here’s an opportunity.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.120
Our students got experience
they would get in no other way.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.920
OK, home team, take the field.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.680
These brothers here, in these neighborhoods,
are coming together for the softball

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.720
It ain’t about just softball.  It’s about making a difference.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.600
Our lives, our children’s lives, our community as a whole.
