00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.310
Alright, what'd you got?

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.420
&gt;&gt; I'm going to say it's one, one.

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.340
&gt;&gt; Alright, how would you figure that out?

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.868
&gt;&gt; Well first, I would ask you if that's correct. [LAUGH]

00:00:07.868 --> 00:00:10.179
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] We'll see when you try to.

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:10.704
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:11.230
&gt;&gt; Figure it out.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.620
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, the idea here is I'm trying to

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.110
figure out what Curly would get, if Smoove was out to

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.840
get, make certain that Curly got the worst possible value.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.780
So, Curly gets to ch Curly gets to choose among rows.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.030
And Smoove gets to choose among columns. So, If

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.900
I chose the B column, then Curly could get

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.920
a one. You're given choice Curly would go for

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.170
the first row instead of the second row, because

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.580
Curly would get a one. If I took the

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.460
S column, as Smoove, Smoove took the S column,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.240
then Curly would choose the second row, and would

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.580
get two. And one is lower than two. So,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.200
Smoove would choose the first column and Curly would have to get

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.240
the first row and would end up with a one. That make sense?

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.230
&gt;&gt; Yes, but here's what you haven't figured out.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.220
&gt;&gt; Yes?

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.650
&gt;&gt; What happens if Smoove, no because, because

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.210
Smoove says, I'm always going to choose the Backstreet Boys.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.721
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:10.085
&gt;&gt; Then you're right, Curly should also choose that and at least coordinate.

00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:10.930
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.860
&gt;&gt; But what if Smoove is random say

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.010
half and half random between the two options.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.630
&gt;&gt; And I

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.880
don't know what's going to happen before then?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.650
&gt;&gt; And you don't know what's going to happen, sorry?

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.120
&gt;&gt; I know that, I know it's half Curly knows it's half

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.150
and half but doesn't know which one he's choosing any given time?

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.635
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:30.650
&gt;&gt; I see. Then, I would end up with, one half and one.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.070
&gt;&gt; Then for choosing B.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.690
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.580
&gt;&gt; Expect the score would be a half, and for choosing

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.160
S, they'd expect the wor, expect the score would be one.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.470
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.690
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see. And, and then Curly would choose S and

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.120
get the one.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.540
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.400
&gt;&gt; And that's still consistent with, with that?

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.033
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:50.150
&gt;&gt; Can we work out what the what the worst case is?

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.000
&gt;&gt; What do you mean?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.470
&gt;&gt; Well I feel like, we should solve it

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.520
like a [INAUDIBLE] game, like we did in your lesson.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.050
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.226
&gt;&gt; Say that Smoove is actually choosing a

00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:00.645
pro, probability either X or 1 minus X.

00:02:00.645 --> 00:02:02.290
&gt;&gt; So I thought you were asking for like

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.805
a pure decision, I wasn't even thinking about mixed decisions.

00:02:04.805 --> 00:02:05.390
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh,

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.810
yes, it could be a malicious and randomized adversary.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:09.757
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] So we are.

00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:10.880
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] You said yuck [LAUGH].

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.390
&gt;&gt; We, we are really talking about my ex-girlfriends.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.040
Okay so you just do the math. Do the math.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.530
&gt;&gt; Alright, so if we, if Smoove chooses Backstreet Boys

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.830
with probability X and Sting with probability of one minus X.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.220
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.644
&gt;&gt; Then, Curly for choosing Backstreet Boys will get X on average and

00:02:30.644 --> 00:02:36.740
for choosing Sting, we'll get two times one minus six on average. And the

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.630
useful point is going to be to discover when these are equal to each other.

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.610
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.740
&gt;&gt; So in fact, Smoove, by being malicious and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.860
stochastic, can actually force things down to 2 3rds.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.650
&gt;&gt; Hm. And things being symmetric as they are, Curly can do the same.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.670
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.240
&gt;&gt; So, basically, Curly can behave in such a way, that even against a

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.830
malicious adversary, it could, he could guarantee himself to a score of 2 3rds.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.290
&gt;&gt; Yeah, a malicious possibly mixed adversary.

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.929
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:12.317
&gt;&gt; Okay. But one, one would be right if we

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:15.310
were sticking with pure strategies, but why would we do that?

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.390
&gt;&gt; That's right, but for the purpose, if that's right, and you can do a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.780
version of the folk theorem. In fact, there's

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.600
lots of different flavors of the folk theorem.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.650
The one that we're going to focus on

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.570
is going to allow for these mixed strategies.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.165
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:24.165 --> 00:03:26.970
&gt;&gt; But. In fact in general you could say you know,

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.260
no I kind of like the mixed strategies, let's just stick with that.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.160
&gt;&gt; No, I like the mixed strategies too, I just wasn't thinking about them.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.970
&gt;&gt; So, I want to point out that in fact the solution that you gave, I

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.600
think that actually does correspond to what is

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.380
usually called Minmax, which is the pure strategy.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah!

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.500
&gt;&gt; So the, [LAUGH] the minmax is, is in fact one, one.

00:03:46.738 --> 00:03:48.995
The other concept is really important too though. And I think

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:52.400
it's sometimes called the security level profile. So instead of the min

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.780
max level profile the security level profile. And that allows for

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.204
the possibility of, of mixed strategies. So that gets you down to

00:03:58.204 --> 00:04:00.418
the 2 3rds, 2 3rds. I think you know, it turns

00:04:00.418 --> 00:04:03.154
out that there's folk theorems that can be defined with with either

00:04:03.154 --> 00:04:06.670
of those concepts. I prefer this one. But I do like this

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.180
name better [LAUGH]. So I, I apologize if that made things confusing.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.810
&gt;&gt; I'm not

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.330
confused now. I think in the end Michael,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.080
the important thing is we were both right.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.329
&gt;&gt; Well, the example that I'm going to next, these two concepts line

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.423
up. So let's let's do that, and then we don't have to care. [LAUGH]

00:04:23.423 --> 00:04:24.750
&gt;&gt; I, I'm all for that. Let's do that.
