00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.350
Joining me as an evolutionary biologist,

2
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:12.351
formerly of Evergreen State University who is now a professional professor in

3
00:00:12.481 --> 00:00:15.800
exile.
Heather.
Hi and welcome to the Rubin report.
Thank you for having me.

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.760
Days professor and exile.
I believe that is in your Twitter bio.

5
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.500
It is.
I believe it is in your husband,
Bret Weinstein's Twitter bio.
Yeah,

6
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.040
we generated just to get together.

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.730
Is that going to be the title of the Co authored a book when the dust settles on

8
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:30.564
all of this stuff?

9
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.120
<v 2>Oh,
I dunno.
Um,</v>

10
00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.340
I think both of us are both eager to leave the evergreen story behind,

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.400
but still heartbroken that an institution that we loved and still believe in the

12
00:00:43.671 --> 00:00:48.671
educational model that it offered and still believe in the students who got

13
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:53.060
great educations there for many decades.
We,

14
00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.680
we would love to see it resurrected,

15
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.450
but it doesn't look like it's going to happen.

16
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.020
<v 1>Yeah.
All right,
so this is,</v>

17
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:01.080
it's a little crazy to me that this is the first time that we've met because

18
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:05.520
obviously our,
our circles have been sort of a closing in on each other for,

19
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.330
for quite some time.
So when,

20
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.930
when the whole evergreen thing happened and I only want to spend a little bit of

21
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:13.200
time at the top talking about it and then I want to do all sorts of evolutionary

22
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:14.250
biology stuff.
And the other,

23
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.990
the other things that you're really passionate about,

24
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.610
the story obviously was more focused on Brett and then he was sort of thrust

25
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:24.480
into the media and all that.
But this was a direct um,

26
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.490
attack on you as well in the end as you said,

27
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.110
the institution that you loved and all that.

28
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.350
Can you just give me any sort of recap or just pieces of it that maybe we don't

29
00:01:33.361 --> 00:01:36.000
know that whether or just your perspective on what was happening there?

30
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.280
<v 2>Well,
um,
as,
as briefly as I can [inaudible] leaving out many,</v>

31
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:42.390
many relevant pieces.

32
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.290
We've got a new president and the new president very quickly got rid of a

33
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:53.301
provost who was going to get in his way and spoke publicly about his desire to

34
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:56.880
turn evergreen into the social justice college.

35
00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.090
That was actually on the record early in George Burgess tenure at the point that

36
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:06.410
the protests broke out a year ago.
Now Ish.
Uh,

37
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.460
he had been president for about two years and a year before that had broken out

38
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:13.160
in equity,
uh,
uh,

39
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.880
a desire to bring equity and inclusion to the forefront,
which is,

40
00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:18.910
which is code words,

41
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.910
it's dog whistles for the people on the far left who are actually interested in

42
00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.630
a reversal of power,
not an end to oppression,
but an actual,

43
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.060
a reversal of historical oppression.

44
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.490
<v 1>Did,
did you guys recognize those things as Doug Wilson was at the time?</v>

45
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:36.970
Because as Brett said,
Yup.
At the time he considers himself,

46
00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:39.640
or at least at that time,
did consider himself deeply progressive.

47
00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:41.050
You just said to me right before we started,

48
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.330
you still consider yourself progressive.
Yep.

49
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.170
So did you realize those buzzwords words and what they actually meant at the

50
00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:47.510
time?

51
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.130
<v 2>Absolutely.
Uh,
I mean,
Brett,</v>

52
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.120
actually I was on sabbatical the year most of the year before this broke out as

53
00:02:53.121 --> 00:02:56.270
part of why I was sort of disappeared from the story I said,

54
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:57.590
as I went on to sabbatical,
Brett,

55
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.510
I will continue to read everything you want to send out to these lists,

56
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.290
but I'm not engaging.
I'm doing my own work now.
Um,

57
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.940
so about a year,
actually a year to the day before the protest broke out,

58
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.990
the first announcement of the new plan came,
came live,

59
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:18.700
and then on there and for the next year,
Brett was,
I was a little bit,

60
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:22.060
a couple of other people were a little bit standing up and saying,

61
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.190
this doesn't smell right.
This,

62
00:03:24.191 --> 00:03:28.450
this feels like this is actually about something that we're not talking about.

63
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.620
And furthermore,

64
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:34.621
if we're actually interested in improving the fate of various demographic

65
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:38.680
groups,
these processes are not going to be the way to accomplish them.

66
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.050
So we were saying that,
um,

67
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.610
Brett mostly was saying that a few others of us were saying it.
And,
um,

68
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.190
was there any,
um,

69
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.190
sort of understanding of that point of view privately?
Yes.
Yeah.

70
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.520
Privately,
yes.
People were scared and when in fact,

71
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.260
when Brett used the phrase culture of fear on campus,

72
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.690
what came back at him was you have to prove that there's a culture of fear or

73
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:10.060
else there's not one.
And,
you know,

74
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:12.930
show me the people who aren't standing up or else I will know that they,

75
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.200
they don't exist,
which is,
you know,
it's baffling.
Yeah,
right.
It's,

76
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:19.270
it is obviously an approval,

77
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.330
an unprovable statement to say there's a culture of fear and I'm not going to

78
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:27.400
out the people who have come to me and told me they're scared because I actually

79
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:30.640
am going to honor their privacy.
But if,

80
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
if everyone who would come to us privately and said this is nuts and it's got to

81
00:04:36.011 --> 00:04:40.120
stop,
had stood up,
it would've been a totally different outcome.
Well,

82
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:42.320
that's the culture of fear summed up right there.
Right.

83
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.450
<v 1>Um,
okay,
so without rehashing the whole thing,
can you just tell me a little,</v>

84
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.030
just a little bit about sort of how your life has changed throughout this and

85
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:52.060
sort of,
you know,
look,
you and Brett,
you guys did settle.
Uh,

86
00:04:52.061 --> 00:04:54.970
it wasn't for a ton of money,
at least in my humble estimation,

87
00:04:54.971 --> 00:04:57.730
but I think you probably want it to just put some of this behind you,

88
00:04:57.731 --> 00:04:59.230
but you guys are professors in exile.

89
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:02.740
You if you have kids and family and all that stuff and just sort of sum up kind

90
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:03.610
of where you're at at the moment.

91
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.900
<v 2>Yeah,
so I mean we had um,
we'd been living in Olympia for 15 years.
Um,</v>

92
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:09.540
the,

93
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.050
the college was an amazing place to really do a deep dive in community with

94
00:05:14.051 --> 00:05:15.370
students.
And so,
you know,

95
00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.690
Brad and I had done one and I had done several long study abroad trips and

96
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:24.250
Panama and in Ecuador with pretty large groups of undergraduates taking them

97
00:05:24.251 --> 00:05:25.900
through the Amazon,
the Galapagos,

98
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:29.530
we spent time in the field in Washington state and the San Juans and eastern

99
00:05:29.531 --> 00:05:30.364
Washington.

100
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.470
You took people places where not only were we studying evolutionary biology and

101
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.280
animal behavior and field techniques and Statistics and philosophy of science,

102
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.560
but also coming to know each other such that after,

103
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.980
after you break bread with people for days and you play ultimate with them and

104
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:49.210
you sit around a campfire,

105
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.440
you come to understand that when they disagree with you,

106
00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.500
it's not inherently coming from a place of hatred or personal animosity.

107
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.380
And so that trust that we were able to create in our classrooms,

108
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.160
which both of us love to doing,

109
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.380
allowed us to effectively then rip the intellectual rug out from under people

110
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.890
when they made claims that weren't falsifiable or couldn't be,

111
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.760
couldn't be justified once you started to ask them what the assumptions were

112
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:20.780
there were underlying their claims.
That was,
that was an amazing gift.

113
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:24.500
And I don't know that really almost any other educational model out there allows

114
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:28.340
for that because it required the time to build community with students,

115
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.340
which was,
which was wonderful.
So yes,

116
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:34.280
we lost two tenure track jobs along with your health insurance and our

117
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:37.340
retirement plans and all of that and have two kids still in school.

118
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:38.930
So that's alarming.

119
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.330
But some of what we were doing in the classroom,

120
00:06:44.331 --> 00:06:48.200
we have begun to do on larger stages.
And that is promising.

121
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.650
It seems clear that the world is interested in hearing how to understand systems

122
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:55.280
from an evolutionary perspective.

123
00:06:55.670 --> 00:07:00.590
I knew that was true from the 25 or 50 students that I had doing the deep dive

124
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:05.000
for every quarter,
every year for years.
Uh,
it's not that surprising,

125
00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:08.210
but it is heartening to see that that is the response of many,

126
00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:09.140
many people out there.

127
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.530
<v 1>Weird way.
Does it almost feel right then that this happened?
I mean,</v>

128
00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:16.860
I know it's kind of sucky and again with the salaries and tenure track positions

129
00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:17.251
and all that,

130
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:22.110
but that the message that you guys are talking about seemed so relevant right

131
00:07:22.111 --> 00:07:24.930
now.
You guys are now doing more public speaking gigs.
I'm,

132
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.720
I'm dragging bread on stage with me to do stand up.

133
00:07:27.721 --> 00:07:32.310
I mean all sorts of crazy things are presenting themselves and then the sort of

134
00:07:32.311 --> 00:07:36.480
the rise of this new alliance of whether you want to call it intellectual dark

135
00:07:36.481 --> 00:07:38.560
web or whatever you want to call it at this point.
But there,

136
00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:42.150
there is this sort of interesting crew of people with a lot of different

137
00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:45.660
feelings on a lot of different issues with all sorts of different disciplines

138
00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:46.494
coming together.

139
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.920
And maybe if you guys were still at university in a traditional sense,

140
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:52.530
you wouldn't be able to be dealt in the way that

141
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.420
<v 2>you are now.
I think that's possible.
I think,
um,</v>

142
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:59.660
there is both a way in which having gone through the looking glass,

143
00:07:59.661 --> 00:08:03.500
having gone through the direct,
you know,
to borrow a phrase from the far left,

144
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:08.501
but the lived experience of actually being at the center of a mob at the center

145
00:08:10.611 --> 00:08:13.430
of riots and then watching as the world,

146
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.610
the mainstream media and others tried to do a public rate relational spin on it

147
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:23.330
and tell a totally different story to live that and to watch the institution

148
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:27.860
that you loved become totally disloyal to you and to watch many people whom you

149
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:30.110
respected,
um,
hide.

150
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.740
You can't see that it's valuable.

151
00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:38.180
And the fact that we're sitting here talking together and that many of us in,

152
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.320
you know,
the intellectual dark web and,
and this and this bigger group are,

153
00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:47.480
are speaking and saying actually the culture of fear that is society wide is

154
00:08:47.481 --> 00:08:50.530
real.
And so also the,

155
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.440
the first time I met my students after the November,

156
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.770
2016 election after Trump was elected evergreen,
it's a very left place.

157
00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.390
Olympia is a very left place.

158
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:03.330
Pretty much everyone on campus had that glazed eyes.

159
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:07.650
Slack Jawed looks at people and most progressive enclaves will be familiar with

160
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:10.470
from that time,
from those few days,
right.
Myself included,

161
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.990
even though it was no Hillary fan,

162
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:17.900
but I didn't see that outcome coming and I certainly didn't vote for Trump.
I,
um,

163
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:24.120
we got to class and my co faculty whom I admire greatly,
uh,

164
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.610
just proceeded with her lecture on horse evolution.

165
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.850
And I'm looking around the classroom going,
no one here cares about horsepower.

166
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.010
Today's not a good day.
Day is not the day.
Yeah.
Um,

167
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:40.190
so she ended up at early and we had lab couple hours later and before she let

168
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:44.250
them go,
I said,
hold on,
if anyone wants to stay,
this is no longer class.

169
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:45.390
But if anyone wants to stay,

170
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.420
I would be happy to lead a conversation about what just happened,

171
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:49.980
what just happened to our country.

172
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.710
And about 40 of our 50 students stayed and skip their lunch hour.

173
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.880
And then we went right to anatomy lab that afternoon from,

174
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.210
from this conversation.
And what I said to them was,

175
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.080
do not for a minute believe that racist and sexist elected Trump.

176
00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:09.060
Think about how many times you have had to censor yourself on this campus when

177
00:10:09.061 --> 00:10:14.061
you had an opinion that was even slightly different from the accepted dogma.

178
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.740
And that conversation not only brought life to the room,

179
00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.930
but afterwards I had several students come up to me,

180
00:10:21.931 --> 00:10:24.720
some of them in tears telling me stories about,

181
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.550
one of them had lost a job on campus for speaking in opinion that was not

182
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.300
accepted.
One of them had an another story of another friend who lost a job.

183
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:37.470
Others talked about their self censorship and um,

184
00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.210
that and all of these people,
again,
we're far left.
Not that it should matter,

185
00:10:42.211 --> 00:10:46.080
but these weren't even people who are conservatives who held conservative views.

186
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.340
So that,

187
00:10:47.790 --> 00:10:52.200
that is the larger culture of fear that is hardly restricted to evergreen,

188
00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:54.330
but is society wide that we are,

189
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:58.860
that we are speaking about and that people are responding to because in,

190
00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.740
you know,
at Google,
at Starbucks,
yeah.

191
00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.500
It in cubicles in campuses,

192
00:11:04.501 --> 00:11:08.610
but far beyond campuses across the country and across the weird country is at

193
00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:10.980
least this is a problem.
Well,
the irony too

194
00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:14.880
<v 1>me is that I think that all that I'm doing is talking about these things often</v>

195
00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:17.880
with people who have a much better pedigree than I do.

196
00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.100
But by me talking about it,

197
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:23.520
it's giving room for other people to talk about and that's all that they want.

198
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:25.680
Well,
you're also,
you were also so

199
00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.310
<v 2>providing ways into the conversation.
I think.</v>

200
00:11:29.311 --> 00:11:31.800
So there are a lot of people when confronted with,

201
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:34.920
you're not allowed to think that say,
Oh God,

202
00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.490
I'm not actually sure how to respond.
I haven't,
I don't know.
I don't,

203
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.780
I don't have the linguistic skills.
I don't have the analytics behind me.

204
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.050
I don't know what I'm supposed to say here.
And so just listening to,

205
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.950
to you and to Sam Harrison,
to Jordan Peterson into Brett and to Eric into me,
um,

206
00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:51.811
and to,
you know,
many,

207
00:11:51.811 --> 00:11:56.811
many others I believe begins to give people a sense of not only is this doable,

208
00:11:57.011 --> 00:11:58.930
these are good,
reasonable,

209
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:01.390
smart people who are being respectful in what they're saying.

210
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.810
But also it's not just tools.
It's actually like phrases.
It's like,
Yo,

211
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.330
this is what you can say.

212
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:11.200
These are the things that sort of things that you can say in response that are

213
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:14.830
still respectful and don't reject the humanity of the person on the other side

214
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.310
but do reject the argument.
It's interesting,
it almost shows that

215
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:22.070
<v 1>what you guys obviously were doing so well at a university level,</v>

216
00:12:22.071 --> 00:12:25.970
that's exactly what's needed at a societal level.
Now talking about the language,

217
00:12:25.971 --> 00:12:30.050
the language to get these ideas across,
right is so important.

218
00:12:30.051 --> 00:12:35.051
I wonder is there a evolutionary explanation for a little bit of what has

219
00:12:35.931 --> 00:12:37.730
happened here with the left?

220
00:12:37.731 --> 00:12:41.700
Like the way they've sort of closed off ranks and then purge everyone cause it

221
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.070
was just as I sit here with you,

222
00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.990
it's like the idea that you inbred wouldn't be enough of whatever it is that

223
00:12:47.991 --> 00:12:51.410
they want is so bananas and yet it is true.

224
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.830
<v 2>So is there some way that you can explain that coming from the discipline you</v>

225
00:12:54.831 --> 00:12:56.330
come from?
Well there's,

226
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:59.780
I think this is not going to be a particularly deep point,
but it's,

227
00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.250
it's basic ingroup outgroup dynamics and we will always,

228
00:13:04.251 --> 00:13:08.690
we will not get rid of,
of tribal thinking.
We will not get rid of our sense of,

229
00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:12.380
you know,
you and I are aligned.
Right.
That's,
that's a good thing.

230
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.020
There's a way in which there's a kind of tribalism there,

231
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.170
even though we just met for the first time today.
Yeah.

232
00:13:17.390 --> 00:13:20.540
And we definitely have political differences,
I'm sure,

233
00:13:20.541 --> 00:13:23.000
which we can talk about if we want.
Yeah.
Right.
So,
and,
but,

234
00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.320
but that isn't the main thing.
Like we are aligned and I,
you know,

235
00:13:27.321 --> 00:13:32.240
I feel walking in here like you've got my back and you've got my back.
And,

236
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.433
um,

237
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:39.550
I think people especially raised without much experience with the physical world

238
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:46.240
and raised often in situations where they're being given a number of

239
00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:49.760
pharmaceuticals early on that are disrupting development,

240
00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:55.180
arrive at what should be the cusp of adulthood and aren't sure how to navigate,

241
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.420
aren't sure how to navigate the waters.
And so when trolled,
Oh,

242
00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.100
if you just agree with everything,

243
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:05.840
if you just become an idea log and go in lock step with us,
you can be with us.

244
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.071
So,
you know,

245
00:14:07.071 --> 00:14:10.580
identity politics is appealing because it provides an instant in group if you

246
00:14:10.581 --> 00:14:13.340
will only subjugate yourself.
Yeah.
And you know,

247
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.150
identity politics on the side begets at any politics on this side of course,

248
00:14:17.151 --> 00:14:19.640
because anyone who shows up here and is told no,

249
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.490
you don't have enough of what the progressive stack tells us you need,

250
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.040
either you can totally subjugate yourself or go over there and we'll,

251
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:27.590
of course we're going to get a rise over here and back and forth.

252
00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.890
<v 1>W when people criticize us,</v>

253
00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:34.270
whoever this is for not focusing on that identity politics enough,
the one that,

254
00:14:34.271 --> 00:14:35.740
the secondary one that you're talking about here,

255
00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.690
which is the identity politics of the right,
which is either you,

256
00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.200
which is based in actual racism or,
or you know,

257
00:14:41.201 --> 00:14:45.280
there's a white ethno state or ideas that are so the antithesis of the American

258
00:14:45.281 --> 00:14:48.310
experiment is,
to me they're,
they're ridiculous and have no real,

259
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.290
real world traction.

260
00:14:50.291 --> 00:14:54.210
It's almost like we've created this boogie man cause we need it since been

261
00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:58.910
displaying w no,
no.
Almost no one thinks that way anymore.
Sorry.

262
00:14:59.030 --> 00:15:02.180
No.
Well,
so what's your,
what's your best argument against that?
When people say,

263
00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:04.250
well you're not focusing on that enough because,

264
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.150
because everyone wants everything to be equal all the time.

265
00:15:06.151 --> 00:15:08.210
So if you're focusing on the identity politics of the left,

266
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.220
which clearly many of us see as,
I mean I truly see it.
I,
I've been saying,
listen,

267
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.070
I really believe this.

268
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:18.430
I view it as the greatest existential threat to western democracy that there is.

269
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:22.370
I believe that if there's something that would cause us to,

270
00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:26.420
to be on the streets like killing each other,
I think it's that we're,

271
00:15:26.421 --> 00:15:30.460
we'll have broken off and all of the commonalities will,
will disappear.
But what,

272
00:15:30.461 --> 00:15:33.050
what do you think is the best argument for why you're not focusing on that one

273
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:35.090
enough?
Cause I see that a lot now,
right?

274
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.920
<v 2>I think,
I think two things.
One,
it's not as big a group,
right?
The,</v>

275
00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:44.120
the,
the white nationalists to the extent that they exist and they do are better

276
00:15:44.121 --> 00:15:46.790
armed by and large than,
than the far left.

277
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.240
But numerically they just don't exist in the same numbers and they don't have

278
00:15:52.911 --> 00:15:53.810
the kind of play,

279
00:15:53.811 --> 00:15:56.870
they don't have the kind of cultural reach that the far left does.

280
00:15:56.871 --> 00:15:59.510
And so that's the second,
well I guess there's three points.

281
00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.870
A secondary point then is everyone can walk white nationalists that is

282
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:09.260
completely acceptable and in fact demanded that you do when those sorts of ideas

283
00:16:09.261 --> 00:16:12.470
come up in conversation.
Whereas the stuff on the far left,

284
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:17.320
increasingly it is demanded that you not,
so there is,

285
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.800
that's the key right there.
Right?
So like we are saying,
no actually we must,

286
00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:24.620
we must disagree with this just as much as we should.

287
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:28.070
Just as much as culturally we now know it's a norm to disagree with what's on

288
00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:29.960
the right,
the far right.

289
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:35.000
It should become a cultural norm to disagree with frankly the cryptic racism and

290
00:16:35.001 --> 00:16:39.260
sexism and you know,
and everything else that's happening on the far left.

291
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:44.150
It is,
it comes packaged as if it's anti racist and anti sexist and all.

292
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.420
It's just,
it's racist and sexist against the other group.

293
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.170
It's a flipping of the tables of oppression.

294
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.350
So I would say the third point is,
for me anyway,

295
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:59.150
as someone who has been on the left my whole life,
uh,
this has changed.

296
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:02.390
This experience is going through the looking glass in the last year has not

297
00:17:02.391 --> 00:17:03.620
changed my values,

298
00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:08.890
but it has changed what I understand about how people are using language to make

299
00:17:10.911 --> 00:17:13.760
other people out to be things they're not.
Yeah.
And so,
you know,

300
00:17:13.761 --> 00:17:18.470
I no longer believe in a massive outright,
for instance.
Right,
right.

301
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.010
Um,
and you know,
the,

302
00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.730
the bogeyman that are out there that you're not supposed to do things like talk

303
00:17:22.731 --> 00:17:25.340
to Fox News,
sorry.
No,

304
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.300
actually we should all be exposing ourselves to too,

305
00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:32.180
the media across the entire range.
And for me on the left,

306
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:37.360
it's actually my job much more so than to go after people who I have nothing in

307
00:17:38.631 --> 00:17:39.464
common with,

308
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.820
to go after the people who claim to have values that are similar to mine.

309
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.940
But I see that they are actually achieving goals.

310
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:46.990
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

311
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:50.850
And that's why I love this conversation and don't get tired of it because we're

312
00:17:50.851 --> 00:17:54.060
all in on it at different levels.

313
00:17:54.061 --> 00:17:58.530
We all have different realizations at different times along the timeline and

314
00:17:58.531 --> 00:18:01.080
it's like for me,
I,
that's where I free for two years.

315
00:18:01.081 --> 00:18:04.590
I kept saying I'm of the left and that's why I want to fix this.

316
00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:06.480
I don't think realistically anymore.

317
00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:09.060
I can honestly say that I think I have more in common,

318
00:18:09.061 --> 00:18:12.810
certainly with Libertarians and I find I find an intellectual openness with

319
00:18:12.811 --> 00:18:16.260
conservatives that I just don't find any more on this other side,

320
00:18:16.261 --> 00:18:17.370
and I know there's,
again,

321
00:18:17.371 --> 00:18:19.690
I know there's some people you just spoke at Hetero docs,

322
00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.170
you just spoken heterodox.
Jonathan hates being on the show.

323
00:18:22.171 --> 00:18:23.310
I think he's doing wonderful work.

324
00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:27.540
There's obviously people like Brett and like Eric and and Steven pinker and

325
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.460
plenty and Sam and plenty of other that exist still as sort of a same left,

326
00:18:32.461 --> 00:18:36.330
but I see that just being whittled and whittled and whittled away and that

327
00:18:36.331 --> 00:18:38.700
doesn't mean the fights not worth taking it.

328
00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.830
Maybe it means it's the most worthy fight,

329
00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:45.380
but I just see it as like an increasingly untenable position to hold.
I see.

330
00:18:45.450 --> 00:18:48.030
<v 2>I think,
I think there are actually many,
many,</v>

331
00:18:48.031 --> 00:18:52.290
many people out there who are not,
who don't have public platforms,

332
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:57.150
who are waiting,
who've been waiting for this,
who are watching your,

333
00:18:57.151 --> 00:19:00.990
most of these people would consider this almost themselves Democrats as I always

334
00:19:00.991 --> 00:19:02.040
did.
I don't,

335
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.880
I don't want to identify as a Democrat anymore given what they know stand for.

336
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:11.310
Uh,
but most I think that,
and this,
you know,
as evidenced by my inbox.

337
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:14.790
So it's anecdotal,
but it's a lot of anecdotes and you know,

338
00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:16.800
and also my Twitter feed,
uh,

339
00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.750
that there are a massive number of people out there who are on the left who have

340
00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:26.670
values on the left and who find no one out there who was making sense except

341
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:31.710
now,
except this crew of knackered.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it,
it has taken,

342
00:19:31.711 --> 00:19:34.350
it has taken this to,

343
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:38.340
you have this fever pitch that we have arrived at a for a number of people.

344
00:19:38.341 --> 00:19:42.660
I really think,
and like I said,
you know,
Google,
Starbucks,

345
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.670
but it's not just those big stories.

346
00:19:44.671 --> 00:19:49.671
There are people writing to me and to Brett from just average workplaces saying,

347
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:55.860
I'm in fear for my job because I cannot speak anything that doesn't fit the

348
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:58.860
dogma.
We just hired an equity advisor.

349
00:19:58.861 --> 00:20:02.850
We've just hired an inclusion advisor and it's,
and it's hateful.

350
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.730
It's hateful rhetoric that we are being told to adopt.

351
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.530
This is what's happening across corporate America.
Now.
Of course,

352
00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:12.960
most Americans are not going to appreciate that.

353
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:16.320
<v 1>Yeah.
It's like it existed at the universities for a long time.</v>

354
00:20:16.321 --> 00:20:20.370
And finally it started bubbling out of there and those kids took those ideas and

355
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:22.620
started entering the workforce.
That's why it's so weird.
You know,

356
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:25.380
people say you're all,
you're focusing on college students too much,

357
00:20:25.381 --> 00:20:29.770
and it's like you do realize they get out of college.
That's usually right.

358
00:20:29.771 --> 00:20:30.820
If there's,
if there's supposed to be.

359
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.180
So tell me a little bit more about sort of what you're doing now.

360
00:20:33.181 --> 00:20:36.480
I know you just spoke at Heterodox and,
uh,
or let's start,
let's start with that

361
00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:41.070
<v 2>heterodox.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
the,
this was Heterodox Academy's first conference.
Uh,</v>

362
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.490
they and fire are really at the forefront institutionally of,
uh,

363
00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:47.830
defending viewpoint diversity campuses.

364
00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:52.370
A fire from sort of more of a legal perspective and Heterodox at the faculty and

365
00:20:52.371 --> 00:20:55.260
administrative perspective.
And it was point,

366
00:20:55.261 --> 00:20:57.940
it was an intense conference is the only conference I've ever been to where I

367
00:20:57.941 --> 00:21:00.050
thought they should have been longer.
I wanted to be the logger.

368
00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.820
It was a daisy all academics in the audience as well or do they open that up?

369
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:08.050
I think the public,
I think there were probably non-academics there.

370
00:21:08.051 --> 00:21:10.540
I know that there were a lot of journalists there.
Uh,

371
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.280
and most everyone I met were students or faculty or Admin,

372
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.720
um,
or journalists.
Uh,
so I don't know,
I don't know what the,

373
00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.110
what the entry rules where,
um,
but you know,
the panels were as,

374
00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.460
as John's on heights and at the end of the day,
I,
I,

375
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.440
Jonathan Count only three people who are on the panels of I guess 28 people who

376
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:36.430
might be conservative.
So he himself pointed out,
you know,

377
00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.630
we're striving for viewpoint diversity,
but the fact is,
it's an uphill battle.

378
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:44.590
You know,
we're not going to get,
just,
just like we shouldn't expect a 50,

379
00:21:44.591 --> 00:21:48.370
56 ratio among software,
software engineers,
between men and women.

380
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.380
We're not going to get a 50,

381
00:21:50.381 --> 00:21:53.620
50 ratio of liberals and conservatives on college campuses.

382
00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:57.970
It's not necessarily the kind of work that conservatives flock to in the same

383
00:21:57.971 --> 00:22:00.280
numbers as liberals.
So I think,
you know,

384
00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:02.620
we need to be careful about imagining what,

385
00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:07.870
what equity would look like as in all of these arguments.
At an ideal level,

386
00:22:07.871 --> 00:22:12.871
why would it be that conservatives would be less inclined to be doing academics?

387
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:17.860
I guess it depends on what our definition of conservative is.
One of,
um,

388
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:23.230
a stereotype that comes to mind that I may regret saying is that a liberal types

389
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:28.180
take some odd pride and not caring about making a good living,

390
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:33.830
making good money in faculty positions tend to tend to fit that right.

391
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.630
Certainly Evergreen did.
Um,
so you know,
if you,

392
00:22:37.631 --> 00:22:42.631
if what if one of your primary goals is not only to make a good living for

393
00:22:42.641 --> 00:22:46.600
yourself and potentially to leap out of the living you're making and you know,

394
00:22:46.601 --> 00:22:50.680
really hit it big,
you're unlikely to do that in academia.
Uh,

395
00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:55.630
so there's a,
there's a sort of a risk aversion I think,

396
00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:56.913
um,

397
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:02.220
to the prospect of making it big financially that academics tend to have,

398
00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:07.780
um,
that may be,
may,
maybe conservatives would be less likely to,
to go that way.

399
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:11.170
Do you think he could also be,
the conservatives were just self selecting out,

400
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.020
like they realize the hostile atmosphere,
so they were just like,

401
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:18.840
why would I do this?
Absolutely.
That is one of the explanations for sure.
And,
um,

402
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:21.470
you know,
certainly in some fields,
you know,
an engineered,
the,

403
00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.840
the less human focused the field,
the more conservatives there are.

404
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:30.130
We know this.
So in engineering,
for instance,
in the more physical sciences,

405
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:34.750
mostly people don't speak their politics on college campuses if they are on the

406
00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:38.590
right because they're not welcome there.
Uh,
but,
uh,

407
00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.430
but those fields do have higher representations of conservatives than liberals,

408
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.430
but most of the social sciences and humanities,
uh,

409
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:49.400
we're all always tended liberal but are even more so.

410
00:23:49.401 --> 00:23:51.050
I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head,

411
00:23:51.051 --> 00:23:55.430
but even more so now than they ever have been.
And that's a problem to have,

412
00:23:55.670 --> 00:23:56.840
you know,
take,
you know,

413
00:23:56.841 --> 00:24:00.020
to have a field that is trying to understand the nature of humans,
you know,

414
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.280
any of the social sciences,

415
00:24:01.281 --> 00:24:06.281
psychology or anthropology or sociology to be entirely limited to people on the

416
00:24:08.091 --> 00:24:09.530
left side of the political spectrum.

417
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.790
Maybe you're missing something in your explanation of what humans are.

418
00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:17.570
If you don't have anyone who's willing to speak to a different political

419
00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:20.570
position.
So when I've talked to Jordan Peterson,

420
00:24:20.571 --> 00:24:22.310
who you referenced and my friend Peter,

421
00:24:22.311 --> 00:24:25.670
but goes in in a couple of other people who are professors,
um,

422
00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:28.070
you probably know Pete,
right?
Yep.
Yeah.
Um,

423
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:32.030
I think a lot of their argument is based around that,
you know,

424
00:24:32.031 --> 00:24:34.640
the gender studies and these sort of,

425
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:39.641
these sort of new fields basically have a completely separate set of standards

426
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:42.523
that have been,

427
00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.860
have virtually nothing to do with any of the standards that you as an

428
00:24:45.861 --> 00:24:50.560
evolutionary biologist had to had two and half to uh,
prescribe to,

429
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:53.690
to do your work.
Is that really the crux of it?

430
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:57.310
Sort of at the institutional level.
I schools I,

431
00:24:57.410 --> 00:25:01.490
that is at least one of the Foa Psi that,
that I have seen as well,

432
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.200
that there are many new fields,
many of which end in the word studies,

433
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:10.880
uh,
like gender studies that are frankly,
they're,
they're made up,

434
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:16.420
they are based in postmodernism and not just not just postmodernism because at

435
00:25:16.461 --> 00:25:20.690
its base originally there,
there's some stuff of value there,
believe it or not,

436
00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:25.790
but the,
the new manifestations in critical theory and such are,

437
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:30.380
are basically free of any fact checking apparatus.
So they are,

438
00:25:30.381 --> 00:25:33.470
they are anti science,
anti enlightenment and,

439
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.820
and they're quite willing to say things like reason is a tool.
The Patriarchs,

440
00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:41.580
this is the new one.
This one started popping up in the last six months.
Right.

441
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.631
And I mean you,

442
00:25:42.631 --> 00:25:46.700
you just have to know you're dealing with people who are not going to be playing

443
00:25:46.701 --> 00:25:49.490
in good faith and willing to have an actually,
you know,

444
00:25:49.491 --> 00:25:52.310
viable argument at the point that they say that.
Uh,

445
00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:55.040
so it's that there has been capture,
you know,

446
00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:58.100
pretty pretty solid capture and a few of them more traditional fields.

447
00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:02.780
I'm not entirely,
in fact,
I met several people at Heterodox,
um,

448
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:05.330
who are sociologists who are fighting this from within,

449
00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:08.750
but sociology is one of the captured fields,
anthropology,

450
00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:13.280
geography and um,
or cultural anthropology in particular.

451
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:18.640
So that the fact that it is that there are fields that students can go into and

452
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.800
basically never be exposed to the idea of you're going to generate as many

453
00:26:27.261 --> 00:26:30.230
possible explanations for the thing that you've observed as possible.

454
00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.920
We're going to do hypothesis generation first and then we're going to try to

455
00:26:33.921 --> 00:26:35.720
figure out what would it have to be true if any,

456
00:26:35.721 --> 00:26:37.820
if each of those individual hypotheses were true.

457
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.120
And then we're going to try to figure out how to test between them.

458
00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.840
That's the scientific method and it's,
it's an efficient,

459
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.030
it sometimes gets things wrong,

460
00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:53.330
but it is the only tool we have to over time get to a better and better

461
00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:57.020
understanding of the universe.
And there's,
there's no,

462
00:26:57.060 --> 00:27:01.050
there's a method over in gender studies.
Yeah.

463
00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:06.080
So how have you seen that way of thinking leak into the harder sciences?

464
00:27:07.291 --> 00:27:10.610
Cause this seems to be the next frontier here.
Yeah.
Um,

465
00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.020
there are,

466
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.030
there are some schools now that when positions come open in,
um,

467
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:22.530
in science disciplines.
So most schools,
this wasn't true what evergreen,

468
00:27:22.531 --> 00:27:27.390
but at most schools through the hiring apparatuses within,
uh,
within department.

469
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.410
So you have someone in physics,
retires and physics gets to society,

470
00:27:31.411 --> 00:27:34.830
the Physics Faculty and Department Chair and such get to decide what kind of

471
00:27:34.831 --> 00:27:39.210
physicists they're going to hire next.
Somehow.
Increasingly,

472
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:43.470
science educators are being,
uh,
being hired rather than scientists themselves.

473
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:48.210
And science educator is a code word for people coming out of Ed schools and

474
00:27:48.211 --> 00:27:52.650
education schools have,
have this pathogen very,

475
00:27:52.651 --> 00:27:54.630
very badly.
So,
um,

476
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:58.140
science educators being hired into positions that should have been scientists

477
00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:02.670
means that now you have a weakening of scientific voice and scientific method in

478
00:28:02.671 --> 00:28:06.150
science departments.
You have a,
I mean,

479
00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:10.770
even what was that just recently nature I think published one of the two big

480
00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:14.070
science journals,
um,
published,

481
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:19.250
I don't know if it was a letter or an article arguing that one of the primary

482
00:28:19.591 --> 00:28:24.480
things that science needs to be focusing on is increasing diversity.
Okay.

483
00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.010
So two problems with this.
What are your measures of diversity?

484
00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:30.990
It's the stuff that you can see on first pass.

485
00:28:30.991 --> 00:28:34.350
It's these immutable characteristics and has nothing to do with actually all the

486
00:28:34.351 --> 00:28:37.730
other kinds of diversity that are interesting and that,
you know,
and,

487
00:28:37.731 --> 00:28:41.490
and that we can change things like political belief and you'll see some things

488
00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:45.360
that we can't change,
but things like being on the autism spectrum or you know,

489
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.990
even like,
you know,
colorblindness or dyslexia or lefthand in this,

490
00:28:48.991 --> 00:28:52.530
all of which provide your brain without us ever being conscious of it.

491
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:56.160
Some different way of approaching the world and that kind of diversity in a

492
00:28:56.161 --> 00:28:59.520
group of people.
Ads,
ads,

493
00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:02.160
actual intrigue and nuance to conversations.

494
00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.460
And then I'm a lefty with a little dyslexia actually.
So there you go.

495
00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:10.020
I'm a lefty too.
All right.
So you know,
lefties,
like,
you know,

496
00:29:10.021 --> 00:29:12.300
like many other members of these groups,
but I happened to,

497
00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:15.120
I happen to know the lefty one because I've done some research on it.

498
00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.330
Lefties are overrepresented at,
you know,

499
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:20.190
in the National Academy of Sciences and the mental institutions.

500
00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.340
You've got this really big spread.
Well,

501
00:29:23.341 --> 00:29:27.590
now I can see that there's really two options for your future.
That's right.

502
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.160
<v 0>Okay.</v>
