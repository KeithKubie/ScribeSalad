[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.119
SPEAKER 1: Will you join me
in welcoming to Google Anne

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.541
Fadiman and Lynn Stegner.

00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:13.690
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.480
LYNN STEGNER: Well,
my first question

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.660
has to do with your father.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.910
He died 18 years ago.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.000
And I wonder if he
might be asking,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.800
why did it take you so long?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.240
ANNE FADIMAN: Ah.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.510
Well, I don't think my
father would be asking

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.334
why did it take me so long.

00:00:33.334 --> 00:00:34.750
Because he never
would have wanted

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.350
me to write this book
in the first place.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.650
Because although it's a loving
memoir, hardly a Daddy Dearest,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.440
it does contain
some things that I

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.430
know he wouldn't have
wanted me to write about.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.650
Perhaps I should
explain who he is.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.230
You know, but not
everybody does.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.530
A recent review of the "Wine
Lover Daughter" was titled,

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.100
who was Clifton Fadiman?

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.560
And Adam Gopnik described
him with the adjective

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.510
"once-omnipresent."

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.160
And so that's both a complement
and, alas, a sad insult.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.920
He certainly is not
omnipresent any longer.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.250
He was mostly a writer.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.860
But he was also--

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.945
at 28, he was the
editor-in-chief

00:01:22.945 --> 00:01:24.340
for Simon &amp; Schuster.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.230
At the age of 29, he
was the book reviewer

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.430
for "The New Yorker."

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.820
At 34, he was the emcee
of a famous radio show

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.810
called "Information Please."

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.020
But he was mainly a writer.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.570
And I think the
reason that it took

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.940
me so long was
that, first of all,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.820
I couldn't have written
it while he was alive,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.430
because I wouldn't have
wanted to hurt him.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.970
And also I think
that his fame needed

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.340
to decline even more, year, by
year, by year since his death,

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.940
until it got to a point
where I no longer felt

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.790
that writing a book about
him would be standing

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.650
on the shoulders of his fame.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.350
But rather trying to revive it.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.140
Which put me in a far
more powerful role.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.920
LYNN STEGNER: Well, I was
thinking about that yesterday.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.300
And that this memoir
is a kind of-- you

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.560
are lending some of your
literary longevity back to him.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.920
Because he wasn't able,
as you say in the book,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.860
ever to complete a whole book.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.370
And I wonder if you could talk
a little bit about why you think

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.250
he didn't do that whole book?

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.860
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh, that's
such an interesting question.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.250
I have dozens and dozens
of his books on my shelf.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.120
But they're all either
collections of his essays--

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.910
he didn't consider
that a whole book.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.860
It was a collection
of shorter work.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.470
Or they're anthologies
that he edited.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.980
Or they're books by others
that he wrote the foreword to

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.250
or the afterword to.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.100
But he'd never
completed a whole book,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.830
although he started several.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.900
I think it was part of
his sense of insecurity,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.460
that he didn't quite deserve to.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.440
He deserved to review
books, and to write

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.440
forewords and afterwords to
books, and to edit books.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.020
But never quite to write one.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.110
An insecurity that I
think came from the fact

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.860
that he grew up poor in
Brooklyn at the beginning

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.120
of the 20th century.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.470
Born to Russian Jewish
immigrants in 1904.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.440
And although he
became someone who

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.830
seemed so patrician--
a friend of mine said,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.140
oh my god, I always thought
that your father's family

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.110
must have dated back to Plymouth
Rock because of his voice.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.780
And I think he felt like an
actor who was really, really

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.160
good at imitating people that
he would never truly feel like.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.811
And that insecurity bled over
into his own life as a writer.

00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:54.310
So the very fact
that I have written

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.550
some whole books, including
this one, that part

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.120
would really please him.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.110
LYNN STEGNER: Yeah, you talked
about his fear of the imposter

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.830
syndrome.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:03.670
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.310
LYNN STEGNER: Of being
a fake and a fraud.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.720
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.230
LYNN STEGNER: Even though he
had every pot on the stove

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.020
that you could have had on in
terms of the literary landscape

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:12.170
at the time.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.010
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes,
he was so successful.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.910
One of his favorite evidences
of the reach of his influence

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.180
was that, when he was the
emcee of his big radio

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.350
show, "Information
Please," which at its peak

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.280
more than a tenth
of the US population

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.820
tuned into every Tuesday
night from 8:30 to 9:00--

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.170
by the way, just to see,
gee, more than a tenth.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.210
Is that a lot?

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.150
I looked up the fraction of
the US population that tuned

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.000
in to the most popular episode
of "Game of Thrones," 1/20.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.100
So he beat Game of Thrones.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.430
But his favorite story about
the reach of his influence

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.630
was an occasion for a lawsuit.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.230
He'd asked the radio audience,
in his inimitably plummy voice,

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.040
and now I would like to
ask the men in my audience

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.420
to close their eyes and see
whether they can remember

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.490
the color of their ties.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.290
And unfortunately, one of his
listeners was driving a car,

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.140
and listening on the car
radio, and crashed into a tree.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:22.102
And he was fine.

00:05:22.102 --> 00:05:23.810
Otherwise this wouldn't
be a funny story.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.136
But I think his
fender was destroyed.

00:05:28.136 --> 00:05:29.120
LYNN STEGNER: Took a--

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.869
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes.

00:05:29.869 --> 00:05:32.750
And he sued the show's sponsor.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.330
And my father couldn't
have been more pleased.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.317
Because that was
evidence of his affect--

00:05:38.317 --> 00:05:39.650
LYNN STEGNER: The reach of his--

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.060
ANNE FADIMAN: --on
his listeners.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.420
So yes, he was
extraordinarily successful

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:48.950
in any number of literary
jobs he held over the years.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.600
But because when he was
small growing up, sharing

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.550
a bed with his two brothers over
a series of failed drug stores

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.080
that his father ran in Brooklyn
in poor neighborhoods, long

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.360
before Brooklyn became the
fashionable place it is now--

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.740
because he had grown up with
parents who came from Russia

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:17.600
and spoke un-grammatical,
heavily accented English--

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.510
English was essentially
a second language.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:24.020
He said that he learned
it as if it were Sanskrit.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:29.150
And although he never went
back to his earlier voice,

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.970
I think he felt like someone
who had learned to part

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:33.980
rather than been born into it.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.200
One thing I found out when
I was researching this

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.820
was that his older brother--

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.460
who went to the same
public school in Brooklyn

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.650
that he had called Boys High--

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.390
had been the vice
president of something

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.570
called the Correct English Club.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.210
And don't you think
it's poignant to imagine

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.800
all of these smart sons
of immigrants founding

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.660
a club that would help them
not sound like their parents?

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.150
LYNN STEGNER: I think
we still need that club.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:03.480
I want to ask a question.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.570
Just because growing up the
daughter of a well-known--

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.040
you resisted a temptation
that many descendants of fame

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.880
don't resist.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.980
And that is you didn't
sanitize his life

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.680
when you wrote a memoir of it.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.050
You really dealt with it
in an even-handed way,

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.220
including things
like his chauvinism.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.770
I wonder if you would talk
about that as his daughter.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.590
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh gosh, yes.

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.470
Well, reading my father's
literary reviews,

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:37.700
his putdowns of women
authors and readers

00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.280
were more or less
a continuous series

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:47.570
of oinks from a really
completely irredeemable

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.790
male chauvinist pig.

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:53.240
On the macro level,
he was left wing,

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.780
and liberal, and in favor of the
Equal Rights Amendment, and sad

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.160
when it didn't pass.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.240
But on the granular
level, he was really

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.810
condescending to women.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.880
I came across a newspaper
article about a lecture

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.950
that he had once
given at a ladies

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:18.140
luncheon at which he said,
women are bad at conversation.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.230
And they know
nothing about wine.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:24.230
LYNN STEGNER: And this
was to a ladies luncheon.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.150
ANNE FADIMAN: A ladies
luncheon at which

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.490
I am sure wine was served.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.370
And perhaps I should say that
the reason that the book is

00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.320
called "The Wine
Lover's Daughter"

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.750
is that it would have
been impossible for me

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:41.090
to write my father's biography
or a kind of grandiose memoir

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.049
about my father.

00:08:42.049 --> 00:08:45.650
I needed a lens that
narrowed the task

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.690
to something that felt doable.

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.819
And books and wine were
the things my father--

00:08:50.819 --> 00:08:51.860
LYNN STEGNER: Experience.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.750
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes,
they were the things

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.370
he loved most in the world.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.150
As well as for him, the
most powerful symbols

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.530
of that cultivated, refined
life across the East River

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:07.280
that he aspired to when he
was growing up in Brooklyn.

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.590
And he wrote a lot about wine.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.310
And of course, you used
to run a wine company.

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:17.000
And I've read that you have been
called an organoleptic freak,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.450
because you are such a
remarkable wine taster.

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.880
I can't say that I
love wine myself.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.950
And that's one of the
themes of the book.

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:27.500
But if my father
were sitting here,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.560
I can guarantee you all
the rest of your questions

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.500
would just end up on the floor.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.330
Because he would
want to talk to you

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.970
for an hour about great wine.

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:42.080
LYNN STEGNER: This was a way
out of escaping his origins,

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.310
to quote your brother, Kim.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.230
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.390
LYNN STEGNER: His
affection for wine

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:52.940
and his really deep exploration
of the world of wine.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.440
How do you think--

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.480
would you like him
to know now what

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.450
you know now, which is
that you don't have,

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.360
genetically or
physically, a palate that

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.460
can appreciate wine?

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:08.610
ANNE FADIMAN: I'm not sure.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.750
One of the chapters
toward the end of the book

00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:18.300
is about my exploration in
the world of taste science.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.650
It occurred to me that perhaps
my inability to love wine

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:26.364
wasn't a character flaw, as I
had assumed it was all my life.

00:10:26.364 --> 00:10:27.780
From my father's
point of view, it

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:31.350
was as if I couldn't appreciate
art, or music, or literature,

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.660
all of which, thank god, I can.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.400
But wine was in
that same category

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.560
of magnificent
human experiences.

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.730
And if you were a full human
being, of course you loved it.

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.980
But I found out by
taking a series of tests,

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:48.960
including genetic tests, that
I have a hypersensitive palate

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:52.140
that makes pretty much
everything taste too strong.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.200
And in particular, I
have a genetic variant

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.470
that makes bitterness
in alcohol something

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.710
that tastes very intense to me.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:06.390
I think he would have been
more likely to forgive me,

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:10.530
because it wasn't my
fault. But on the whole,

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:15.150
I think it would have been a
sad thing for him to learn.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.360
Because he would have realized
that there was no hope.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.190
He was-- he believed
in education.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.380
He'd been educated
right out of Brooklyn.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.550
And he kept hoping that if I
just kept tasting enough wine

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:27.960
that I would learn.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.730
That is, children
don't like wine.

00:11:29.730 --> 00:11:31.960
And yet, most do
when they grow up.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.710
And so eventually, with
time, it would happen.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:39.480
And I think he died still
hoping that that moment would

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:40.520
come for me.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.650
And knowing that it
never would, oh my god,

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.750
I'm so glad I never
had to tell him that.

00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:47.040
LYNN STEGNER: It would
have been a form of--

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.670
a disability.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.830
ANNE FADIMAN: It
would have killed him.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:49.200
LYNN STEGNER: Yeah.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.741
ANNE FADIMAN: An
absolute disability.

00:11:50.741 --> 00:11:53.880
It was as if he had found
out that I couldn't see.

00:11:56.670 --> 00:12:00.330
LYNN STEGNER: He lived in--
you know-- in New York.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:04.980
And at a time when
psychoanalysis was in vogue.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:09.120
And I wonder if given the
periodic depressions that he

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:13.200
went through and this
self-depreciation that he

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.430
was prone to, why he never
considered going into something

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.130
that everybody seemed to
be doing at that time?

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.554
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh, I think a
really long psychoanalysis

00:12:22.554 --> 00:12:23.970
would have done
him a lot of good.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:26.220
And oh, the lucky analyst.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:29.730
Because my father was
such a great talker.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.320
He really could
have lain on a couch

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.970
and prevented an analyst from
sleeping, I think, for at least

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:36.640
a decade.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.340
No, he never did that.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:44.110
I don't think that he wished
to explore his darker corners.

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:47.640
Although he was honest
about their existence,

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.170
at least within the family.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.790
Particularly in his later years.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:57.090
I read a letter
that he'd written

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.700
to one of his closest friends
when he was in his 70s--

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.790
and he lived to be 95--

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:05.140
in which he said that our
culture makes it difficult,

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.120
if not impossible, for
children ever to really get

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.740
to know their parents.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:13.140
Actually, that contained
a split infinitive.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.010
And he would never have
split an infinitive.

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:18.310
So that is probably
not a direct quote.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.070
But that was the idea.

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:23.070
And my book was a
refutation of that.

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:27.030
But the end of his life was
also a refutation of that.

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:31.410
Because he wanted to be
as transparent as possible

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.880
with his children, so that
he wouldn't die and have them

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.370
feel that they never
really got to know him.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:42.330
So he was really forthright,
candid, and honest

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:46.470
about his flaws, and his
fears, and his insecurities,

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.210
all of which are in the book.

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:52.770
But of course, he didn't know
that I would be sharing them

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.150
with however many people.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.745
LYNN STEGNER: 1/10
of the population.

00:13:54.745 --> 00:13:56.800
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh, yes, with 1/10
of the population of the United

00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.090
States.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:59.423
Yes, that's the number of
people who will buy this book.

00:13:59.423 --> 00:14:00.730
I feel certain.

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.310
Especially after
this Google video.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.810
LYNN STEGNER: Well, you say
that toward the end of his life,

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.692
he was trying to
pin himself down.

00:14:08.692 --> 00:14:09.900
I love that phrase, because--

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:11.270
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.620
LYNN STEGNER: And he kept
journals in which he--

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.370
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:18.660
LYNN STEGNER: --explored his
own sort of machinations and old

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:19.650
motivations.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.400
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.322
LYNN STEGNER: So he did a
kind of his own analysis.

00:14:23.322 --> 00:14:24.030
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:25.822
LYNN STEGNER: Self-analysis
toward the end.

00:14:25.822 --> 00:14:27.196
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes,
so when I said

00:14:27.196 --> 00:14:29.250
that he didn't like to
explore the dark corners,

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:33.210
I should have completely
excepted the last couple

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.980
of decades of his life.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.430
Because then he did start
exploring those corners,

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:40.620
not with the help of a shrink.

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:42.930
But he had terrible insomnia.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.560
And he had two ways of
dealing with his insomnia.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:50.940
He'd do word games in his head
in the middle of the night,

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.230
things like think of trees
beginning with each letter

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:56.040
of the alphabet.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.860
He'd go, acacia,
baobab, chestnut.

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.080
And then he'd get
to x, y, and z.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.410
And have a-- I guess
u for y would work.

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:05.760
He'd have a really hard time.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.956
So I have a feeling that
these games kept him awake

00:15:07.956 --> 00:15:09.330
rather than putting
him to sleep.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.497
But they were a way to while
away the hours of 3:00,

00:15:11.497 --> 00:15:12.330
4:00 in the morning.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.770
But then he would
also sometimes--

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.132
he kept this journal on
little scraps of paper.

00:15:17.132 --> 00:15:18.090
He'd turn on the light.

00:15:18.090 --> 00:15:21.750
And he'd note a little
journal entry down.

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:24.900
And then it would be typed
up by his part-time secretary

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.710
the next day.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.980
And I've read all of them.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.570
I'm his literary executor.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:33.430
So my house is just
full of his stuff,

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:37.140
which was one motivation
for writing this book.

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.970
I have 1,000 books of his.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:42.870
And all his journal, and
letters, and tapes that I

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:47.700
made for a profile that I wrote
about him for "Life" magazine

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:50.310
when he was 80.

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:54.990
But those little
journal snippets were--

00:15:54.990 --> 00:16:00.090
yes, a lot of them were about
his childhood in Brooklyn.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:02.850
And a lot were about
the feeling that you've

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:07.140
mentioned of feeling
counterfeit, duplicitous,

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.240
like an actor,
someone who's going

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:13.380
to be found out any moment
and booted out the service

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:13.890
entrance.

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:17.160
Because he doesn't really belong
in the fancy gentleman's club.

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.960
LYNN STEGNER: Back to
the mudroom for you.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.418
ANNE FADIMAN: That's
exactly right.

00:16:20.418 --> 00:16:22.800
LYNN STEGNER: Well, one thing
I wanted to ask you about

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:29.700
was, because this memoir
is very balanced and not

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:33.210
a form of hagiography,
I'm wondering

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:39.060
if that process grew out of
your experience as a journalist

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.520
with requirements
of objectivity.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:45.840
Or if it simply was that
you could trust your abiding

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:51.210
love for him to handle the
darker aspects of his life

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:53.100
and personality?

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.320
ANNE FADIMAN: Well,
I am a journalist.

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:58.440
But I don't think I was ever
an objective journalist.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:06.540
That is, all of my best work
of reporting, I think, was--

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.599
is-- fair and accurate.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:10.819
But not objective.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.380
That is, I was never
a news reporter.

00:17:13.380 --> 00:17:16.170
And so in my first
book, which was

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:22.020
about a cultural impasse between
a family of Hmong refugees

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:24.690
and their American doctors
called "The Spirit Catches You

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:27.839
and You Fall Down," I put
myself in as a character

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:29.490
and made it very
clear that I had

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.390
become close friends with
both sides of this conflict.

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:35.730
So that there would be no
attempt at objectivity,

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:37.800
although every
attempt, as I said,

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.970
at both accuracy and fairness.

00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.900
But I do think that
when you're a journalist

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.140
you're not glossing over
the difficult stuff.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.250
So it wasn't objectivity,
but completeness.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:55.050
The desire not to paper over
things that are uncomfortable.

00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:57.461
And journalism certainly
taught me that.

00:17:57.461 --> 00:17:59.460
Partly because the things
that are uncomfortable

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.810
are the most interesting.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:03.930
The second factor
that you named,

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:08.010
that my love for my
father would somehow

00:18:08.010 --> 00:18:12.660
lead to triumph, even though I
certainly revealed his flaws.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.150
And I think that was the
most important thing.

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.620
You really nailed it there.

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.914
I loved my father
very much, even

00:18:18.914 --> 00:18:20.580
though there were
parts of him that were

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:23.190
disappointing and exasperating.

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:26.320
But I don't think it's worth
writing a book about anybody,

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.100
especially a parent,
unless you're

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.550
willing to go to those
uncomfortable places.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.680
And I loved him.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.700
And in memory, still
love him enough, in fact,

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.380
really quite superlatively,
that I was sure

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:45.515
that that love would come
through to the reader.

00:18:45.515 --> 00:18:46.431
LYNN STEGNER: It does.

00:18:46.431 --> 00:18:49.470
ANNE FADIMAN: Even
when I was dissing him.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:52.650
LYNN STEGNER: I want to turn to
your relationship with writing.

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.920
And can you tell us something
about your writing process?

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.940
ANNE FADIMAN: Sure.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.600
Well, it's funny that I'm
answering this question

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.620
at Google.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.080
Because I wrote
most of this book

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.810
in a place as un-Google-like
as you could possibly imagine.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:14.700
I wrote some of it at
the MacDowell Colony,

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:21.290
which is a literary and artists'
colony in New Hampshire.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:25.800
But I wrote most of it at
a rented one-room cabin

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:31.980
in northwest Massachusetts that
had no internet, no landline,

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.960
and no cell service.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:38.370
So I was completely undistracted
and alone with my father.

00:19:38.370 --> 00:19:40.374
Who, by the way, liked luxury.

00:19:40.374 --> 00:19:41.790
Would have hated
this cabin, which

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.370
also didn't have any hot water,
and didn't have a bathroom,

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.120
and other things.

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:47.020
It did have electricity.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:50.770
But because I was completely
cut off from the world,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:54.420
it was a lot easier to
feel that he was there.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.610
Because nobody was
interrupting us.

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.850
And as I finished
each chapter, I

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:04.290
would put its name on a post-it
and array them vertically

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:08.230
along one of the wooden
posts of the cabin.

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:11.560
And when I put the final
one at the very bottom,

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.980
there was just room for the last
chapter after all those years.

00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:17.170
There were tears in
my eyes, thinking

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:18.780
I'd finally got to the end.

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:20.030
LYNN STEGNER: Pinned him down.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.850
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh, I don't know
that I could ever completely

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:22.630
pin him down.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.490
But I guess I sure tried.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:26.740
LYNN STEGNER: Yeah.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:29.950
As a writer, are there
any particular battles

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:34.540
that you feel you've won
over the years of your work?

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.600
ANNE FADIMAN: I'm not sure
I ever feel I win a battle.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.080
I feel that I survive a
battle, survive sufficiently

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:42.940
to come back and fight another.

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:46.020
Certainly as I've gotten
older, the ability

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:50.500
just to write a perfect sentence
without revision, that simply

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:56.830
comes delivered by
Amazon Prime instantly

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:59.470
by a winged muse, that muse--

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.590
you know, now it's sort
of more like UPS Ground.

00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.910
So I have to do more drafts.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.760
But my standards
haven't lowered.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.880
So that ultimate
sentence has to be

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.950
just as good as it used to be.

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:18.260
It just takes a little
longer to get there.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:23.020
But in the case of this
book, to write an entire book

00:21:23.020 --> 00:21:26.500
about someone I knew so
well, and loved so much,

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:31.500
and missed so much, but who
was, in many ways, so imperfect,

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.890
was a challenge I
hadn't faced before.

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:37.810
And it's so much harder to write
about someone in your family

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:41.290
than someone outside your
family that you're reporting on.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.720
LYNN STEGNER: You have
to sort of mature away

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.927
from their lived lives--

00:21:44.927 --> 00:21:45.760
ANNE FADIMAN: Right.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.801
LYNN STEGNER: --into lives
that are becoming almost mythic

00:21:48.801 --> 00:21:49.300
in your--

00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:49.660
ANNE FADIMAN: That's right.

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:51.368
LYNN STEGNER: --in
your heart and psyche.

00:21:51.368 --> 00:21:53.070
ANNE FADIMAN: That's just right.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.210
LYNN STEGNER: Your
husband is a writer, too.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:59.590
What is it like living under the
same roof with another writer?

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.450
ANNE FADIMAN: My husband,
George Howe Colt,

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:02.810
also writes nonfiction.

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:06.430
So not only are we both writers,
but we're in the same genre.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:09.830
And although I teach a
couple of days a week,

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:11.616
the rest of the week
I'm working at home.

00:22:11.616 --> 00:22:12.490
And he works at home.

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:15.340
And we have lunch and
dinner together every day.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:19.300
And we've often been asked, not
only why haven't you divorced,

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:22.090
but why haven't you
killed each other by now?

00:22:22.090 --> 00:22:25.480
People assume that
there's rivalry.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.780
But there isn't.

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.350
It was beautifully put
into words by a friend of--

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:35.590
late friend of mine,
Mark O'Donnell,

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:39.501
also a writer, who had
an identical twin, Steve

00:22:39.501 --> 00:22:40.000
O'Donnell.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.416
And they were both
comedy writers.

00:22:41.416 --> 00:22:43.960
And at one point, one of them
was writing David Letterman.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.580
And the other one was writing
"Saturday Night Live."

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.163
And when one of them
would get a Tony,

00:22:47.163 --> 00:22:48.820
and the other one
wouldn't, somebody

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.350
said, Mark, when something
great happens to Steve,

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.670
are you jealous?

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.590
And he said, no.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.950
I feel that Steve
won one for the team.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.750
And so when George got his
National Book Award nomination,

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.480
oh my god, I wasn't jealous.

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.100
He'd won one for the team.

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.840
We also edit each other's work.

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.152
And George often reads
his work aloud to me.

00:23:14.152 --> 00:23:15.610
So that's something
that will often

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.560
happen at the lunch table.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.230
And I can't imagine
not being married

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:23.240
to another member of the club.

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.400
And so you, too, are
married to a writer.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.840
LYNN STEGNER: Yeah, but he
was mostly writing nonfiction.

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:30.220
And I was writing fiction.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.939
So we had staked out separate
but equal territories.

00:23:33.939 --> 00:23:35.480
ANNE FADIMAN: You
had your bailiwick.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.370
With this sort of a
Berlin Wall between.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:40.012
LYNN STEGNER: Well, there was--
no, a bunting board, let's say.

00:23:40.012 --> 00:23:40.720
ANNE FADIMAN: OK.

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.890
Oh, a bundling board.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:42.760
That's wonderful.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.310
So people who don't know
what a bundling board was,

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:49.800
the Puritans would have
unmarried couples--

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:51.730
this actually sounds
sort of racy--

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:54.317
keep each other warm in bed.

00:23:54.317 --> 00:23:56.650
But with something called a
bundling board between them.

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.710
So there could be no
physical contact whatsoever.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:01.450
But yet you could
have conversation.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:02.350
LYNN STEGNER: You could talk.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:04.100
ANNE FADIMAN: A sort
of Pyramus and Thisbe

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.800
through the wall,
the hole in the wall.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.770
So yes, the bundling board
between you and your husband.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:09.620
That's just a--

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:09.970
LYNN STEGNER: But we also--

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.830
ANNE FADIMAN: That's
the loveliest metaphor.

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.650
LYNN STEGNER: We did edit
each other's work, too.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:14.310
ANNE FADIMAN: Yeah.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.560
LYNN STEGNER: Yeah, there is--

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.870
that's a real lucky--

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:17.170
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.794
LYNN STEGNER: It's
a lucky circumstance

00:24:18.794 --> 00:24:23.230
for a writer to have a
built-in home-grown editor

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:23.956
on the property.

00:24:23.956 --> 00:24:25.330
ANNE FADIMAN: And
so inexpensive.

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.320
LYNN STEGNER: So
inexpensive, exactly.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.800
This is a classic question.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.830
But it's always an
interesting one.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:37.230
And that is what writers or
books have most influenced you?

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:41.050
ANNE FADIMAN: Well, I majored
in the history and literature

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.040
of England in college.

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.400
I went to a college that
actually had a major called

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.010
history and literature.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:51.340
And so the great 19th
century writers probably

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:54.610
influenced my prose style.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.490
"Middlemarch" is probably
my favorite book.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:00.880
And I think you can learn
more about human psychology

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.060
from "Middlemarch" than from
most psychology textbooks.

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.020
I recently read the--

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:10.560
did the audio book
for this book.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.040
And it was the first time that
I had been the narrator of one

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.280
of my books.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.340
And as I-- it turned
out to be much harder

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.550
than I had expected.

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:21.150
As I was in this little
studio, I found myself

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:22.860
saying to myself,
why does that writer

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:24.990
write such long sentences?

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.460
And why are there
so many parentheses?

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:33.360
And so I'm sure 19th
century British literature

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.470
was that influence.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:38.820
But I'm very much
influenced, I guess,

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:43.140
by the great writers
of literary journalism.

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:47.220
John McPhee, Ian
Frazier, Joan Didion.

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.570
And McPhee has probably been
my longest-lasting influence.

00:25:51.570 --> 00:25:56.490
I remember reading the
first part, the first third,

00:25:56.490 --> 00:25:58.800
of "Encounters
with the Archdruid"

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.320
my freshman year in college.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:05.850
And it was a genre that I
had never encountered before.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.980
And there it was in
"The New Yorker."

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.790
And it was just as if a
tsunami had come over me.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.920
And I thought, oh my god,
I would love to do that.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.820
LYNN STEGNER: That's
what you want to do.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:15.360
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.443
LYNN STEGNER: That's a
great essay and great book.

00:26:17.443 --> 00:26:19.260
I think I read it at
about the same time.

00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.020
McPhee actually includes
one of your essays

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.320
as one of the 10 greatest
essays ever written.

00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:30.120
It's an essay from "Ex Libris"
entitled "Marrying Libraries."

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.500
And it is one of
my favorite too.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:31.590
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh, thank you.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.965
LYNN STEGNER: And I use it,
actually, in a class I teach.

00:26:33.965 --> 00:26:38.280
But what I love about it most
is the unity of form, content,

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:40.620
and narrative voice.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.950
It's just, everything
is fused beautifully

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:45.540
in that short essay.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.880
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh, thank you.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:49.470
"Marrying Libraries"
was about what

00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:53.880
happens when two writers, each
with a whole lot of books,

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.270
get married and have to
marry their libraries.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.820
And first we lived together.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:00.930
And then we got married.

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.420
And then we married
our libraries.

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:05.250
That was a much bigger step.

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.560
Because after we
mingled our books

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.170
and had to throw out the
duplicates and decide whose

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.500
would go, we really
couldn't get divorced.

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.450
I mean, that was a
far bigger commitment

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:17.360
than any marriage vows.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:21.600
But yes, when John
McPhee put that essay

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.780
on his little list
of the best essays,

00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.270
that was one of the
best moments of my life.

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:32.220
It was like God speaking
and tapping me on the head.

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:34.680
LYNN STEGNER: You get
to enter heaven now.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.580
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.710
I was in heaven at that moment.

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:40.290
And even just hearing you
say it just brings me back

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.956
to the moment when I
first found that out.

00:27:42.956 --> 00:27:44.580
LYNN STEGNER: I have
a question about--

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:50.880
all of your books contain a very
rigorous, long sources section.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.030
And I wonder if you could
footnote for us your devotion

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.500
to footnotes and sources.

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.490
ANNE FADIMAN: Sure.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:03.190
Well, it's partly that I'm very
interested in being accurate.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.990
So this book has no
made-up quotations.

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:12.090
Everything is verbatim or
very close to verbatim.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.940
Everything my father says is
either quoted from something

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.490
that he wrote-- either
published, or from his journal,

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:18.810
or from a letter--

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:23.520
or something that I
taped or took notes on.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.040
And so I wanted the
reader to know that.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:29.610
Because most memoirs are
full of reconstructed quotes.

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.160
Because if somebody said
something 30 years ago,

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.080
how could you
remember it verbatim?

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.440
I also thought that
readers might be interested

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.440
in-- if they were
interested in a--

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:44.610
so there's a chapter
about my father's feelings

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:45.740
about being Jewish.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.510
He encountered a great
deal of anti-Semitism

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:50.700
when he was young
and at Columbia.

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.760
And if anybody is interested
in reading about anti-Semitism

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.000
at Columbia during the
1920s, well, they're

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.310
in the sources at
the back of the book.

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:01.740
Also I love research.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.776
And so maybe it's-- the--

00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:10.620
I think the length maybe was a
specific response to something

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.190
that one of my
Yale students said.

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:15.990
As I was just about to
start the source notes,

00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.785
I told this student, yeah,
over this winter break,

00:29:18.785 --> 00:29:20.910
I'm going to work on the
source notes for my memoir

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:21.600
about my father.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.550
And he said, a memoir?

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.090
Would that have source notes?

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.540
And I thought, oh my god, yes.

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.890
It took me years to do
all of this research.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.490
So maybe I just
wanted a little trail

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.789
of evidence of all that sweat.

00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:36.580
LYNN STEGNER: Well,
and you also write it--

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.480
there's also an essay that you
wrote called "Nothing New Under

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:46.550
the Sun," in which you let the
form mimic your attentiveness

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.170
to--

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:52.390
and it's a really irritating
piece to read, as wonderful--

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.720
I mean, it's supposed--
it's a gag, in a way.

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:54.930
ANNE FADIMAN: Yeah.

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:56.040
LYNN STEGNER: Because
every sentence

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:56.920
you write has a footnote.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.690
ANNE FADIMAN: Is footnoted.

00:29:57.690 --> 00:29:59.250
LYNN STEGNER: You have to
stop, and go down, and look

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:01.200
at the footnote, and
go back to sources.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.810
And by the end of the essay,
we're shaking our fist at you.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.726
ANNE FADIMAN: I wanted
you to shake your fist.

00:30:06.726 --> 00:30:07.420
LYNN STEGNER: We were.

00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.336
ANNE FADIMAN: That's an
essay about plagiarism

00:30:09.336 --> 00:30:10.420
in "Ex Libris."

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.950
The idea being that everybody
always plagiarizes everything.

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.700
Because there's nothing
new under the sun.

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:18.400
And therefore, every single
sentence in the essay

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.780
had some source or another.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.640
And everything was footnoted.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.500
This book is not
footnoted, because I

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.420
didn't want to
interrupt the narrative

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:27.460
and make readers shake
their fists at me.

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:31.030
But I do have source
notes at the end.

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:33.460
LYNN STEGNER: Well, should
we take some questions

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.279
from the audience?

00:30:34.279 --> 00:30:35.070
ANNE FADIMAN: Sure.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:36.050
LYNN STEGNER: This is--

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.400
is this a good time, Dave?

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.270
Oh, OK, great.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.104
Let's talk about-- go
back to wine a little.

00:30:43.104 --> 00:30:44.353
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes, your world.

00:30:44.353 --> 00:30:47.102
LYNN STEGNER: Oh, I wanted you
to read a couple of excerpts.

00:30:47.102 --> 00:30:48.060
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh, sure.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:51.440
LYNN STEGNER: So let's
hear that opening oakling.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.270
ANNE FADIMAN: OK, yes, and I
have an oakling question then

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:56.420
for you.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:59.550
So you're about to learn a term.

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:03.150
I'm really hoping that, if
this book does nothing else,

00:31:03.150 --> 00:31:06.820
it introduces the word oakling
to the American vocabulary.

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:12.130
A few years ago,
I wrote an essay

00:31:12.130 --> 00:31:15.970
about Hartley Coleridge, a
19th century British poet who

00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:19.450
had the bad luck to be the
son of a far more famous poet,

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:21.640
Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:25.750
Hartley started off as
a celebrated wunderkind

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:27.940
and ended up a
penniless alcoholic

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.450
who often spent his days
in alehouses and his nights

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.160
in ditches.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.310
A review of the only book of
Hartley's poetry published

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.790
in his lifetime allowed
that it manifested

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:44.110
no trivial inheritance
of his father's genius,

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:46.660
a sincere compliment,
if one that implied he

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:48.620
had no genius of his own.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:53.080
But also cited an old
adage, the oakling withers

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.120
beneath the shadow of the oak.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.490
I am interested in oaklings,
because I am one myself.

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:02.200
When writers beget
writers, there

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.150
are, of course, some advantages.

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:06.340
There are plenty of
books in the house.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.320
There's an example
right under your nose

00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:11.410
that words are a plausible
way to earn a living.

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.960
There's the intimacy that
comes when you and your parents

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.900
like the same things and
are both good at them.

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.720
But despite the
perks, oaklings face

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.210
a universally
acknowledged problem,

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:26.110
the mighty oak grabs
all the sunlight.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:29.530
One solution is relocating
yourself as far as possible

00:32:29.530 --> 00:32:31.120
from the shadow.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:34.990
My brother and my half-brother
chose not to become writers.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:38.800
They were thereby saved the
angst of Nick Harkaway, John Le

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.070
Carre's youngest son, who
said that becoming a writer

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:45.490
would feel as pointless as
standing next to a lighthouse

00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:47.890
and waving a flashlight.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.310
Like me, he became one anyway.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:58.900
So an oakling-- the notion
that the oakling, the writer

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:00.880
offspring of the
famous writer parent,

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.940
is always going to be
smaller than the oak

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:08.140
is something that everyone in
my position struggles with.

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:16.060
So a terrible compliment to
give to the writer offspring

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:18.550
of a famous writer
parent is, oh, you're

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:20.290
a chip off the old block.

00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:25.810
Because no chip has ever
been as large as the block.

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:31.750
So you're more or less an
oakling by marriage, Lynn.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:35.360
Your father-in-law
was Wallace Stegner.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:40.210
So partway through your
life, all of a sudden you

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.670
had a famous last name.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:44.860
And you, too, were a writer.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.580
What has that sort of
oakling-in-law-- dumb--

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.750
been like for you?

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.500
LYNN STEGNER: Well, mostly
it's been wonderful.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.620
As I said, I had
built-in readers.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.660
Both my husband
and father-in-law.

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.080
But it did hold me--

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.930
that tribe, that family tribe,
held me to a higher standard.

00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:06.850
ANNE FADIMAN: Yeah.

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.230
LYNN STEGNER:
Other people held--

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:12.250
so my first book,
which was a first book,

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:16.360
necessarily flawed
in certain ways.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:22.330
You know, I had my agent send
it out under my maiden name.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:25.044
And then they asked-- actually,
it wasn't even my maiden name.

00:34:25.044 --> 00:34:26.710
It was my first name
and my middle name.

00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:29.630
And when they decided to
take the book, they said,

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:31.570
would you mind using
a different name?

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.219
Because they didn't--
and I said, well,

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:34.960
that's actually not my name.

00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.540
And so they were very happy.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.830
So there were advantages
and disadvantages.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:43.480
ANNE FADIMAN: But I
admire you for making sure

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:46.840
that it was being
acquired by a publishing

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:49.750
house on its own merits.

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:51.280
That's such an
interesting story.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.380
Because when I was
a young writer,

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:56.440
I considered using my
mother's maiden name.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.530
That is, I considered
calling myself Anne Whitmore.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.710
She had been Annalee Whitmore.

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:05.440
Because I also
didn't want anyone to

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.310
think that I was trading
on my father's name.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:12.250
And I pondered it
for a few months.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.860
And then I thought, but
I'm not Anne Whitmore.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.270
I'm Anne Fadiman.

00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:19.450
I'm a Fadiman just as much
as my father is a Fadiman.

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:20.590
That's me.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:24.385
Why should I have
to change who I am?

00:35:24.385 --> 00:35:26.560
LYNN STEGNER: You say,
he had my genes, too.

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.685
ANNE FADIMAN: That's right.

00:35:27.685 --> 00:35:29.230
He had my genes, too.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.970
Yes.

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:35.480
So it seems to me
that we shared genes.

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:37.060
They were verbal genes.

00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:39.970
His two brothers also
were very verbal.

00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:42.130
My brothers are very verbal.

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:44.690
We all shared the same genes.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:48.400
So we inherited those genes
from great, great, great, great,

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.630
great grandparents.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:52.360
And people who simply
say, oh, you've

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:55.420
got your father's genes,
as if there was absolutely

00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:59.020
no creativity, or originality,
or even work on my part,

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.790
oh my god, it's exasperating.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:05.440
But I'm so admiring that
you sold your first book

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.846
not under the name Stegner.

00:36:06.846 --> 00:36:09.470
LYNN STEGNER: And then they were
very happy when they learned--

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.011
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh,
I'm sure they were.

00:36:11.011 --> 00:36:12.070
I'm sure they were.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.590
LYNN STEGNER: Here's a question
I wanted to ask earlier.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:19.520
And that is, your
fathers life effectively

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.839
bookends the 20th century.

00:36:21.839 --> 00:36:22.630
ANNE FADIMAN: Yeah.

00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:24.370
LYNN STEGNER: 1904 to 1999.

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:25.710
ANNE FADIMAN: There's
the 20th century for you.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.335
LYNN STEGNER: There's
the 20th century.

00:36:27.335 --> 00:36:30.520
So do you think
a Clifton Fadiman

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:34.090
would be possible in this
century in America today?

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:35.170
ANNE FADIMAN: No.

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.885
Oh, good question.

00:36:36.885 --> 00:36:37.385
No.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.950
My father's life as
a public intellectual

00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:45.990
really was the cultural
life of the 20th century.

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:49.280
And I think that there
are two reasons why

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:52.560
if somebody like him
were alive today,

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.260
he would not be successful.

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:57.767
One was that my father
was essentially didactic.

00:36:57.767 --> 00:36:59.600
He always wanted to be
an English professor.

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:02.240
Didn't get to be,
because Columbia said

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.280
that it had one spot for a Jew.

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.950
And it was going to his
best friend Lionel Trilling.

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:09.030
So much for his academic career.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.510
But he was still
always the explainer.

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:14.120
He wrote a book about
the 100 greatest books

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:16.711
you should read in your life,
called "The Lifetime Reading

00:37:16.711 --> 00:37:17.210
Plan."

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:19.085
He was a judge of the
Book of the Month Club.

00:37:19.085 --> 00:37:21.980
That sort of
didactic explaining--

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:29.330
people between the wars, and
I would say also in the 1950s,

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:31.040
wanted to better themselves.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.470
And people now don't
want anybody to say,

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:35.670
here are the 100 greatest
books you should read.

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:37.820
They might want to
read a self-help book

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.830
about how to make more money.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.820
Or how to do better
on match.com.

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.420
But not what books to read.

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:47.780
So that didactic strain
wouldn't go over.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:53.000
And the other was that, boy, he
was really an old, white male.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.200
The "Lifetime Reading Plan."

00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:55.410
100 books.

00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:58.970
97 by men.

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:04.070
99 by white writers.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:07.280
100 by Western writers.

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:14.510
So it seems to me that in
today's more diverse culture,

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.630
which I'm very
interested in myself,

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:20.480
he would be an anachronism.

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:23.200
And in some ways should be.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.260
LYNN STEGNER: Yeah.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.180
Well, that makes sense.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.670
But at that time,
our country needed

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:33.050
a cohesive unifying
voice of culture.

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:33.800
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:34.820
LYNN STEGNER: After
the war especially.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:35.945
ANNE FADIMAN: That's right.

00:38:35.945 --> 00:38:36.530
He was it.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:37.760
LYNN STEGNER: He was it.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.760
ANNE FADIMAN: He was it.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:43.010
LYNN STEGNER: And the
radio especially reached

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:44.385
that broader audience.

00:38:44.385 --> 00:38:45.510
ANNE FADIMAN: That's right.

00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:46.301
LYNN STEGNER: Yeah.

00:38:46.301 --> 00:38:49.250
ANNE FADIMAN: All of whom I
think felt somewhat elevated.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:54.440
Because the level of wit
and repartee on "Information

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:59.690
Please" was so high, even
though a lot of their guests

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.280
were from show business.

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.260
They were all people
who were really smart.

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:06.590
And it was not a polarized time.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:10.910
Just last week I happened
upon an old newspaper piece

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:11.780
about my father.

00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.190
This isn't mentioned
in the book.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:19.610
In 1940, he was
talking to a luncheon

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:23.022
of alumni of the University
of North Carolina.

00:39:23.022 --> 00:39:23.855
And it was the fall.

00:39:23.855 --> 00:39:24.980
And it was just before the.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.120
Election.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:29.450
And FDR was running
for his third term

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:31.160
against Wendell Willkie.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.140
And one of the women
in the audience

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.630
said, who was your
favorite guest

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.330
ever on "Information Please?"

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:41.960
And expected him to say,
you know, Groucho Marx,

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.660
or Boris Karlov, or whatever.

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:47.000
And he said it was
Wendell Willkie.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.390
Wendell Willkie was the
best-informed and most charming

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:52.610
man I ever had on the show.

00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:55.100
Of course, I'm voting for FDR.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.780
And the notion
that in those days

00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.500
you could say something so
respectful about the guy you

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.980
weren't voting for
just made me sigh.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:08.090
So that was the
kind of reaching out

00:40:08.090 --> 00:40:13.880
to an audience to
try to bring them up

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.780
to his level of
education and civility.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:19.970
So I think people
always felt that they

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:22.970
could stand a little taller
after listening to him.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.910
But not as if they'd
had a boring 10th grade

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:26.570
English class.

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:28.745
Because he was
just so damn funny.

00:40:28.745 --> 00:40:32.090
LYNN STEGNER:
Yeah, he was funny.

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:35.390
Back to the wine.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:37.827
Prohibition was
repealed in 1933.

00:40:37.827 --> 00:40:39.160
ANNE FADIMAN: Yes, that's right.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:43.915
LYNN STEGNER: In 1935, he began
his extensive wine cellar.

00:40:43.915 --> 00:40:45.040
ANNE FADIMAN: That's right.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.300
LYNN STEGNER: Yeah,
and so, in effect,

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.230
he was kind of a pioneer
in a country whose

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:55.522
wine fields had been laying
fallow for almost 14 years.

00:40:55.522 --> 00:40:56.730
ANNE FADIMAN: 14 years, yeah.

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.940
LYNN STEGNER: So how
did he sort of get

00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:03.570
that all going when there were
no sources of information.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:08.840
ANNE FADIMAN: Well, he'd had his
first glass of wine in Paris.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:09.800
Couldn't get one here.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.150
Prohibition.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.490
He was the editor
of Simon &amp; Schuster.

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:16.490
He commissioned somebody
to write a book about wine.

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:18.950
But wine, of course,
was all French wine.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:20.600
He learned about French wines.

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.540
And on the first day that he
felt ready to start collecting,

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:27.350
he bought 908 bottles,
as I discovered

00:41:27.350 --> 00:41:29.180
when I found his cellar book.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:34.954
And Chateau Lafite Rothschild
cost $1.75 a bottle.

00:41:34.954 --> 00:41:35.745
LYNN STEGNER: Alas.

00:41:35.745 --> 00:41:37.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:39.256
Should we take some questions?

00:41:39.256 --> 00:41:40.148
Yeah.

00:41:40.148 --> 00:41:42.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.870
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh god, you'd
have to be a billionaire.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:49.190
And of course, many of those
wines that he bought in 1935

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.345
were from 1929.

00:41:51.345 --> 00:41:53.720
Which, of course you know,
was probably the greatest year

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.260
for wine ever.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.660
Nobody quite knew that yet.

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:59.230
Because it was only
six years earlier.

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:01.140
The Lafite Rothschild
I think was '28.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:07.400
But I know that he bought
Chateau Margaux for $25 a case

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.810
from 1929.

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:14.847
That's $2.08 a bottle.

00:42:14.847 --> 00:42:15.930
AUDIENCE: That's baffling.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.512
So--

00:42:20.512 --> 00:42:22.230
ANNE FADIMAN: Is there
a question there?

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:24.290
Oh.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:25.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'll pass it.

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:27.040
On.

00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:29.160
So this question is for Anne.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:32.730
So I know that you mentioned
that the 18th century

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:34.895
British writers really
influenced your style.

00:42:34.895 --> 00:42:36.020
ANNE FADIMAN: 19th century.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.490
AUDIENCE: Oh, sorry.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:37.260
19th Century.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:38.968
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh, the
18th century people

00:42:38.968 --> 00:42:40.830
were really dry and dull.

00:42:40.830 --> 00:42:43.390
The 19th century with the
Romantics and the Victorians,

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:44.970
oh, very different.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:47.726
AUDIENCE: So sorry,
19th century.

00:42:47.726 --> 00:42:50.350
But what I was actually going to
bring up was the 18th century.

00:42:50.350 --> 00:42:53.580
So I know that you have a
little bit of an affinity

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.350
for the Romantics.

00:42:55.350 --> 00:43:00.150
And you have an essay about
Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:01.800
I was wondering
if you could maybe

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.159
talk about your
appreciation for him.

00:43:04.159 --> 00:43:04.950
ANNE FADIMAN: Sure.

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:06.840
So Samuel Taylor
Coleridge mostly

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.670
writing in the
early 19th century.

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.200
There was a group of--

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:11.640
among the lake poets.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.280
William Wordsworth was
also in that group.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:17.220
He was the father of
Hartley Coleridge,

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:21.810
the poet I mentioned
earlier who was essentially

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:24.780
called an oakling,
because he grew up

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:28.920
withering beneath the
shadow of this great oak.

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.590
And I'm particularly
interested in Coleridge's life,

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:34.710
because he spent much
of it running away.

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:38.850
My essay in a book called
"At Large and At Small"

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.420
is called "Coleridge
the Runaway."

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.400
And he ran away by
becoming an opium addict.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.470
He ran away from his marriage.

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:51.330
He ran away through
procrastination.

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:53.010
And at one point
he just ran away

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:56.070
from England, where
he had disappointed

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:58.900
a great many people
personally and professionally.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:01.560
And ran away to
Malta, where he worked

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.930
as a sort of junior diplomat.

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:09.060
And yet, despite the fact
that he was so disorganized

00:44:09.060 --> 00:44:12.660
and could never face
any difficulties,

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:16.230
he was incredibly productive and
one of the greatest poets ever.

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:19.110
And I'm so interested
in process that I

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.390
was fascinated to
think about, how

00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:23.760
could you be so great
and so productive

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.504
when you were so messed up?

00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:33.370
AUDIENCE: Well, I'd
like to ask if--

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:36.760
I'll preface this by
saying my hobby is writing.

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.697
I'm working on a bunch
of short stories.

00:44:38.697 --> 00:44:39.530
ANNE FADIMAN: Great.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:42.040
AUDIENCE: I've started a new--

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.140
well, I haven't finished
my first novel yet.

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:47.155
But I started another
one fresh for NaNoWriMo.

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.240
I'd just like to know if you
have any advice for aspiring

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.410
writers?

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:56.050
ANNE FADIMAN: Sure.

00:44:56.050 --> 00:44:59.970
Well, I was talking about
this in the car here.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:03.870
And I was lucky enough to
have a marvelous author

00:45:03.870 --> 00:45:07.740
escort driving me in my
car who's sitting here.

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:11.886
And she said, well, I was
writing something for my work

00:45:11.886 --> 00:45:12.510
just yesterday.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:13.870
And it wasn't really that good.

00:45:13.870 --> 00:45:15.703
I just don't think I
could ever be a writer.

00:45:15.703 --> 00:45:19.440
And I said, if you wrote 20
drafts like me you could.

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.880
And I think most
people don't know

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:25.260
how good they could possibly be,
at least on the sentence level.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.120
Because they write a
sentence in an email.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.350
And they go, eh, that's OK.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:32.520
Well, my emails aren't
that great either.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:36.490
Because I'm not rewriting
the sentence 20 times.

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:40.410
But I also think that the best
advice for an aspiring writer

00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:44.520
beyond rewriting, and
rewriting, and rewriting

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.340
is reading, and
rereading, and rereading.

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:51.340
I've always felt that if they
had a psychology experiment,

00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:56.080
and they put one guy
on a desert island

00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.070
with an unlimited amount
of paper and pencils

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:00.060
for five years.

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.710
And then on the
next island they had

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:05.350
a guy marooned with an unlimited
library for five years--

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:07.650
I'm not suggesting
this as an experiment.

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:11.040
I think the psychological
profession probably

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:11.860
would ban it.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.390
But I'm convinced that the guy
on the island with the books

00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:18.180
would probably be a better
writer at the end of five

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:22.802
years, even though he hadn't
been able to write a word.

00:46:22.802 --> 00:46:25.260
LYNN STEGNER: That brings me
to a question I wanted to ask.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:28.790
And that is, how does
teaching affect your writing?

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:32.750
ANNE FADIMAN: I teach
creative nonfiction at Yale.

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:35.150
It mainly distracts
me from my writing.

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:37.520
Because it means I can
write only in the summers.

00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.190
But my students'
writing is so good

00:46:40.190 --> 00:46:42.140
that I'm convinced
I'm contributing more

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.870
to American literature
by teaching writing

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:48.050
for most of the
year than by writing

00:46:48.050 --> 00:46:49.790
more books during my lifetime.

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:53.260
Because my students become
such marvelous writers.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.330
It's not that my teaching makes
them such marvelous writers.

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:58.100
They're already on
that trajectory.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:00.170
But if in a few
cases I could give

00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:03.470
that final nudge that
might make them say,

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:05.720
yes, I have the
courage to do this.

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:07.950
Because somebody said
I was really good.

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:11.240
So they're so good
that they inspire me.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.500
And they keep me fresh.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.690
As I get older, they
stay the same age.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:15.470
It's amazing.

00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:16.650
The new crowd comes in.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:18.260
And they're just forever young.

00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:20.314
And they keep me young.

00:47:20.314 --> 00:47:20.897
It's sort of--

00:47:20.897 --> 00:47:22.310
LYNN STEGNER: And
in the conversation.

00:47:22.310 --> 00:47:23.726
You're still in
that conversation.

00:47:23.726 --> 00:47:25.640
ANNE FADIMAN: Oh, in
the conversation, yes.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:26.911
They never shut up.

00:47:26.911 --> 00:47:28.160
And they never let me shut up.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:31.485
And that's the best
thing about it.

00:47:31.485 --> 00:47:33.110
AUDIENCE: OK, I have
one more question.

00:47:33.110 --> 00:47:34.540
This one's for Lynn.

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:37.540
So I'm going to actually ask
you the same question that you

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:41.560
asked Anne, which is who
are your favorite writers,

00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.110
and what is your favorite book?

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.700
Where do you draw
inspiration from?

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:49.390
LYNN STEGNER: I'm still filling
in gaps in my education.

00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:52.940
And so I tend to read
books, great books, that I--

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:55.720
they're all on your
father's reading list.

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:59.710
But American writers that
really have influenced me

00:47:59.710 --> 00:48:02.980
are William Styron,
Hemingway's short stories.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.710
Not his novels.

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:09.100
But then Dostoevsky.

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:12.730
I read all of the world's,
I think, existential writers

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.050
for a period of time.

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:18.740
Sabato and Camus, of
course, and others.

00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.660
So I think it's
all over the map.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:25.840
But I don't read a lot
of really new fiction.

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:31.300
It's like waiting for a new app
to go through 0.1, 0.2, 0.3.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.150
I wait a while before
I pick up new books.

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:36.140
ANNE FADIMAN: Or
like a great vintage.

00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:40.510
A really great wine is not
at its best in the year

00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:42.720
that it's produced,
as you well know.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.646
You have to wait
until it matures.

00:48:44.646 --> 00:48:47.020
LYNN STEGNER: Yeah, and goes
through its awkward periods.

00:48:47.020 --> 00:48:48.340
ANNE FADIMAN: Goes through
its awkward periods.

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:48.950
LYNN STEGNER: Yeah.

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:51.033
ANNE FADIMAN: Yeah, Chateau
Mouton Rothschild sort

00:48:51.033 --> 00:48:52.735
of version 0.01, 0.02--

00:48:52.735 --> 00:48:53.860
LYNN STEGNER: Right, right.

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:54.651
ANNE FADIMAN: 0.03.

00:48:54.651 --> 00:48:56.620
LYNN STEGNER: Wait
until you get to 0.3.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:58.818
Yeah.

00:48:58.818 --> 00:49:00.694
How are we for time?

00:49:00.694 --> 00:49:01.860
SPEAKER 1: I think we're OK.

00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:02.610
LYNN STEGNER: OK.

00:49:02.610 --> 00:49:04.944
Any other questions?

00:49:04.944 --> 00:49:06.110
SPEAKER 1: All right, well--

00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:07.901
ANNE FADIMAN: May I
just end with something

00:49:07.901 --> 00:49:10.850
about my father and Google.

00:49:10.850 --> 00:49:14.290
I was talking with
my brother Kim

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:16.640
before I came out
here to California.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.470
And I said that I was going to
be doing this talk at Google.

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:24.910
And he reminded me that
my father's math professor

00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:28.270
at Columbia-- about whom he
told many stories when we were

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:32.200
growing up-- was Edward Kasner
who invented the term Google,

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.020
spelled G-O-O-G-O-L.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:39.250
And my brother reminded me
that we'd heard from our father

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:44.560
that Kasner had been on a walk
with his young nephew, Milton.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.590
And Kasner had
said, Milton, what

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:50.650
would be a good word
for a really big number.

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:53.980
Let's say one
followed by 100 zeros.

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.950
And little Milton,
said, what about google?

00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:58.390
It was a made up word.

00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:02.830
Kasner spelled it G-O-O-G-O-L.
But that was the inspiration

00:50:02.830 --> 00:50:03.850
for Google.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:07.420
And my father had a
marvelous mental game,

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:12.460
another mental
game, that he would

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:16.060
play inside his head in
the middle of the night

00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.710
when he had insomnia.

00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:20.980
And it was called, I shook
hands with Shakespeare.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.590
And he would imagine
somebody like Shakespeare

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:25.060
who had lived a long time ago.

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.590
And he would imagine
people that he

00:50:26.590 --> 00:50:28.360
had known shaking hands with.

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.997
And then somebody
that that person

00:50:29.997 --> 00:50:32.330
might have known, going back
to the previous generation.

00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:34.121
Somebody that that
person might have known.

00:50:34.121 --> 00:50:36.670
And tried to get himself
all the way back to sort

00:50:36.670 --> 00:50:40.030
of shaking hands virtually
through the centuries

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:41.410
with some great writers.

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:45.670
And so now that all of you
are here listening to me,

00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:47.980
and I am the daughter
of my father,

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:51.220
and my father was the
student of Edward Kasner,

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:55.455
I feel that Google is
shaking hands with Google.

00:50:55.455 --> 00:50:57.335
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:57.335 --> 00:50:58.960
LYNN STEGNER: You
are the missing link.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.490
ANNE FADIMAN: I am missing link.

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:03.460
I have restored it.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.620
SPEAKER 1: Well,
thank you, Anne, Lynn.

00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:06.569
Thank you for coming.

00:51:06.569 --> 00:51:08.360
Let's give them one
more round of applause.

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.710
ANNE FADIMAN: Thank you.
