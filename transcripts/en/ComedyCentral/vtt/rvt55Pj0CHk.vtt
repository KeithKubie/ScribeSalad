00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.569
The machine,
Mr. Bert Kreischer, everybody.

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:09.570
Let him hear it.

00:01:09.603 --> 00:01:12.773
[cheers and applause]

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:16.777
I fought a bear one time.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.345
[laughs]

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.547
I know--It sounds
as ridiculous to me

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:22.716
as it does to you.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.185
But I used to have a show
called <i>Hurt Bert.</i>

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.621
It was on FX,
and I used to take

00:01:27.654 --> 00:01:29.623
new men's dangerous jobs.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.191
Every week,
it was a brand-new guy,

00:01:31.225 --> 00:01:32.793
and I took
his dangerous job.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.862
So you can imagine
the excitement I got

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:37.130
when I had--when I got a call
one morning

00:01:37.164 --> 00:01:39.766
and they said, "Hey,
do you want to fight a bear?"

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.603
I was like, "Who does that
for a living?"

00:01:42.636 --> 00:01:46.740
And they're like,
"You do on Thursday."

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:49.977
So I show up on set,
and it's a real grizzly bear.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.414
It is a 9-foot bear
sitting on a park bench just--

00:01:57.017 --> 00:01:58.752
A vacant look in--

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:02.890
As dumb as you think
a bear would look.

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:05.559
So I walk up.
I'm 28 years old.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:06.827
I don't know any better.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.230
I stick my hand
in front of his nose

00:02:10.264 --> 00:02:12.366
so he can get my scent,

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:14.968
and the trainer
loses his shit.

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:17.171
He goes,
"What are you doing?"

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:19.406
I was like, "I'm letting--
He's getting my scent."

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.807
He goes,
"This is a grizzly bear,

00:02:20.841 --> 00:02:23.677
not a labradoodle."

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.179
He goes,
"That's not how we do it.

00:02:25.212 --> 00:02:26.813
We have protocol
around here."

00:02:26.847 --> 00:02:28.382
I said, "Okay, what am I
supposed to do?"

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:29.583
He goes, "Take these,"

00:02:29.616 --> 00:02:31.051
and he hands me
five marshmallows.

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.586
He goes, "When the bear's
not looking,

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.254
"take a marshmallow,
put it in your mouth.

00:02:34.288 --> 00:02:36.023
"Then, discreetly walk
in front of the bear,

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:41.895
"just casually,
show him the marshmallow like--

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:45.432
"And allow the bear
the opportunity to engage you.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.267
"He needs to engage you

00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:49.570
"and take the marshmallow out
of your mouth with his mouth.

00:02:49.603 --> 00:02:51.004
This way, he'll learn
to trust you."

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:54.942
And I was like,
"[bleep] that.

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:56.210
"Who thought of this,
the bear?

00:02:56.243 --> 00:02:59.046
Is this the bear's idea?"

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.815
He's like, "Hey, buddy,
this is how we do it,"

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:03.817
and my whole television crew
is behind him like...

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:08.922
♪ This is how
we do it ♪

00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:11.992
It's my second TV show ever.
I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:14.528
I'm 28, and I want--
So I'm like, "All right.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.930
I don't care.
I'll do it."

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:19.766
So I take five marshmallows,
I hide behind the bear,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.369
and like David Blaine,
I whip one into my mouth.

00:03:22.402 --> 00:03:24.838
Then nonchalantly
walk in front of the bear

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.773
like a street hooker,
like...

00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:29.743
[moaning]

00:03:34.348 --> 00:03:37.784
And the bear goes from vacant
to excited, just...

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:39.453
[snorts and roars]

00:03:39.486 --> 00:03:40.454
And I'm going...

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:42.723
[muffled crying]

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.725
And he starts jumping.

00:03:44.758 --> 00:03:45.726
[roars]

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:46.727
And I'm going...

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.995
[cries]

00:03:48.028 --> 00:03:49.229
And he rushes me

00:03:49.263 --> 00:03:52.699
and tongues it
out of my mouth.

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:53.967
Tongues it.

00:03:54.001 --> 00:03:58.338
Bears never brush
their teeth.

00:03:58.372 --> 00:04:01.708
I'm making out with a homeless
person five times in a row.

00:04:01.742 --> 00:04:02.709
And I'm like...

00:04:02.743 --> 00:04:06.113
[retching]

00:04:06.146 --> 00:04:07.447
We get done,
and the trainer goes,

00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:08.949
"Fantastic.
We're ready."

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:12.219
I go, "Hold on.
I haven't learned anything."

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.820
He goes, "You kidding me?

00:04:13.854 --> 00:04:15.789
"You learned the most important
lesson of the day,

00:04:15.822 --> 00:04:17.891
and that is,
the bear likes marshmallows."

00:04:17.925 --> 00:04:19.293
I go, "What's that mean
for me?"

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:20.928
He goes, "Listen,
if you get in trouble,

00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:22.930
"just very confidently say
'marshmallow,'

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:24.831
"and what'll happen is,
the bear will hear that,

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:27.067
"and he'll give you some space
to do your marshmallow trick.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.002
"But we'll hear it,
we'll know you're in trouble,

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:31.138
and we'll get you out of there;
that's your safe word."

00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:34.908
I was like, "Yeah, but he thinks
they're inside me."

00:04:34.942 --> 00:04:37.277
He's like, "You'll be fine.
Let's go!"

00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:38.779
And the bear--
I swear--

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:40.414
And I know you're gonna go,
"Bullshit."

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.150
The bear was smiling.
He was--

00:04:43.183 --> 00:04:45.586
He's got that look
in his face like,

00:04:45.619 --> 00:04:48.488
"I know how to get marshmallows
around here, bitch."

00:04:48.522 --> 00:04:50.591
And he runs up to me,

00:04:50.624 --> 00:04:53.694
and I can't express it
perfectly.

00:04:53.727 --> 00:04:54.995
It's like being
in a car crash,

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:56.330
the most helpless
I've ever felt.

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:59.700
He grabs me by the ears,
both paws,

00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:03.337
lifts me off the ground
effortlessly,

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.205
and starts trying
to shake marshmallows

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:06.507
out of my ass, just...

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.008
[roars]

00:05:08.041 --> 00:05:10.043
And I'm going,
"Marshmallow, marshmallow.

00:05:10.077 --> 00:05:11.044
Marshmallow!"

00:05:11.078 --> 00:05:12.746
But no one can hear me

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:14.581
'cause there's
a 9-foot grizzly bear going...

00:05:14.615 --> 00:05:17.584
[roaring]

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:19.453
All of a sudden,
he drops me,

00:05:19.486 --> 00:05:21.722
and that is at the moment
that I thought I was gonna die.

00:05:21.755 --> 00:05:23.724
He lets go,
and I'm like, "Thank God."

00:05:23.757 --> 00:05:28.562
Then his fingernail
grabbed my belt loop,

00:05:28.595 --> 00:05:34.401
just snagged it,
and he spun me doggy style

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:37.471
and locked on
in a bear hug, just...

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.373
[roars]

00:05:39.406 --> 00:05:42.976
Grinding gently
on my ass, just--

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.379
Now we're both facing
the same direction.

00:05:45.412 --> 00:05:47.447
I'm looking at the crew,
the trainer, going,

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:52.553
"Marshmallow.
Marshmallow, marshmallow."

00:05:52.586 --> 00:05:54.454
Everyone's laughing
except for the trainer,

00:05:54.488 --> 00:05:57.257
who looks panicked.

00:05:57.291 --> 00:06:00.127
He waves and catches eyes
with me and goes, "Go limp!"

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.965
I'm like, "Please be talking
to me right now.

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:08.802
"A--Is there a bear [bleep]
climbing up my jeans?"

00:06:08.836 --> 00:06:10.904
About to split center seam,
just--

00:06:10.938 --> 00:06:13.740
[strained]
"Marshmallow."

00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:17.411
So I go limp.
I go limp.

00:06:17.444 --> 00:06:20.614
Now it looks like I'm getting
date raped by a bear, just--

00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:26.253
I slide out of his paws,
land on my back,

00:06:26.286 --> 00:06:27.721
and that's the last thing
I remember,

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:29.923
because apparently
his instincts took over

00:06:29.957 --> 00:06:33.927
and he sat on my face.

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:37.564
My wife, who I had been dating
for three months at the time--

00:06:37.598 --> 00:06:41.568
I had invited her to the set
so I could impress her.

00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:43.403
My wife's not afraid
of big animals at all.

00:06:43.437 --> 00:06:45.038
She goes over to the bag
of marshmallows,

00:06:45.072 --> 00:06:46.707
grabs a marshmallow,
puts it in her mouth.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.509
Stands by my feet
and goes--

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:52.746
The bear then takes his balls
out of my mouth,

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.314
walks over to her.

00:06:54.348 --> 00:06:56.149
They pull the bear to one side,
her to the other.

00:06:56.183 --> 00:06:59.253
They drag me under a tree,
and I wake up in the lap

00:06:59.286 --> 00:07:02.022
of my producer
Tim Scott.

00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:04.258
I open my eyes.
I look at Tim.

00:07:04.291 --> 00:07:06.426
It's the first thing I see,
and I was like,

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.161
"What happened?"

00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:13.767
He was like, "Well, you got
raped and tea-bagged by a bear.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.174
You might want
to get tested."

00:07:20.207 --> 00:07:22.809
And he's like, "That chick--
that LeAnn chick,

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:24.678
I think
she saved your life."

00:07:24.711 --> 00:07:27.014
And I look over,
and my wife, at that moment,

00:07:27.047 --> 00:07:28.949
is coming running over to me,
and it's like--

00:07:28.982 --> 00:07:30.717
It's out of a movie,
and I know you're gonna go,

00:07:30.751 --> 00:07:32.519
"Really, is this how
this [bleep] happened?"

00:07:32.553 --> 00:07:34.988
Well, it's my narrative, okay?

00:07:35.022 --> 00:07:37.991
She leans in.
Her head blocks the sun.

00:07:38.025 --> 00:07:40.494
There is a halo
from the Lord himself,

00:07:40.527 --> 00:07:43.564
or herself--
I don't care.

00:07:43.597 --> 00:07:45.632
And she is staring down at me,
and she says to me

00:07:45.666 --> 00:07:49.870
in her Southern accent,
"Are you okay?"

00:07:49.903 --> 00:07:53.006
And I look back at her
with the sun

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.708
caressing her face,

00:07:54.741 --> 00:07:56.910
and I knew without a doubt
in that instant,

00:07:56.944 --> 00:07:58.745
at that very moment--
You're like, "Really?

00:07:58.779 --> 00:08:00.948
That's when you knew?"
Yeah, that's when I knew.

00:08:00.981 --> 00:08:04.618
I would've never done that
for her.

00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:05.953
Thank you, guys.

00:08:05.986 --> 00:08:06.053
[cheers and applause]
