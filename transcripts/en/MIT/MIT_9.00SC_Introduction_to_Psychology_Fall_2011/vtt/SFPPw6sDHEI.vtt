PROFESSOR JOHN GABRIELI:
Good afternoon.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.490
So last time we talked about
neuropsychiatric disorder.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.720
And I just want to remind you
that we talked about it in a

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.880
couple of context
of challenges.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.500
That historically, different
cultures at different times

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.870
have interpreted unusual
behavior in

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.470
very different ways.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.310
From trephination, where you
have to release evil spirits,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.370
to possession, to what we would
now consider brutal

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.430
patterns of taking
people away from

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.740
society who behave unusually.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.230
And that even in recent times,
things like in the Soviet

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.720
Union, the diagnosis of people
who protest at utilitarian

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.410
governments is a socially
defined diagnosis.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.530
Obviously things like definition
of homosexuality is

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.200
a psychiatric disorder until
about 20 years ago.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.160
It was a socially defined
disorder.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.630
So there's a lot
of challenges.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.150
On the other hand, there's a lot
of people suffering with a

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.430
huge range of neuropsychiatric
disorders.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.110
So we're going to talk some
more about that today.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.890
Think a little bit more about
issues of treatment, talk a

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.840
bit about depression,
and ADHD.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.260
And I think of depression and
ADHD, attention deficit

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.360
hyperactivity disorder, as
kind of different as

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.110
schizophrenia.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.860
So most of us, except for the
1% approximately who have

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.030
schizophrenia, don't
hear voices, right.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.750
That's an unusual thing.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.920
But all of us can be sad.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.080
And many children are what we
would consider to be a bit

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.200
hyperactive, compared to a
teenager or an adult, right.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.160
They won't sit still quietly in
a large classroom like this

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.370
for very long.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.580
And so when we talk about
disorders like these.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.686
These are in some ways
exaggerations, or extensions,

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:23.460
of what we consider typical
everyday behavior.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.580
But moving into a realm that
makes life difficult for those

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.620
who get the diagnosis.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.100
So when it comes to treatment,
there's sort of two giant

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.170
classes of them.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.700
One of them is behavioral
treatment.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.550
Broadly speaking, you could
call them talk therapies.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.240
And the other one is medical
treatment with drugs.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.650
Within psychotherapy, which
really covers all of the talk

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.230
therapies, people sometimes
make a distinction between

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.935
psychoanalysis and cognitive
behavioral therapy, or CBT.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.140
So what is psychological
therapy?

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.910
So you might have a sense that
there's a lot of organization,

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.030
and rules, and regulations
about this.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.040
But the truth of the matter is
that psychotherapy is a social

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.960
interaction in which a trained
professional tries to help

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.890
another person behave and
feel differently.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.920
There's really no boundaries
on that.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.160
OK.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.530
There's no official rules.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.020
There's more and less official
channels we're used to.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.000
But it can be a very wide
sources of this.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.470
And if you flip open--

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.450
this is an archaic thing--
yellow pages.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.460
I realize a few years ago
people, yellow pages.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.850
But they used to have things
called phones and phone books

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.420
that were tethered
to the wall.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.300
And this is where you would
look for information about

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.870
people who list themselves as
providing psychotherapy.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.980
All you have to do is put your
name in that listing, even

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.840
easier on the internet maybe.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.560
A psychiatrist, the big
difference between

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.110
psychiatrist in one practical
sense and psychologist is

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.440
psychiatrist of course,
go to medical school.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.350
And they have prescription
privileges.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.290
They can write prescriptions
for drugs.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.260
That's rare to nonexistent
currently among psychologists.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.800
Psychoanalyst, here's Sigmund
Freud in the original

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.120
psychotherapy couch.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.610
And I think we've barely
mentioned Freud so far in this

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.690
course, right?

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.530
Which is kind of a big
shock to many people.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.200
You might have thought coming
into this course that there'd

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.870
be Freud, Freud, Freud.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.880
And you know, that we would be
sitting there and that we'd be

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.670
discussing ideas about
Freudian theory.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.630
I'll come back to that
in a moment.

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.560
Clinical psychologists can
provide psychotherapy.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.269
Counseling psychologists in
schools, clinical social

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.970
workers, clergy, peer groups,
self-help books.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.540
So let me just return to Freud
just for a moment.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.070
Because intellectually, I think
most people will agree

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.100
that Freud was a giant mind.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.740
And that in many ways, the
complexity of the modern human

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:42.630
mind, the idea that we're made
up of different parts,

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.580
different feelings, that we're
not just one simple operation

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.050
machine, but that we have
conflicts, different feelings,

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.560
and thoughts, and patterns
all within us.

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.650
Freud probably articulated that
thought more powerfully

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.910
than anybody else in many ways,
as a modern way in which

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.020
we view people, right.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.330
People are not just
simple things.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.840
They're complicated things, full
of tensions and desires.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.420
They're all mixed together.

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.720
At the same time, the specific
ideas that Freud articulated

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.480
using psychodynamic theories
like free association,

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.250
resistance, transference,
interpretation, trying to have

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.250
a corrective emotional
experience, where you go back

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.360
to your youth and
you figure out

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.360
something bad that happened.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.250
And if you can somehow grapple
with that, that will let you

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.030
be free of the consequences
of that early experience.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.740
Almost none of that has
withstood the scrutiny of

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.550
practical science.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.180
A lot of it, you don't
even know how you

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.910
could begin to test.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.050
Now for those of you who become
physicians, and the

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.790
rest of you will be patients,
it's amazing how much of

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.690
medicine is not science-based.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.510
It's amazing.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.940
So you hear the cry all the time
in medicine, we need to

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.920
have science, or evidence-based
medicine.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.090
And you might have thought,
well, what

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.000
else are they doing?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.380
OK.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.570
And the answer is they're
treated as best they can and

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.420
what works, works.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.150
A lot of stuff they don't
understand exactly when and

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.900
why it works.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.520
But they apply what they can.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.310
There's a patient in distress.

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.170
Freudian ideas are everything
that you know about ids, and

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:10.530
electric complexes, and all
that kinds of stuff.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.620
Hard to prove that they exist
in any scientific sense.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.830
So weirdly, Freud is in many
ways marginalized in the

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.820
current scientific psychology.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.030
That doesn't mean he wasn't a
creative mind that influenced

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.200
the way people think about the
human mind, and treating the

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.380
human mind.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.060
But the specific ideas he has
are in many ways at the edge

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.350
of the field.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.060
So more central to the field
is work called cognitive

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:39.470
behavioral therapy, or CBT.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.330
This is Aaron Beck,
who's maybe the

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.960
foremost figure in that.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.450
And that CBT was developed to
be exactly the opposite in

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.420
many senses of psychoanalysis.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.170
So similar because it's about
behavior, and about the

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.310
interaction between a clinician
and a person seeking

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:57.380
a sort of happier, healthier
approach to things.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:01.290
But the Woody Allen version of
psychotherapy, where you go

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.530
for 40 years weekly to your
psychiatrist on the west side

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:07.200
and talk through your
problems, OK.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.880
That idea, people said, well,
that's fine if you do that.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.780
But is that really what we mean
by treating somebody?

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.130
So Beck said, in things like
anxiety or depression, people

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.080
have dysfunctional beliefs that
the world is threatening,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.720
that the world is hopeless.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.210
These are sort of logical
thinking errors that you can

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.710
work yourself out of to make
yourself less depressed or

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.010
less anxious.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.790
That you should focus not on
childhood causes of what

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.250
happened, but on current
problems you face day-to-day

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:35.610
and how to grapple with them.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:39.190
Develop strategies that don't
make you get down and

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.510
depressed, or fearful
and anxious.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.220
And that it should
be time limited.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.720
Eight weeks or something, from
beginning to end period, not

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.900
an endless review of your life
and roots of your life.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.960
And so people are like that
because of part, it's easy to

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.630
test in research studies.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.980
It's been shown to be pretty
effective, pretty much on a

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.220
par with medications
in most studies.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.910
And in some cases, better.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.350
And a psychoanalysis
could go forever.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:07.490
It's hard to experimentally
test that in many ways.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.170
So there was questions about
whether psychotherapy works.

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:12.480
And if you're kind of a
scientist, you kind of like

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.080
biological stuff like pills,
not talking, right.

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.040
Although talk is
very powerful.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.230
And now, and early on,
people say, well,

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:22.190
maybe it's all baloney.

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:25.350
And I would say that starting
around 1980 from this review,

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.130
people said, no, there's
a lot to it.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.040
Although not everything
we wish it did.

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.610
So they performed
a meta-analysis.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.130
You may have heard of these
kinds of things.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.659
Where it was a quantitative
method for averaging results

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.159
of a large number of
different studies.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.890
The ideas is that statistically,
if you combined

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:40.039
many different studies, you
might have a sort of an

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:40.890
overall picture.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.100
It's not just describing them,
but taking their actual

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.820
statistics and combining them.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.440
Looking for the effect size,
something about the consistent

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.040
size of, in this case, a
psychotherapy treatment.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.000
And then asking what happens
in the terms

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.290
of the effect size.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:55.430
And you come out with a picture

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:56.840
like this in the study.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.720
That you have an average effect
side of a 0.7 that is

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.310
treated people.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:01.870
This is getting better
this way.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:04.610
We're on average better across
many different studies.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.270
So the treatment seemed
to move people

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.310
in the right direction.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:13.730
And that furthermore, about half
receiving psychotherapy,

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.730
the average person was better
off than 80% of the people who

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:17.370
didn't get it.

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:18.940
So not everybody benefits
greatly.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:20.680
But many people benefit some.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.740
About 10% got worse.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.076
So this number says only
a few get worse.

00:09:26.076 --> 00:09:29.120
A weirdly different thing, was
that people have always want

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.590
to develop very clear ideas
about which forms, of many

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.360
possible forms of behavioral
therapy are really powerful

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.630
for which difficulty, or
which kind of person.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.790
It makes sense, right?

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.580
That the different problem
you're facing and the kind of

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.760
person you are, a different
kind of talk therapy,

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.420
different kind of CBT would
be powerful for you.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:48.020
And that's been incredibly
hard to

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.310
demonstrate in most cases.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.330
Shockingly hard to
demonstrate.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.680
And part of that comes from
these kinds of studies.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.610
So the best of these kinds
of studies have random

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.780
assignments and to different
kinds of treatment.

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.010
For psychotherapy, you might
have a wait list.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:05.930
And you could be blinded as to
getting a good or bad version.

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:07.450
So again, here's another
meta-analysis.

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.900
And here's the kind
of big surprise.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:12.450
Again in this next
meta-analysis, about 2:1

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.820
chance of improving, versus
control, if you sit there and

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:15.460
don't do anything.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.560
So that's again, a good way to
go if you're in distress.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.610
Here's kind of a surprise,
credentials don't matter,

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:26.000
Ph.D., M.D., no degree.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.970
There might be something about
the kind of person who's a

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.610
more or less effective
therapists.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.230
That's been hard to
scientifically demonstrate.

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:35.570
The degree you have has never
correlated with the

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.210
effectiveness of
the treatment.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.110
Here's another big surprise,
the experience of the

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:40.450
therapist didn't matter.

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.700
Beginning, middle, end of
career, seen a lot of

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:45.400
patients, not seen a lot of
patients, that doesn't

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.620
consistently matter.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.970
The type of therapy doesn't
consistently matter.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:53.220
The length of therapy doesn't
matter in any way that people

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:54.910
have been able to show
scientifically.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:58.660
What seems to matter is talking
to somebody who

00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:01.560
listens to you on a
consistent basis.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:01.870
Yeah?

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.702
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:04.702 --> 00:11:06.280
PROFESSOR JOHN GABRIELI: That's
for all these kinds of

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.940
things, right.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.810
So on the one hand, you wouldn't
want to push it to an

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:11.610
absurdest thing because there
are humans involved.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.130
You wouldn't want to say, well,
just for fun, let's take

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.180
somebody's who like a
three-year-old and send them

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:17.480
out to see what they
can do, right.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.400
So I mean, there's a real
person involved

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.650
here in real distress.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.010
But whenever they've
done these kinds of

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:22.950
things, they adjusted--

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:26.600
And CBT is the most consistently
studied because

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:27.960
it's very organized.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.080
Psychotherapy, so many people
do so differently.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.120
It's very hard to study.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.760
And CBT is time-limited.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.560
So that approach seems more
practical in some senses to

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.140
people's minds.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.560
So most of the research on
behavioral therapy is focused

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.940
on CBT, but not exclusively.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.090
But people never been able to
show that these things matter.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.910
Maybe there is something about
the bedside manner so to

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:52.750
speak, of the clinitioner or the
person who talks with you.

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.150
But that's never been extracted
rigorously.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.190
And then the other approach of
course is many different kinds

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:01.280
of medications that you read
about or hear about or

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.920
experience all the time.

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:07.560
It turned out, let me just say
it were, to be extraordinarily

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.560
hard to develop medications
for psychiatric diseases.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.170
There's been a number that
have mostly been

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.880
discovered by accident.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.260
Most of these were medications
developed for something else,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:17.920
they kind of stumbled
on as useful

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.810
for psychiatric disorders.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.990
In the last 20 years as people
have developed drugs more

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:25.510
systematically, it's been
brutally hard to develop drugs

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.640
for psychiatric disorders.

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.330
There's hardly been any major
new ones in the last 10 years.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.970
And many pharmaceutical
companies are now abandoning

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.580
their current research programs
because they just

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:38.380
don't feel they're making
any traction on it.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.840
So it's been really,
really hard.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:44.000
I mean the mind and brain
is just so complicated.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.650
And so you get all kinds of
partly political debates about

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:48.810
people who are concerned about
what's right for children.

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:50.940
Are we giving kids
too many drugs?

00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.140
Of course, you're never
going to have a

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.570
scientific answer to that.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:56.120
Some kids probably get
too many drugs.

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.230
Some kids probably
don't get enough.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.530
We'll come back and
talk about ADHD.

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:06.800
So let's people let's pick for
a moment one disorder.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.740
And then we'll pick OCD,
obsessive compulsive disorder.

00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:14.060
So it's a kind of an anxiety
disorder that features

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.010
obsessions, recurrent
unwanted thoughts.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.660
People are drawn to patterns
of thought that they don't

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.620
want to over and over again.

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.290
So the obsessions are mental
patterns of thought.

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.780
The compulsions are physical
repetitive behaviors, like

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:27.530
endless hand-washing, counting,

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.380
checking, and cleaning.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:32.190
Done with such intensity and
ferocity that the person's

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:33.730
really trapped by these.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:38.060
So let me show you one example
of an individual patient

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:41.070
describing her experience.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.620
So the thing with these
disorders is we sometimes say

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.610
somebody's a little OCD because
they like to be extra

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:53.060
careful to brush their teeth
four times a day.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:54.590
But in these cases, these

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.120
individuals are really trapped.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.150
I mean they have a hard time
leaving their house, a hard

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:01.900
time functioning socially,
hard time getting jobs.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.960
So people wonder, what's the
most helpful treatment?

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.350
And here's a example of a study
looking at how many

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:11.170
symptoms you have with OCD.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.650
And these are individuals who
get, in blue, placebo.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.920
So it's good to be low.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.350
In green, a medication that's
used for the disorder.

00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:21.860
And then these colors are
getting behavioral treatment,

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:23.480
or behavioral treatment
plus medication.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.760
So at least in this context
for example, behavioral

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:30.705
treatment is more effective by
itself than the medication.

00:14:30.705 --> 00:14:33.970
It would be easy to tell you
oh, there's a rule for

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.200
different disorders, that it's
behavioral treatment or

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:36.810
medication.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.600
But it turns out on average,
it just vary considerably

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.250
depending on the medication,
depending on the particular

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.380
patients you see.

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.055
There's no real understanding
yet of which patient should

00:14:46.055 --> 00:14:49.430
get which treatment under
what circumstances.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.530
And here is some evidence
suggesting that if you get

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.790
medication only, this is the
percent who relapsed.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.050
So a concern is there's active
treatment phase .

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.240
And how many people slide back
into the difficulty,

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.450
medication-only.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:03.350
About half the people are
relapsing about a year later.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.660
But if they get this sort of
behavioral treatment, there

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.000
sort of seems to be more
sustained benefits.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.060
So people are thinking that
might be important.

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:15.850
And then people wonder, if we
treat your mind by behavioral

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:19.780
therapy, if we treat your brain
by drugs, now we're

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.210
going to reject that
distinction.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.690
OK.

00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:24.970
When I talk to you, if you
happen to remember anything I

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.440
say, I'm changing your brain.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.220
OK.

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.170
Talk, or experience, or
thoughts, or imagination

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.180
change your brain as
much as any medical

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:35.190
substance does, right.

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.130
So it's a wrong way to think,
like the drugs change the

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.070
brain and the talk
changes the mind.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.280
To change your mind is
to change your brain.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:44.760
So but any case, you could ask
whether these forms of

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.090
treatment, in what ways are they
similar or dissimilar?

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.780
So here's PET scans of
patients with OCD

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:51.350
pre and post treatment.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.180
And you can see that there's
sort of activation in the

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.030
basal ganglia in the caudate
that looks pretty similar

00:15:58.030 --> 00:16:01.580
across the treatments, as if
both treatments were working

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:05.470
on that over activation
of the basal ganglia.

00:16:05.470 --> 00:16:08.770
On the other hand, here's
looking at CBT and drug

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.550
treatment for depression.

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.830
And you can see these pictures
with these blue areas, and

00:16:12.830 --> 00:16:16.000
these with these red areas, the
brain changes in response

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.420
to treatment, look
very different.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.240
So there's no simple answer
about whether behavioral

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:25.060
therapy and drug therapy change
the same or different

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.150
things to help people.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.450
Depends on the disorder,
depends on the drug.

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:31.510
And we just have a lot more
to learn about that.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:34.380
But both of those things affect
the brain and can be

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.250
effective to help people.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.720
So let's focus on depression
a little bit.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:41.070
These are people with depression
who feel fearful,

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.510
gloomy, helpless, hopeless
in an extreme way.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.450
So it's difficult to get out of
bed, difficult to do work,

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:48.800
relate to people.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.940
Literature, Hamlet's description
of how weary,

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:53.830
stale, flat, and unprofitable
seem to me all the uses of

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:56.390
this world, describes often what
people with depression

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.390
roughly describe their
experiences like.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.780
A typical episode,
it varies widely.

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.599
It's about 4 to 12 months
if untreated of intense

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.680
depression.

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:10.220
A pervasive dysphoria, just
sort of inability to feel

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.200
pleasure and intense
mental pain,

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:14.599
generalized loss of interest.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:18.089
It's estimated to sometimes
affected some 5% of the

00:17:18.089 --> 00:17:19.020
world's population.

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.300
That's a huge number
of individuals.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.180
Average age of onset is 30.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:28.390
But it goes across wide ages,
often unnoticed in children.

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:30.750
People are picking this up
more than they used to.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:32.740
They used to think there's a
thought that children can't

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.380
really be depressed.

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:36.310
It's hard to know why that
happened exactly.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:39.770
Psychiatric ideas are typically
developed in adults.

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.270
And it takes a while
for the field to

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.570
recognize them in children.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:46.200
But it's rare to have a first
depressive episode after 60.

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.815
It's rare to have gone your life
and then get depression

00:17:48.815 --> 00:17:51.360
in older age.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:54.480
Kind of mysteriously at the
moment, women have depression

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.040
at two or three times the rate
of men in the United States,

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:58.730
and pretty much throughout
the world at a two

00:17:58.730 --> 00:17:59.660
to threefold increase.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:01.470
That's a pretty big one.

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.690
We'll talk later about ADHD.

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:03.875
There the numbers
kind of reverse.

00:18:03.875 --> 00:18:08.130
It's 2 to 3 times more frequent
in boys than girls.

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.270
And about 70% of people who
will have one episode of

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.110
depression will have another
one later on.

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.720
So the diagnosis in the DSM book
requires at least three

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.020
of the following for a period.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.170
Now what I wanted to give you
a feeling if you think about

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.230
this, you know you are the
doctor talking to somebody.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:28.510
And you know, disturbed sleep,
but how disturbed

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:29.260
does it have to be?

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:31.770
Diminished appetite, but
how diminish, right?

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.590
Loss of energy?

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.850
Well, we all have periods where
we're more sluggish or

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:36.640
more focused, right?

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.590
I mean so usually depression,
these things are so extreme.

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:40.540
It's very obvious.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.070
Sometimes it's at the edge.

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.090
And there's a range
of these things.

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:45.830
We know there's a genetic
predisposition.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.950
If you have identical twins
50%, dizygotic 10%.

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:51.610
But we know there's
environmental factors.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:55.820
So it's very hard to figure
out whether diseases are

00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:58.700
getting more or less
common over time.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.760
Because especially in
psychiatric diseases, the

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:04.350
criteria that defines those
diseased change over time.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.725
So you don't know which it
is, sensitivity to it.

00:19:06.725 --> 00:19:08.420
You know, 30 years ago teachers

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.320
never heard of autism.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:13.850
Now every teacher in
kindergarten is watching out

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:14.900
for autism.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:17.470
So it's spotted much more
quickly and consistently.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:19.250
So people say it's going up.

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:20.280
Is it really going up?

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.230
Is it being detected
more often?

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:24.680
It's very hard to tell
those things apart.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.180
But where evidence is available,
since 1940 there's

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.980
nearly a 10-year drop in the
average age of the first

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.030
instance of depression.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:35.550
So is this 10-year drop that
people are getting better at

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.870
spotting it at adolescents,
instead of seeing an

00:19:37.870 --> 00:19:41.130
adolescent or child as simply
moody, they're recognizing

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:42.220
depression?

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.030
Or is the increased pressures
in childhood driving

00:19:46.030 --> 00:19:47.860
depression up at
an earlier age?

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.330
Very hard to tell.

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.320
So here's a video clip of some
patients describing their

00:19:55.320 --> 00:20:01.470
experience in depression

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:05.190
So people have been trying to
understand by experiments,

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:09.170
what are the thought patterns
that are promoting depression?

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.440
One approach has been
this dot probe test.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.650
We've talked about
that before.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:14.420
I'll remind you in a moment
what that is.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:19.130
But basically, it's to
experimentally test the idea

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:23.100
that there's a sort of cycle
of negative thought in

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:25.580
depression that reinforces
itself--

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:29.240
That you pay attention
to sad or bad things.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.820
The more you think about bad
things, the worse you feel.

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.570
The worse you feel, the more
you think about bad things.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.710
And this is sort of you know,
a downward spiral of

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:38.150
gloominess.

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:40.210
And another question that people
are very interested in

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:43.270
is, when you see these kind of
psychological mechanisms that

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.790
may contribute to depression,
are they there for somebody

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:49.600
who has never yet been
depressed, but it's a risk

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.660
factor for becoming depressed?

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:54.060
Or is it really a consequence
of the depression, right?

00:20:54.060 --> 00:20:57.530
If you pay more attention to sad
things is that a risk for

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.220
becoming depressed
first time ever?

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.960
Or is that already part
of the disease process

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.020
itself once its hit?

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:07.120
So here's a dot probe test.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.360
We talked about it before
in regards to aging.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.480
You see two pictures.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.480
A neutral one and a happy one.

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.730
They disappear.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.390
A dot appears behind
one or the other.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:18.820
And you push a button to
indicate which side it's on.

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.720
All you're doing is indicating
which side it's on.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:26.280
Or you might get another pair
of faces with a negative

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.470
expression and a neutral
expression.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:30.860
Beneath one of them, sometimes
it's a neutral,

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:31.890
sometime it's negative.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.310
A dot appears.

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.830
And then you can look at the
response times, how quickly

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:38.390
people responded to the
dot depending on

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.970
where the face was.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.260
And the idea is, the faster you
respond to a dot, the more

00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:48.640
your attention was drawn to
a positive, neutral, or a

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.580
negative face, right.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.830
Because if your attention is
sitting there already when the

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:53.960
dot appears, boom, you're
ready to go.

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.840
If your attention is somewhere
else, you'll

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.340
have a slower response.

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:59.440
And sure enough, in patients
with depression, specifically

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.010
for sad faces, they have
this bias response.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.400
They tend to respond quickly
when the dot appears where the

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.880
negative face just has been.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:12.460
So it's a way that there was
sort of the attention, even

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.720
for such a trivial thing is
drawn to the negative.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.290
It sits on the negative.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:19.680
And so now you can ask the
question, what about girls who

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:22.420
were born into families with
a history of depression?

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:27.090
So they're in a general way at
genetic risk for depression.

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.690
But they have never been
depressed themselves.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:32.730
So now we can ask the question,
does this mode of

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:36.200
thinking, of dwelling on the
negative is it apparent in

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.190
these girls even before they
ever have depression?

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:40.600
And not all of them will.

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.450
But you don't yet which ones
will and which ones won't.

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:47.060
And sure enough, if looking at
sad or happy faces, and here

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:50.600
it gets pretty opposite, for the
young girls who have a low

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.220
likelihood of having depression,
no family history,

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.850
they tend to dwell on
the happy faces.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.480
And for the girls who were
born in a family with

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.680
depression, they tend to dwell
on the negative faces.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.280
So you can see this mechanism
of focusing on the negative,

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.250
dwelling on the negative already
even before the child

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:12.040
has ever a episode
of depression.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.730
So just for a moment let's
discuss, does that mean it's

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:15.980
genetic or environmental?

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.280
Who are these girls who have
a high risk for getting

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.090
depression?

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.450
What does high mean?

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.820
Sorry to put you on the spot.

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.150
What does high mean?

00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:36.370
They're in a family where they
have a parent with depression.

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:37.010
OK.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:39.890
So you can't tell that maybe
having a parent with

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:42.430
depression ups the child's
focus on the negative.

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:44.400
Because they've had some
difficult things to deal with

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.570
in their family.

00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:48.320
Maybe they have genes that draw
them to negative things,

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.210
or maybe both.

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:50.930
You can't tell that apart from
these kinds of studies.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.190
Every once in while there's
sort of a success story in

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:00.140
brain sciences.

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:03.380
And why it's terribly important
is this, to this

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.300
day, as one of the speaker said,
there's people who think

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.455
psychiatric disorders are
just for sissies.

00:24:08.455 --> 00:24:10.090
That you just stop
being depressed.

00:24:10.090 --> 00:24:11.940
Just don't listen to those
voices, right.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:13.730
Just stop washing your hands.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.570
And what's very confusing about
this message is for

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:20.760
people for example, who are
addicted to substances or have

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:24.420
alcoholism, we ask them to stop
drinking and stop taking

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.900
drugs, with support.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:27.905
But we say it's, we think
it's somewhere in

00:24:27.905 --> 00:24:29.260
you to stop, right.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.810
So with the right support,
we think it's

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.280
somewhere in you to stop.

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:34.095
So it's kind of hard.

00:24:34.095 --> 00:24:35.180
Where is that line, right?

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.900
CBT is getting people to find
ways to think so they're not

00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:40.080
anxious or not depressed.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.490
Again, we think it's
in them with the

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:42.460
right kind of support.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:44.810
So on the one hand we ask
people to get themselves

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:46.520
healthier with support, right.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.540
So it's kind of tricky.

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.410
Where is the line of
responsibility?

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.710
But I think one of the triumphs
of modern brain

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:55.210
imaging is to make visible the
brain basis of psychiatric

00:24:55.210 --> 00:24:57.520
disorders on average.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.675
So because there's no broken
arm, no broken leg, no tumor

00:25:00.675 --> 00:25:02.730
or anything like that, right.

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.110
That promotes discussion,
or consideration, is our

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:08.500
psychiatric disorders real
brain differences?

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.830
And I can also tell you that
unfortunately, we're not

00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:14.860
anywhere near where a house
can put up a picture of

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.730
somebody's brain and say, oh,
this person's certainly has

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:21.870
depression, or schizophrenia,
or ADHD, or dyslexia, or any

00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:23.480
difficulty that you know of.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.110
Nobody can say that on the basis
of a single brain scan

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:27.150
for a single person.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:27.750
We want to.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.120
We're not there yet.

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:31.570
But we can see on average
differences between people who

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:34.010
have a diagnosis and
people who don't.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.380
So here's a PET, positron
emission tomography, top of

00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.960
the brain, bottom
of the brain.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.790
They found less activation in
this so called subgenual

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:42.650
anterior cingulate.

00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.110
The anterior cingulate is this
cortex that sits over the

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.450
corpus callosum.

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.540
And here in this bottom part
of the anterior cingulate,

00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:53.180
less activation in patients
with depression

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.590
than control subjects.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:58.870
And then, looking at structure
now, physical volume.

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:03.100
Also reduced volume in these
areas, in patients with both

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.540
unipolar and bipolar, in
this case, depression.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.050
So now we have both
a structural

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.340
difference on average.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.740
And a functional difference
on average.

00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:14.160
Sometimes in psychiatry there'd
be a brain banks.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.990
When patients passed
away, they'd donate

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:17.700
their brains to research.

00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:20.175
And people said, let's go look
in this area in people who

00:26:20.175 --> 00:26:23.060
have passed away so we can look
at the cellular level of

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:23.800
what's going on there.

00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.160
We can't see with brain imaging

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.440
anything close to cells.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.270
But with post-mortem
analysis we can.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.440
And there was a big surprise.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.870
The big surprise was when they
looked in this region, there

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:37.720
was a reduced number of cells,
which goes with the reduced

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.050
the volume, and the reduced
activation.

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:42.310
But it was in the neurons,
it was the glial.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.280
And you go glial?

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.840
We haven't talked about
glial for a long time.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.200
You know neurons are the stuff
that compute the mind.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.260
We all agree with that.

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:51.320
Glial are essential for
brain function.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.050
So we don't understand
what that means.

00:26:53.050 --> 00:26:55.350
That these patients would have
an equal number of neurons but

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:56.660
a reduced number of glial.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.240
We just don't know
what that means.

00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.340
But it was a big surprise.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:03.710
And over time I think maybe
we'll think about that.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.840
And furthermore, imaging
studies looking at the

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.300
anterior cingulate found that
if you looked at the

00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.340
pre-treatment activity in
this brain region--

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:12.440
I'll show another example
in a moment--

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:16.410
you could see not only changes
that occur with treatment, but

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.540
that differences predicted which
patients would benefit

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.710
more or less for treatment.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.480
So all these conversion areas
about the importance of the

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.840
anterior cingulate cortex in
depression although nobody

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.730
thinks that's the whole story.

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:32.230
That the anterior cingulate is
part of a network of areas

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:36.190
that are compromised
in depression.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.720
And another thing that I think
is sort of an exciting

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.210
direction is each dot here
is an individual person.

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.380
Here's how much they improved.

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.810
Better is down here.

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.270
This is the patients who
improved the most with

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:50.270
treatment, the least
with CBT treatment.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.850
And this is the initial
activation.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.560
So it's telling you maybe that
these are the patients who

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.490
really should get CBT.

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:57.910
And maybe these are
the patients who

00:27:57.910 --> 00:27:59.390
didn't respond so much.

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.910
And maybe they should get, by
the initial brain measure,

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:03.440
some other form of treatment.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.340
So that's I think an exciting
areas where we could develop

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:08.950
enough understanding of
diversity among patients to

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:11.370
understand which patient might
benefit for which treatment.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.050
But we're just at
the beginning of

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:15.580
that kind of knowledge.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:19.180
So what about treatments
for depression?

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.230
In 2005, that's some years ago
now, but there's an estimated

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.110
27 million people in the US.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:26.270
There's $10billion now
and more in sales.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:29.380
That's to drugs or CBT forms
of treatment of depression,

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.360
the most common forms
of treatment.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.770
Even with these treatments--

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:34.770
so here's the message.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.220
Everybody agrees I think and
reasonably, that if you know

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.570
somebody with depression, or
you're depressed yourself, or

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.800
anxiety, but we're talking about
depression, getting help

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.540
is a good idea.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.380
Many people get helped.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:47.100
But the help is not nearly
what we wish

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.150
it were in the field.

00:28:48.150 --> 00:28:50.590
So in depression, about
half of patients

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.270
don't achieve remission.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.790
They still are depressed
even after medicine

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:57.490
or behavioral treatment.

00:28:57.490 --> 00:28:59.720
And even among those who improve
a lot, there's still

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.820
residual symptoms.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.770
It's not as if patients
typically or often escape

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:04.870
entirely that.

00:29:04.870 --> 00:29:06.970
But they can improve a lot.

00:29:06.970 --> 00:29:09.130
But the other thing is since
nobody knows which approach to

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.110
take with which patient by any
scientific evidence, it's all

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.900
trial and error.

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:15.310
So finding a good
treatment for a

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:16.630
person could take months.

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:18.810
And by then some people just
give up and don't come back.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:20.810
Because in the throes of the
diseases, or they just figure

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.020
they're not going
to be helped.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.400
It's all hit and miss.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.760
I have a colleague in CSAIL
the computer science

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.660
department.

00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.180
And we're doing research
with her.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.230
And we say, you know, if you
go to a doctor now with

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.140
depression, or anxiety, or
social anxiety disorder, it's

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:37.600
almost completely random whether
they assign you to one

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.900
treatment or another within
some broad constraints.

00:29:40.900 --> 00:29:43.830
There's no scientific basis
for knowing what drug you

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:46.920
should get, or a drug plus
CBT, or CBT only.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.170
It's completely random.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:50.660
It's depending on the
physician's background and

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.660
intuitions.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:53.600
There's no scientific basis
for knowing that.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.510
So there's a lot to
be discovered.

00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:58.720
So sometimes people are trying
to say, well, let's compare

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:03.180
placebo treatments to a
medicine treatment, to

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.850
cognitive behavioral therapy.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:07.390
Here's responding to treatment,
improving.

00:30:07.390 --> 00:30:09.850
So better than placebo
or both drugs, about

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.530
eight weeks, and CBT.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.810
And then at 16 weeks there's
even more of a gain.

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:19.140
And they look very similar on
average across patients.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.860
And if you look over time now,
after the treatment is over,

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.750
at how many people sort of what
the long-term picture is

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:26.260
because you care about that.

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:28.850
I mean there's two things,
getting people out of crises

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:31.090
and then keeping your
head above water.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:33.770
It seems like the group that
maintains the best response

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:37.500
are the people who had the
CBT over longer periods.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:38.560
So you might say, well
why don't we just

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.120
give everybody CBT?

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.050
And part of it is not everybody
responds to that.

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:44.530
Some patients for example, with
severe depression are

00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:45.830
talking about suicide.

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:48.840
You don't feel like you can wait
8 weeks or 16 weeks to

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.760
let a CBT process happen.

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.340
Some patients just don't have
the energy to go to sessions

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:55.500
and work on things.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.460
And you need to rescue
them from that.

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.000
So there's all kinds of issues
about what kinds of treatment

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.215
ultimately are practical and
effective for patients.

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:10.120
So in clinical trials when
they try a drug.

00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.090
And I'll focus on drugs
for the moment.

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:13.520
There's a random assignment.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.870
Patients with the diagnosis are
assigned either to or a

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.870
placebo or a drug.

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.580
The physicians are not supposed
to know what it is.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:23.580
Response means just getting
better, which is valuable.

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.800
Remission means, that you don't
qualify for having the

00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.440
disease anymore.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.410
How people decide whether
you have depression?

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:32.400
They take a full history.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.220
But they'll often use some
sort of rating scale.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.550
One of the most common is a
Hamilton to say how severely

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:38.680
depressed are you.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.750
So they can document
it at beginning.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.120
Then give that to
you at the end.

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.470
And see how severely depressed
at the end.

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.880
So one thing to know that's
really interesting, and really

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.880
a problem from the field is
there's incredibly strong

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:51.060
placebo responses.

00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:56.920
In many studies the placebo
responses rival the response

00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.850
of the drug itself.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.160
And people have had huge debates
to this day about what

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.630
that means.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:02.880
And it's not well understood.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.120
Some people say nobody is
getting better, that the

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.920
entire thing is regression to
the mean from study entry.

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:13.810
And what does that mean?

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:16.570
Well when people have a drug
trials for depression, they

00:32:16.570 --> 00:32:19.490
say we want to treat people with
substantial depression.

00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:21.080
That makes sense, right?

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:24.130
So you get people who are
substantially depressed.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.640
Depression is inherently
a fluctuating disorder.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.360
So from your understanding of
regression to the mean, what

00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:33.280
happens to a patient when you
get them with a really bad

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.530
depression score?

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.560
What's likely to be
there score next

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.010
week, better or worse?

00:32:39.010 --> 00:32:40.800
Better.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:43.260
So you get people with really
low depression scores, you

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.150
just sit back, you don't
do anything.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.980
And because it's a fluctuating
disorder, the chances are that

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:51.340
because you're getting them at
low points in, they're going

00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:52.320
to get better next week.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:52.750
OK.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.390
That's not a treatment effect.

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:57.670
That's, you're getting at them
at a low moment by definition.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.310
So some people say, wow, these
studies could be full of that.

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.900
We say, wow, look at
this drug effect.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.900
Man, let's push it up.

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:04.240
Yeah, That's because you're
getting people

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.420
at their worst moment.

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.480
They're going to go back
to their average,

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.380
which will be better.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:12.670
Or another really interesting
thing is could our brains have

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:15.280
incredibly powerful responses
to placebos?

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:19.930
Do we have in us naturally
occurring healing mechanisms?

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.780
That if we just really
believe in it, than

00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:23.810
those can take over.

00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:24.945
And could we harness that?

00:33:24.945 --> 00:33:27.330
Could we harness these
naturally occurring

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.110
self-healing capacities in
people's minds and brains to

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:32.960
make themselves better?

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.000
So this is a kind of typical
average results.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.440
Drug, psychotherapy,
about the same.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.160
Placebo, pretty close.

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.650
And here's the no
treatment group.

00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:43.950
But even this, kind
of the picture has

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:45.120
been challenged recently.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.420
And let me tell you what the
challenges have been and then

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.730
let me tell you what I take
as the takeaway message.

00:33:50.730 --> 00:33:53.540
But it's not scientifically
certain.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.300
So one person did a
meta-analysis and

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.940
he's totally arguing--

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.700
and let me tell you, the
argument's pretty clever.

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.150
There's no effect of
a drug at all.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:05.010
That typically, you get
about 75% of a drug

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:06.020
effect from the placebo.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:06.620
That's huge.

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.250
75% from an inert substance,
sugar or something like that.

00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:11.060
OK.

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:14.610
75% in treating a severe
psychiatric disorder.

00:34:14.610 --> 00:34:16.820
And he says that that small
difference, that

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.300
25% is due to this.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.760
And who even thinks of this
until you read this, if you

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.889
haven't been involved in a
drug study, that apparent

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.820
differences are due to patients
realizing they have

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.449
the active drug from
the side effects.

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:27.670
OK.

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:30.020
So most studies give
you the drug.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:35.380
Most drugs that treat things
have unpleasant side effects.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.100
Because they're potent
things, OK, that

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.650
are perfectly targeted.

00:34:38.650 --> 00:34:40.340
So they're saying oh,
it's double blind.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.900
You tell this patient,
here's your pills.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.630
You don't know if they're
placebo or drug.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.310
And here's your pills.

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.929
You don't know if they're
placebo or drugs.

00:34:45.929 --> 00:34:47.440
But patient's are reasonably
smart.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.400
Many have been through
treatment before.

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:51.590
And they know if they're feeling
nauseous, and yucky,

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:54.570
and all kinds of other stuff,
they got the drug.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:57.210
And if they take it and they
don't feel anything funny,

00:34:57.210 --> 00:34:58.950
they got the sugar placebo.

00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:59.760
Does that make sense?

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.520
Because they figure out--

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.250
and 80% of the time they're
accurate, whether they got the

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:07.420
inert placebo or the drug.

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.050
Because this side effects tell
them that, not the drug effect

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.250
on the mind.

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:14.670
And that in the few studies
where they give you up a

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:17.110
placebo that has peripheral
effects, that make you

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:20.020
nauseous like the drug, then
in those couple of studies,

00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:22.130
there's just been a couple,
there's no difference between

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:23.370
placebo and drug.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:28.110
So here's a position that the
entire thing is placebo.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:30.660
And an argument from this guy
that we should tell patients,

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.100
it's all placebo.

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:34.470
Now why do you think that it's
not necessarily a good idea to

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:36.900
tell patients even if it were
scientifically true?

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.370
Yeah?

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:39.568
AUDIENCE: Because if you
tell them it's a

00:35:39.568 --> 00:35:40.196
placebo it could ruin--

00:35:40.196 --> 00:35:41.140
PROFESSOR JOHN GABRIELI: Yeah.

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:42.680
There's a pretty good chance
you've ruined it.

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.350
If you hand them the pills and
you go, look, who know.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:47.100
It's all sugar.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.880
But you know give it
a go for a person

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.810
who's in misery, right.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:52.380
So they have to kind
of believe.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:53.560
And it's kind of interesting.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.210
What is the biology
of that belief?

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:55.810
Right.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:58.070
So that's one side
of the story.

00:35:58.070 --> 00:36:01.050
Another slightly less drastic
interpretation, but also

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:05.106
pretty strong, is that in recent
meta-analysis is that

00:36:05.106 --> 00:36:08.930
the drug effect of a placebo
only occurs for the most

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:11.760
severe depressions, the most
severe depressions.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.870
And the Depression Center even
considered severe or moderate,

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:16.780
where you do want to help
people, there's no difference

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.670
between the placebo
and the drugs.

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:23.150
So my only fear in telling you
this is the last thing you

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.320
want to do if in your life, or
somebody you care about,

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.830
there's depression or anything
like that, get them help.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:28.700
Because there are helped.

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:30.840
And if it's placebo,
that's OK too.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:34.320
And if it's some unreputable
person without a degree but

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.350
they're really good at talking
to people, that's good too.

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:37.090
OK.

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:38.230
The evidence is overwhelming.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:41.130
That getting help helps
many people.

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:42.640
And not getting help
out people at

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:43.690
greater and greater risks.

00:36:43.690 --> 00:36:44.490
It's overwhelming.

00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:46.800
Getting help is a really
good thing.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.460
It's just that we don't
understand how the help works.

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:52.300
And we know it doesn't help
nearly powerfully enough on a

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:55.650
consistent basis.

00:36:55.650 --> 00:36:58.860
So now we're going to switch
from depression to ADHD, a

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:00.280
disease of childhood.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.980
These are children who have
inattention, hyperactive in

00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:07.000
80% of cases, impulsive, moving
around, and jumpy.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.500
The diagnosis, like everything,
is by exclusion.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.430
They make sure that there's not
some other problem in the

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.320
child's life that's making
them inattentive or

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:13.930
impossible.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:16.370
For example, like
abuse at home.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:19.570
Its prevalence is 2
million or more.

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:22.700
It's tripled since 1981,
increased 2.5 times since '90.

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:25.010
So sort of like the discussions
you hear now about

00:37:25.010 --> 00:37:29.660
autism, there was fantastic
debates about ADHD.

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.300
Does it exist at all?

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.750
Are people just medicating kids
to keep them lined up in

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:37.890
classrooms, quietly listening
to lectures like me?

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:39.730
Is there a real problem?

00:37:39.730 --> 00:37:41.420
And there's incredibly
polarized

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.170
debates about these things.

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.530
So how does the clinician
make the diagnosis?

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:48.140
They look at the child.

00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:50.340
They talk to parents,
teachers.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:51.580
And they sort of fill out

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.300
questionnaires and have a list.

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.820
And I'll show you the kind of
a list the clinician has to

00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:58.570
work against.

00:37:58.570 --> 00:38:00.520
Depending on studies, and this
is kind of an interesting

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:05.620
number, ranges from about
2% to about 15%.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.560
And you can say, well how could
it possibly do that?

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.330
Why can't researchers
get it right?

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:10.000
OK.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.180
You could take a 1/2 a percent
off, or two or whatever it is.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.670
And again, it depends
so much of your

00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:19.130
criteria for the diagnosis.

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.220
Part of it too is over time
these things change as you

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.480
have different versions
of DSM.

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:26.410
And I mentioned also countries,
professions,

00:38:26.410 --> 00:38:30.820
overnight in the same German
population doubled as DSM book

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.400
got revised and changed
its criteria.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.592
OK.

00:38:33.592 --> 00:38:35.160
Is this the correct criteria?

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.780
Are these the correct
criteria?

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.660
And how would you know if you
had the correct criteria?

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:40.440
How would you know if
you've got it right?

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.490
People just have to
have consensus as

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:43.550
best they can guess.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.050
Because there's no objective
evidence beyond reasonable

00:38:46.050 --> 00:38:47.310
interpretation.

00:38:47.310 --> 00:38:50.300
So about 3-5% of school
age children.

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.360
And the reason that people take
it seriously beyond these

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.640
conceptual debates is that
children with ADHD that is not

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.970
treated struggle a lot.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:04.580
To a huge variation of course,
but it predicts anti-social

00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.390
behavior, substance abuse,
adverse occupational social

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.780
adjustments.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.340
There are people with ADHD who
are phenomenally successful.

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.550
There's probably several of you
in the class who have been

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.020
diagnosed with that in
any group like this.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:18.170
So it's not the certain thing,
but on average if you don't

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:21.330
have other talents, and
situations, and support, it's

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:24.460
a big risk factor for doing
badly in life by the ways that

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:26.390
most people want to do well.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:29.200
The most common, but not the
only treatment, is a Ritalin

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.140
or methylphenidate.

00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.160
The Ritalin is the commercial
name, methylphedidate the

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.510
generic name.

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:35.080
We know there's a genetic
piece about this.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.640
You've heard it so many times.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.340
7 times higher rate within
families, about a 0.76

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.100
heritability in twin studies.

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.790
Some candidate genes have been
identified and involved in the

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:47.430
dopaminergic systems
of the brain.

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:49.890
But like with all
neuropsychiatric diseases, in

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:51.320
kind of a weak way.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.120
It's not like there's a
gene, if you have it,

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.000
you have the disorder.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.990
Is just a little higher on
average in populations.

00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.310
OK.

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:01.620
So here's the question,
a kid comes in to you.

00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.520
You're the doctor.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.650
And it's quite interesting to
talk to doctors about this.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:06.810
Because in many medical settings
with the current

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:10.550
economic environment, doctors
are incredibly encouraged, and

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.220
by for example, their salaries,
to see patients

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:14.800
really fast.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.110
The faster they see them, the
more the health systems says,

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:18.360
yeah, we're productive.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.160
So here's what they have
to decide, do you had

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:24.820
inattention?

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.810
Because inattention was one
of the big criteria.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:28.790
You have to have at least six
for at least six months to

00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:32.200
agree that it's maladaptive
and age inappropriate.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.350
Careless mistakes in school or
productivity, I'm sure none of

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:36.840
us ever make careless
mistakes, right.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.060
Difficulty sustaining attention
in tasks or play,

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:41.240
does not seem to listen when
spoken to directly, not follow

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.180
instructions to finish tasks,
difficult organizing tasks and

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:44.550
activities.

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:47.310
Avoids, listen to this one,
avoids tasks engaging

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:50.090
sustained mental effort, OK.

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:52.290
Loses things, easily distracted
by extraneous

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:54.080
stimuli, forgetful in
daily activities.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.710
What five-year-old is
not describable

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:57.870
in these ways, right?

00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:59.410
So you see how challenging
it is?

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:01.070
And it's not to take
it lightly.

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:03.380
Because the kids who really
meet this, really

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:04.210
struggle over time.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.320
There's been many longitudinal
studies.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.530
That on average, children who
meet these criteria will

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:12.310
struggle in many ways.

00:41:12.310 --> 00:41:13.260
But look at all of these.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.810
There's nothing here like
hearing a voice, right?

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:17.520
It's just like a kid.

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.970
But a little more of
it for your age.

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:24.610
Hyperactivity, you fidget
or squirm in your seat.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.050
You leave your seat
in the classroom.

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.290
You run about or climb
excessively.

00:41:28.290 --> 00:41:30.210
You have difficulty
playing quietly.

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:31.370
You talk excessively.

00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:33.350
Blurts out answers before
questions are completed.

00:41:33.350 --> 00:41:35.220
So these are kids who are
tough on teachers in

00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.470
classrooms.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.020
The symptoms have to be present
before the age of

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.650
seven, persistent in two or
more settings, at home and

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:46.650
school for example, typically.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:49.630
And then not because you don't
hear well, or because you have

00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:52.290
allergies, or you have other
psychiatric disorders.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:54.540
And sometimes people talk about
both, inattention and

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:56.730
hyperactivity, or the
combined type.

00:41:56.730 --> 00:42:00.510
There is a thought that the more
frequent finding in boys

00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:03.000
is because boys are more
frequently hyperactive.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.410
So they're trouble making
in a classroom.

00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:05.290
They're jumping up and down.

00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:06.610
They're not listening
to the teacher.

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:10.400
And the girls might be more on
average inattentive, quiet and

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.860
dreamy, not taking stuff in.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.900
That's not a problem for
classroom management.

00:42:13.900 --> 00:42:16.540
So there's a thought the girls
might be under diagnosed

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:21.120
because of the way it's
expressed in boys and girls.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.690
But there's a huge source
of evidence that if left

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.720
completely untreated, rates of
depression, anxiety, substance

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.820
abuse, academic failure, work
problems, family problems,

00:42:28.820 --> 00:42:31.265
emotional distress are much
higher in children where

00:42:31.265 --> 00:42:34.560
there's no attempt to treat
or manage ADHD.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.430
There's a huge amount of
evidence for this.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.790
So one of the sort of most
famous studies in

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:46.000
developmental psychiatry of
directly comparing individuals

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.570
on behavioral and
drug treatments.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:50.790
It was a study called
the MTA study.

00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:53.590
It was done in many different
sites all put together with a

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:57.150
huge number of children, 14
months, they got medication

00:42:57.150 --> 00:43:01.370
management alone, behavioral
treatment alone, a combination

00:43:01.370 --> 00:43:02.950
of both, or routine
community care.

00:43:02.950 --> 00:43:04.800
So they said, what happens
when we give you better

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.360
behavioral treatment, or more
careful medical management on

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.010
the drugs, or you go back to
your standard community care?

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.610
And what people found was
this, that medication

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.536
management alone--

00:43:16.536 --> 00:43:18.380
Here's what they did in
those conditions.

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.890
They saw a doctor monthly
for 30 minutes.

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:23.400
They would move the drugged
amount up or down.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:26.090
They would titrate it if it
seemed to be sedating the

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:27.460
child too much, they'd
make it less.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.570
If it was not working enough,
make it more.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:31.390
And they will talk a lot with
a child and the parent.

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:32.630
So that was the medication
management.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:34.820
More active than you typically
get people get at medical

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.950
interactions.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:39.110
Behavioral treatments involved
an 8-week summer camp, or you

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:40.560
got the two of them together.

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:43.610
Or you were sent back to your
community and got the regular

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:47.010
care from a regular doctor that
people typically get.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:50.450
So and the big outcomes were
that the best thing was to

00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:52.350
have the medical management
alone, or a

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:55.050
combination of the two.

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.850
And in some cases, you would get
lower doses of medications

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.280
if you got the behavioral
treatment.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.160
So you could say, and for many
years I heard lecturers who

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.530
were expert in this field
saying, the definitive thing

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.410
is the medication pretty
much does it all.

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:11.120
Maybe the behavioral treatment
had something, the behavioral

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.790
treatment by itself
didn't add much.

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:14.750
This was what everybody
was taught.

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:18.080
But they kept following
these people and

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:18.760
here's what they found.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:21.180
Eight years later after the
study was over, no difference

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.020
in which group you were in.

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:27.380
About 60% of kids stopped taking
medication, the family

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:29.640
decided to stop, or the doctor
decided to stop.

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.890
And there's no difference
between those who did or did

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:36.240
not stop taking medication, in
terms of difficulties in life.

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.320
So now this is very
complicated.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:40.450
Because people always say like,
what is the long-term

00:44:40.450 --> 00:44:42.020
effects of taking Ritalin
in children?

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.790
What is the long-term effects?

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:47.750
And you go well, you
could say the first

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:48.760
interpretation is this.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.740
Well, since it didn't make any
difference, the drug has no

00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.420
effect at all, right.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:54.890
You take the drug, you don't
take the drug, you have the

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:56.280
same outcome.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.660
14-months was something.

00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.780
But eight years, it
doesn't matter.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:02.480
But of course, who's more likely
to stop taking the

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:03.000
medication?

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.100
Kids who are doing better or
kids who are doing worse?

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:09.030
Who's more likely to
stop probably?

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:10.880
On average, kids who are
doing better, right.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.590
So maybe what you're really--
maybe no difference is some

00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:14.960
kids were improving
for other reasons.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:18.370
And so really, the kids who got
the medications caught up

00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:19.690
with them because of
the medications.

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:21.080
And you can't tell those
two things apart.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.030
So it's just incredibly hard
to know with certainty what

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:26.690
the right thing to do is
in any long-term view.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.300
Because you can control for
14-months what people do, if

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:30.810
they're willing to
let you do that.

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:32.090
But you can't control
it over years.

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:34.260
They go back to their own
complicated lives.

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:36.430
And sorting out what the
treatment did, versus the rest

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:37.990
of their life is really hard.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.060
So Charlie, if we could
do the VCR movie.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:44.110
Here's a example of a kid
with ADHD and some

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:45.360
discussion about that.

00:45:48.082 --> 00:45:50.300
You know, amazingly I can tell
you that even though they're

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:54.190
as good as it can do, there is
no behavioral test you can

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:57.830
give like this that's better
than 50/50 at separating an

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:00.310
ADHD child from other
children.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:02.390
So you could be part
of the story.

00:46:02.390 --> 00:46:04.960
But many, many, many children
will not be identified this

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.540
way even though they're having
real problems at

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:07.400
school and at home.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.020
I want to say two things
about the video game.

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:11.880
People, as they noted
here, sometimes ADHD

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:13.180
diagnoses are tough.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:16.570
Because when kids come into a
new situation, a doctor's

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:18.490
office, a new doctor,
an evaluation,

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:19.690
it gets their attention.

00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:23.090
And they look more
focused, OK.

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:25.430
And people have noticed that
kids with ADHD seem to do

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:28.750
quite well when they have an
entertaining video game, which

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:31.400
is easier to enjoy, right,
than most things.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.540
So they actually did the study
to ask how long does an ADHD

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:37.400
kid play a video game versus
a kid without ADHD.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.420
And when they're both playing
video games, still the ADHD

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.740
kid plays for less long.

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.330
So it's not that it
takes it away.

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:46.545
But it in many ways, obfuscates
the difference.

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:55.670
So one interesting question
is what is the right dose?

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:58.580
Because we said the treatments
where they titrated the dose,

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:00.980
where you went to a doctor
frequently and they said let's

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.220
push it up, let's push it
down, let's get the dose

00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.700
that's right for the child.

00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.010
What is that number?

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:09.660
So here's a paper all the
way back from 1977.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:13.030
Here's placebo, here's a small
dose, here's a large dose.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:14.690
And they measured three
different things.

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:17.670
They measured how well
you did in terms

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:19.330
of the teacher ratings.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:21.130
So a teacher say, how's
the kid doing?

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:23.160
That's the open bars, OK.

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.320
So the teacher said, here's
how the kid's doing.

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.690
They go, well, this
is even better.

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.880
And they go this is
even the best, OK.

00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.280
So the teachers are saying,
the more drug the better.

00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.460
Here's an objective measure of
learning performance by those

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:37.130
children, the same children.

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:39.320
Better, worse.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.820
So you see, we go back to the
ideas that came out of the

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:46.160
prefrontal lobotomies,
completely different topic.

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:48.550
Everybody pretty much in the
field agrees that these drugs

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:50.550
help these kids on
average, OK.

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:52.980
But think about the
complications of what the

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:54.290
right dose is.

00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:56.890
For the teacher, the biggest
dose is best.

00:47:56.890 --> 00:47:59.090
And why do you think that's
likely to be?

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:00.640
For the teacher doing classroom

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.610
management with the 30 kids?

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:04.275
Why does a big dose seem best?

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:07.370
Yeah?

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:09.438
AUDIENCE: Because they want
the kids to be really

00:48:09.438 --> 00:48:09.880
manageable.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:10.840
PROFESSOR JOHN GABRIELI:
Yes Yeah, yeah.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:11.810
You were going to say
the same thing.

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:12.070
Yeah.

00:48:12.070 --> 00:48:14.600
For them it's the kid is not
fidgeting, not jumping around,

00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:16.250
distracting the other kids.

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:19.690
So a slightly over-sedated
kid seems like a triumph.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:23.530
And it can be to a parent also,
like listening to me.

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:26.060
But objective learning measures,
this is optimal.

00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.310
And this is overdosing.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:29.580
So I think we'd all agree.

00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:31.220
This is the one that matters
most of all.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.830
But you can see, you don't
often have this kind of

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:35.220
measurement.

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.470
Often the doctor says, what
does a teacher think?

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:38.580
What does the parent think?

00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:41.160
And the kid will end up over
here because that's what seems

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:45.690
most correct to the eyes of the
teacher or the parent, the

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:48.170
biggest change in the
child's behavior.

00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:49.360
So for the last couple of
minutes I want to talk about

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.470
brain imaging in regards
to ADHD.

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:54.150
So we talked about the idea that
the cerebral cortex, you

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:57.330
have too much of it, too many
neurons and over connected.

00:48:57.330 --> 00:49:00.500
And that what it is to grow the
adult brain you have is to

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.340
eliminate neurons and synapses
that are not

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.670
functionally valuable.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:06.290
You're picking out
the most valuable

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:09.040
players of your neurons.

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.750
And so you can say there's a
peak age at which you go up

00:49:11.750 --> 00:49:12.420
and then you go down.

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.640
And you consider that peak to
be a sort of milestone of

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.840
development.

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:18.383
And you can see here in the
dorsal lateral prefrontal of

00:49:18.383 --> 00:49:20.410
the cortex, here's the
front of the brain.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:23.170
Here's the delay in
ADH children.

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:28.120
They take an average two years
longer to reach that peak than

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:30.290
do typically developing kids.

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:33.120
But there's no difference
at all in primary

00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.890
somatosensory cortex.

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:39.530
So you might imagine it on
systems that are the inputs of

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:41.320
sensory stimulation
from the world, an

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.580
ADHD child is typical.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.500
For parts of the brain that
regulate, like I'm not going

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.870
to pay attention to that or I'm
going to focus on this.

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:50.430
That's slower developing.

00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:53.060
And you could see how that might
lead to inattention or

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:54.790
easy distractability.

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:58.790
So a two-year delay in the
development on average of

00:49:58.790 --> 00:50:03.290
prefrontal cortex structure.

00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:04.600
I talked with you before,
and I'm just going to

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:05.290
remind you of this.

00:50:05.290 --> 00:50:09.390
That if we look at reward
systems, anticipation of a

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:12.580
reward coming up in a few
moments activates the nucleus

00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:14.170
accumbens in animals
and humans.

00:50:14.170 --> 00:50:16.880
This is in humans, anticipation
of a reward.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:22.830
And the same system that's
measured here goes on to the

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:25.220
medial prefrontal cortex.

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:28.590
And that system turns on when
you get the reward.

00:50:28.590 --> 00:50:30.000
So one thing anticipates.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.740
And one thing responds when
you get the reward.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:35.120
And there's been some slightly
divergent studies in ADHD.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:37.570
But one suggestion
one is this.

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:40.920
So here's the control subjects
anticipating the reward.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:44.800
Here's the ADHD individuals also
anticipating the reward

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.390
but not showing any
activation.

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:50.900
It's as if, now remember the
reward is this, you get a

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:53.520
signal that tells you in a few
moments if you push a button,

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.940
you're going to get $1.

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:58.460
This is not like study now, and
if you complete college,

00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.650
you get to go to
medical school.

00:50:59.650 --> 00:51:01.280
It's not delayed
gratification.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:05.776
It's anticipating reward coming
up in about 10 seconds.

00:51:05.776 --> 00:51:07.860
And at least in these
patients, it

00:51:07.860 --> 00:51:09.290
doesn't drive the system.

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:13.800
It's as if delayed gratification
were not having

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.760
any attraction with
these brains.

00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.570
On the other hand, then you find
out if you got it or not,

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:22.650
because sometimes they trick
you don't get it, orbital

00:51:22.650 --> 00:51:24.630
frontal response and
controls, and much

00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:25.890
more in ADHD patients.

00:51:25.890 --> 00:51:29.320
If this picture is true, or at
least true for some patients,

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:34.840
imagine the consequences of
anticipating reward, but being

00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:36.800
overly responsive to whether
you got it or not.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:38.650
You'd be stimulus
bound, right.

00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:40.620
You couldn't hold
yourself back.

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:44.640
It's not helping you develop
delayed gratification.

00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.600
And here's one more thing
that people ask,

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.970
which is if you have--

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:50.660
because now there's some
evidence about this-- if you

00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:54.730
give Ritalin for a while, does
it's slow the development of

00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:55.750
the cerebral cortex?

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:57.180
And I won't go into
the details here.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.100
But he answers is it does not.

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.700
So people are worried, like if
we keep giving Ritalin for

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:04.130
some more years are we affecting
brain structure?

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:05.560
And the evidence is clear.

00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.810
Objectives of it is
that it is not.

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.220
So I think a lot of people feel
like if the medication's

00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:12.470
helpful, there's very little
evidence there's

00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:14.070
harmful side effects.

00:52:14.070 --> 00:52:15.680
Weirdly enough, Ritalin--

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:17.220
and we'll come back to
this just in a --

00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:19.890
is one of the least problematic
medications in

00:52:19.890 --> 00:52:24.300
psychiatry, and frequently
helpful.

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:28.520
So the last FMRI study I want
to show you is this.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:31.285
Let's say you gave Ritalin not
only to children with ADHD who

00:52:31.285 --> 00:52:32.170
are taking it.

00:52:32.170 --> 00:52:35.410
But also typically developing
children who've never taken

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:38.790
Ritalin because they're
typically developing.

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:41.260
And how do their brains
respond to that?

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:45.480
So here's some ADHD children,
and children without ADHD.

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.750
And here's the tasks
they perform.

00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:51.680
Sometimes they push a button
every time a letter appears--

00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.670
they're having a whole bunch of
letters here, push, push,

00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:55.980
push, push.

00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:59.520
But they're told when an
X appears, don't push.

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:00.880
So you're tricking
the subjects.

00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.860
Because you're getting
a habit going.

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:03.910
What people call . prepotent
response.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:05.730
So it's push, push,
push, push.

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:08.840
Oops, hold yourself back, OK.

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.410
What people call no
go, don't go.

00:53:11.410 --> 00:53:13.170
And that's hard to
do for a kid.

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:15.770
It's harder to do for somebody
to do with ADHD, to control

00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:18.740
the impulse to push.

00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:20.110
And so you measure brain.

00:53:20.110 --> 00:53:21.540
And here's the behavior.

00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:22.860
And then let me tell
you the issue.

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.240
So here's the percent
of false alarms.

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.640
This is when you pushed for the
X, you should have held

00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.230
yourself back.

00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:32.840
Here's the control, here's the
ADHD children, making more

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.400
impulsive errors overall, harder
to control themselves

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:38.590
and stop themselves from pushing
for that X. When

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:42.480
they're off Ritalin they make
more mistakes when they're on.

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:47.090
But look at these kids who have
no ADHD and never took it

00:53:47.090 --> 00:53:49.300
because they have no
reason to take it.

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:50.060
They perform better.

00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:52.090
But look at the drug effect.

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:54.090
Just the same size.

00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:56.600
And this is not the only study
that has found that giving

00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:00.400
typical children Ritalin, will
make them perform better on

00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.590
cognitively demanding tasks.

00:54:02.590 --> 00:54:06.160
They are typically not done so
well by children as by adults.

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.910
So the psychiatrist we worked
with on the study said, wow,

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:12.110
we used to think that if we gave
somebody Ritalin and they

00:54:12.110 --> 00:54:15.080
behaved better, we knew we
gave the right treatment.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.390
But it's not clear that these
kids aren't behaving better.

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:18.540
OK.

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:19.470
They have no problem.

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:23.150
And there's no reason to give
them the medication.

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:25.700
And let me step through this.

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.230
If you look in the brains at
where the Ritalin's affecting

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:31.490
things, and lots of the brain,
the control subjects, and ADHD

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:33.240
children look alike.

00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.260
The only part of their brain
that looks really different is

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:37.240
in the basal ganglia, part of
their brain that's involving

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:40.320
in habits and impulse
controls.

00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:44.640
Also implicated in OCD that
we talked about before.

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:47.280
It's an area that's full of
dopaminergic systems.

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:50.090
It's an area that Ritalin
binds to.

00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:53.220
When you look inside the brain
in animals, and here what was

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:53.860
found was this.

00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:56.010
So this is a behavioral
difference you saw before.

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:58.690
So if you look in the basal
ganglia, here's the controlled

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:02.930
children off the medication,
and then on the medication.

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:05.470
Here's the ADHD showing this
opposite response.

00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:08.360
So here's the only place where
the responses are different

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.560
between the controlled children

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:11.050
and the ADHD children.

00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:13.470
And you can see in a way the
medication is so-called

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:14.680
normalizing the activation.

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:19.540
So here's typical kids just
being themselves, no Ritalin.

00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:22.270
Here's children with
ADHD not treated.

00:55:22.270 --> 00:55:23.000
And now you can see.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.350
Now look how similar they
get with the treatment.

00:55:25.350 --> 00:55:26.010
OK.

00:55:26.010 --> 00:55:28.730
So in this part of the brain,
and its opposite effect when

00:55:28.730 --> 00:55:31.420
the typical children get the
drug, the activation go down,

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:32.550
the ADHD children, it goes up.

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:34.820
So this part of the brain seems
like it's an important

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:35.850
part of the story.

00:55:35.850 --> 00:55:38.600
And also of how the medication
influences somebody.

00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.280
So last thing I want to talk
about for two minutes

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:46.050
including the chapter in this,
or three minutes is the

00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:49.040
struggle that people have of,
what's the boundary between

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:52.220
treating an outright
disease and

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:53.810
manipulating normal variation?

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:57.310
So for example, here's the
average height in the US of

00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:58.850
men and women.

00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:03.560
Huge debate about whether people
who are on a very sort

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:06.910
of, are projected to have
a very short stature in

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:10.380
adulthood, should they get
growth hormone or not?

00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:12.330
One argument is no, why
even think about it?

00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:15.280
Some parents will feel like,
my kid might struggle.

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.460
Give the kid a break.

00:56:16.460 --> 00:56:17.570
You can do something about it.

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:20.680
You don't have to do that.

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:22.130
How about sadness
and depression?

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:25.965
If you're somewhat sad,
should they get CBT?

00:56:25.965 --> 00:56:28.270
Or do they have to be
and dark depression?

00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:31.530
Where's the boundary between
shyness and social anxiety?

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:34.110
Or a kid doesn't follow
directions, when do you say

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:37.060
that's a kid not paying
attention to ADHD?

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:41.300
So one of the big surprises
has been that when people

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:43.710
have--and you guys can
tell me in a moment.

00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:45.260
When people pole things,
you never know how

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.070
accurate these are.

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:50.460
In some polls 7% of university
students without ADHD say they

00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:52.890
take methylphenidate to help
them focus and concentrate on

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:54.020
their studies.

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:57.360
And even more disturbing to
scientists, in one study in

00:56:57.360 --> 00:57:01.340
nature, 20% percent of
scientists said they do it.

00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:05.140
So I'm not asking you
to turn yourself in.

00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:07.690
But this is my little poll of
undergraduates in the world

00:57:07.690 --> 00:57:10.460
out there, because that's what
I read in the magazines.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:15.260
So is there moderately
widespread use of it by people

00:57:15.260 --> 00:57:19.445
who are not prescribed
directly themselves?

00:57:19.445 --> 00:57:20.695
Or is it pretty rare?

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.870
Rare?

00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:33.660
It could be rare, you know.

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:34.910
OK.

00:57:36.550 --> 00:57:37.680
And then what is the
right thing?

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:41.440
Where in all this will people
debate about this?

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:43.180
I think there's no debate that
for people who are really

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:44.670
suffering, you want
to help them.

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:47.790
But where should the line be
drawn between you know,

00:57:47.790 --> 00:57:52.250
helping those in despair and
boosting those in the middle.

00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:54.230
So last example I want to give
you just for a minute is this

00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:58.960
chapter from a man who mistook
his wife for a hat.

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:01.630
Because of this question about
boosting experience.

00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:04.150
So this is a woman of
90, Natasha Kay.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:05.180
She comes to the clinic.

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:08.220
And after her 88th birthday
she began to change.

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.045
She felt thrilled.

00:58:09.045 --> 00:58:11.110
She was extremely well.

00:58:11.110 --> 00:58:14.030
People said see had changed from
being shy to flirtatious,

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:16.720
giggling, telling
jokes at age 88.

00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.730
She had this huge
transformation.

00:58:18.730 --> 00:58:21.240
It turns out she has
syphilis, what she

00:58:21.240 --> 00:58:23.340
calls cupid's disease.

00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:26.160
But she's quite enjoying the
change in personality.

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.760
She's disinhibited and having
a good time, OK.

00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.410
It's like the small bit of
alcohol that loosens you up

00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:35.340
but all the time without any
of the downside, right.

00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:36.820
And then they said well,
should we treat it?

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:39.750
Because she got the disease at
an age when penicillin was not

00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:40.870
widely given.

00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:44.100
And they discover happily that
if they treat the penicillin

00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:45.610
it protects her medically.

00:58:45.610 --> 00:58:48.250
But because the brain changed
from the neurosyphilis has

00:58:48.250 --> 00:58:52.080
occurred, she remains very
happy all the time.

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.790
So you know, if somebody could
give you a drug that could

00:58:55.790 --> 00:59:01.760
make you very happy all the
time, bad idea, good idea?

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.030
Anyway, so you could
think about it.

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:04.280
Thanks very much.
