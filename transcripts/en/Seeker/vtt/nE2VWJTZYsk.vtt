00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:07.490
This just in - airplanes are disgusting, disease-ridden
sesspools ready to infect you and everyone

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.680
you love at a moment's notice.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:16.119
Have a great trip!

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.210
Hey guys Tara here for Dnews - and if you're
gonna be doing some summer traveling soon

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.169
- then it's worth reminding yourself how gross
airplanes actually are.

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.919
A new study from Auburn University finds that
microbes can live up to 8 days inside an airplane,

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.750
just long enough to infect you and ruin your
entire vacation.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.600
A team of researchers sterilized 6 different
surfaces on the inside of an airplane - and

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.679
then purposefully infected them with a host
of microbes, ranging from E coli to MRSA,

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:48.850
the antibiotic-resistant staph infection that's
estimated to occur in around 1-2% of US citizens.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.050
Their goal was to see how long these microbes
could survive in an airplane cabin, where

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.109
they're most likely to proliferate, and what
the chances are of them actually infecting

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:58.109
someone.

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.429
Turns out - there are a few different places
bacteria love to thrive - and the worst one

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.059
is the airplane seat pocket.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.460
MRSA was especially attracted to this area,
surviving up to 168 hours - or around 8 days.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.270
E. coli, on the other hand, tends to thrive
in the rubber armrest, and was able to survive

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.549
up to 4 days there.

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.439
The 4 other germiest areas of the cabin were
leather seats, plastic window shades, plastic

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.909
tray tables, and toilet handles.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.890
Despite what you might think, though - the
dirtiest places aren't always the most likely

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.590
to transmit infections.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.380
The researchers in this study found that the
most porous surfaces - like the rubber arm

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.369
rests - do harbor the longest-living bacteria,
but also have a lower risk of infection because

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.909
the microbes tend to bury themselves deep
into the pores of the material.

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.200
On the flipside, non-porous surfaces - like
the toilet handle - hold fewer microbes with

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.640
shorter lifespans, but they're way more likely
to infect you than a place like the seat pocket.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.170
Other studies on airplane germs have come
up with some interesting conclusions.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.549
A 2007 study found that 60% of airplane tray
tables, tested positive for MRSA.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.710
Other experts caution against staying in aisle
seats - since they come into contact with

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.860
more people, and are thus more likely to transmit
infectious microbes.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.530
Obviously keeping yourself hydrated is important
too, since the low humidity on board can lower

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.030
our natural defense system.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.390
But the overwhelming consensus, across all
studies, is to avoid the airplane restrooms

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.540
at all costs.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.849
You may remember a while back, there were
several cases of fecal bacteria discovered

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.400
in the water supply of airplanes.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.650
As a result, the EPA passed the Aircraft Drinking
Water Rule which ensures safe and reliable

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.909
drinking water for passengers and crew.

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.010
But germs like E Coli can still survive in
airplane sinks, as long as people who are

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.150
infected with it, are washing their hands.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.170
And you know that tiny airplane soap isn't
gonna get rid of that stuff.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.940
Now obviously, the ideal solution would be
for airlines to adopt the same sanitation

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.599
strategies as places like hospitals, which
use peroxide vapors and UV light to disinfect.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.209
But until that happens - if you're really
concerned about getting sick - your best option

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.780
is to avoid the bathroom altogether.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.159
And if you MUST use it - wash your hands thoroughly,
and then douse yourself in hand sanitizer

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.159
afterwards.

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.270
Maybe not your whole body, but at least your
hands.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.680
Hopefully this hasn't scared you out of traveling
this holiday weekend - but to be honest, I

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.750
kind of hope it has.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.340
I'm gonna be traveling myself, and I wouldn't
hate having an empty seat next to me.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.670
You know, for hygiene purposes.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.260

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.900
