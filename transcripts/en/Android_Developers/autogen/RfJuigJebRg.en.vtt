now I want to show you some of the new

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:31.429
now I want to show you some of the new
 

00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:33.429
now I want to show you some of the new
application patterns that we've created

00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:33.439
application patterns that we've created
 

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:36.119
application patterns that we've created
as part of the honeycomb UI framework

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:36.129
as part of the honeycomb UI framework
 

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:39.129
as part of the honeycomb UI framework
but before I do that let me just point

00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:39.139
but before I do that let me just point
 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:40.540
but before I do that let me just point
out the fact that we've spent a

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.550
out the fact that we've spent a
 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.389
out the fact that we've spent a
significant amount of effort making sure

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:43.399
significant amount of effort making sure
 

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:45.879
significant amount of effort making sure
that existing Android applications run

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:45.889
that existing Android applications run
 

00:07:45.889 --> 00:07:49.179
that existing Android applications run
really well on tablets in fact an app

00:07:49.179 --> 00:07:49.189
really well on tablets in fact an app
 

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:51.159
really well on tablets in fact an app
that's been designed with our

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:51.169
that's been designed with our
 

00:07:51.169 --> 00:07:53.529
that's been designed with our
recommended development guidelines is

00:07:53.529 --> 00:07:53.539
recommended development guidelines is
 

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:55.329
recommended development guidelines is
going to work without any modifications

00:07:55.329 --> 00:07:55.339
going to work without any modifications
 

00:07:55.339 --> 00:07:57.699
going to work without any modifications
and one really well on Android and I

00:07:57.699 --> 00:07:57.709
and one really well on Android and I
 

00:07:57.709 --> 00:07:59.619
and one really well on Android and I
want to show you an example in fact one

00:07:59.619 --> 00:07:59.629
want to show you an example in fact one
 

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:02.019
want to show you an example in fact one
of my all-time favorite games which is

00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:02.029
of my all-time favorite games which is
 

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:05.049
of my all-time favorite games which is
of course fruit ninja so because I was

00:08:05.049 --> 00:08:05.059
of course fruit ninja so because I was
 

00:08:05.059 --> 00:08:06.759
of course fruit ninja so because I was
playing this earlier I'm gonna see that

00:08:06.759 --> 00:08:06.769
playing this earlier I'm gonna see that
 

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:08.439
playing this earlier I'm gonna see that
it's actually showing up here in my

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:08.449
it's actually showing up here in my
 

00:08:08.449 --> 00:08:11.709
it's actually showing up here in my
recents by touching the multitasking

00:08:11.709 --> 00:08:11.719
recents by touching the multitasking
 

00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:13.239
recents by touching the multitasking
button so I'm gonna go into fruit ninja

00:08:13.239 --> 00:08:13.249
button so I'm gonna go into fruit ninja
 

00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:16.359
button so I'm gonna go into fruit ninja
and I'll play this for a little bit now

00:08:16.359 --> 00:08:16.369
and I'll play this for a little bit now
 

00:08:16.369 --> 00:08:18.069
and I'll play this for a little bit now
this is a completely unmodified version

00:08:18.069 --> 00:08:18.079
this is a completely unmodified version
 

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:20.079
this is a completely unmodified version
of fruit ninja in fact what's available

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:20.089
of fruit ninja in fact what's available
 

00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:23.139
of fruit ninja in fact what's available
in android market today before it was

00:08:23.139 --> 00:08:23.149
in android market today before it was
 

00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:25.419
in android market today before it was
built before honeycomb even existed and

00:08:25.419 --> 00:08:25.429
built before honeycomb even existed and
 

00:08:25.429 --> 00:08:27.779
built before honeycomb even existed and
it works amazingly well it even supports

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:27.789
it works amazingly well it even supports
 

00:08:27.789 --> 00:08:31.119
it works amazingly well it even supports
multi fingered multi handed gestures if

00:08:31.119 --> 00:08:31.129
multi fingered multi handed gestures if
 

00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:33.279
multi fingered multi handed gestures if
you want you can probably also tell that

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:33.289
you want you can probably also tell that
 

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.589
you want you can probably also tell that
I am really good or getting really good

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599
I am really good or getting really good
 

00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.899
I am really good or getting really good
with this but I'll pause that for a

00:08:37.899 --> 00:08:37.909
with this but I'll pause that for a
 

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:42.670
with this but I'll pause that for a
second so it works really well even

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:42.680
second so it works really well even
 

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.079
second so it works really well even
though it was built before honeycomb

00:08:44.079 --> 00:08:44.089
though it was built before honeycomb
 

00:08:44.089 --> 00:08:47.590
though it was built before honeycomb
even existed as I said now of course we

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600
even existed as I said now of course we
 

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.929
even existed as I said now of course we
want to encourage application developers

00:08:49.929 --> 00:08:49.939
want to encourage application developers
 

00:08:49.939 --> 00:08:52.780
want to encourage application developers
to build tablet optimized experiences

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:52.790
to build tablet optimized experiences
 

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:54.700
to build tablet optimized experiences
for the applications and to do that

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:54.710
for the applications and to do that
 

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:56.530
for the applications and to do that
we've added a lot of really cool new

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:56.540
we've added a lot of really cool new
 

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.020
we've added a lot of really cool new
things to the honeycomb application

00:08:59.020 --> 00:08:59.030
things to the honeycomb application
 

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.450
things to the honeycomb application
framework one of these things is what we

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:01.460
framework one of these things is what we
 

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:04.180
framework one of these things is what we
call an application fragment and I want

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:04.190
call an application fragment and I want
 

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.430
call an application fragment and I want
to show you what that is inside of Gmail

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:06.440
to show you what that is inside of Gmail
 

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.760
to show you what that is inside of Gmail
so let me open Gmail over here so we

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:09.770
so let me open Gmail over here so we
 

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.520
so let me open Gmail over here so we
we're in landscape mode and in landscape

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:12.530
we're in landscape mode and in landscape
 

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.710
we're in landscape mode and in landscape
mode you're gonna see two panes the left

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720
mode you're gonna see two panes the left
 

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.530
mode you're gonna see two panes the left
folder view and then my inbox on the

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:17.540
folder view and then my inbox on the
 

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.950
folder view and then my inbox on the
right now watch what happens when I

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:19.960
right now watch what happens when I
 

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.180
right now watch what happens when I
click on a message when I tap on a

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:22.190
click on a message when I tap on a
 

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.240
click on a message when I tap on a
message you see that the leftmost pane

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:25.250
message you see that the leftmost pane
 

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.630
message you see that the leftmost pane
slid out to make room for another pane

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640
slid out to make room for another pane
 

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:31.480
slid out to make room for another pane
the message that then slides into the

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:31.490
the message that then slides into the
 

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:32.860
the message that then slides into the
same place and if I click on the inbox

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:32.870
same place and if I click on the inbox
 

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.950
same place and if I click on the inbox
you see that the side the leftmost panel

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:35.960
you see that the side the leftmost panel
 

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.070
you see that the side the leftmost panel
or pane slides back in these panes are

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:39.080
or pane slides back in these panes are
 

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.530
or pane slides back in these panes are
what we call application fragments and a

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:41.540
what we call application fragments and a
 

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.720
what we call application fragments and a
fragment is something that a developer

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:43.730
fragment is something that a developer
 

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.790
fragment is something that a developer
can use to encapsulate specific

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800
can use to encapsulate specific
 

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.890
can use to encapsulate specific
application functionality and then reuse

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:47.900
application functionality and then reuse
 

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.230
application functionality and then reuse
that throughout the application so for

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:50.240
that throughout the application so for
 

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.910
that throughout the application so for
example if I flip this tablet into a

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920
example if I flip this tablet into a
 

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.460
example if I flip this tablet into a
portrait mode I may want and probably

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:54.470
portrait mode I may want and probably
 

00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.140
portrait mode I may want and probably
will want to recombine how these

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:56.150
will want to recombine how these
 

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.560
will want to recombine how these
fragments are laid out and eventually

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:58.570
fragments are laid out and eventually
 

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:01.150
fragments are laid out and eventually
fragments are going to be useful so that

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160
fragments are going to be useful so that
 

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.860
fragments are going to be useful so that
you can have completely reusable

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:02.870
you can have completely reusable
 

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.800
you can have completely reusable
functionality between the phone and the

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:05.810
functionality between the phone and the
 

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:08.170
functionality between the phone and the
tablet version of your application so

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:08.180
tablet version of your application so
 

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.620
tablet version of your application so
that's coming in the future another

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:11.630
that's coming in the future another
 

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.130
that's coming in the future another
really cool action is being able to pick

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:15.140
really cool action is being able to pick
 

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:19.060
really cool action is being able to pick
up and then drag a message for example

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:19.070
up and then drag a message for example
 

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:22.090
up and then drag a message for example
into a folder and this is something that

00:10:22.090 --> 00:10:22.100
into a folder and this is something that
 

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.060
into a folder and this is something that
has been built not as part of Gmail but

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:25.070
has been built not as part of Gmail but
 

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.340
has been built not as part of Gmail but
part of the application framework we

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:27.350
part of the application framework we
 

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:28.960
part of the application framework we
have an incredibly full-featured

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:28.970
have an incredibly full-featured
 

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.200
have an incredibly full-featured
dragging manager that allows you to

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.210
dragging manager that allows you to
 

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.200
dragging manager that allows you to
create and manage sort of these dragging

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:35.210
create and manage sort of these dragging
 

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.520
create and manage sort of these dragging
interactions there's a lot more coming

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:36.530
interactions there's a lot more coming
 

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.560
interactions there's a lot more coming
there and then one last thing that I

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:38.570
there and then one last thing that I
 

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.990
there and then one last thing that I
wanted to show is across the top here is

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000
wanted to show is across the top here is
 

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.090
wanted to show is across the top here is
the application bar the application bar

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:43.100
the application bar the application bar
 

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.280
the application bar the application bar
is another application pattern that can

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:45.290
is another application pattern that can
 

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.710
is another application pattern that can
be packaged into a fragment and in this

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:47.720
be packaged into a fragment and in this
 

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.590
be packaged into a fragment and in this
case it contains it's showing global

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600
case it contains it's showing global
 

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.960
case it contains it's showing global
actions so I have search I have compose

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:52.970
actions so I have search I have compose
 

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.660
actions so I have search I have compose
and a few other things but if I select a

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:55.670
and a few other things but if I select a
 

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.880
and a few other things but if I select a
few messages you'll see that that

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:57.890
few messages you'll see that that
 

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:00.010
few messages you'll see that that
application bar now changes to contain

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.020
application bar now changes to contain
 

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.900
application bar now changes to contain
actions that are specific to the

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:01.910
actions that are specific to the
 

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.680
actions that are specific to the
selected items in this case archive Star

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:04.690
selected items in this case archive Star
 

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.580
selected items in this case archive Star
label etc

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:06.590
label etc
 

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:09.280
label etc
so this is another example of the really

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:09.290
so this is another example of the really
 

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.590
so this is another example of the really
modular development that we've built as

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600
modular development that we've built as
 

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.330
modular development that we've built as
part of the honeycomb application

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:13.340
part of the honeycomb application
 

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.660
part of the honeycomb application
framework go back to the home screen now

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:16.670
framework go back to the home screen now
 

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.380
