00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:02.556
- [Voiceover] In the last
video we were talking about

00:00:02.556 --> 00:00:05.047
the era of reconstruction

00:00:05.047 --> 00:00:07.517
and how after the Civil War

00:00:07.517 --> 00:00:12.038
when the 13th Amendment to the
Constitution outlawed slavery

00:00:12.038 --> 00:00:16.188
many Southern states enacted
laws known as black codes,

00:00:16.188 --> 00:00:18.786
which in many cases were really just

00:00:18.786 --> 00:00:20.446
slavery by another name.

00:00:20.446 --> 00:00:23.511
They prevented African
Americans from voting,

00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:25.389
from owning firearms,

00:00:25.389 --> 00:00:28.083
from not being in some
kind of labor contract,

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:31.200
or they might be enslaved
or jailed for vagrancy

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.044
and the North, controlled
by a republican Congress,

00:00:35.044 --> 00:00:37.368
was outraged by these codes

00:00:37.368 --> 00:00:40.982
having just fought an
incredibly destructive war

00:00:40.982 --> 00:00:42.145
to end slavery.

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:43.971
In response to the black codes,

00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:47.904
Congress passed the 14th
Amendment to the Constitution

00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:49.987
and the 14th Amendment...

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:54.341
guaranteed that anyone
born in the United States,

00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:57.943
regardless of previous
condition of servitude,

00:00:57.943 --> 00:00:59.693
had full citizenship,

00:01:00.714 --> 00:01:03.051
meaning they're entitled to all the rights

00:01:03.051 --> 00:01:05.490
and privileges of being a citizen,

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.683
and equal protection under the law.

00:01:08.683 --> 00:01:11.433
So a law could not target someone

00:01:12.336 --> 00:01:14.586
on the basis of their race.

00:01:17.074 --> 00:01:19.552
Now to enforce the 14th Amendment,

00:01:19.552 --> 00:01:24.290
Congress sent federal troops
to the states in the South,

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.457
divided the Southern region
up into military zones

00:01:29.603 --> 00:01:34.047
and said that the South would
be occupied by federal troops

00:01:34.047 --> 00:01:37.610
until the states rewrote
their constitutions

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.445
to recognize the 14th Amendment,

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:44.302
in effect to give equal
citizenship to African Americans.

00:01:44.302 --> 00:01:47.885
In fact they also passed
the 15th Amendment

00:01:48.747 --> 00:01:50.747
two years later in 1870,

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:54.846
which said voting rights

00:01:56.256 --> 00:01:59.839
are included among
these citizenship rights

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.842
guaranteed in the 14th Amendment.

00:02:03.842 --> 00:02:06.371
I should mention that these voting rights

00:02:06.371 --> 00:02:09.204
were only for African American men

00:02:11.122 --> 00:02:13.944
as women will not get the
right to vote until 1920.

00:02:13.944 --> 00:02:17.027
So from the 14th Amendment until 1877

00:02:18.798 --> 00:02:22.298
there's a military occupation in the South

00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:26.441
and military troops are only taken away

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.156
from the Southern states when
they write their constitutions

00:02:32.156 --> 00:02:35.771
to grant equal citizenship
to African Americans.

00:02:35.771 --> 00:02:38.095
Now you can imagine in the South

00:02:38.095 --> 00:02:42.262
where whites have had racial
supremacy from the 1600s,

00:02:44.034 --> 00:02:47.226
getting them to recognize social equality

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:50.470
with African Americans
was an incredible struggle

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.033
and it was a struggle that
the republicans in Congress

00:02:54.033 --> 00:02:56.320
and the federal troops really didn't win.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.320
This is the era of the Ku Klux Klan,

00:03:00.636 --> 00:03:03.586
which ran terrorist raids at night

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:06.230
trying to prevent African
Americans from voting

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.921
or to prevent their allies
from helping them to vote.

00:03:09.921 --> 00:03:14.199
This era of reconstruction
was really a continuation

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:17.865
of the Civil War where
troops from the North

00:03:17.865 --> 00:03:20.968
tried to enforce the 14th Amendment,

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:23.343
tried to enforce the end of slavery

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:25.617
and the citizenship of African Americans

00:03:25.617 --> 00:03:29.486
with really implacable resistance
from white Southerners.

00:03:29.486 --> 00:03:32.569
So by 1877, only two states were left

00:03:35.004 --> 00:03:37.916
that still had troops 'cause
the rest of the states

00:03:37.916 --> 00:03:39.908
had rewritten their constitutions

00:03:39.908 --> 00:03:41.657
to acknowledge the 14th Amendment.

00:03:41.657 --> 00:03:45.310
But that is not to say
that racial equality

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.800
had been achieved in the South whatsoever.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.163
So what happened in 1877?

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:53.931
Which is generally known as
the end of reconstruction

00:03:53.931 --> 00:03:58.081
and the beginning of this
period of Jim Crow segregation.

00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:00.229
Well we'll get to that in the next video.
