00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
At the end of the day what we want is an equation of motion

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
describing how these masses will accelerate.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Before we jumped into solving the problem, there's still a little more benefit

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we can get from doing more thought experiments.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Let's see what will happen when M₂ is much bigger than M₁, for example may be

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
M₂ is a grand piano and M₁ is a slice of apple pie.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This is a sort of silly example but I'm trying to make a somewhat serious point.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We can push nature to its limits in our head but we never have to set up this experiment.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We just have to think what's going to happen.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Well, we already know when M₂ is greater than M₁, the system accelerates clockwise, of course.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The piano pulls more than the pie, of course.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
In fact, when M₂ is so much bigger than M₁, we can even estimate its acceleration.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So in this situation now, I want you to tell me--what do you think is the best estimate

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
for how quickly this piano works all the way downwards and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
therefore, how quickly the pie works all the way upwards.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Is it 10, 5, 2 or 1 m/s².

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, I want you to remember that a free falling object accelerates downwards at 10 m/s².
