Perfect queen-of-everything,

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:06.173
Beyoncé, was finally proven
mortal this past weekend,

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:07.975
when her earring ripped out
during a performance,

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:11.478
causing her to emit
what appears to be human blood.

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.481
Uh, she's fine, I think?

00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:17.117
She's used to it.
Beyoncé blood is what

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.020
the Illuminati use to begin
their Christmas parties.

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:22.055
-(laughter)
-So she'll be fine.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.057
(applause and cheering)

00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:25.759
She'll be fine.

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:27.027
And she finished the concert
like a pro,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.630
but some of the more fervent
members of the Bae Hive

00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:32.733
are showing their solidarity
by making themselves bleed...

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:35.035
-(Hardwick laughs) -Oh, no!
-(laughter and groaning)

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.370
What is our culture?

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.205
...with the hashtag
#CutForBeyonce.

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:39.873
-Oh, God! -Uh...
-(groaning)

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:41.608
This is ridiculous,
especially considering

00:00:41.642 --> 00:00:43.877
not a single person showed
their solidarity last year

00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:46.180
with the hashtag
#WhipYourDickOutForLennyKravitz.

00:00:46.213 --> 00:00:48.115
-Nobody.
-(laughter)

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:51.885
-(cheers and applause)
-There he is. -Ah.

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:53.854
CONOVER:
He has known

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:55.455
-struggle, too, you know.
-Yeah.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.457
♪ It wants to get away.

00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:00.928
(laughter)

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:07.134
Comedians...

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.169
It looks like it hurt real bad.

00:01:09.203 --> 00:01:10.737
HARDWICK:
It... (laughs)

00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:13.907
Comedians... what are people
doing in solidarity

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.609
with other musicians?

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.110
-Jonah.
-Um...

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:21.148
in solidarity,
fans of Sublime are sucking.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.317
-HARDWICK: Aw, Jesus Christ.
-(laughter)

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.686
You know, they had
some good songs, Jonah.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.855
-No, they didn't.
-All right, points.

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:29.089
(laughter)

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:31.158
(Hardwick laughing)

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.961
-Adam. -In solidarity
with Keith Richards,

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:34.061
fans are hiding heroin
in their walkers.
