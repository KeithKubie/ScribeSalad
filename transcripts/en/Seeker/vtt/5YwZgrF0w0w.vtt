00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.260
Imagine the world...powered by mushrooms.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.089
No, I’m not on drugs, this is an actual
scientific thing--we’ve now invented mushrooms

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:11.910
that produce electricity, no fossil fuels
required.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.500
Let me explain: researchers at the Stevens
Institute of Technology just created what

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.410
they’re calling a bionic mushroom—a fungus
they’ve modified to produce electricity!

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.510
It really is basically any old mushroom—this
team bought those little white button mushrooms

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.490
you can get at the grocery store to throw
in your salad or pasta sauce—but with a

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.029
few special additions.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.149
First of all, mushrooms are much more exciting
than they may seem at first glance.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.949
They are host organisms for their own microbial
communities, acting as little homes for other

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:43.239
microorganisms like bacteria.

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.500
We also know that certain bacteria have electricity-producing
properties.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.510
Cyanobacteria, for example, is an extremely
diverse group of bacteria that are photosynthetic,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.620
meaning they make sunlight into energy.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.120
This photosynthetic process produces high-energy
electrons, which can then be intercepted and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.299
used to produce an electric current.

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:08.030
And voila, you have a living solar panel--otherwise
known as a biophotovoltaic cell.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.600
So how do we keep these bacteria alive in
time spans long enough for them to be practically

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.600
useful?

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.119
This is where the mushroom comes back in,
with its nice and comfy nutrients and pH and

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.290
moisture, which help those bacteria feel right
at home.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.130
One of the coolest parts of this experiment--and
yes, it gets even cooler than biophotovoltaic

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.509
cells--is that the bacteria are printed onto
their mushroom habitat.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.820
These living organisms can be loaded into
just a regular paper printer as a bioink,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.950
which is already insane.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.939
But in this particular case they were deposited
by a 3D printer in the desired structure and

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.729
pattern onto their support matrix--which in
this case is the mushroom.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.700
And how do we get the electricity out of this
bionic mushroom?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700
Graphene.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.109
In addition to the bacterial bioink, the researchers
also added a network of 3D-printed graphene

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.530
nanoribbons to their mushroom, what you could
call an ‘electronic ink’.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.739
The graphene is what taps into the bacterial
cells, intercepting the electrons, and transferring

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.960
them into a small electric current.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.970
In future experiments, we could just add sunlight,
wire a couple of those ingenious fungi together,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.300
and ‘ta-da’: a light bulb comes on.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.380
All natural clean electricity, baby!

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.700
This kind of project is what scientists are
calling engineered symbiosis --exploiting

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.989
an existing relationship between two or more
organisms for humanity’s benefit.

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.730
And this brilliant light bulb of an idea has
appeared over the heads of scientists all

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.819
over the world.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.760
MIT engineers have embedded specially-designed
nanoparticles into plant leaves, creating

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.650
plants that glow.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.330
Other research has tapped into the existing
relationship between plant roots and bacteria

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.980
to design plants that are particularly good
at binding heavy metals, making plants that

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.680
could be used for environmental remediation.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.769
And another super exciting microbe project
has genetically engineered symbiotic gut bacteria

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:03.519
in mosquitoes to stop the parasite that causes
malaria in its tracks inside the mosquito.

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:08.110
In finding solutions to humanity’s toughest
problems, like developing clean energy and

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.090
combating disease, scientists are looking
to nature for inspiration and for ingenious

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.870
hacks into life’s carefully balanced systems.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.930
The resulting projects could just give us
the answers we’re looking for, and help

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.230
us preserve those natural systems that have
given us so much.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.459
It’s not exactly same, but you may have
actually already made a voltaic cell at home,

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.060
using a potato attached to some wires and
nails.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.400
Does that count as biovoltaic cell?

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.959
Let us know--what’s the coolest electronic
thing you’ve made out of a household vegetable?

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.299
