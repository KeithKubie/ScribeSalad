00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.490
- I have taught AP Physics
classes for the last seven years.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.070
AP Physics One, AP Physics B,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.740
back in the day, and AP Physics C now.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.060
I try to make my lessons personable,

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.630
relate to the student,
offer them real life

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.870
examples where things happen,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.560
but also focus on, instead of,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.640
a bunch of little memorization facts,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.550
like, what's the big idea that helps

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.770
you figure out all these
different situations for,

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.420
allows you to be a more
robust problem solver.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.350
So, we're focusing on the big core ideas

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.880
of our subject, being physics,

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.650
and I think you'll find that across

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.920
all the different AP content subjects.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.460
We are finely tuned

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.130
to what the AP exam

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.600
is gonna be like, directly.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.970
And we are building in
videos for instructions,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.680
specific to that, and also we have

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.840
practice exercises that
I'm really excited about,

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.820
that, you can assign it to students,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.260
and there's hints, and there's feedback,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.400
why a certain problem is wrong,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.850
and why a certain problem is right.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.470
And then it shows you the solution path

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.320
of how you would get to the solution.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.770
So, when you assign a student a problem,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.320
they don't have to wait a whole

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.470
24 hours, until they get back to class.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.735
They can get it wrong, fail early,

00:01:31.735 --> 00:01:34.200
try another one, fail often,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.240
and do a couple times on that.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.550
And I actually think my students

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.730
might actually do more,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.380
homework, 'cause they're getting

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.390
instant feedback on the process,

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.050
rather than just trying a couple,

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.250
and getting stuck, and like,

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.530
"Ah, I'm frustrated, I'm outta here."

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.950
They can really

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.810
get in the seat,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.890
and stay in it, because they're getting

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.830
instant feedback and help as they're

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.810
working through problems.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.740
I think that's gonna be really powerful.
