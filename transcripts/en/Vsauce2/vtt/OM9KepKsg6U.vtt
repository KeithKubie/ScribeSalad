00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
Vsauce!

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.160
Kevin here.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.490
This ant needs to get to the end of this 20cm
rubber rope.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.759
It’s really more of an elastic latex string
but… work with me here.

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:23.400
If he moves 5cm per second, he’ll get there
in…1, 2, 3, 4 seconds.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.550
Okay.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.699
Uhh.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:26.859
No.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:28.210
No paradox there.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:36.760
But what if, as the ant walks 5cm per second,
I stretch the rope 10cm per second?

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.540
Will he ever get to the end of the rope and
fulfill his ultimate ant ambitions?

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.579
Ant-bitions?

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.960
It doesn’t seem like it.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.239
It actually seems completely impossible.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.280
How could he ever reach the end of the rope
if I’m increasing the distance he needs

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.090
to travel by more than his progress?

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.040
Oh, also this ant’s name is…

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.190
Billy.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.130
Speaking of ants, I started reading about
them and found out that some ant queens can

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.310
live for 28 or 30 years.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.910
Which means there are ants alive today that
were 10 years old when the first Harry Potter

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.170
came out.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.480
My voice cracked.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.460
Okay, back to stretching.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.970
At 0 seconds, Billy starts walking.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.830
And at 1 second, he’s 5cm toward his goal.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.900
That’s when we stretch the rope another
10cm.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.780
And then Billy moves.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.350
Billy moves Uhh…

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.490
I can't stretch the rope and move Billy at
the same time I really need like another arm

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.740
or something Ahhhh!

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.740
Woah!

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.740
Hey!

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.740
No!

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.740
Come back, come back, come back.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.740
Come back, mystery arm.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.740
I need your help.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.490
Look, just hold this end of the rope.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.740
Like that.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.010
And then.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.240
Yeah!

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.590
This is frightening but helpful!

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.400
Now after this stretch, the rope is 30cm long.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.400
And look!

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.500
Billy’s no longer at 5cm because the key
to all of this is that the ant is on the rope

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.630
and he stretches with the rope.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.940
So to make sure he moves exactly 5cm every
second I’ll just grab another ruler.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.940
There we go.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.410
Billy moves another 5cm.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.950
And now we stretch to 40cm…

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.070
Billy moves another 5.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.390
50cm.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.940
Another 5 for Billy.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:30.940
60cm.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.150
5 &nbsp;more for Billy.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.150
70cm.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.480
And you can see that despite stretching the
rope much more than the ground he covers each

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.200
second, Billy is making progress toward the
end.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.490
So a 5cm speed and 10cm stretch really isn't
much of a paradox here either.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.490
But.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:54.840
What if the rope is 1km long and Billy moves
at only a 1cm per second pace?

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.860
And we stretch it 1km every second?

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:04.640
Then can Billy ever reach the end of the rope?

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.730
Obviously not!

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.840
Or definitely yes?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.040
And there’s our paradox.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.000
Ant On A Rubber Rope is a veridical paradox,
which we learned about in my What Is A Paradox?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
video.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.920
It’s the type of paradox that packs a surprise,
because obviously the ant can’t reach the

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.069
end of the rope if we stretch it that much
every second… but that certainty dissipates

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.530
as we ponder the proof.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.260
Actually, if I stretch it 1 kilometer per
second and the ant only moves 1cm per second,

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.710
he will still reach the end.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.990
As long as old Billy here lives forever.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.990
Okay.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:46.430
Let’s ponder that proof.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.459
It’s important to think about this as the
fraction of rope that Billy has left to travel

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.410
instead of the raw distance.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.849
I’ll show you.

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:57.709
Let's put Billy at the halfway mark of the
rope.

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:58.930
Like that.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.930
And I'm just gonna mark where he's standing
with a Sharpie on the rope.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:04.930
Okay.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.350
So that mark is our Billy.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.130
And this time Billy doesn’t move at all.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.410
He just stands there being Billy.

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.390
Every time we stretch the rope, distance is
added behind and in front of the rope, but

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.500
he’s still at the halfway point because
his relative position doesn’t change.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.350
Which means that in spite of the stretching,
every time Billy steps forward from this point,

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.210
he’s making progress toward reaching the
end of the rubber rope.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.610
By continuing his journey forward, he can
only get closer to the end, and eventually

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.810
he will.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:48.410
Because he’s always shrinking the fraction
of the rope he has left.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:55.730
If you still don’t believe then this we
can totally get algebra-y and calculicious.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.330
First I want to briefly mention the harmonic
series.

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.630
It’s a divergent series, meaning it’s
infinite and the partial sums of the series

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.550
don’t have a finite limit.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.460
It was first proven over 600 years ago and
there’s been a whole list of different proofs

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.690
since that I'll link you to down in the description
below.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:18.150
But the important thing you need to know is
that it’s like a neverending addition problem

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.740
where the sum of these fractions eventually
surpasses 1.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.110
Okay let’s talk about Billy and his stretching
rope.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.360
Let’s say the rope is initially c units
long, and the ant moves a units towards the

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.580
other end of the rope every second but the
rope itself stretches v units longer every

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.510
single second.

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.830
During the first second, the ant will have
moved a units forward and the rope will have

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.669
stretched to c plus v units long.

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:50.669
Cool?

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:51.669
Cool.

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:57.400
In the second second, the ant will again move
a units forward and the rope stretch another

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:04.540
v units longer, making its new length its
original length c plus v plus v again.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:08.020
Which we can just write as c+2v.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.340
In the third second, the ant will have moved
another a units forward and the rope will

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:18.979
be c+v+v+v units long or c+3v.

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.400
During any second, the fraction of the rope
the ant covers is just the ratio between the

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.210
two lengths in that second’s row.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:35.330
After the first second, the ant covers a units
of the total c+v units the rope is long.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:41.150
During the second second, the ant covers a
units of the rope’s now total c+2v units

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.150
of length.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:43.150
And so on.

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.430
If you add these two fractions, you get the
fraction of the rope covered after the first

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.830
and second second.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:55.740
The number of fractions we add corresponds
to how many seconds have elapsed and their

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:03.729
sum tells us the total fraction of the rope
the ant has covered after that many seconds.

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.480
One way to think about adding fractions to
represent a sum is eating pizza.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.480
Okay?

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:15.370
Take one big bite of pizza and then a smaller
bite of pizza, add those two bites together

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.980
and their sum equals the total amount of pizza
you’ve just eaten.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:28.410
So if we represent seconds as k, during the
kth second, the ant covers 1 of the total

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.100
c+kv units the rope is long.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.479
Okay cool story, Kevin.

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:39.370
But the question is: if we wait long enough,
if we add up enough of these diminishing fractions

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:45.350
of the rope’s length the ant covers during
each next second, will the sum ever equal

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.390
1?

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:51.690
One whole of the rope’s length?

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.420
YES.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.000
And we can prove that by using a COMPARISON
TEST.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.490
Let’s compare this series with one whose
behavior we know: the harmonic series.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.620
We can do that by creatively tweaking the
general formula for the fraction of the rope

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.310
the ant covers during any given second k.

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:21.160
If we multiply not only v but ALSO c by
k, then for any natural number k, like 1,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:28.319
2, 3, 4, etc., this new formula will give
either the same result as the original formula

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:32.500
. Well, it'll give us the same result when
k equals 1.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:38.289
Because if k equals 1 then this is just c
and if k equals 1 here that's just v so that

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.570
will be the same so that will be equal.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.689
Or it'll give us a number that is smaller.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:56.529
And this new formula -- a/(kc+kv) -- is equal
to a over c plus v times 1 over k.

00:08:56.529 --> 00:09:03.189
Because 1 times a is just a and we still have
the k times c and k times v. Okay?

00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:04.269
Got it?

00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:09.639
And if we generate a new series using this
formula, when we start plugging in number

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:18.540
for k we get a over c plus v time 1 over 1
plus 1 over 2 plus 1 over 3 plus 1 over 4

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:20.129
and so on...

00:09:20.129 --> 00:09:24.389
Which is the harmonic series!

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:26.309
Exciting!

00:09:26.309 --> 00:09:29.519
So this new series we’ve created diverges.

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:35.800
As long as you keep adding in new values for
bigger and bigger k’s, the sum can reach

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.069
any number you want -- including 1.

00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:42.329
That's a big one.

00:09:42.329 --> 00:09:43.329
Because this is a big deal.

00:09:43.329 --> 00:09:48.749
And since every single element of this new
series is always equal to OR LESS than an

00:09:48.749 --> 00:09:56.019
element in the series that describes the ant’s
progress, our ant’s progress MUST ALSO DIVERGE.

00:09:56.019 --> 00:10:00.990
So no matter how tiny the fractions get, no
matter how long it takes the ant to cover

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:07.070
any proportion of the rope, he will eventually
cover 1/1th of whatever the rope’s length

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.070
has become.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:11.730
H will reach the end.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:17.220
But it will take A LONG, LONG TIME since a
smaller and smaller portion is covered every

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.529
step of the way.

00:10:18.529 --> 00:10:24.660
In our example of an ant traveling 1cm every
second and a rope stretching 1 km longer every

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:33.889
second, the ant will reach the end after about
8.9 × 10 raised to the 43,421 years.

00:10:33.889 --> 00:10:35.949
To put that number in perspective.

00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:42.779
The known universe is about 13.8 billion years
old, which is 1.38 x 10^10.

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:49.730
All the known atoms in the observable universe
number is about 10^80.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.839
A Googol is still only 10^100.

00:10:54.839 --> 00:11:03.730
So what does a number with 43,421 zeroes actually
look like?

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.350
This.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:10.889
The real world analog to the ant on a rubber
rope would be light from distant galaxies

00:11:10.889 --> 00:11:13.410
traveling through space.

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:19.449
If photons are traveling through a universe
that is constantly expanding, will their light

00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:21.940
ever reach Earth?

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:29.790
The ant on a rubber rope teaches us that yes,
yes the light will eventually reach us, or

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:34.639
it would, if the universe were expanding at
a constant rate.

00:11:34.639 --> 00:11:40.569
But the metric expansion of the universe is
actually accelerating, which means there are

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:47.429
ant photons traveling through the universe’s
rubber rope that will never crawl into your

00:11:47.429 --> 00:11:49.149
eyes.

00:11:49.149 --> 00:11:53.929
So be sure to enjoy the starlight that does
make that journey.

00:11:53.929 --> 00:12:02.059
And as always -- thanks for watching.
