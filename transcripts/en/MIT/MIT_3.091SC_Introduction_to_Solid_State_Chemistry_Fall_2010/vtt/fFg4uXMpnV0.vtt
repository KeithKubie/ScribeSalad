00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.080
PROFESSOR: OK, OK,
Settle down.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.380
Settle down.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.430
It's 11:05.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.940
It's time to learn.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.190
All right.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.130
Last day we were looking at the
emissions spectrum of the

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.370
target in the x-ray tube.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.430
The target is the anode, and
it's being a bombarded by

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.970
electrons that have been
accelerated across a potential

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.370
difference of some tens of
thousands of volts, and this

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.720
was what we saw as the output,
intensity versus wavelength.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.360
We see this whale shaped curve
which we have attributed to

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.060
bremsstrahlung, which is
the breaking radiation.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.530
And then if the voltage
is high enough, high

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.550
enough to do what?

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.650
High enough to eject inner shell
electrons, we will get

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.310
the cascade, and the cascade
will give rise to specific

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.780
values of wavelength associated
with transitions

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.570
within the target atom.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.240
There's too much talking.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.450
I want it absolutely silent or
else somebody is going to

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.530
leave. That's the only
way it works here.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.440
I talk.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.170
You listen.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.320
And if you have a problem with
that, there's a door here.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.200
There's a door there.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.180
And there's a door
at the back.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.670
So let's get it straight
right now.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.210
It's the only way
it works here.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.760
Now what happens is that these
characteristic lines are

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.850
calculable in part.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.560
The K alpha line, the L alpha
line we saw from Moseley's

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.930
law, which is up here
on the slide.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.020
and the leading edge of the
whale shape curve, the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.950
bremsstrahlung is calculable
by the Duane-Hunt Law.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.900
The rest of this is
not calculable.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.510
So there it is.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.206
What I want to do today is
harness this radiation.

00:02:19.206 --> 00:02:22.210
The reason we were studying
x-rays in first place was that

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.960
we said they had a length scale
that was comparable to

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.380
that of atomic dimensions.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.840
And so now we want to close
the circle here and probe

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.760
atomic arrangement by
x-ray diffraction.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.320
And it goes by this
three-letter

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.060
initialization XRD.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.180
And in order to use x-ray
diffraction to probe atomic

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.520
structure, we're going to
make another model.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.930
And this model is going
to be simple.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.010
And it's going to be inaccurate,
but it's going to

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.080
be good enough to explain
the phenomena that

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.220
we're going to study.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.880
So the first thing I want to
do in constructing a model

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.410
that will allow to use x-ray
diffraction, is to model the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.240
atoms as mirrors.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.250
That's the first assumption
that we make.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.960
We model the atoms as mirrors.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.470
And when we model the atoms as
mirrors, this means that we

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.990
will invoke the laws of
specular reflection.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.940
So if this table top is a plane
of atoms, and I have a

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.030
beam coming down at an angle,
the laws of specular

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.370
reflection say that the angle
of incidence will equal the

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.830
angle of reflection.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.830
So that's all we're doing by
modeling the atoms as mirrors.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.425
Laws of speculative
reflection apply.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.350
So that simply means that the
angle of incidence, theta

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.846
incidence equals theta
reflection.

00:03:58.846 --> 00:04:03.250
And you'll see how that comes
into play in a minute.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.560
And then the second thing we're
going to do in order to

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.720
get intensities is to use the
concept of constructive and

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.910
destructive interference.

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.900
OK.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.169
So we apply interference
criteria.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.150
And I will explain what
that means in a

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.930
second with a diagram.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:38.710
But in dense text, it simply
means that in phase rays--

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.920
it sounds like this rain in
Spain falls mainly in the

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.845
plain-- in-phase rays amplify.

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.510
And out-of-phase rays dampen.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.110
So at some point, you'll study
this in physics, but we need

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.630
it right now, so I'll give you a
little bit of foreshadowing,

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.120
and then you'll be ahead
of the game when you

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.310
meet this in physics.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.740
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to show you two rays,

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.910
and they both have the
same wavelength.

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.160
And I want to show
you in phase.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.730
And so I want to illustrate this
concept here, in-phase

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.760
rays amplify.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.930
So let's give one ray here.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.610
I'm going to depict it as
a wave. All right, so

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.890
that's ray number 1.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.000
And beneath it, is
ray number 2.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.140
It's got the same wavelength.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.550
So that means crest-to-crest
distance is the same, and if

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.750
it's in phase, in phase means
that crest lines up with

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.470
crest, trough lines
up with trough.

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:50.960
So I'm going to make another
one seemingly identical.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.440
It's supposed to be identical
to the capacity of

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.890
my ability to draw.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:01.670
And so what this means is
that these will amplify.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.050
So 1 plus 2, 1 plus 2 will
give me something

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.570
that looks like this.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:08.920
I'm going to line it up again.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:14.190
Only now the amplitude is double
the amplitude of a

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.960
single ray.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.820
That's what I'm trying
to depict here.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.430
OK.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.560
So this is amplification.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.680
Now over here, I want to
do the same thing.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.710
Only I'm going to have
two rays, same

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.130
wavelength, but out of phase.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:35.290
OK, so in phase is here, out
of phase is to the right.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:40.060
So we'll have ray number
3, which does this.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.320
And ray number 4, I'm going to
line up with the crest of ray

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.760
number 3, the trough of ray
number 4, but it's going to be

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.160
the same wavelength.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.430
So the distance between
successive crests is the same.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.310
Only they're going to be
offset by exactly half

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:57.450
wavelength.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.800
So the crest here of wave
3 lines up with the

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:01.880
trough of wave 4.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.400
The trough of wave 3 lines up
with the crest of wave 4, and

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.050
so on, and so on, and so on.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.340
And if I drew this thing
accurately, it would be

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.080
obvious to you.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.630
But since I can't draw very
well, then we're going

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.170
to take 3 plus 4.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.950
And the sum of the crest
and the trough is 0.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.160
The sum of the trough
and the crest is 0.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.470
And so the sum here is 0.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.150
All right this is total
destruction.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.750
This is cancellation.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.370
So in the extreme, you can have
destructive interference

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:34.750
that dampens to the point
of obliteration.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.960
OK, so that's the two extremes,
full amplification

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.460
and complete cancellation.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:46.060
So now, I want to take this
concept of planes as mirrors

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:55.330
and rules of interference
criteria, and now what I want

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:56.970
to do is illuminate.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.940
And I want to use the
full board here.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:07:59.770
So here's what we're
going to do.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:06.260
We're going to take in
phase, coherent--

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:07.350
that's what coherent means.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:10.900
Coherent means that the
radiation is in phase and

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.150
monochromatic.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.860
What's that mean?

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:20.180
Monochromatic means one color,
which means single wavelength.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.100
So I have something of a single
wavelength in phase.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:33.120
Coherent, monochromatic,
incident radiation, so I've

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.720
got a plurality of rays.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.930
I have this thing flooded
by a beam.

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.380
So what I'm going to
do, is I'm going to

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.750
draw some atoms here.

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.210
And I'll put a second
batch on top.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.530
And now I'm going to model
these as mirrors.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.430
So I'm going to have the
incident beam come in like so.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.400
The incident beam comes in like
so at an angle theta.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.010
So this is theta incident.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.930
This is the angle
of incidence.

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.280
And according to our model, the
beam is reflected at the

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.220
same angle.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.710
So this is theta, reflection
of theta.

00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:16.570
Reflection equals
theta incidence.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.810
So that's the first
thing that we do.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:23.470
And then the second thing we
do, is we use the laws of

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:24.260
interference.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.200
So I'm going to take a second
beam, and it's going to go

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.050
down to this atom here.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.360
So I'm going to bring
it down like so.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.910
And it's going to come
in at the same angle.

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.540
And it's going to leave
at the same angle.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:41.100
And if you'll excuse
the drawing, these

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.295
lines should be parallel.

00:09:42.295 --> 00:09:44.920
They should be coming in
parallel, and they should be

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.320
leaving parallel where these
angles theta i and

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.110
theta r are the same.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.450
Now how do we invoke the
interference criteria?

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.070
Well what I'm going to do
is put a marker here.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.250
I'll put a marker.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:01.060
And I'll call the first one ray
number 1, and the second

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.670
one ray number 2.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:07.950
And what I'm going to show is if
I start from ray number 1--

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.240
maybe it's time for
colored chalk--

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.020
so if I start from ray number 1,
to show that it's in phase

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:19.470
with ray number 2, I'm going to
draw this little waveform,

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:21.080
and they're both lined up.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.780
So you can see crest lines up
with crest. Trough lines up

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.720
with trough, and they both
have the same wavelength.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.280
So that makes the point
coherent, monochromatic.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.820
But now things get interesting,
because you can

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.710
see that ray number 1 travels
a shorter distance than ray

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:42.590
number 2, and we can put on some
coordinates here and mark

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:47.190
the geometry, so we can say that
the point at which the

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.530
ray number 2 has to start
traveling a longer distance,

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:52.890
I'll drop a normal down,
and I'm going to

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:55.020
call this point A.

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.740
This is point A.

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.180
The bottom here is point B.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.620
And then up here where it
catches up with ray number 1,

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.490
the reflected ray number
1, I'm going to

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.840
call this point C.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:12.120
So you can you can see that
ray number 2 has to travel

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:16.440
this extra distance,
AB plus BC.

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.930
And now, if I want to get out
to here where I'm now in the

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.510
reflected zone, and I want ray
number 1 reflected and ray

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.100
number 2 reflected to continue
to be in phase, there's a

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.670
geometric constraint on
the dimension of AB

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.840
plus BC, isn't there?

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:42.090
That length, AB plus BC must
be a whole number of

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:43.416
wavelengths.

00:11:43.416 --> 00:11:47.870
It must be an integer number
of wavelengths of whatever

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:50.600
this thing is, otherwise,
these two will

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.210
not being in phase.

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.240
So that's the interference
criterion.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:12:00.540
And n can equal 1, 2, 3, and so
on, so this is called the

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.840
order of reflection.

00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:09.630
And then we can go through
the trigonometry.

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:10.840
I'm not going to
do it in class.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:11.810
It's just a waste of time.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:13.490
It'll bore everybody to tears.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:16.720
But if you want to do that at
home at some point when you've

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.670
got nothing to do, you
can go through.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.790
You've got all the
numbers here.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:21.340
You know the value of lambda.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.150
You know the distance AB,
and you know what

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:25.270
this distance is.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:27.780
This distance between successive
planes is your

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.400
dhkl, isn't it?

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.210
So if you go through all of this
analysis, you will show

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:41.090
that n lambda is equal to 2
times the d of the hkl spacing

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:44.800
times the sign of theta.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.900
And this is called
Bragg's Law.

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:54.610
And Bragg's Law governs the
reflection of incident

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:56.590
radiation by a crystal.

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.160
Now you'll notice I didn't
put an apostrophe here.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.120
Some people put the apostrophe
here, because the

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.510
man's name was Bragg.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:06.670
Some people put the apostrophe
here because, in fact, it was

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.900
father and son.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:13.380
And they both together won
the Nobel Prize in 1915.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.430
Now there have been people who
lived to see, as Nobel Prize

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:20.830
winners, one of their children
win the Nobel Prize. but this

00:13:20.830 --> 00:13:24.820
is the only time in history a
father and son team together

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.430
won the Nobel Prize
for the same work.

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:31.070
And there are undoubtedly people
sitting in this room

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:33.510
who think the fact that the
father and son could work

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:37.240
together in physics for an
extended period of time alone

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.180
is deserving of the
Nobel Prize.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:47.160
Now in 3.091, I'm going to keep
it simple, always choose

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.930
first order reflection, always
n equals 1 in Bragg's Law.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.860
So therefore, we will write
Bragg's Law as lambda equals

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:01.810
2d sin theta.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:05.760
And to make the point, the d
is specific to a particular

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:06.930
set of planes.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.870
So it's a d spacing
of the hkl planes.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.480
And it's the theta associated
with the correct reflection of

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:16.300
the hkl planes.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.050
Now how does destructive
interference come into play?

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.400
Destructive interference comes
into play should there be a

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:26.280
situation where I have
a third ray.

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.690
I'm going to bring a third
ray in also at the

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.360
same angle of incidence.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.810
And that ray is halfway between
these two rays.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:38.300
And what situation
could that be?

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.720
That could be a situation in
which the crystal structure

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.350
has in a plane out from the
board, an atom that sits

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.890
halfway between these
other two atoms.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.730
And if that happens,
you can see.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:50.160
We can go through
the derivation.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.890
But there's going to be a path
length difference that's

00:14:52.890 --> 00:14:56.370
exactly 1/2 wavelength
different.

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.300
That's bad.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.420
It's not just there's going to
be some measure of reduction.

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:02.620
It's going to be total
cancellation.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:08.240
And so by going through the set
of crystal structures and

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.580
recognizing that when you have
1/2 wavelength difference, you

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:13.280
get destructive interference.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.100
And therefore, you
will see no line.

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.730
The incident radiation will come
in at this angle, and at

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:21.980
the reflection angle for that
particular plane, there will

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.030
be nothing detected.

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:28.960
So you can say that you have a
combination of selection rules

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:35.190
that involve the integral of
both the rules of interference

00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.180
and interaction with the
crystal structure.

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:43.290
So let's generalize this and
say if we take interference

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:54.530
criteria plus the crystal
structure, that is to say, the

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.870
instant relationship of atom
positions for a particular

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:06.190
specimen, the combination of
that will give rise to the set

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:11.456
of expected reflections.

00:16:11.456 --> 00:16:15.760
So only when you satisfy the
Bragg criterion do you get

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.200
reflection.

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.840
So you move the specimen.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.900
And only at that special angle
will you get the reflections,

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.750
will you get constructive
interference.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.480
So this, in fact, is
a fingerprint.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.780
This is a fingerprint
of the crystal.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.920
In this case, we're not getting
the chemical identity.

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.310
We're getting the structural
identity.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.600
So we can determine
if something is

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.770
BCC, FCC, and so on.

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:51.500
So for example in BCC, that's
exactly the case that I just

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:52.440
illustrated.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.020
So in BCC we have atoms
at the eight corners.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.540
And we have an atom
dead center.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.160
There's a central atom.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:12.410
And the central atom lies in
0 0 2 plane, doesn't it?

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.080
The base of this is 0 0 1.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:21.140
And the top is an 0 0 1.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.680
But the central atom
is an 0 0 2.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.580
And 0 0 2 is halfway between
successive 0 0 1.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.170
So can you see that light
that comes in?

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.300
And it's going to be
constructively reinforced.

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.390
Off of 0 0 1 is going to be
destructively reinforced off

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:46.930
of 0 0 2, and the result is
that in BCC, no 0 0 1

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.205
reflection observed.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.050
The same thing happens in face
centered cubic, right?

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:58.350
What's the face of face centered
cubic look like?

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:01.520
It looks like this,
doesn't it?

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:04.750
So there's an 0 0 1.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.750
Here's an 0 0 1.

00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:08.270
What about this space
centered atom?

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:09.900
Where is it?

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:12.020
That's an 0 0 2.

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:13.750
It's halfway between 0 0 1.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:17.400
So at the angle where you
would've expected, if you use

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.990
the Bragg Law and calculate the
angle at which for your

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.400
particular crystal, because
you know the d spacing.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.140
You fix the wavelength
of your x-radiation

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:29.700
coming out of the generator.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:32.790
At the angle where you would
expect to see reflection off

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.730
of 0 0 1, you will see nothing,
because 0 0 2 is

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:38.820
canceling 0 0 1.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.090
So you don't have to worry
about all this.

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:43.910
This has all been tabulated
for you.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:48.940
Somebody has gone through
and done all of this.

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.300
Well, this is just
making the point.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.140
See, there's a simple cubic.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.570
All the planes are reflecting.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:55.340
There's body-centered cubic.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.250
That's a/2.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.620
There's face-centered
cubic a/2.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.960
0 0 2 is going to
cancel 0 0 1.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.340
You're not going to see
anything there.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:03.450
So people have gone through.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:07.840
And they've made this set
of rules for reflection.

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:09.620
So simple cubic, you
get reflection

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:11.000
from all the planes.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.260
Body-centered cubic, you just
get these planes here.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:17.660
And it turns out that there's
a simple rule that compactly

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.790
represents which planes are
going to reflect in

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.270
body-centered cubic.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:32.480
And in BCC, the hkl, it's the
planes for which h plus k plus

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.240
l is an even number.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.850
h plus k plus l is even.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.730
And 0 was counted as even.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:47.370
So for example, 0 0 1 h
plus k plus l is 1.

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:48.550
It doesn't reflect.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:52.170
0 0 2, 0 plus 0 plus 2 is 2.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:53.540
It does reflect.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.180
And so on.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:56.010
You just go down
the whole line.

00:19:56.010 --> 00:19:59.350
And so these are in ascending
order of h squared plus k

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.300
squared plus l squared, because
that's a nice way of

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.570
deciding how to add them up.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.860
And now in FCC the
selection rule is

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:08.160
a little bit different.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:13.790
In FCC you get reflection from
planes when you write the HKL

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:25.480
such that h, k, and l must be
either all even numbers, or

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:31.640
all odd numbers, or some people
like to say unmixed.

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.210
Some crystallographers say
unmixed, meaning you can't

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.120
have a combination of even
numbers and odd number.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:40.890
So for example, 0 0 1 won't
work because 0 is a zero.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:41.760
That's even.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.160
1 is odd.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:49.890
But 0 0 2, h plus k plus l all
even or all odd, there you go

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.730
all even or all odd unmixed.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:53.410
So this will work.

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:54.120
And then so on.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.160
So you can go through and
see which ones work.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:57.500
All right.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.140
So the next one here
is in the sequence.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.950
This sums to 1.

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:04.260
And what would sum to 2?

00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:06.500
It would be 0 1 1.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:10.310
And 0 1 1 doesn't work either
because zero is even.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:11.450
And 1 is odd.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.500
The next one of the
sequence is 1 1 1.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.580
These are all odd.

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.060
So that one reflects.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:20.240
So in FCC, you don't
see 0 0 1, 0 1 1.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.890
But 1 1 1 does reflect.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.760
And then 0 0 2, which is the
next one, because 0 squared

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.950
plus 0 squared plus
2 squared is 4.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.520
This is even even.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.190
So that one works.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:32.560
So there's the sequence.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:38.430
And so now what we can do is use
this technique in order to

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.520
make measurements.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.400
But before we do so, I want to
show you the experimental

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:44.310
measurement, one way.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.490
There's several ways of
conducting the measurement.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:49.790
And so the first way I'm going
to show you is called

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.040
diffractometry.

00:21:54.670 --> 00:21:56.650
And you can do this over
in Building 13.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:59.530
If you get yourself a UROP, you
might be assigned to make

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:00.210
some measurements.

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.150
So diffractometry is a form
of x-ray diffraction.

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.680
It's one of the techniques.

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:12.940
And the way it works is you fix
the wavelength and vary

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.590
the angle of incidence,
you don't

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:17.520
rotate the x-ray generator.

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.480
You rotate specimen and present
continually varying

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:22.470
angles to the thing.

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:26.950
So this shows the technique
in operation.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.790
So you have a specimen
sitting here.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:33.870
The specimen can either be
a thin film, or in other

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:36.840
instances, we have a finely
ground powder.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.040
So each of the powder grains
presents a different angle.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.990
And coming out of the
collimator is the

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:44.530
monochromatic.

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:46.630
We want a single wavelength.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:50.880
So this collimator means it's
monochromatic and coherent.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.440
So that beam comes and
strikes the specimen.

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:56.470
And for historical reasons,
instead of calling this the

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.860
angle of incidence, and this the
angle of reflection, they

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:02.560
call the angle that goes to
the detector 2 theta.

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.600
In other words, the projection
of the beam, this is theta

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.930
incident equals theta r.

00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:11.070
So this is really 2
theta incident, or

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.280
it's 2 theta reflected.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:13.020
It's the same thing.

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:15.840
So you'll see x-ray data
usually reported

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.410
in units of 2 theta.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:18.800
And here's the detector.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.220
And then all you do is you
rotate the specimen.

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:26.450
And by rotating the specimen
with a detector, you're able

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.600
to get the entire set
of reflections.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.980
And whenever you move through
an angle that satisfies the

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.210
Bragg Law, you get a
peak in intensity.

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:39.420
And here's what the output
would look like.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:42.550
So you're plotting intensity
as a function of 2 theta.

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.040
So somewhere along here at
around, it looks like about 38

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:49.610
degrees, you have satisfied the
Bragg angle, and you get

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:51.100
constructive interference.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.890
When you move off of 38
degrees, destructive

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:56.470
interference reigns supreme,
and you get almost no

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:57.090
reflection.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.950
Then you get to the right
angle for 2 0 0, you get

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:00.600
reflection.

00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.550
Well, all you get
is these lines.

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.360
You don't get these numbers.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.030
These numbers you don't
get for free.

00:24:06.030 --> 00:24:08.280
So here's the experiment
that we're going to do.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.010
We're going to run our
x-ray generator

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.780
with a copper target.

00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:13.590
Why do I tell you the
copper target?

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:15.760
Because you're going to
fix the wavelength.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.270
And you fix the wavelength
by choosing the target.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:23.960
So we've got copper target in
our x-ray generator, OK?

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.970
So remember, the sample
is not the target.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:29.570
The sample is what is
being irradiated.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:34.540
This is being bombed by the
electrons in the tube, copper

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:42.000
target in x-ray tube, and that
means that the lambda of the

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.700
radiation is lambda copper.

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.500
And I'm going to use lambda
copper K alpha because I know

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:52.570
it's wavelength to five
significant figures.

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:56.950
It's 1.5418 angstroms.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.100
And here's the data set.

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.200
I looked this up in
the literature.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.050
Here's the data set from
the experiment.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:06.700
And that's all you get,
a set of 2 thetas.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.770
So here's my challenge to you.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.710
I'm telling you you've got an
unknown sample that's cubic,

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:13.200
and there's your data set.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:17.940
The task for you is determine
two parts to the question.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.890
And we're going to
do it together.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:25.530
First part, determine the
crystal structure.

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:32.390
So it's either FCC, BCC,
or simple cubic.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:36.970
And the second part is
determine the lattice

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:39.690
constant, the value of
the lattice constant.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:41.620
So you can get quantitative
measurements.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.420
So I'm going to show
you how to do it.

00:25:43.420 --> 00:25:45.310
So how are we going to do it?

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.680
We're going to use
this technique.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.460
This is my self-help
book for you.

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.650
And here's the key.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.340
Here's how I came
up with this.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:25:55.240
There's a way to unravel this.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.730
And the way you unravel this
is to take these two

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.000
relationships.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.530
You have lambda equals
2d sin theta is 1.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:08.000
And you also know that d--

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.900
in fact, I'm going to keep
writing hkl subscripts here--

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.250
you know the dhkl
is equal to a.

00:26:14.250 --> 00:26:16.760
That's this lattice constant.

00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.580
Be sure this is lattice
constant.

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.750
This is the cube edge
measurement lattice constant

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:27.430
divided by the square root
of h squared plus k

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.150
squared plus l squared.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.550
So what I do is I
combine the two.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:36.140
If you combine these two,
you can end up with this

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.516
relationship.

00:26:37.516 --> 00:26:43.210
If you combine the two, you
get lambda squared over 4a

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:50.610
squared equals sin squared theta
over h squared plus k

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:52.400
squared plus l squared.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.560
And this is the key.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.060
Why is it the key?

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:57.260
The value of lambda
is set by you.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.150
You chose the target.

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.180
The value of a is set
by the sample.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:02.800
That's the lattice constant.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.510
So the ratio of two constants
is a constant.

00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:06.330
Agreed?

00:27:06.330 --> 00:27:09.330
So this is a constant.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.180
So if the left side of the
equation is a constant, the

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.450
right side of the equation
must be a constant.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:16.300
But h, k, and l vary.

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:17.580
And theta varies.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:20.550
But the ratio of the variation,
when mapped into

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:24.890
sin square theta over h squared
plus k squared plus l

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:26.860
squared, this must
be a constant.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.600
And that's going to be the
way I work through

00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.640
this delightful problem.

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.790
So let's see.

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:38.110
Start with 2 theta values, and
generate a set of sin squared

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.580
theta values.

00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:42.320
That's what Sadoway says first.
So I took 2 theta.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.860
And all I did was make 1 theta,
and then took the sin

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:46.140
of it, and then took
the square the sin.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:50.640
So this is the data set
transmogrified into sin

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.780
squared theta.

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.140
All right, what's the
next thing he says?

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:58.180
Normalize by dividing through
with the first value.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:00.080
So I'm just going to take
this whole series and

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.320
divide it by 0.143.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.160
And now I end up, instead
of 0.143, 0.191.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.800
I have 1, 1.34, and so on.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:07.940
That's what I mean
by normalize.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:10.070
Normalize to the first entry.

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.620
OK, What's next thing he says?

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:13.800
Clear fractions.

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:16.400
Clear fractions from the
normalized column.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.750
So I'm going to multiply this
by a common number.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.810
Because 1.34, remember this
is experimental data.

00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:24.400
It's noisy.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.300
1.34 looks like 4/3.

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.480
Doesn't it?

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.680
It's fuzzy logic.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.990
And 2.67 looks like 2
and 2/3, 3 and 2/3.

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:35.430
That's roughly 4.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:36.840
5 and 1/3.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.650
The 3 looks like
a magic number.

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:44.920
So if a multiply this column by
3, I get 3, 4, 8, 11, 12.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.120
What does it say next?

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.040
Speculate on the h, k, l values,
that if expressed as h

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.950
squared plus k squared plus l
squared would generate the

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:56.440
sequence of the clear
fractions column.

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.630
And then that's going to take
me to the selection rule.

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:00.550
So I say, well how do I get 3?

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:02.530
It's 1 plus 1 plus 1.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.990
4 is 2 squared plus 0 squared
plus zero squared.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:09.130
8 is 2 squared plus 2 squared
plus 0 squared.

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.630
So I'm generating this thing.

00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.180
And now it's pretty
obvious, right?

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.240
Because now I've got
to use these.

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.440
And what do I see here?

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.320
Well, 1 1 1 are all odd.

00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:23.030
2 0 0, all even.

00:29:23.030 --> 00:29:25.770
2 2 0, all even.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.680
Gee, this looks like it conforms
to the selection

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:36.040
rules for Bragg reflection
from an FCC crystal

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.270
And then to make sure that
I'm on to something,

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:39.890
what I do is this.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:43.640
Compute for each theta the value
of sin square theta over

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.050
h squared plus k squared plus
l squared on the basis of

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:48.070
those assumed values.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:51.430
What I'm doing is I'm saying if
my hunch is right, whatever

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:55.630
I choose for the theta and the
assumed value h squared plus k

00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.110
squared plus l squared, that
should be a constant that

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.430
doesn't change.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.450
So let's test it.

00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.950
And sure enough, look.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:06.290
0.0477, 0.0478, so it looks
like I'm on to something.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.630
And furthermore, I know
what this is.

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:13.630
That 0.0477 is this.

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.090
This is 0.0477.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.200
And I know my lambda.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.900
That's 1.5418.

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:21.710
So now I can calculate my a.

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:24.080
So now I've determined
that it's FCC.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.770
Plus if I go ahead and I
calculate the a value, I get

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:32.980
3.53 angstroms. And if it's FCC
and it's 3.53 angstroms, I

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:35.970
bet it's nickel.

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.640
So that's how you index
this stuff.

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:41.420
So there we are.

00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.890
There are the selection rules.

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:45.420
Now here's a little trick.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.970
Let me show you.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.940
Because when I go to index this,
the first thing I do is

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.310
I go for low hanging fruit.

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:56.170
If you start looking for whether
it's simple cubic,

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:58.880
face-centered cubic, or
body-centered cubic, let's

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.550
look at the sum.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:04.480
So I've got simple cubic,
body-centered cubic, and

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.790
face-centered cubic.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:09.570
So the first plane on simple
cubic, it's going to give me

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:10.270
everything.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:15.570
It's going to give me
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.030
And FCC, what does it give us?

00:31:18.030 --> 00:31:19.760
If you start looking down
there, it gives you

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:24.920
3, 4, 8, 11, 12.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.260
Well, this is so different.

00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:29.580
3, 4, 8, 11 is so different
from 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.550
What does BCC give you?

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:36.930
It gives you 2, 4,
6, 8, 10, 12.

00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:38.560
Can you see you have
a problem here?

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.090
It's pretty easy to
pull out FCC.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.460
But look at these two.

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:44.530
Since you don't know, you're
just normalizing.

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.330
You can't tell.

00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:48.940
If I give you a number sequence
that is in the order

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.630
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, how do you know
that that couldn't be 1,

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:53.880
2, 3, 4, 5?

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.060
There's a hook here, though.

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.960
Look at the sequence of h
plus h squared plus k

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.200
squared plus l squared.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.830
Do you notice that there's no
combination of h squared plus

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:10.230
k squared plus l squared
that gives you 7?

00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:11.170
You get 6.

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:12.760
And then the next one is 8.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.170
But there is a sequence
that gives you 14.

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:22.800
So if you have a seventh line,
if the seventh line to the

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:28.040
first line, the ratio of h
squared plus k squared plus l

00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:35.530
squared for angle number
7 to h squared plus k

00:32:35.530 --> 00:32:38.180
squared plus l squared.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:43.230
For angle number 1, if
it's equal to 7--

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:48.120
and point of fact it's
not 7:1, it's 14:2--

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.820
and if it's equal to 8 for
the seventh angle--

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.600
then it must be simple cubic.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.300
And now you've sorted
it all out.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.650
So you're an expert now.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.530
Now you can do it.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.970
OK, so you're going to get some
practice on homework.

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.470
So you can index crystals.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.940
You can determine a
crystal structure.

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.360
All right, a couple of other
things we can do.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:11.650
There is a second technique.

00:33:11.650 --> 00:33:18.680
And it's called Laue diffraction
after von Laue,

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:21.120
who got the Nobel
Prize in 1914.

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.440
He beat the Braggs by one
year for this technique.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.750
So he shines.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:29.580
In this case for Laue, it's a
slightly different technique.

00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:33.630
What Laue does, is he
uses light x-rays.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:42.070
That means variable lambda.

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.980
So how would you get a fixed
value of lambda?

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.910
Well, you would pick off one of
those lines, like maybe the

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:51.000
K alpha line because it's
a nice, singular line.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.660
And repress the bremsstrahlung
and so on.

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.370
But if I want a variable lambda,
where do I go for

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:57.940
variable lambda?

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.080
I repress the lines.

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.490
And I go for the
bremsstrahlung.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:04.870
So now I've got lines varying
all across the x

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:06.030
region of the spectrum.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.080
So I use variable lambda.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:13.670
And I fixed the angle of
incidence, whereas with

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:17.700
diffractometry, I use a single
value of lambda and vary.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:20.830
So here's the cartoon which
shows what's going on.

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:23.960
I'll do it one more time.

00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:30.580
So this is called
camera obscura,

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:32.530
which is darkened room.

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:34.600
That's all this means
is dark room.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.110
So let's say I've got the
specimen on the back wall of

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:42.860
this thing, and what I've got
is white x-rays coming in.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:46.920
So the white x-ray enters
through the face.

00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.210
I've got the plate here, and
I've got the specimen sitting

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:51.800
somewhere in between.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.110
And what happens is I
get a spot pattern.

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.390
I get a spot pattern.

00:34:56.390 --> 00:35:13.640
And the spot pattern is
imitative of the symmetry of

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.890
atomic arrangement.

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:25.030
So I have to say a little bit
about symmetry so we know what

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.590
that means.

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.250
So let's take a look
at symmetry.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:32.430
So I'm going to talk a little
bit about rotational

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.680
symmetries.

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:37.740
So let's look at that.

00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:43.150
So first one I'm going to look
at is an 0 0 1 plane.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:46.270
So if I just take a projection
of an 0 0 1 plane,

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.300
it looks like this.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:47.810
Doesn't it?

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:50.650
It's just the cube edge,
or the cube bottom.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:55.080
So it's got a and
a as the edge.

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:59.920
And now, the rotational
axis, it's about a

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.790
normal rotational axis.

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.470
A normal rotational axis.

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.840
So what I'm going to ask is how
many degrees do I have to

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:14.270
go through before I get
this same image back.

00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:17.270
You can see that you go 90
degrees, it'll come back.

00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:20.110
If I stop at 45 degrees, it's
going to look like this.

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:22.120
You're going to say I know
he moved the specimen.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.290
If I go 90 degrees, you
can't tell it apart.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:29.330
So we define fold.

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:35.220
The fold is equal to
360 divided by the

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.630
basic angle of rotation.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:42.240
So we would say that this plane
here exhibits 4-fold

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:47.070
symmetry, OK?

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.000
Let's do a second one.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.630
The second one is 0 1 1.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:55.000
So if I look at 0 1 1,
0 1 1 at this plane.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.100
0 1 1 goes across
the diagonal.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:05.490
So I'm going to take the
diagonal here and

00:37:05.490 --> 00:37:06.880
plot it like so.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.980
So it's going to have
an edge of a.

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.850
And it's going to have the
diagonal, which is

00:37:11.850 --> 00:37:13.940
root 2 times a.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:17.830
And if I put a rotational axis
in the center of that, clearly

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:21.020
if I go only 90 degrees, I'm
going to tell that the thing

00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:21.980
is rotated.

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:25.190
I have to go 180 degrees before
I can't tell that

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:26.940
there's been any disturbance.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.410
So this one here has
2-fold symmetry.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:36.990
We'll do one more.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:38.850
Because there's only three
major ones that we

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:40.180
have to deal with.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:42.540
And that is going to
be the 1 1 1 plane.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.650
And the 1 1 1 plane.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:47.450
And the 1 1 1 plane, I think
I've got an image of it here.

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:51.630
You can see the 1 1 1 plane
drawn in this cube.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:54.540
So what's the face of
1 1 1 look like?

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:57.990
The face of 1 1 1
looks like this.

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:59.920
That's face of 1 1 1.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.940
And if you go through this
analysis, this is root 3a

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:07.750
because it's a diagonal of
a difference persuasion.

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:10.180
So this is 3-fold symmetry.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.610
This has 3-fold rotational
symmetry.

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:17.210
And that means if I take
a crystal such

00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:19.010
as this, for example.

00:38:19.010 --> 00:38:22.780
I've told you before, this is
my silicon wafer, and this

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.310
silicon wafer has been cut
from a single crystal.

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:31.180
So I'm looking at the edge
of an atomic plane.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:33.790
The question is, which
one is it?

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.150
The crystal didn't come with
a label on the side.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:38.530
I don't know what the crystal
growth axis was.

00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:41.320
I started with a single crystal,
and I dipped it into

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:42.630
molten silicon.

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.730
And just like rock mountain
candy, I drop the heating

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:49.350
coils and cause the
liquid to solidify

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:50.490
around the seed crystal.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:53.790
And I grow this salami that's
about 8 inches in diameter,

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.630
about 2 meters long.

00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.020
So now I go and I cut these
things with the diamond wheel.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:01.860
So I'm cutting them normal to
the growth axis, but I still

00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.020
don't know what plane
I'm looking at.

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:08.910
So if I use the Laue technique
and put the crystal like so,

00:39:08.910 --> 00:39:11.840
bombard it with white
x-rays, and I

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.000
look at the spot pattern.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.160
The spot pattern is going
to give me one of those

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.000
symmetries.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.060
And if I get a 3-fold
symmetry, I know I'm

00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.120
looking at 1 1 1.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.490
I mean, it's not going to
be some wacko plane.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:26.380
It's going to be either face,
edge, or diagonal.

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.940
And on the basis of the symmetry
in the Laue pattern,

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:33.830
I can tell which plane
I'm looking at.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:35.420
They use this stuff.

00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.160
They use it to make the devices
that are in your cell

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.160
phone and your computer.

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.260
I'm not just telling
you a story.

00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:41.640
All right.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.610
So let's look at some others.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:45.050
We'll go back to the
Escher prints.

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:47.060
Everything has symmetry.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.220
OK, so what's this one?

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.620
See this?

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:52.870
What's the symmetry?

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.776
4-fold.

00:39:58.776 --> 00:40:02.040
How about this one?

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.840
What do you think?

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.090
3-fold.

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:09.670
I even went into Photoshop
just to show you

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:10.670
how dedicated I am.

00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:11.830
So I took this image.

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:15.430
And I told Photoshop to give
me 120 degrees rotation.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:16.520
And I got this.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:19.020
You can even see the fold
in the book there.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.760
So I'm really doing it.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.630
It's coming back.

00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:24.790
It's 120 degrees rotation.

00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:27.310
How about this one?

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:30.340
That's 3.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:32.040
Now these are real
Laue patterns.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.630
This is 4-fold.

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:34.930
This is obviously 3-fold.

00:40:34.930 --> 00:40:36.080
This one is hard to see.

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.770
But it turns out it's 2-fold.

00:40:37.770 --> 00:40:39.400
The one axis is just
a little bit longer

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.650
than the other axis.

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.740
What about this one?

00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:49.180
That's our simple cubic puppy.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.790
Yes, 1-fold.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:55.190
Translational symmetry without
rotational symmetry.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:57.700
You can make this by just
moving them sideways.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:01.510
But you have to go all
the way around.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:04.070
So that's 1-fold symmetry
translation.

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:05.320
Look at this one?

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:09.960
What's going on here?

00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.360
Is that one of the
Bravais lattices?

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.330
This is called Penrose tile,
again rotational symmetry

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:22.010
without translational
symmetry.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:26.230
You can take a patch of this
and move it rotationally.

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:28.690
But you can't take and
cover a wall with it.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:31.980
So that's rotational without
translational.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:32.930
See?

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:34.960
You can go around this way.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:38.780
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, and reproduce this.

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:43.510
But you can't use this as a unit
cell and keep it hopping

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.280
laterally and tile
a wall with it.

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:53.190
Here's another one, not
a Bravais lattice.

00:41:57.020 --> 00:41:57.390
All right.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:02.080
So I told you at the beginning
of this unit that there are

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.090
ordered solids and disordered
solids.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.560
We've been focusing
on ordered solids.

00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.520
They have a unit cell.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.350
They're periodic.

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:10.180
And we call them crystals.

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:13.950
And next week we're going
to start looking

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:15.920
at disordered solid.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.390
So they have no building block,
no long range order.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:20.920
And we call them glasses.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.020
For a long time, people thought
that solis have to

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.970
fall into one box or
the other box.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:30.390
And then the best thing
that can happen in

00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:32.860
science is not, oh, yeah.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.370
That's exactly what
I expected.

00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:37.370
It's, I wonder what
that means.

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:40.570
And there was one of these
moments in 1982.

00:42:40.570 --> 00:42:43.980
In 1982, a man by the name of
Danny Shechtman from Technion

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:47.250
in Israel, was over here in the
United States working at

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:50.370
the National Institute of
Standards and Technology,

00:42:50.370 --> 00:42:52.800
which used to be National Bureau
of Standards down in

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.240
Gaithersburg, Maryland.

00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:59.400
And he was looking at a set of
aluminum-manganese alloys.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.560
So aluminum is a metal.

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:01.780
Manganese is a metal.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:05.010
You can make a solid solution
which we call an alloy.

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:07.250
And these are highly ordered.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:13.850
And what he found in his Laue
measurements, were rotational

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:16.440
symmetries that are impossible
in a crystal.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.000
He was getting 5-fold
symmetry.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.810
You can't get 5-fold symmetry.

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.290
There is no set of planes
here that will give

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:25.710
you a 5-fold symmetry.

00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:27.440
They lack translational
symmetry.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.010
They were called aperiodic.

00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:33.390
And the popular name for
them was quasicrystals.

00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:37.850
So here's the Laue pattern of
one of Danny Shechtman's

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:39.300
aluminum-manganese specimens.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.250
I think this is 25%
manganese and

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.400
aluminum if I'm not mistaken.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:49.160
So let's count, 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:53.170
You can't have 10 or 5.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:54.460
Atoms don't work that way.

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.140
But he got it.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:44:01.470
He got it, 5- fold,
72 degrees.

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:03.870
Now this is really,
really exciting.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:06.420
This is a shot of
his lab book.

00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:08.430
You're looking over
his shoulder.

00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:11.000
These are the specimen
numbers.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.000
And this is aluminum 25%
manganese, April 8, 1982.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.640
So it's just another
day at work.

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.890
You could be doing this.

00:44:26.310 --> 00:44:27.850
And he can't believe
what he's getting.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.310
He's wondering what's
going on.

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:36.890
You can't contribute this to
a calibration error on the

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.030
instrument.

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:43.320
This thing is on unassailably
5-fold symmetry.

00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.720
The joke is that this is not
far from the Pentagon.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.480
Only within shouting distance
of the Pentagon would you

00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:53.760
discover 5-fold symmetry.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.030
So there it is.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:57.370
So where have we come
with all of this?

00:44:57.370 --> 00:45:01.710
We've come with the ability to
start with some very simple

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:04.040
ideas about x-ray generation.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.460
And we've come to the point
where we can characterize

00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:10.010
crystals, get quantitative
measurements of their lattice

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:12.300
constants, and by using Laue

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:15.210
techniques, investigate symmetry.

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:15.810
OK.

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.040
Let's adjourn.

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.960
We'll see you on Friday.
