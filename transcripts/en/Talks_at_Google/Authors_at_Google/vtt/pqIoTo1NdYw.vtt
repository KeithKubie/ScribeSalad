00:00:05.423 --> 00:00:06.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.753
ALEX BANAYAN: Thank you so much.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.803
Hi, guys.

00:00:11.803 --> 00:00:12.506
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:13.630
SPEAKER: Welcome to Google.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.546
ALEX BANAYAN: Thank you
so much for having me.

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:17.040
SPEAKER: So I loved the book.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.017
The book opens
actually with something

00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:21.600
I did myself in college, which
is that I went to "The Price Is

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.050
Right."

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.540
ALEX BANAYAN: No way!

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.810
SPEAKER: I did.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.490
ALEX BANAYAN: I
did not know that.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.910
SPEAKER: I did.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.650
And I didn't get on
"The Price is Right."

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.940
I actually-- my friend
got the door prize.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.570
And that was as
close as we came.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.180
But you--

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:30.930
ALEX BANAYAN: Wow.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.460
SPEAKER: You made it on
"The Price is Right."

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.251
ALEX BANAYAN: Yeah.

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:35.160
SPEAKER: And that's
a big-- the impetus

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.440
for a lot of what
happens to you after.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.690
So I'm just curious if you were
so good at hacking "The Price

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.890
Is Right," why don't you do
this with other game shows?

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.420
ALEX BANAYAN: Well,
I actually have

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.800
something very funny
to share that I

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.883
haven't talked about much.

00:00:47.883 --> 00:00:49.780
SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.500
ALEX BANAYAN: So after
the whole book journey--

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.360
and this is like last year--

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.070
I realizing the book
tour is coming up.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.610
And I needed some money
to fund the book tour.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.830
So a couple of friends
of mine got a message

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.210
that a game show-- a brand new
game show was filming like 10,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.370
15 minutes from where we live.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.350
And it was-- we checked online.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.440
And the final tickets were for
the next morning at 6:00 AM.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.020
So we cancelled our plans
the next morning, showed up.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.750
We use the same "Price
is Right" strategy.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.300
And four hours later, I walked
away with a brand new car.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.342
And sold the car.

00:01:26.342 --> 00:01:27.800
And that helped
fund the book tour.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.341
SPEAKER: So--

00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:29.215
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:29.215 --> 00:01:30.590
So maybe your next
book should be

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.280
about how to hack onto
national television shows

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.750
where you can win money.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.500
ALEX BANAYAN: It's
worked out pretty well.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.750
I'm 2 for 2 so far.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.680
SPEAKER: So you
stopped out of college.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:43.880
You were at USC.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.610
And you talked about the
idea of a dream university.

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.650
And that's sort of
why you interviewed

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.160
a lot of these people.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.280
How do you feel about
alternative education

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.800
and taking a nonlinear path?

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.630
ALEX BANAYAN: So I had two
different things pulling at me

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.910
when I started college.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.070
So this whole journey
started when I was 18.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.750
I was a freshman in college.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.510
And I was spending every day
lying on my dorm room bed

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.372
staring up at the ceiling.

00:02:13.372 --> 00:02:15.830
And to understand why I was
going through that life crisis,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.455
you have to understand
that I'm the son

00:02:17.455 --> 00:02:20.510
of Jewish immigrants,
which pretty much means

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.010
I came out of the womb.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.780
My mom cradled me in her arms.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.750
Then she stamped M.D. on my
ass and sent me on my way.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.410
And in third grade I wore
scrubs to school for Halloween.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.950
I went to pre-med summer
camp, studied for the SATs.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.210
And by the time
I got to college,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.860
I'm the pre-med of premeds.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.555
And that was the goal.

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:40.180
Work as hard as you
can in high school.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.960
And you get to college.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.380
But very quickly I remember
lying on this dorm room bed,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.050
looking over at this towering
stack of biology books,

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.480
feeling like they were
sucking the life out of me.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.760
So first I assume maybe
I'm just being lazy.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.011
But then I begin to wonder,
maybe I'm not on my path.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.760
Maybe I'm on a path
somebody placed me on.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.460
And I'm just rolling down.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.590
So when we go back to the idea
of traditional universities

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.250
versus a nonlinear
one, I wasn't finding

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.130
the answers I was looking
for in traditional classes.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.320
So I just did what I
thought was natural.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.550
I just started googling it.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.390
And I started googling it.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.806
And I started going through
business books and biographies

00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:19.970
and self-help books.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.506
But eventually I was
left empty-handed,

00:03:22.506 --> 00:03:23.880
because what I
was looking for is

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.676
I wanted to figure out when
nobody knew their name, when

00:03:26.676 --> 00:03:28.050
nobody would take
their meetings,

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.760
how did they find a
way to break through?

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.110
How did Gates sell
his first piece

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.630
of software out of his dorm
room when nobody knew his name?

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.060
How did Spielberg become
the youngest studio director

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.420
in Hollywood history when he
was rejected from film school?

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.380
So to me I actually don't
think they contradict.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.180
Being in a
traditional university

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.290
and taking a nonlinear education
can actually go hand to hand.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.090
For me I made my own hybrid.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.050
I was in school.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.240
And I went to go find
the answers myself.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.720
And what I've learned is that
when you take your education

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.750
into your own hands,
that's when you actually

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.430
start going on the path that's
going to change your life.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.430
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.420
And I think that's great advice
to sort of have both and weave

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.940
them together.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.690
So this is sort of my take
on the book a little bit.

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.990
"The Third Door"-- you almost
use your own third door

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:19.369
framework to create this book.

00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:20.660
So it's kind of meta, because--

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.519
--you're talking about how all
of these major, powerful people

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.310
use the third door.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.520
But you, yourself, kind
of had to use a third door

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.240
to find them.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.240
Is that sort of how you envision
this book, because that's

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.874
the journey that I sort of
saw when I was reading it?

00:04:35.874 --> 00:04:37.290
ALEX BANAYAN: It's
a good insight.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.560
And I didn't even realize
that until I was looking back

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.190
on the book in hindsight.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.230
So the whole premise
and thesis of the book

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.780
is that after spending seven
years tracking down the world's

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.400
most successful people--

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.110
you know when I had started,
I had no zero desire

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.149
to find that one key to success.

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:59.190
We've all seen those Ted
Talks or business books.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.340
And normally I
just roll my eyes.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.100
But what I ended up realizing
is that every single one

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.210
of these people treats life
and business and success

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.154
the exact same way.

00:05:11.154 --> 00:05:12.570
And the analogy
that came to me is

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.850
that it's sort of like
getting into a nightclub.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.700
There's always three ways in.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.750
There is the first
door, the main entrance

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.200
where the line curves around
the block, where 99% of people

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.180
wait around hoping to get in.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.400
And then there's the second
door-- the VIP entrance--

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.360
where the billionaires and
celebrities go through.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.730
And what school and
society never talk about--

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.370
they always make you feel you
either have to be born into it.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.010
Or you wait your turn
like everybody else.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.410
But what I've learned
is that there's always,

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.729
always the third door.

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.770
And it's the entrance
where you jump out of line,

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.930
run down the alley, bang
on the door 100 times,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.846
crack open the window,
go through the kitchen.

00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:49.200
There's always a way in.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.054
And what I've realized
is that not only

00:05:53.054 --> 00:05:54.470
did all these
people I interviewed

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.100
take the third door when it came
to launching their own careers.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.790
I had no choice but to do it
too, because to my surprise

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.420
Bill Gates doesn't do interviews
with random 19-year-olds.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.360
So that's why it took this
long process of running down

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.100
the alley, getting
muddy, getting

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.312
bruised up to make it happen.

00:06:11.312 --> 00:06:12.020
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.550
Well to me you epitomize
the third door theory.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:16.050
So--

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.460
ALEX BANAYAN: Thank you.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.120
SPEAKER: --one of the things
that I sort of took away

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.044
is I'm often reaching
out to people

00:06:20.044 --> 00:06:21.710
and punching over my
weight a little bit

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.420
in terms of who
you reach out to.

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.540
And one thing that's
amazing is your ability

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.660
to find these people,
get them to respond.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.130
Tim Ferriss is a
great example who

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.690
teaches you a little
bit about reaching out.

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.740
So I was wondering if you could
share some insights with us

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.260
about how to reach
out to busy people.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.620
And if you do
actually get to them,

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.430
do you find that people actually
are decently responsive?

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.000
ALEX BANAYAN: Yes, so one of
the people who gave me one

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.310
of the most practical pieces of
advice on this journey was Tim

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.610
Ferriss, the author of
"The 4-Hour Workweek"--

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.390
SPEAKER: Who's been in here
to do talks, by the way.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.590
ALEX BANAYAN: Well--

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:58.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.630
ALEX BANAYAN: --he's incredible.

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.834
And with Tim I was 19 years old.

00:07:03.834 --> 00:07:05.500
And I ended up having
to-- as you know--

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:07.880
I crouched in a
bathroom at a conference

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.040
for 30 minutes waiting
to jump out to meet him.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.870
And I eventually
got the interview.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:13.790
And what I learned
with Tim Ferriss

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.500
is that he started his career
essentially using cold emails.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.030
He emailed the CEO of a company
he wanted to work with 32 times

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.630
until he got the job.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.180
And then when he wanted
to become an author

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.279
he cold emailed best-selling
authors for advice.

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:31.070
So when I was interviewing
him, I naturally

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.540
had to press him on
his cold email secrets.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.987
And he gave me a template
that works unbelievably well.

00:07:39.987 --> 00:07:42.070
And it goes like-- if any
of you guys are curious,

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.120
it goes like this.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.270
Dear So-and-So, I know
you're incredibly busy.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:48.620
And you get a lot of emails.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.470
So this will only take
60 seconds to read.

00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.110
And then you put in the next
paragraph one to two sentences

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.470
max of who you are and what
context you have that's

00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:59.240
relevant to the person.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.080
And then next paragraph-- one
to two sentences max again--

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.890
of a very specific question
they can answer right away.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.530
You know what book do you
recommend a first-time author?

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:12.330
What advice do you
have for someone

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:14.860
who's new to managing teams?

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.970
And then the closing
paragraph is the clincher.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:22.020
I totally understand if
you're too busy to reply.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.130
Even a one or two-line response
will completely make my day.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:27.990
All the best, Tim.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.600
And what's been remarkable
about that cold email template

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.610
is I've gotten interviews
for the book using it.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.684
I've gotten mentors.

00:08:34.684 --> 00:08:36.059
Pretty much the
whole book launch

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:38.700
was brought to you by
that cold email template.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.460
And like you said
it is remarkable

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.110
that when you are thoughtful
about how you message someone,

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:47.450
people are really
receptive to helping.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.040
SPEAKER: Because there's nothing
worse than getting a really

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.100
long email, especially--

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.690
ALEX BANAYAN: Right.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.860
SPEAKER: --if you're
an important person.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.040
But--

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.825
ALEX BANAYAN: The long
essay life story emails.

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:54.325
Yeah.

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.340
SPEAKER: What you found
is, if you don't ask,

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.530
you don't get, right?

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:59.652
So it's a little bit
of a numbers game.

00:08:59.652 --> 00:09:01.610
But I think that's awesome
advice and something

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.310
I definitely took with me.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.460
So you talk a lot
about mentorship too.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.080
And you were mentored by Elliott
Bisnow from Summit Series.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.990
And I was sort of wondering
if you are now a mentor

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.700
having the success
that you've had

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.990
and how mentorship has
changed your vision.

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.560
ALEX BANAYAN: So what I've
learned about mentorship is--

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.070
when you study the world's
most successful people

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.867
in any industry--

00:09:29.867 --> 00:09:31.700
you can look at finance
with Warren Buffett.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.490
His entire career
changed when he got

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.920
mentored by Benjamin Graham.

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.860
You can go to any
single person who

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.067
I've research and interview.

00:09:41.067 --> 00:09:42.650
And there's always
been a mentor who's

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:47.080
changed the entire course
of someone's trajectory.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:49.760
And what I've learned
about mentorship

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:54.180
is that the most powerful thing
a mentor can do for someone--

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.020
of course, there's introductions
and opening doors and advice.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.810
But at the end of the
day what I've learned

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.495
is that a mentor can change
what the mentee believes

00:10:05.495 --> 00:10:05.995
is possible.

00:10:08.096 --> 00:10:09.470
And what I've
learned is that you

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.250
can give someone all the best
tools and tactics in the world.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.820
And their life can
still feel stuck.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.910
But if you change what
someone believes is possible,

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.720
they'll never be the same.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.410
And that's the most powerful
thing a mentor can do.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.560
That's what I'm trying
to do now that I'm--

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.190
the book's out.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.390
And I'm helping out others.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:29.389
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:30.820
You've got to find
your one mentee

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.840
who you can really mold--

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.660
Right?

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.840
So I'm interviewing
you about an interview

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.286
you did with Larry King
who you interviewed.

00:10:40.286 --> 00:10:42.160
So this is very meta,
because there's a lot--

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.310
ALEX BANAYAN: Very meta.

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:43.450
SPEAKER: --of
interviews in here.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.074
What was that like
to-- you interviewed

00:10:45.074 --> 00:10:46.930
Larry King for the book.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:48.550
You met him at
Nate 'n Al's, which

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.310
is one of my favorite
places in LA.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:54.700
And then he interviews
you about your book.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.470
What was that like
to have that happen?

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.840
ALEX BANAYAN: Well, you have to
understand the context of this.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.440
The whole way I met Larry
King is I was sitting

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.550
on the sidewalk--
and talk about meta--

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.369
I'm sitting on the sidewalk
with one of my best friends.

00:11:10.369 --> 00:11:12.910
This is after the eight-month
quest to get to Warren Buffett.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.700
And it ends in a
complete disaster.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:18.912
And I'm sitting on the
sidewalk completely depleted.

00:11:18.912 --> 00:11:20.870
And I'm complaining to
my friend about how hard

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.731
not only it is to
get interviews.

00:11:22.731 --> 00:11:24.230
But even when I was
doing interviews

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.880
they weren't going
the way I wanted.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.360
And as I'm complaining
a car pulls up and out

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.640
walks Larry King.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.460
And I end up chasing him
through the grocery store.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.500
And instead of a
restraining order

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.350
he ends up inviting
me to breakfast.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:44.250
And at breakfast not only
do we become friendly,

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.580
we end up doing an interview.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:47.670
And I've been to breakfast
with them over 50 times

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.800
over the past five years.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:54.810
And it gets fully full circle
when the book came out.

00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:58.050
And he was the first interview
I did for the book tour.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:00.840
So it was truly a
remarkable experience.

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.230
And the one thing
Larry has taught me--

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:04.595
the secret of interviewing.

00:12:04.595 --> 00:12:06.220
And it doesn't matter
if you're doing--

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:06.290
SPEAKER: Good.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.320
It's good for me right now.

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:07.830
ALEX BANAYAN: Yeah, if you're--

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.720
OK, ready?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.997
And you're already doing
about whether it or not.

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:14.580
And it doesn't matter if you're
interviewing someone for press

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.084
or if you're interviewing a
job candidate, this is the key.

00:12:18.084 --> 00:12:19.250
You know Larry looked at me.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.260
And he has that
gruff, Brooklyn voice.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.400
And he's like, the problem
that you kids have--

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.840
and he's telling me that all
these young interviewers make

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.930
a monumental mistake
from the very beginning.

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.360
He said the thing
they do is they

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.060
look at all the
interviewers they admire,

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.850
whether it's Larry or Oprah
Winfrey or Barbara Walters.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:43.100
And they look at their styles.

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:44.390
And they try to emulate it.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.550
It's a natural thing to do.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:49.280
And Larry said that's the
biggest mistake you make,

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.900
because you don't know
why those styles exists.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.670
Larry likes to ask
the simple questions

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:56.840
everybody is curious about.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.010
Oprah uses all this enthusiasm.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.850
Barbara Walters
is very strategic.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.450
Larry said if you're
focusing on the style,

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.350
you're missing the point.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:12.210
The reason each
person has that style

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.670
is that that is what makes them
most comfortable in their seat.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.130
And when you're
comfortable in your seat,

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.500
the interviewee is
comfortable in their seat.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.580
And that's what makes
for the best interview.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.920
SPEAKER: I think that's awesome.

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:28.130
That's great advice for
those of us who interview

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:31.360
and in all sorts of
different contexts.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.800
So you've heard from
Larry obviously.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.200
Have you heard from other
folks that you interviewed?

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.012
And what was their
response to the book?

00:13:38.012 --> 00:13:39.470
ALEX BANAYAN: It's
been really fun.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:44.710
One of the most fulfilling
ones for me is--

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.630
one of the most
surprising interviews

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.860
was with Quincy Jones.

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.210
I knew what most people
know about Quincy Jones.

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:55.230
I knew he's the most nominated
music producer in history.

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:59.550
And he's shaped entertainment
over the past 50 years.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:03.180
But he's the only interview
where I walked in one person.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.480
And I walked out another.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.630
And I ended up spending 2
and 1/2 hours in his house.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.270
And even the chapter itself
I still read sometimes weekly

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:16.600
just to like refill myself
for the inspiration.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.630
And when the book
was about to come out

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.090
we had the early galley copies.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:24.620
And I got a message.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.070
I sent the galleys to
everyone who was in the book.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.940
And I got a message
not from Quincy.

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:33.390
I got a message from someone
who works at his company,

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:37.224
like a random cold message
saying, hey, wanted

00:14:37.224 --> 00:14:39.390
to let you know I work for
Quincy Jones productions.

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.264
And I love your book.

00:14:40.264 --> 00:14:42.627
And I'm like, how did you
get my book, because this

00:14:42.627 --> 00:14:43.710
was before it was on sale?

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.560
And he goes, oh,
Quincy's been walking

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.540
around the office handing your
book person to person saying,

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:52.650
this kid's up next.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:53.850
You've got to read this.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:58.050
And to my surprise, Quincy read
the entire book in three days.

00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:01.770
And to get that kind of--

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.791
I didn't write the book for him.

00:15:03.791 --> 00:15:04.290
I wrote it--

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:04.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:04.620
--the reader.

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.380
SPEAKER: You didn't?

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:07.421
ALEX BANAYAN: You know I
wrote it for the reader.

00:15:07.421 --> 00:15:10.920
But still he's one of
my heroes and the fact

00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:13.670
that it resonated with
him makes it so special--

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.795
SPEAKER: Maybe he reads
his own inspirational

00:15:14.795 --> 00:15:15.295
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:15.295 --> 00:15:18.212
--words every week too to
sort of refresh himself.

00:15:18.212 --> 00:15:18.920
Now that's great.

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:19.650
That's awesome.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:23.600
And it is a testimony to
the power of this book.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.000
So I think one
thing that I thought

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.140
was difficult probably
when I was reading

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:32.420
it is a lot of the people who
you interviewed already have

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.580
sort of extensive biographies.

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:37.020
They already have a
lot of literature,

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.840
videos, all of these
resources where

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.340
you can find out about them.

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.760
What did you feel like you had
to add to that conversation?

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:46.970
And how challenging
was that to sort of add

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:52.130
to what already exists about
Jane Goodall and Bill Gates

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:53.390
and Warren Buffett?

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:55.160
ALEX BANAYAN: So that's
a great question,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:59.680
because that actually was the
hardest part of the interviews.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.010
I didn't anticipate it.

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.910
But when you're going in
to interview Bill Gates you

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:04.690
can't--

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.420
well look, you can take an
interview however you want.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.080
I knew that if I only
have one hour with him,

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:15.190
I wanted to make sure that I got
the most value out of that hour

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:17.640
and ask him questions he's
never been asked before.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.360
And to make sure you
don't ask anything

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.700
that's been asked before
you have to read everything

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.690
about him.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.390
And his biography
is 800 pages long.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.150
And there's hundreds of
articles and interviews.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.510
So before every
major interview I

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:36.100
spent anywhere from
3 weeks to 3 months

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.590
fully immersing
myself in each person.

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.310
And what I've learned is that
the most powerful insights

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:48.240
from every interview
came from a question

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.270
that even the interview
subject didn't

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.550
know the answer to
initially, where

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.289
they had to go within
themselves and think.

00:16:57.289 --> 00:16:58.830
And those are the
moments, whether it

00:16:58.830 --> 00:17:02.940
was with Bill Gates talking
about his negotiations in Japan

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:06.089
or if it was Jane
Goodall talking

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:09.060
about when her mentor started
making sexual advances--

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.030
when you get someone to
look within themselves

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.500
that's when you
get something new.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:16.058
And that is what's
powerful in the end.

00:17:16.058 --> 00:17:18.099
SPEAKER: And you got
really, really good at that.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:19.829
But I think what
you're saying, which

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:22.957
is important is that you
did a lot of research

00:17:22.957 --> 00:17:24.540
and preparation,
because when you only

00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.849
have a finite amount
of time with someone

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:29.449
you want to make sure you
have that focus there.

00:17:29.449 --> 00:17:30.240
ALEX BANAYAN: 90%--

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.110
SPEAKER: Not wasted.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.484
ALEX BANAYAN: 90%
of an interview

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:34.680
happens before you
walk into the room.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.600
It's about how well
you know the person,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.570
how comfortable you're
feeling about the topic area.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:42.660
And when you're in there
if you're fully prepared,

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:44.820
you can completely relax.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:45.920
And magic will happen.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.920
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.390
Cool, well, I hope I
know enough about--

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:51.610
This book to sort of
make it worth your while.

00:17:51.610 --> 00:17:55.062
So you talk about low
points in the book.

00:17:55.062 --> 00:17:56.520
We've talked about
some challenges.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.430
But you had some-- you
talk about Larry King just

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:04.500
now coming off of Warren
Buffett, personal traumas that

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:05.580
were happening.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.120
How did you get
past that and say,

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.860
I'm not going to
give up on this book.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.026
This book's important to me.

00:18:10.026 --> 00:18:12.750
It's going to happen.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:15.950
ALEX BANAYAN: I think
one of the hardest parts

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:18.140
not only if you're
writing a book,

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:21.150
but if you're going out
to start anything new,

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:24.170
whether it's a company,
or whether it's

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:26.830
a new project within
an organization,

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.300
the very aspect of
starting something new

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:33.827
inherently has tremendous
amount of rejections built in.

00:18:33.827 --> 00:18:35.410
If you're not getting
rejected, you're

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:38.800
not trying something ambitious.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.920
And the wilder the idea,
the more you're going to get

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:43.270
rejected.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:48.460
And to my surprise 90% of this
journey was me getting the door

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.140
slammed in my face.

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.110
And it got to the point--
let's say with Warren Buffett--

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:57.130
where I spent eight
months writing him letters

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.420
and calling his office.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.562
And week after week
after week getting a no.

00:19:00.562 --> 00:19:02.270
You have to understand
I had left school.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.900
I'm working full time
from 6:00 AM to 11:00

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.300
PM my only job is asking Warren
Buffett for an interview.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:08.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.190
And you know at month 3
it gets pretty depressing.

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:17.800
By month 6 of that's the
only thing you're doing,

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.680
it gets to the point where your
insides are black and blue.

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:25.140
And it feels like you're
going to cough up blood.

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.160
And what I've learned at
the darkest points, where

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:34.120
there was no hope in
sight is that two things

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.020
saved this mission.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.649
The first is that-- you guys
remember the movie "Castaway?"

00:19:41.649 --> 00:19:43.940
By a show of hands, who
remembers the movie "Castaway?"

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:44.550
OK, perfect.

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.570
So remember Tom Hanks
is on the island.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.519
And he has the
volleyball Wilson.

00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:51.310
There have been many
points in this journey

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:55.540
where I felt I was Tom
Hanks on that island

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:00.730
and no phone, no communication,
completely alone.

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:04.850
And my Wilson-- the
volleyball I would talk to--

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:08.450
would be the core reason why
I had started this journey

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.147
in the first place.

00:20:11.147 --> 00:20:12.980
And I had a belief from
the very beginning--

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:13.860
SPEAKER: Did you have
a real volleyball?

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:16.435
ALEX BANAYAN: No, but
it would be in my head.

00:20:16.435 --> 00:20:18.910
This conversation
would be in my head.

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:20.860
When you're doing
something new you

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:24.650
learn your best friend are
the voice in your head.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:30.380
And I just believe from the
very beginning that if all these

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.080
people came together-- you
know not to promote anything,

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.290
not for press but really just
to share their best wisdom with

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.350
the next generation--

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.050
young people can
do so much more.

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:43.270
And at the points I
wanted to give up,

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:47.330
because my life was
miserable on this process,

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:52.800
I realized this isn't about me.

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.180
And it was holding
onto that idea.

00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:59.210
It didn't re-energize me and
make me say, this is awesome.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.350
It just helped me not let go.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:03.950
And the second
thing that I think

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:08.120
is grossly underrated,
especially now in 2018--

00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:10.500
you can turn on YouTube or--

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.370
you will find a million
business authors yelling at you,

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:15.000
never give up, 24/7.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.600
Keep up the hustle.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.520
How about take a nap?

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:21.910
How about take a fucking break?

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:25.010
And I think there's tremendous
value when you're getting

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:28.160
rejected, when you're getting
your-- you know, just--

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.590
life is just handing it to you--

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:34.050
taking the afternoon
off sometimes is

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:35.820
the thing that
keeps your mission

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:40.090
going, whether it's having
a bowl of ice cream,

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:42.190
going on a bike ride,
or even just turning off

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:45.340
your phone for an hour.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:48.410
Yes, it's not good
to just waste time.

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:50.620
But the worst thing is
to give up altogether.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.830
And sometimes taking
a short break--

00:21:52.830 --> 00:21:53.652
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:21:53.652 --> 00:21:55.360
ALEX BANAYAN: --is
the key to keep going.

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.568
SPEAKER: Yeah, and that
helps you be more productive,

00:21:57.568 --> 00:21:59.442
because you've rested.

00:21:59.442 --> 00:22:01.150
Who do you wish you
would have gotten to?

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:03.220
You didn't interview
Sergey or Larry.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:05.535
I'm sure you have
a long, long list.

00:22:05.535 --> 00:22:07.660
ALEX BANAYAN: There's a
funny-- there's the cameo--

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.542
Larry has the cameo in the book.

00:22:09.542 --> 00:22:12.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.910
It's a weird cameo.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.142
But it's [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:15.142 --> 00:22:15.850
SPEAKER: Read it.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:16.810
And find out.

00:22:16.810 --> 00:22:18.742
ALEX BANAYAN: One of the--

00:22:18.742 --> 00:22:19.950
it's another bathroom story--

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:22.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:27.390
ALEX BANAYAN: --one
of the people who I do

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:32.590
wish I could have talked to
or hopefully I can talk to

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:38.130
in the future is Barack Obama.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:45.150
And of course, I've admired
his leadership ability,

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.105
his political savvy, and his
public service over the years.

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:56.920
But it wasn't until about a year
ago when my dad passed away.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:04.000
You know when a parent passes
away you sort of find yourself

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.690
in this hole where you
don't even know what's up

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:10.490
and what's down.

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:19.200
And I remember the first
week after my dad passed.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.140
You know right when it happens
in your life is sort of filled

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.820
up with the funeral and
the memorial and the shiva.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:31.450
And when that stuff ends
you're just left with grief.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:34.040
And no one is around you.

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:38.580
And it's-- I still can
remember that feeling.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:41.756
And I remember waking up
one morning not knowing

00:23:41.756 --> 00:23:43.130
what I was going
to do, because I

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.260
took a little time off writing.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:51.310
And I saw this book on my
shelf, "Dreams from my Father"

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:52.500
by Barack Obama.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.800
And I had never read it before.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:59.200
And just because of the title
I ended up reaching for it.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:04.960
And I spent that whole day
reading that book and crying.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.990
And reading about how
he lost his father

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.030
made me feel less alone.

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:21.940
And if I do have a chance
one day to interview him,

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.920
that's what I want
to talk about.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.920
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:26.329
I think that that--

00:24:26.329 --> 00:24:28.370
like you've done with so
many of these interviews

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:31.970
finding something
specific that has not

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.480
been talked about before
is such an important angle.

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.020
I think that's an awesome goal.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:40.430
So I hope you get there.

00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:45.380
I hear he'll be back
in Chicago soon I hope.

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.560
So you've interviewed some
really, really famous people.

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:51.477
You interviewed some sort
of lesser known but really

00:24:51.477 --> 00:24:53.810
important business people
like [? Key. ?] You talk about

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:56.859
[? Key ?] [? Time ?]
from Microsoft.

00:24:56.859 --> 00:24:59.150
Do you think there's sort of
lessons all over the board

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:03.590
all the way from Lady Gaga,
who has infinite sort of fame

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.890
to some of these
executives who are famous

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.070
but not in the public eye?

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:09.560
And so what's the
difference there in terms

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.518
of interviewing someone
who's a little bit less

00:25:11.518 --> 00:25:12.970
in the public eye?

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.380
ALEX BANAYAN: So you
brought up Chi Liu.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:21.190
And sometimes like my
friends and I will joke,

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:23.260
because we wrote this book--

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:27.017
I wrote this book when I
was 18, 19, 20 years old.

00:25:27.017 --> 00:25:28.600
We used to think of
the book sometimes

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.340
as like this Coachella
lineup, where you

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.887
have the big names at the top.

00:25:31.887 --> 00:25:33.970
And then you have the
smaller names at the bottom.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.553
But it's the smaller
names sometimes--

00:25:35.553 --> 00:25:38.986
the smaller bands that always
blow you at a music festival.

00:25:38.986 --> 00:25:41.110
And one of the people who
you brought up-- his name

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:42.540
was Chi Liu.

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:44.980
And he grew up in a--

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.870
almost nobody knows his name.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:51.370
And he grew up in a rural
village outside Shanghai, China

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:54.130
with no running
water, no electricity.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.830
People were so
poor in his village

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.480
that they walked around with
deformities from malnutrition.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.900
And we think our education
system's bad in America.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.780
In his village for
every 300 students,

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.190
there was one school teacher.

00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:12.130
But she was very smart
and worked really hard.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:15.704
And by age 27 had made
it to the university

00:26:15.704 --> 00:26:17.620
and was making the most
money he's ever made--

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.440
$7 a month.

00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.070
Fast forward 20 years later, and
he's a president at Microsoft.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.820
And it's one of the most
remarkable stories in tech

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.470
that you've never heard.

00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:31.270
And what I've learned
is exactly what

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:34.690
you said-- that while there's
tremendous value, of course,

00:26:34.690 --> 00:26:38.500
in the Bill Gates and Lady
Gagas in the world, sometimes

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:42.760
it's the Chi Lius that
throw you back in your seat.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:49.430
And wisdom exists anywhere
where there's a good question.

00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:53.766
And if you're asking the right
questions and if you're curious

00:26:53.766 --> 00:26:55.140
you'll find answers
to things you

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.660
didn't even know you needed.

00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.990
SPEAKER: I agree with that.

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:00.448
So I'll try to ask
a good question.

00:27:00.448 --> 00:27:05.400
So you talk about the third
door obviously as a mindset.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.320
There are people who
we know have made it

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.319
through the third door--

00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:10.440
Steven Spielberg, Lady Gaga.

00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:12.330
Can this be applied to anyone?

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:18.500
Or is this just for gifted,
extraordinary people?

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:22.110
ALEX BANAYAN: I believe that--

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.370
like you said the third
door is a mindset.

00:27:24.370 --> 00:27:26.640
It's a framework.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.550
All these books that offer
you recipes or blueprints

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:32.250
for success, I
don't subscribe to,

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.320
because I think everyone's
life is different.

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.670
But you can have a mindset
that opens possibility.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:42.490
And what I've learned is that
the power of the third door

00:27:42.490 --> 00:27:47.770
framework is that it
applies to anybody who wants

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.990
it to apply to their life.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.040
So anybody who's going out
to start something new,

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:55.660
anybody who's trying
to make a dream happen,

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.760
whether it's
career-wise or personal,

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.700
whether you're trying to make
new friends or find a spouse,

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:01.960
get a dream job--

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.480
anybody out there who wants
to make something happen

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.960
and doesn't want to wait
around and hope life's

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.570
going to hand you
what you're expecting,

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.150
the third door
mindset is for you.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.330
Now the hard part
that people don't

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:19.530
talk about when it
comes to the third door

00:28:19.530 --> 00:28:25.480
isn't actually the process of
getting into the third door.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:31.150
The hard part is leaving
the line for the first door,

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.760
because that's where you were
placed when you were a kid.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.140
That's where you were raised.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.727
That's where-- school
has to function there.

00:28:37.727 --> 00:28:39.310
It would be chaos
if kids were running

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:44.150
around all day in high school.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:47.870
And in many times human
beings have a natural desire

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.690
for certainty and comfort.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.110
But what I've learned is
that no one achieves a dream

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.176
from the comfort of certainty.

00:28:55.176 --> 00:28:56.869
And that's the hardest part.

00:28:56.869 --> 00:28:58.410
SPEAKER: I'm going
to invite everyone

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.090
to start lining
up for questions.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.050
I have a few more.

00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.630
But I'd like to open it up.

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:09.720
If anyone has any questions,
please line up at the two mics.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.760
Have you sort of
heard from people

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.590
who have been
inspired by the book

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:15.950
and have gone through
their own third doors?

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.360
And do you have any
specific stories

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:20.159
that made you feel really good?

00:29:20.159 --> 00:29:22.200
ALEX BANAYAN: So the best
part of the book launch

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.845
by far has been getting
responses from readers.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.959
Like even yesterday I spent a
couple of hours just reading

00:29:33.959 --> 00:29:34.750
different messages.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:47.320
And I can't not cry,
because in many ways

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:52.010
this dream wasn't about
this, because this is just

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:55.599
sheets of paper bound up
with ink splashed on it.

00:29:55.599 --> 00:29:56.640
The whole point of this--

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.390
SPEAKER: It's nice, though.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:58.390
ALEX BANAYAN: It's nice.

00:29:58.390 --> 00:29:58.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.040
The whole point of
this mission, though,

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.750
was for that effect
on the readers.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:11.200
And there's been a lot
of different responses.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:13.185
There's a few that
I'll never forget.

00:30:13.185 --> 00:30:17.930
One person was exactly 18 years
old, a freshman in college.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.090
And he wrote-- and the
fun part is sometimes

00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:22.580
you get messages as an
author directly to you.

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.970
And sometimes they just
post it online not knowing

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:25.970
you're going to read it.

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.484
I like those, the ones
they don't even know.

00:30:28.484 --> 00:30:30.150
Like I'll spent a lot
of time on Google,

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:32.300
like on the 23rd page of Google.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.790
The 23rd O is my
favorite O. That's

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:36.980
where the interesting stuff
happens on the internet.

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:41.810
And there was this
one kid who wrote,

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.900
reading this book felt
like meeting the best

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:47.030
friend I always wished I had.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:48.690
SPEAKER: Oh, are you
going to meet him?

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:50.610
ALEX BANAYAN: I
tracked him down.

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:51.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.130
This is like a 19-year-old
kid in his dorm room.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:54.560
And I tracked him down--

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.010
SPEAKER: And you
got your mentee.

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.890
ALEX BANAYAN: His
name is Connor.

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:58.820
I reached out to him.

00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:00.650
I wrote him this long message.

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:03.680
And that really touched me.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:07.160
And so I read that
one a month ago.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:12.980
And last night I read one
those really powerful.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:16.100
It was from a woman who--

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:22.760
she wrote me and explained that
she was in an abusive marriage.

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.040
And she ended up
escaping from her husband

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.150
when her two kids were infants.

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:35.340
And she wrote that
reading "The Third Door"

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:37.690
felt like the universe
was giving her

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:39.300
exactly what she needed.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.400
And it brought her to tears.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:49.070
And the reason that one touched
me so deeply is truthfully I

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:53.570
wrote the book for Connor,
for the 19-year-old,

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:57.640
because that was the
struggle I was going through.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.430
And to hear last night
that it was helping people

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:09.980
who are suffering from something
I can't even imagine just

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.876
was fulfilling in a way
that's hard to explain.

00:32:12.876 --> 00:32:15.190
SPEAKER: Please.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:17.760
JASON: I don't really know
how to segue from that one.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.440
So I haven't finished
the book yet.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.731
And you may have answered this.

00:32:19.731 --> 00:32:22.547
But the Barack Obama kind
of who you want to interview

00:32:22.547 --> 00:32:24.380
made we think is there--
out of all the list

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:25.670
that people that you've
wanted to interview--

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:26.900
and you've done
all this research.

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.108
You get through the research.

00:32:28.108 --> 00:32:30.460
And you're like, I don't
really know what to ask them.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.030
I mean has that happened?

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.200
Like--

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.180
ALEX BANAYAN: First of
all, what's your name?

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:34.750
JASON: Jason.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:36.242
ALEX BANAYAN: Everyone, give
Jason a round of applause.

00:32:36.242 --> 00:32:36.742
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:36.742 --> 00:32:38.450
Give him some love.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:41.120
So Jason, that's
actually the first time

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.802
I've ever been asked that.

00:32:42.802 --> 00:32:44.510
And it's something I
thought about a lot.

00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:45.570
So I'm very impressed.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:47.720
It's a really good question.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.970
SPEAKER: Which is important--
to have a good question.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:51.220
ALEX BANAYAN: No,
it was really good.

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:53.594
When I hear a question that
I've never been asked before,

00:32:53.594 --> 00:32:56.730
I'm very impressed, because
it's very insightful.

00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:00.210
And the answer is yes.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:03.430
There have been people who I've
researched, who I was like--

00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.930
fuck it.

00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:04.780
I'll say the name.

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:07.449
It was Elon Musk.

00:33:07.449 --> 00:33:09.240
You're writing a book
on successful people.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.600
He's a natural person to float.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.880
Look, he's done
remarkable things.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.410
I read his biography.

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:19.730
I've watched his interviews.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.630
And I was like, he's
done a pretty good job.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:25.220
He sort of explained it.

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:30.860
And I've learned
that when it comes

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:34.170
to getting these
interviews for the book

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:41.670
I personally need to have this
immense fire in my curiosity

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:43.440
to get these interviews,
because it's not

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.990
like I can just call up
someone and get the interviews.

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.222
So I need to be really
passionate to make it happen.

00:33:49.222 --> 00:33:51.180
For like you said Lady
Gaga it took three years

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:52.540
to make it happen.

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.120
So with Elon Musk I read it.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:55.890
And I was like, you
know, his biography

00:33:55.890 --> 00:33:57.281
did a pretty good job.

00:33:57.281 --> 00:33:57.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.870
And I sort of just let it be.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:01.950
I like sent a message.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:03.990
But at that point I
sort of just let it be.

00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:06.770
That's a great question.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:08.630
SPEAKER: You speak at
a lot of corporations.

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.989
We talked about that earlier.

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:11.900
What do you tell people
in corporate America?

00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:12.899
What's the message?

00:34:12.899 --> 00:34:13.940
You're sitting at Google.

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:17.360
What's the message for
people at big companies?

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.880
How can we apply the
third door mindset?

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:24.830
ALEX BANAYAN: So I've
realized that when

00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.902
you're in a corporation--

00:34:26.902 --> 00:34:28.360
and it's been fun
in the book tour,

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:32.195
because you sort of just get
thrown across the spectrum

00:34:32.195 --> 00:34:33.070
of corporate America.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:38.139
From IBM to Snapchat you
sort of see the whole system.

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:44.739
And what I've realized is that
one of the biggest things that

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:47.380
holds people back
in their jobs--

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:48.760
no matter what
level they're at--

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:52.520
and I've been hearing this from
C-Suite to the intern level--

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.330
is there's a tremendous
amount of fear--

00:34:56.969 --> 00:34:59.250
fear for trying
something new, fear

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:02.580
for reaching for a
new position, fear

00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:05.620
for sort of rocking the boat.

00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:07.980
And there's all these
ideas that exist

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:10.860
in the company, all this
entrepreneurial energy that

00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:13.580
sort of gets tucked away.

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:15.740
And one of the
questions I get asked

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.830
most is like, how do
you become fearless?

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:20.330
Like that's like
everyone's thing.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:23.510
They're like, how do
you become fearless?

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.800
And when I started
this mission I,

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:31.310
too, was filled with
tremendous amounts of fear.

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:33.060
I was like the scaredest
kid in the world.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.940
I had like a nightlight
until I was 12.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:36.020
You know I was that kid.

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:39.290
And what I've learned is
that all the people who

00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:42.830
I interviewed when
they were starting out

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:47.400
were actually tremendously
scared in the beginning.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.450
So it's not fearlessness that
you should be looking for.

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.430
It's courage.

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:57.350
And the difference is
incredibly important.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:00.140
You know fearlessness is
jumping off of the cliff

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:01.610
and not thinking about it.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.340
That's idiotic in my opinion.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:10.930
Courage, on the other hand,
is acknowledging your fear,

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:14.442
analyzing the consequences,
and deciding you still

00:36:14.442 --> 00:36:16.900
care so much about it you're
going to take one step forward

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:17.635
anyway.

00:36:17.635 --> 00:36:20.340
So that's the biggest
thing I could share.

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:22.550
SPEAKER: And-- oh, question.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:25.970
ZIJI: Hi, so you talk about
when you were at your low point.

00:36:25.970 --> 00:36:27.670
And then you just kept going.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:31.060
And eventually you succeeded.

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.730
But there are some times
that the road is just not

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:34.960
going anywhere.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.880
And some projects are
just going to fail.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.440
And then you just have
to cut it at some point.

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.220
And how do tell the
difference of the two?

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:46.180
Like when do you
decide, OK, this

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.590
is just not going anywhere.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:48.580
I have to end it.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.430
And how do you decide
like, OK, maybe this

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:55.120
could succeed someday and
that I will just keep going?

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:57.340
And my second question
is, now that you

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.020
have written the book,
what's the next for you?

00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:01.927
And what's your next goal?

00:37:01.927 --> 00:37:03.760
ALEX BANAYAN: Great,
and what was your name?

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:04.450
ZIJI: Ziji.

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:05.674
ALEX BANAYAN: Everyone give
her a round of applause.

00:37:05.674 --> 00:37:06.173
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:06.173 --> 00:37:08.910
Give her some love.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:11.500
So that's another
great question,

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.580
because that's a
big question I had,

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:18.450
because when I was just getting
in that eight-month rejection

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.500
from Warren Buffett when
there was no hope in sight,

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.770
the natural thought is, at what
point do you cut your losses,

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:29.320
because there are some
things that just don't work.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.270
So I ended up doing an interview
with one of the greatest

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:36.330
inventors alive today.

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:38.870
His name is Dean Kamen.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:42.790
And Dean Kamen invented the
segway and the bionic pump

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:46.000
and the iBOT electric
wheelchair and the insulin

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.239
pump and the Slingshot
water purifier.

00:37:48.239 --> 00:37:49.780
And I'm sitting down
with Dean Kamen,

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:53.680
a guy who has 400
patents to his name.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.830
Bill Gates goes to
Dean Kamen for advice.

00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:59.360
And I'm sitting down
with Dean Kamen.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:01.180
And I had that exact question.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:08.350
At what point is it
the right time to stop?

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.060
8 months, 10 months--

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:14.070
you know when do you stop?

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:19.159
And he's like-- he's like,
you want to know the answer?

00:38:19.159 --> 00:38:19.950
And I'm like, yeah.

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:20.659
He leans forward.

00:38:20.659 --> 00:38:22.450
And he's holding this
like dark cup of tea.

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:23.460
And he leans forward.

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:27.780
And he's like, I don't know.

00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:28.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.340
And I'm like, are you
fucking kidding me?

00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:32.429
Like, I came all the
way to New Hampshire

00:38:32.429 --> 00:38:33.970
to talk to the
smartest guy on Earth.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:36.520
And your answer is I don't know?

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.010
And you know he leans
back in his chair.

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:41.064
And he actually
looks sort of sad.

00:38:41.064 --> 00:38:43.480
And he's like, you know, that's
the thing that keeps me up

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.342
at night the most.

00:38:46.342 --> 00:38:51.260
And you know, we
ended up talking

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.180
about this for a long time.

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:55.400
And his answer was
incredibly profound.

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.100
But at the end, you know I
wanted something practical,

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:00.600
something that I could
almost use as a checklist.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.230
So when I'm in that situation
I can refer back to.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.110
So I sort of kept prodding
him until he came up

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:09.590
with this checklist of three
things to ask yourself.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.580
When you feel you're at
your-- the end of the rope

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:14.150
and there's no hope
in sight, these

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:15.691
are three things
you can ask yourself

00:39:15.691 --> 00:39:18.050
to decide whether
it's time to give up

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:20.780
or if you should keep going.

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:24.390
And these are the three things.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:28.520
The first thing is-- and
he's a mechanical engineer.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:33.050
So his first piece of advice
was go back to first principles.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:37.640
Ask yourself, is it physically
impossible for this thing

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:38.660
to work.

00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.950
Does it defy the laws
of Newtonian physics,

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.310
the laws of thermodynamics?

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:45.170
Try to prove yourself
it's impossible.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:48.760
Let's say I wanted
to interview Gandhi.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.690
You know the laws of physics
and biology say it's impossible.

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:55.219
So ask yourself that.

00:39:55.219 --> 00:39:57.760
But for me with Warren Buffett
he does interviews with people

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.530
all the time.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.052
So that one didn't work.

00:40:01.052 --> 00:40:02.260
So he gave me a second thing.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.990
He said, the second
thing you should

00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:13.870
ask yourself is before you go
and try it 150 different times,

00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:16.090
take a step back.

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:19.360
And look at all
the different kinds

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.000
of solutions,
because what you'll

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.830
realize is although some people
say persistence is the key

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.430
and just use brute force, Dean
Kamen was like brute force

00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:32.350
is for brutes.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:34.880
It's not the best strategy.

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:38.890
So if you step back instead of
banging on 1 door 100 times,

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.610
look at the different
kinds of doors.

00:40:40.610 --> 00:40:42.190
OK, we can try the kitchen.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:44.410
We can try talking
to the bouncer.

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.660
We can try the window.

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.820
And then try one of each.

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:53.229
And before you go knocking on
1 100 times, try one of each.

00:40:53.229 --> 00:40:55.020
And see if you can make
any progress there.

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.250
So that was the second
piece of advice.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:01.410
And this third was the most
interesting in my opinion.

00:41:01.410 --> 00:41:04.710
He told me a story
of the STEM crisis

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:08.220
in America, the science
and technology problem.

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:12.950
And when it came to
education, a decade ago

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:18.530
people were thinking this as a
natural education crisis, where

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:22.370
the answer was, let's hire more
teachers, update curriculum.

00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:26.930
But still we weren't making
the progress we needed to make.

00:41:26.930 --> 00:41:29.170
So Dean Kamen
thought, what if this

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:31.710
isn't an education problem?

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:34.850
What if this is a
cultural problem?

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.940
And as soon as he
reframed the question,

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.580
new answers began to appear.

00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:44.150
And he created a thing
called First Robotics, where

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:48.350
he created this program where
scientists became celebrities.

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.700
Engineering became a sport.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.295
And it became this phenomenon
having impacted millions

00:41:52.295 --> 00:41:53.420
of students across America.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:54.590
SPEAKER: Engineers are cool.

00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:55.964
ALEX BANAYAN:
Engineers are cool.

00:41:55.964 --> 00:41:57.110
And they are.

00:41:57.110 --> 00:42:00.230
And what Dean Kamen said
is that the third thing

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:03.290
on the checklist is
sometimes the most important,

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:07.010
where if you
reframe the problem,

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:11.610
sometimes that opens you up
to new kinds of solutions.

00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:14.146
So those are three
things I could give you.

00:42:14.146 --> 00:42:16.840
SPEAKER: Do we have any
other questions right now?

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.500
If not, I have questions.

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.029
Oh, we do.

00:42:21.029 --> 00:42:22.695
ALEX BANAYAN: And
really bring the heat.

00:42:22.695 --> 00:42:23.195
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:23.195 --> 00:42:25.100
AUDIENCE: All
right, I'll try to.

00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:28.200
So I mean I was just curious
like in all the interviews

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.750
that are done were
there any sort of themes

00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:34.310
that you might have observed--

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:37.400
[INAUDIBLE] maybe
it's just me thinking

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:39.780
and I didn't want to write
about that in the book.

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:41.000
So I'm curious about
things like that

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.230
that you thought
it may be a theme.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:43.110
But it might not be.

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.997
So in the end you decided
to not write about them.

00:42:45.997 --> 00:42:47.955
ALEX BANAYAN: Like people
who I interviewed who

00:42:47.955 --> 00:42:49.510
I ended up not writing about?

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:51.606
AUDIENCE: Not people,
but I mean say--

00:42:51.606 --> 00:42:53.480
and full disclosure I
haven't read the book--

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:54.920
I just have a jist
from the talk.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.530
But I mean like are
there any themes

00:42:57.530 --> 00:43:01.365
that you observe in the people
that you interviewed that you

00:43:01.365 --> 00:43:03.740
weren't sure if that's a trend
or maybe just that's maybe

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:05.090
some eccentricity.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:07.820
Or maybe a few people that
you thought, OK, maybe it's

00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.590
not a trend.

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:14.445
And so you can't aggregate that
or like some data point right?

00:43:14.445 --> 00:43:16.820
But at the same time it was
on the back of my mind, like,

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.700
could that be possible that
somebody who was successful

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.857
might also have this
side of an attribute?

00:43:22.857 --> 00:43:23.690
So I'm just curious.

00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:25.023
The answer could be no, as well.

00:43:25.023 --> 00:43:25.610
I mean--

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:29.740
ALEX BANAYAN: Yeah, when
it came to different trends

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.670
and different teams of
people that I looked at--

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:41.020
the good thing about this
book is that you naturally--

00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.090
it had its own
filtration process

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:47.450
that I didn't even
know about, where

00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:49.285
the people who
might-- and you talked

00:43:49.285 --> 00:43:51.410
about this in the beginning--
the dream university.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:53.420
So the way the list
of people came about,

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.480
the people who I set
out to interview--

00:43:55.480 --> 00:43:57.770
you know, when I started
the book, I got--

00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:59.150
I won "The Price Is Right."

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:01.400
I got the money
from the sailboat.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.720
And I asked myself, who are
the most successful people?

00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.600
And I don't really believe
in that whole Forbes

00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.341
algorithm of--

00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:12.590
I don't believe you can have
an algorithm for success.

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.146
So I called my best friends.

00:44:14.146 --> 00:44:15.770
And I told them to
come over one night.

00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:18.950
And I said, guys, if we can
make our dream university,

00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:20.630
who would be our professors?

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.340
And they started
shouting out answers.

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:24.500
Bill Gates would teach business.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.610
Steve Wozniak would
teach computer science.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:28.430
Buffett would teach finance.

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:29.390
And that went on.

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:32.190
And that's what
created our list.

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:35.340
And what I've noticed
about that list

00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:41.940
is that there are
successful people out there

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.140
that weren't on that list.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.890
So when I looked back at it the
people we were curious about

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:54.530
were the ones who weren't
handed it from the beginning.

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:56.834
They weren't-- and there's
nothing wrong with that--

00:44:56.834 --> 00:44:59.250
working in a family business
or doing something like that.

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:01.690
But we were interested in
someone who had to start from--

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:03.830
Peter Thiel calls zero to one--

00:45:03.830 --> 00:45:05.840
the people who went
from zero to one.

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.090
And during all the
interviews what

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:11.660
I've realized is there was a ton
of different tactics they used.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.090
And I actually included
them all in the book.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:16.920
But the overall
themes were the same.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.774
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:17.774 --> 00:45:18.565
ALEX BANAYAN: Yeah.

00:45:18.565 --> 00:45:20.045
AUDIENCE: Hi, I
wanted to follow up

00:45:20.045 --> 00:45:22.110
on a question that
was asked earlier.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.420
What is next for you?

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.850
Is there a burning
question that you have

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:28.370
or a new idea that
you want to pursue?

00:45:28.370 --> 00:45:31.560
ALEX BANAYAN: So what's next?

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.500
So I've been working on
this for seven years.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:37.866
And seven years went into it.

00:45:37.866 --> 00:45:39.240
And then I'm one
month out of it.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.198
So it's still very new.

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:44.620
What I've realized, though, is--

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:49.020
I heard this story
somewhere in my research.

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.820
I can't even remember
where I read it.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.670
But it's the story
of a teacher who was

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.910
teaching for Teach for America.

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:57.000
And she was teaching at
a school in Baltimore.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.600
It was a really
rough neighborhood

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:00.420
at a really tough school.

00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:04.600
And she's teaching about I
think a third grade class.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.715
She realized all right, these
kids need some inspiration.

00:46:07.715 --> 00:46:09.340
So she's like, all
right, today instead

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:13.170
of doing our math
exercise, I'm going

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:14.927
to pass out sheets of paper.

00:46:14.927 --> 00:46:17.260
And everyone is going to draw
a picture of the thing you

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.922
want to be when you grow up.

00:46:18.922 --> 00:46:20.150
So she passes out the paper.

00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:21.358
And all the kids are drawing.

00:46:21.358 --> 00:46:23.200
And there was this
one boy sitting

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:28.996
in the back of the class who
wouldn't pick up a crayon.

00:46:28.996 --> 00:46:30.590
And the teacher was concerned.

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:32.890
And he had a sad
look on his face.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.805
But about halfway through
his eyes light up.

00:46:34.805 --> 00:46:36.510
And he starts drawing.

00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:38.210
And at the end of the
class, the teacher

00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:39.230
collects all the papers.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:40.349
And the kids go home.

00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:41.390
She's going through them.

00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:46.410
And she sees that kid had drew
a picture of a pizza delivery

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:48.734
man.

00:46:48.734 --> 00:46:49.650
And she was concerned.

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:52.190
So she called the
mother that night.

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:55.820
And the mother said
she wasn't surprised.

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:58.220
She said that the
only male figure

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:03.210
in his life who's not
in jail or on drugs

00:47:03.210 --> 00:47:04.820
is his uncle who delivers pizza.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.600
And what that story taught me
is that young people will always

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:16.730
reach for the highest
branch they see is possible.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:20.720
So it's our job, whether
it's schools or families

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:25.940
or the media or technology
to illuminate more branches.

00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:28.370
And that's the mission
moving forward.

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:30.170
As the book evolves--

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:34.040
we're on month 1, month
2 of this mission--

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:37.610
as it evolves what
I'm committed to

00:47:37.610 --> 00:47:40.160
is illuminating more branches.

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.160
SPEAKER: That's amazing.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:43.270
Well, you have an
amazing memory.

00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:44.394
And the book's great.

00:47:44.394 --> 00:47:46.810
Let's give you a big round of
applause for you being here.

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:47.980
Thank you.

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:49.975
Everybody, please go out.

00:47:49.975 --> 00:47:51.340
Buy "The Third Door."

00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:52.720
It's a phenomenal read.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:54.130
You won't regret it.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:56.040
Thanks so much.
