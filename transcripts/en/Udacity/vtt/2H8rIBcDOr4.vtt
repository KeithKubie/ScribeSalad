00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:07.099
Robotics has come to encompass a lot of different things.

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.765
I would basically define it as robotic systems that either the actuators,

00:00:13.765 --> 00:00:16.810
the sensors, or the general framing are built out

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:20.500
of unconventional typically compliant material sets.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.929
So using things like rubbers,

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:24.370
using things like liquids,

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:30.609
or even going so far as conductive liquids or fabrics, you name it.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.439
Materials that are not common to what was traditionally used in robotics,

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:39.809
putting that into new constructs and seeing what properties emerge.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.490
So a lot of materials you'd use at home are actually

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.179
reasonably common for the projects that you see online.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.909
They're typically sourced from companies that do special effects work,

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.329
theatrical work where it's- you can buy your silicone rubbers,

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.559
you can buy your urethane rubbers,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.760
and castable plastics, and so forth.

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:04.120
And they're all formulated in ways such that you don't need

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.600
an incredible manufacturing facility with a lot of expensive infrastructure.

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:13.569
All you need is the ability to kind of you know mix the different components together,

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:16.839
form into molds and start building things by hand.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.980
It's a remarkably enabling way of prototyping.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.900
I think that's why well,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.670
that's certainly why we did it that way back in university.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.769
And a lot of people will see online coming up with

00:01:29.769 --> 00:01:34.759
crazy gadgets and art installations using those sorts of materials and methods.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.065
A lot of our design is focused around

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:41.170
driving the sorts of mechanical properties

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.769
that you would need to survive real industrial environments.

00:01:44.769 --> 00:01:47.019
So we take a bit of a different vector,

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:49.780
but you can definitely build soft robots and

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.879
people have built out of any of a number of things.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:55.170
So straws, yes.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.745
Back at Harvard there is the straw bot which is a drinking straw

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:03.430
with a cut in it and has an elastomeric balloon on

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.895
the inside so that when you inflate you can just get a little bendable hinge.

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:08.699
That's a soft robot.

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:12.294
Water bottles, there have been people who have used

00:02:12.294 --> 00:02:14.949
recycled water bottles as preforms for

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:18.069
blow molding to blow mold them into new kinds of actuators.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:21.219
So you can use all those sorts of materials.

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.685
The sort of materials that they use in an academic setting,

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:28.015
the sort of castable tabletop stuff,

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:32.644
they typically have lower quality mechanical properties.

00:02:32.645 --> 00:02:37.250
I can't get terribly into the specifics of what we use.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.496
A big part of the feel of soft robotics is understanding your material science,

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:46.795
and so a large portion of what we've achieved here at the company is

00:02:46.794 --> 00:02:51.129
understanding how composites of lots of different kinds of materials,

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.259
know how they can come together in

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:57.209
a specific pattern delivers you know amazing abilities.

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.495
So that's that's the magic piece of this or at least one part of that is of it.

00:03:02.495 --> 00:03:08.830
But yeah, when you transition from the stuff that you make on the lab bench in

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.740
an academic setting with hobbyist stuff to some of

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.930
the best materials in the world sometimes materials that you've formulated yourself,

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.390
you start to really drive performance and start getting the sort

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:24.174
of abilities allow you to run for millions of cycles in an industrial environment.

00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:28.420
So a lot of people ask whether or not pneumatics like what we use

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:33.125
here at soft robotics is the only way to drive a soft robot, and it isn't.

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:38.685
We choose pneumatics because it has very interesting properties that we like to drive on.

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:42.280
But you can also do hydraulic soft robots,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.280
you can do electrically actuated soft robots where

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.580
you use dielectric elastomer actuators.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.480
You can also do heat driven soft robots using shape memory alloy coils.

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:58.164
There's a lot of chemically actuated soft robots that people have explored,

00:03:58.164 --> 00:04:02.849
that make a lot of sense for certain kinds of medical applications.

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.914
So there's a lot of different ways of creating soft robotic actuation.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.810
We use pneumatics because it makes a lot of

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.840
sense for the customer needs we're trying to satisfy.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.480
So for one, industrial environments already have house air.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.300
Pneumatic systems are an incredibly common way to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.954
power devices in factories, in packaging facilities,

00:04:26.954 --> 00:04:28.524
and so as a result,

00:04:28.524 --> 00:04:31.779
our technology becomes a lot more accessible to you if

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:35.699
we also drive our technology using pneumatics.

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.264
You just plug and play.

00:04:37.264 --> 00:04:39.454
Everything we do here, we try to make it plug and play.

00:04:39.454 --> 00:04:41.979
So that's one of the ways we can accomplish it.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.259
The other aspect of pheumatics that's very

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:47.615
interesting is the fact that air is very very compressible.

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:53.365
So we talked earlier about the fact that passive dynamics is a big part

00:04:53.365 --> 00:04:59.805
of why our actuators are able to get such complicated grips without any computation.

00:04:59.805 --> 00:05:04.525
Well, why not add another aspect of compliance in the air that you use?

00:05:04.524 --> 00:05:09.644
So using air then allows us to get more adaptive grips,

00:05:09.644 --> 00:05:11.509
which is a very powerful thing.

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:12.615
And then on top of it,

00:05:12.615 --> 00:05:15.300
it also makes our systems very, very safe.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.495
So the whole idea of being able to collide with a soft robot and

00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:24.355
not have it harm you in part has to do with the fact that these are inflated structures.

00:05:24.355 --> 00:05:26.775
So if I bump into an inflated structure,

00:05:26.774 --> 00:05:30.299
it simply just dissipates that by compressing

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.435
the air and maybe shoveling it to somewhere else in the elastomer construct.

00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:38.100
So you can create these wonderful robotic systems that can

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.252
work alongside people without creating any sort of damage,

00:05:42.252 --> 00:05:47.340
and it also provides the sort of delicacy you need for some of the,

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:50.549
for example, food items that we handle which tend to be very,

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.000
very fragile, very easily deformable.
