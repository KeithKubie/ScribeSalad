Vincent Oshana.

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:03.369
Ladies and gentlemen,
come on now.

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:04.370
Thank you.

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:05.671
Thank you, guys, thank you.

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:06.839
I've known Vincent
for quite some time,

00:00:06.872 --> 00:00:08.708
and I think the
ongoing joke we have

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:09.809
is the Hollywood handshake.

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:10.643
Hollywood.

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:11.644
Hollywood-- the [inaudible].

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:12.578 line:7%
They act like they know.

00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:13.813
It's like, God bless you.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:14.914
I haven't seen you
in so long, dude.

00:00:14.947 --> 00:00:15.948
Boy, hey.

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:17.283
- I hope y'all doing good.
- All right.

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:18.651
- So good to see you, man.
- Yeah.

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:19.919
So good to see you.

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:22.121 line:0%
The more famous you
get, the less effort

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.890 line:7%
you put into shaking a hand.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:24.891
Yeah.

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.426
How long you been
doing stand-up, man?

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:27.693
- Seriously, for about 10 years.
- 10 years.

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:29.662
I just-- I left the
military to literally

00:00:29.695 --> 00:00:31.064
come here and just
do this, because I

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.231
love making people laugh.

00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:33.332
Were you that guy
in the military?

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:34.767 line:0%
I was that guy
in the military.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.203
I got in trouble on the
first day on the milita--

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:38.638
For what?

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:40.773
I was-- me and my boy Jamal
joined at the same time.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:43.443
And I was-- you know what
I'm saying, like, just--

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:44.610
I was dancing.

00:00:44.643 --> 00:00:46.412
And one of the
instructors caught me,

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:47.814
made me come stand
in the middle--

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.115
because we're all
in our underwear.

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:50.550
They're just making sure
we have no weapons--

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.884
the first day of the military.

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:54.620
So he made me stand in
a circle of 100 dudes.

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.489
And he's like start
dancing right now.

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.357
And I was like-- he's,
like, don't-- just go.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.225
So I'm--

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:00.593
[laughter]

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.595
And I'm running
out of stuff to do.

00:01:02.628 --> 00:01:04.931
He's like, do other--
do other things.

00:01:04.964 --> 00:01:05.565
So picture me.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.066
I'm doing this one.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:08.968
And he tells my boys, he's
like, and you cheer him on.

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:11.504
So picture me dancing like this
and my boys going, go Vinny!

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.206
Go Vinny!

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:16.576
So that was on the first
day, so I knew that I was

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.411
going to get kicked out soon.

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.580
No, obviously not
the place to be funny.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:21.714
VINCENT OSHANA: They
don't like that.

00:01:21.747 --> 00:01:23.182
Yeah, they get a
little pissed off

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:24.750
at funny guys in the military.
VINCENT OSHANA: Yeah.

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:26.319
Were those the people
who influenced you?

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:28.221
Were those the people that'd
say, yo, you got to try it,

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.755
Vinny.
You're funny as hell.

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:30.990 line:0%
Yeah, well, the
real inspiration

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:32.959 line:0%
was my mom, because
growing up she was

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.293 line:7%
the funniest one in our family.

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:35.862 line:0%
Did you have your mom's
support from day one?

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.831 line:0%
From day one-- well,
you know how mothers are.

00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:40.967 line:0%
They're like, you're going to
go there and there's drugs.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.634 line:7%
And I was like--

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.402 line:7%
[laughter]

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:44.470
I was like, yeah.

00:01:44.503 --> 00:01:45.471
And she's like, just be smart.

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:46.672
And no, she's awesome.

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:48.241
She's my biggest fan.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.609
Number one, number one fan.
VINCENT OSHANA: Number one fan.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:50.243
No, you can't get
better than that.

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:51.644
Yeah.

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:52.578
Let's look at some
early pictures of my guy.

00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:53.479
[cat-calling]

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:54.914
Yeah, yeah.

00:01:54.947 --> 00:01:57.283
My first impression was what
the [bleep] is going on.

00:01:57.316 --> 00:01:58.718
[laughter]

00:01:58.751 --> 00:01:59.886
Yo, the dude, the guy
that took this was obviously

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:00.853
trying to have sex with me.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:02.855
KEVIN HART: Yes, yes.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:06.692
And he was like, just
undress me with your eyes.

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.461
And I go, I thought
it was the camera.

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:09.562
He's like, no, no, no--

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:11.164
me.

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.331
Keep going.

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:13.566
He was naked.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:14.767 line:0%
At the end of the
shoot, he was naked.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.336
And I got no clothes
on under here.

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:20.072
I'm like, this.

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:20.907
I love it.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.343
This is a comedy head shot.

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:25.611
This is for comedy.

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.380
All right, we've
got our nice guy.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.582
He's a very, very funny guy.

00:02:29.615 --> 00:02:32.185
Let's take a look at him
and they show you this.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:33.218
You go--
