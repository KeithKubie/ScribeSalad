00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.760
Oh guys, we are so fucking excited.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.780
It's the 10 year anniversary of Nostalgia Critic,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.780
-No we're not!
-But because of that we have to watch, well usually when I do like a newer movie...

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.580
I try to have a nostalgic connection if possible, but so many people wanted us to see...

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.380
Norm of the North, so we're finally going to do that one. We are...

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.860
(Musically) SO EXCITED!

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.360
SO.....SCARED!

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.340
What's this, Jessie? Drugs?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.980
Drugs! I Need it! I need my 'Norm of the North!'

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:48.720
-I wish we're watching that. Okay, um... 
-God... 
-We don't want to do this but we have to.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.160
Lets just do it.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.160
No. Yeah. No.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.280
Let's just get this over with!

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.380
It's the fourth animated Titanic movie!

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.380
I don't think this movie is gonna be worthy of this score.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:10.360
This whole movie is like first draft Disney sidekicks and they said "Nah, that's too stupid.Put it in 'Norm of the North'.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.360
(Norm)Any last words before I eat you?

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.880
(Seal) BORK BORK

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.960
-How is it the bear can talk but the seal can't? 
-Well then why'd you ask him if there's any last words? 
-Yeah!

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.360
Don't identify with your victim. That's also good for Rob Schneider.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.100
Don't identify with your victims; you won't want to make any more movies.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.560
THIS LOOKS LIKE A BAD COMMERCIAL.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.960
Like that one of these bears is going to pull out toilet paper any second and be like " Enjoy the go!"

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.600
(Norm) I didn't ask for this? What is wrong with me?(whining like a toddler)

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.920
Yeah,  I'm gonna say it's not that hard to see why Rob Schneider picked this film, every line is like: "What's wrong with me?"

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.640
Don't believe the haters!

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.700
(Putting on best Rob Schneider voice)"Finally a positive message for ME!"

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.040
It looks like-you know how when you see a good animated film is like "Wow, you're in a different world"?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.200
-I just feel like I'm in a program.
-It does look like a screen saver.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.820
They look like those stupid little animated gifs from back like in the early 2000's like the dancing gerbils.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.840
What am I watching?

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.380
Killer whales should not be sexy. That is a sin against nature!

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.480
I like how they're "Ha ha, a dancing, talking bear" and not "Holy shit! A dancing talking bear!"

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.080
Superman used to live there, but they found they were shooting 'Norm of the North' and went...

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.480
"Nope", picked up the house and moved away.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.680
-She looks like one of those little porcelain dolls that's going to eat you in your nightmares. 
-They all look like that.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.120
You know this movie killed more kids than choking hazards in toys?

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.660
Actually this film itself is a choking hazard, a number of toddlers tried to swallow their own tongues while watching this.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.400
(Film)"Au Revoir" as they say in France, and some parts of Canada!

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.080
French-Canadian Joe. I gotta admit. I don't hear those often.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.800
Plus one for originality, minus three for not being fun.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.960
Kid, you don't need to sit that close to the screen, those glasses should do the fucking trick!

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.360
You should be able to see on the moon. She's going to be legally blind by the time she's 15!

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.200
We're gonna be legally blind by the time this movie's over.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.900
I'd pay good money though, if they run into the Iron Giant's head somewhere in there.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.959
He'd completely like laser blasts the polar bear and then we follow his head back and it turns out,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.200
It was all a con. It's an 'Iron Giant' sequel at last!

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.040
Sherman from "Peabody and Sherman" at a sex change. So young. Didn't you have a feeling? Didn't you have a feeling? I got a feeling.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.760
-Good for them. 
-Yeah, good, really good for them, they discovered who they are.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.940
-The Sims had better animation than this. 
-I'm sorry, I blinked for a second. What's happening?

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.260
I don't know. That guy is a stereotype, I just don't know of what.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.060
Yeah I don't know what yet. I'm afraid if I get it right, then I'll be contributing to that stereotype,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.540
-So I don't want to guess. 
-This movie's so bad,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.660
it can't even be offensive because it doesn't even know how!

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.439
Actually everything in this movie looks like it wants to eat me except the actual animal who would want to eat me.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.120
-Peeing lemmings, because this is where we are as a species right now.
-We're not worth saving.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.980
Again, It's like the movement of this guy could be funny, it's like they're onto something, but they're not talented!

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.540
They need to be talented to make this work!

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.860
Stop that!

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.300
This movie sucks.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.100
(on screen) Sorry Mr.. Green. I was just keeping it real.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.220
It's gone! There's only Norm now! Oh what a shock, something stupid's happening.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.520
FUCK!

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.360
So dancing that's like... the thing...

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.640
(Rob screams into his palms)

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.320
Wait wait wait! But he's the guy with the gun! Why...

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.840
Why would their approval ratings be up?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.260
I swear she said "cancer woman".

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.540
-Did you hear that? I heard "cancer woman". 
-Honestly my ears stopped functioning?

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.180
They've been tuning this movie out. All I hear whenever these people open their mouths is just

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.040
(rob makes static noises)

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.800
You know, let's just imagine that we didn't turn the sound on would you be able to follow this story?

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.460
Like Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin,  you know you'd be able to follow it,

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.740
But it's like this, I would have no idea what's going on.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.760
Every sound I make of this movie is kinda like the No Face from "Spirited Away".

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.160
I'm going more Tina from "Bob's Burgers".

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.020
(Both moan)

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.060
And then occasionally when it gets really creepy

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.210
Ha. Ha. Ha.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.740
(on screen) Sometimes I wish she wasn't so good at her job. If it meant she got to spend more time with me.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.460
Oh, this dumbass...Christ! Christ!

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.460
You just know at this point, this is playing to an empty house.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.540
There's like, two theater attendants making out in the back...

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.000
And even they are getting disgusted and it's like: "Can we find a better movie to do this?"

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.100
(On screen) Norm of the North!

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.300
How did they justify the name? Do they think his name is 'Norma' and his last name is 'the North', is that it works?

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:36.940
No, I got it. This is one of those fake trailers that plays before "Tropic Thunder". This isn't a real movie.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:43.400
-It would be amazing if at the very end of it Andy Kaufman just steps out. 
-"I was alive the whole time guys"!

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:50.760
-"That's right, I was alive. This is all one big punk. Thank you very much!" 
-I would call this the greatest movie ever made if that happened.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.800
It would be trolling to 11. I would have paid good money if they had to mo-cap this entire movie.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:03.820
-To get the essence of Schneider. 
-Man, her genes must have beat the shit out of her husband's genes, because good God...

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:09.460
-That's like identical.
-Yeah. 
-She is just so quickly invested in all of this,

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:14.040
it's like they barely got chance to know each other. It's like. "We're besties now", like when did that happen?

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.250
I don't even know your last name!

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.240
Honestly, I had a talking polar bear suddenly show up and be like "hey. Let's be friends." I'd be like "okay".

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.040
-But if it had the voice of Rob Schneider? 
-Well, no, then I'd kick it in the crotch.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.940
Do it. I can't do it!

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.000
Almost there Rob, we're almost there.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.020
I think. God I hope so.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.740
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.380
Remember when they said he was a poet and he did poetry?

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.520
I love how that all worked into his character and story. Like he said he was a poet and then he danced?

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:47.280
That- that tied together very well. E=MC2 because geek!

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.000
Cuz when geeks find that out they're like: "Oh my God gotta put it on the wall!"

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.580
(To the tune of Gilligan's Island)The movie started getting dumb. it was never good from the start.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.760
The perfect Norm.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.640
Hey, isn't it cool that they have like this love interest who did so much?

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:10.960
Yeah. There's like so many things that started then they got shelled off. It was like "oh yeah, they were in the movie".

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.160
(Doug as Norm)"Time to go back and write my poetry!"

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.240
Ohhhhhhhh noooooo!

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.260
Rob Schneider had sex!

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:20.260
(Wailing)

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.420
Yeah, they actually abandon them there.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.780
(Rob moans)

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.920
(Rob gags)

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:30.400
"Directed"

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:35.320
everything needs to be in quotes. "Screenplay by", "Produced by"

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.589
(Doug growls)

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:40.500
Sucks. Sucks! Ow! Sucked!

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.180
Oh God...

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.240
(Doug growls)

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.840
Just what the hell?

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:54.760
It's just like, all this, it's just "stupid shit stupid shit". It's about this, no now it's about this. Stupid shit.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.700
(Doug controls his anger)

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.620
(Rob doesn't)

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.520
No, sir. I didn't like it.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:07.800
This was clearly draft one. There's was no rewrite just the first thing they wrote.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:13.560
The worst is in my top 10? No, but that might be my top 15.

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:19.780
-There's an almost confidence to it, to have like- 
-No there's isn't!

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:25.180
-This animation is terrible!
-Compared to like "FoodFight!" or something like that where there really is no confidence,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.740
-That is- Well okay-
-or "The Christmas Tree", or whatever where there really is no confidence.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:34.419
-All you did was merely did was say "Well compared to rock bottom..." 
-Yes!

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:41.780
-We have seen rock bottom. I wouldn't put top 15. Maybe top 30. 
-This has no right being in the cinema. None.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.080
This is a Direct-To-DVD...

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:50.140
Like and not even that, and this should be in the bargain bin, direct to the bargain bin DVD.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.940
So, OK, that's about it guys.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.480
It's bad. Don't go see it.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.120
Fuck you for making me watch that!

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:00.800
Bye.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:02.120
Fu-
