- And of course my macho dad
threw a fit,

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:09.175
and he started calling
the house collect every day,

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:12.145
threatening to kill
my stepfather,

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.913
which I think is hilarious that
my poor stepfather

00:00:13.946 --> 00:00:15.982
had to pay for his own
death threats.

00:00:54.286 --> 00:00:57.590
So this is a story about how
I tried to kill my dad.

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:01.427
Trust me, it's hilarious.
Trust me.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.063
So you guys have heard the term
"Blood is thicker than water,"

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.565
right?

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.733
I hate it.
My dad must have said it to me

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.068
a thousand times growing up.

00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.903
"Blood is thicker than water,
son."

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:12.538
"Blood is thicker
than water, son."

00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:14.307
And I just started to hate it
because I think it's what

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.143
family members say to you when
they do something shitty,

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:19.278
and then instead of
apologizing,

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.314
they're just like, "Hey,
we have the same blood type,

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:23.449
so you have to put up with
this shit."

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.251
So I would hear it
all the time.

00:01:25.284 --> 00:01:26.919
My dad would miss, like,
basketball games and graduation

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:29.489
and he'd always say, "Blood is
thicker than water, son."

00:01:29.522 --> 00:01:31.924
And he ended up missing
most of my childhood,

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:35.394
'cause when I was 5 years old,
he went away to college.

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:37.096
Well, that's what my mom called
it.

00:01:37.129 --> 00:01:42.068
You guys could of course call
it maximum security prison.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:43.769
And every couple years on
spring break,

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:46.272
he would get out and he would
come visit my little brother

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:49.008
and I, and luckily my mom
remarried and we had a great

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:52.512
stepdad who taught us how to
ride a bike and build a fire,

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.614
stuff that you're supposed to
learn from your dad,

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.582
because when my dad would come
to town,

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:59.819
he would teach me the stuff
he knew about.

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:02.755
So for instance, my dad taught
me three things in life

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:04.290
I'll never forget.

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:08.261
Number one, you never snitch,
no matter what.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.264
Number two, if you have extra
food at lunchtime,

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:14.667
you only give it to
white people.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.471
Weird to tell a fourth grader.
I agree.

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:20.640
And the craziest one of all, my
dad got out on spring break

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.708
one year and he came back home
to visit us,

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:24.677
and he took me and my little
brother swimming.

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:27.346
We had a great day at the pool,
jumping off the diving board,

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.948
playing Marco Polo,

00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:30.783
and I got out of the pool,
I'm in the locker room,

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:33.319
and I'm taking a shower,
and my father comes in

00:02:33.352 --> 00:02:35.021
and he sees me showering.

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:36.622
He's like, "Hold on, son. Get
out of the shower for a sec."

00:02:36.655 --> 00:02:38.491
I was like,
"Why? What's up, Dad?

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:41.527
He goes, "Son, every time you
take a shower from now on,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.162
before you get in the shower,

00:02:43.195 --> 00:02:44.830
put the water on
as cold as it can go

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:47.700
and then get in that cold water
and shadowbox

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:49.468
until you count to 15."

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:53.472
I was like, "Dad, why would
I do that?"

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:55.308
And he's like, "Son,
the way your body reacts

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:56.976
when that cold water hits it

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:58.978
is the same way you'll react if
you ever get stabbed,

00:02:59.011 --> 00:03:00.379
so if you ever get stabbed,

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:05.351
you'll be able to fight
for 15 seconds."

00:03:05.384 --> 00:03:08.054
That's what my
dad--that's what my dad

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:10.489
tells a fucking
12 year old.

00:03:10.522 --> 00:03:13.326
And like an idiot, I do that
shit till I'm, like, 19,

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.829
and I get a girlfriend
and she's like,

00:03:16.862 --> 00:03:20.700
"Why are we fake fighting in
this cold shower?"

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:22.001
Like, you better be ready,
bitch.

00:03:22.034 --> 00:03:24.704
You could go down at any time.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.707
The shit is real.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.041
So that's my dad.

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:31.410
So my dad only did one good
thing for me life,

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:32.912
of course I had wonderful
stepdad,

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:34.714
and before I was about to start
junior high,

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:36.382
he sent me and my little
brother down and he said

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:38.017
he wanted to adopt us

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.186
and have us take his last name
like we were his sons.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.054
And of course my macho dad
threw a fit

00:03:42.087 --> 00:03:46.192
and he started calling
the house collect every day,

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:48.628
threatening to kill
my stepfather,

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:50.863
which I think is hilarious
that my poor stepfather

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:53.299
had to pay for his own
death threats.

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:01.574
But he would call and he would
remind us

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:03.776
"Blood is thicker than water;
you're my son."

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.911
And he eventually sent some
goons over to the house

00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:08.814
to, like, scare my stepdad,
and my mom made a decision,

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:11.717
like, "Forget it, let's just
keep your last name."

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.587
Which is the only good thing
that my father ever did for me,

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.455
because if my stepdad would've
adopted me,

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:18.758
I would've started
junior high school

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.927
as Brandt Hufendick,

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.163
which I think has got to be
the shittiest last name

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.831
in the world.

00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:27.733
My poor little sister's named
Hayley Hufendick.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:30.936
I don't know why she didn't get
married at midnight

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.140
on her 18th birthday,
but she didn't do it.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.775
So that was my dad.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:37.643
And then after that he
disappeared for, like, 8 years

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:39.478
and I never heard from him.

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:42.815
And I went to real college
in Phoenix.

00:04:42.848 --> 00:04:45.318
And then--
well, junior college,

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:47.586
so kind of real, but I went.

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:49.622
But then one day I got a letter
out of nowhere,

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.324
and it was from my dad,
and he just said,

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:52.992
"I'll be at the Phoenix airport
in three days,

00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:54.293
and I'd love to see you,

00:04:54.326 --> 00:04:55.494
and there's no time to write
back.

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.029
Just--I'll be looking for you."

00:04:57.062 --> 00:04:58.798
I didn't know what to do,
'cause I was doing so good

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.933
in life and I hadn't seen him
in almost a decade.

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:03.002
But then part of me is like,
I got to go see my dad.

00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:04.603
So I went to the airport,

00:05:04.636 --> 00:05:06.939
which was one of the weirdest
moments in my life,

00:05:06.972 --> 00:05:09.975
because this is before 9/11, so
you could go from gate to gate.

00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:11.644
And when I got to the airport,
I realized

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:13.879
I didn't even know what my own
dad looked like.

00:05:13.912 --> 00:05:16.449
So I'm in looking at the bars
and bookstores.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:18.517
I'm like, "Is that my dad?
Is that my dad?"

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.386
And then of course I saw a guy
with a ponytail,

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:22.988
wife beater, brown khaki pants.

00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:25.157
I'm like, there's my dad.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.992
So I run over,
I give him a hug,

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:28.327
and we both fight back tears.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.662
And he tells me how much
he missed me

00:05:29.695 --> 00:05:31.130
and how blood is thicker
than water.

00:05:31.163 --> 00:05:33.299
And he's determined to be part
of my life again,

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.167
and he said,
"I'm moving to Vegas.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.738
I had this incredible cocktail
waitress girlfriend,

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.005
and you're allowed--you know
you can come see us

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:41.340
whenever you want."

00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:42.408
And I was like,
"Okay, Dad, thanks.

00:05:42.441 --> 00:05:44.043
I gotta go back to college."

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:46.512
And I drove back to my dorm,
and when I got to my dorm,

00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:48.347
I called my two best friends
back in Wyoming

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.316
who also had shitty dads
growing up,

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:52.518
and I told him this story
and they're like,

00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:54.420
"We should go see your dad on
our spring break."

00:05:54.453 --> 00:05:56.355
And I was like,
"All right, cool."

00:05:56.388 --> 00:05:57.890
So they drove down
from Wyoming.

00:05:57.923 --> 00:05:59.692
They pick me up in Phoenix,
and we went to Vegas

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:01.827
on our spring break and
spent five days with my dad,

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.163
which was incredible, 'cause we
were just dumb kids

00:06:04.196 --> 00:06:05.664
from Wyoming.

00:06:05.697 --> 00:06:08.367
He taught us about, like,
hookers and craps,

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.869
seafood buffets.

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:12.538
We're like, holy shit,
this is incredible.

00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:14.173
So at the end of five days,
he's like,

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:16.041
"You guys are welcome to come
back whenever you want.

00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:19.211
You can live with me and my
girlfriend in this trailer."

00:06:19.244 --> 00:06:21.380
And then we were like, "Sorry,
dad, we gotta go back

00:06:21.413 --> 00:06:22.782
to college."

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.450
And they started driving me
towards Phoenix,

00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:26.419
and every mile we got away from
Vegas,

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:27.720
we were just itching
to get back.

00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:29.255
And by the time we got
to Phoenix,

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:31.390
the three of us idiots
made the decision

00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:32.858
that we were going to drop out
of college

00:06:32.891 --> 00:06:35.928
and move back to Vegas
to get our dream jobs

00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:39.265
as pirates
at the Treasure Island.

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:41.867
We thought, what would be
better than wearing an eyepatch

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.769
and jumping off a big ship
every hour

00:06:43.802 --> 00:06:46.639
while drunk tourist chicks
scream at us?

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:48.541
We're like, "That's it.
That's the dream job."

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:49.742
So we dropped out of college.

00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:51.410
Our families were furious
with us,

00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:53.546
and we moved to Vegas,

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.047
and of course we don't get
pirate jobs.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.649
I don't--we didn't know
anything about casting

00:06:56.682 --> 00:06:58.384
or any of that shit.

00:06:58.417 --> 00:07:00.986
So my friends sober up and they
go back home to Wyoming

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:03.122
and reenroll in college,
but I was enjoying

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:05.090
hanging out with my dad,
and I didn't want to leave,

00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:06.759
so I decided to stay.

00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:08.928
And then one day I actually got
the dream job.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:11.330
I would go play basketball
every afternoon

00:07:11.363 --> 00:07:13.566
with a bunch of professional
gamblers,

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.568
and one of 'em hired me
to be a runner.

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.603
So my job was just to carry
hundreds of thousands

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:19.905
of dollars' worth of cash
up and down the Strip

00:07:19.938 --> 00:07:21.140
and bet on sports.

00:07:21.173 --> 00:07:22.975
So it was great.
I was making a ton of money.

00:07:23.008 --> 00:07:25.945
Everything was good, so I told
my dad we're moving out

00:07:25.978 --> 00:07:27.947
of this trailer and I rented
this beautiful house

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:29.515
on a golf course.

00:07:29.548 --> 00:07:31.450
And I started calling my little
brother who lived in Portland

00:07:31.483 --> 00:07:35.855
at the time, just a little
stoner dude that ran a Subway.

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.990
And I told him you got to come
to Vegas.

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:39.758
It's me, you and dad;
we can finally be a perfect

00:07:39.791 --> 00:07:42.261
little family again,
and he's like, "All right."

00:07:42.294 --> 00:07:44.463
And he moved to Vegas,
and we had a great time

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:45.865
the first six months.

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:47.466
We'd sit on the back porch
every night,

00:07:47.499 --> 00:07:49.969
just get drunk, tell stories.

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:52.104
He'd tell us about prison riots
and shit

00:07:52.137 --> 00:07:54.273
and we'd tell him about
scoring 8 points

00:07:54.306 --> 00:07:55.541
in a JV basketball game,

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:57.309
or whatever shitty stories
we had.

00:07:57.342 --> 00:07:59.311
He obviously had
much better stories.

00:07:59.344 --> 00:08:01.480
But he was always just waiting
to get off parole.

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:03.282
He's like, "I can't wait to get
off parole.

00:08:03.315 --> 00:08:04.517
I can be my own man again."

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.784
And he'd talk about it
every day,

00:08:05.817 --> 00:08:07.019
and we counted down the days

00:08:07.052 --> 00:08:08.787
till he finally got off
parole.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.990
And I remember I threw
a big party at the house,

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:13.158
invited all our family
and friends over,

00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:14.560
and we just got wasted.

00:08:14.593 --> 00:08:16.161
And I remember about 4:00
in the morning,

00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:18.664
it's just me and my dad
and brother in the kitchen,

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:20.466
and we're just telling him
how proud we are

00:08:20.499 --> 00:08:23.235
and we're just drunk and it's
this incredible moment,

00:08:23.268 --> 00:08:26.372
and then--but that is the last
good moment

00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:28.307
I'll ever have with my dad,

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.243
because the next morning he
woke up, got back on drugs,

00:08:31.276 --> 00:08:35.014
started bringing around, like,
little 20-year-old meth heads

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:36.682
to my house, even though
they're younger than me.

00:08:36.715 --> 00:08:38.183
My dad's, like, 48
at the time.

00:08:38.216 --> 00:08:40.553
And he starts just acting like
a drug addict,

00:08:40.586 --> 00:08:42.221
you know, stealing my
friends' wallets,

00:08:42.254 --> 00:08:45.190
forgetting my birthday,
just being a shitty dad,

00:08:45.223 --> 00:08:46.559
and I knew it was going bad,

00:08:46.592 --> 00:08:48.027
but I didn't know how
to get out of it.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.696
And you know, it's hard to yell
at your own dad,

00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:53.098
and I knew it was going to
happen.

00:08:53.131 --> 00:08:55.434
And then on a Saturday
during football season

00:08:55.467 --> 00:08:57.202
I'd have to bet
college football all day,

00:08:57.235 --> 00:08:59.171
so I'd get to the Strip at 8:00
in the morning.

00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:01.674
I'd run up and down and bet
till, like, 9:00 at night.

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:03.175
Then I'd go home, go to bed,

00:09:03.208 --> 00:09:05.578
and then do the same thing
for NFL on Sundays.

00:09:05.611 --> 00:09:07.413
So on the Saturday
I worked my ass off,

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.248
I come home, I'm exhausted.

00:09:09.281 --> 00:09:11.183
When I get home, my dad's there
all cracked out,

00:09:11.216 --> 00:09:13.052
and I tell him, "Hey Dad,
I'm going to bed.

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:15.287
You can come down tomorrow
and get everything comped

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.622
if you want to watch football."

00:09:16.655 --> 00:09:17.923
He's like, "Okay, son."

00:09:17.956 --> 00:09:20.559
And I went to sleep
about 10:00.

00:09:20.592 --> 00:09:22.628
Around midnight, my little
brother busts in

00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:24.063
and he's like,
"Hey, Brandt, Brandt,

00:09:24.096 --> 00:09:25.531
someone stole my money."

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:28.734
My little brother had saved
up $350 to fly to Portland

00:09:28.767 --> 00:09:31.103
to watch his girlfriend
graduate college.

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:32.738
So I jump out of bed,
like the big brother,

00:09:32.771 --> 00:09:34.707
and I run downstairs to try
to find my dad

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.643
and tell--to find whatever
little shitty kid

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:39.211
took my brother's money.

00:09:39.244 --> 00:09:41.046
So when I get downstairs,
I don't see him,

00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:42.881
I'm telling for him, and I go
look in the garage,

00:09:42.914 --> 00:09:45.417
'cause my white trash dad has
this stupid convertible

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:48.253
Camaro that he thought was,
like, the dopest car

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:51.123
in the world, and it always had
to be parked in the garage.

00:09:51.156 --> 00:09:52.658
So when I got in the garage
and I looked

00:09:52.691 --> 00:09:55.728
and his Camaro was gone,
it hit me:

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.930
Oh, shit, I got all my money
upstairs.

00:09:57.963 --> 00:09:59.832
And I ran upstairs and my dad
had stole

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:02.434
$80,000 cash from me.

00:10:02.467 --> 00:10:04.837
And now, I worked for guys that
you don't want to be

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.473
$80,000 short for,
not that there's any job

00:10:07.506 --> 00:10:10.409
you could $80,000 short for.

00:10:10.442 --> 00:10:13.312
But I'll never forget that, and
I see my little brother crying,

00:10:13.345 --> 00:10:14.980
and I'm like, you stole 80,000;

00:10:15.013 --> 00:10:18.684
why would you go steal your own
son's $350, you know?

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:21.153
And it just drove me crazy, and
to watch my little brother cry,

00:10:21.186 --> 00:10:23.455
you know, I brought him from
Portland, he was doing good,

00:10:23.488 --> 00:10:25.124
and I brought him
into this shit.

00:10:25.157 --> 00:10:26.792
So in that moment, I made
the decision, I'm like,

00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:29.495
that's it; I'm gonna fucking
kill my dad.

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:31.296
I'm gonna fucking kill my dad.

00:10:31.329 --> 00:10:33.799
So the next morning I wake up
and I call my cousin Kato

00:10:33.832 --> 00:10:36.602
who lives in Phoenix,
and he's like...

00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:38.170
[laughter]
He's like a real gangster

00:10:38.203 --> 00:10:40.205
and the most loyal dude
in my life, and I tell him

00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:41.640
what happens.

00:10:41.673 --> 00:10:45.444
He says, "I'll be there
in five hours."

00:10:45.477 --> 00:10:48.647
And he drives straight
from Phoenix to Vegas,

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.115
and when he gets there,
doorbell rings,

00:10:50.148 --> 00:10:51.717
I open the door,
and there he is.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:53.052
He's like, "Where's he at?
Where's he at?"

00:10:53.085 --> 00:10:55.721
I was like, "Hold on.
I got a plan."

00:10:55.754 --> 00:10:57.956
Now, in my defense,
I was 23 years old.

00:10:57.989 --> 00:11:01.527
I'd never killed anybody
before.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.195
This is before "Dexter,"
"Breaking Bad."

00:11:03.228 --> 00:11:05.297
This is obviously
a fucking stupid plan,

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.166
but this was my plan.

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:10.169
My mom had told me a story
that when I was young,

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:12.838
my dad had cheated on my mom
and got chlamydia

00:11:12.871 --> 00:11:14.406
and he had to go to the doctor,

00:11:14.439 --> 00:11:16.542
and the doctor prescribed him
penicillin,

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:19.178
not knowing that he was deathly
allergic to penicillin.

00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:22.014
So he took that penicillin
and he almost died.

00:11:22.047 --> 00:11:24.383
So in my head, I was like,
"That's it."

00:11:24.416 --> 00:11:25.718
You know, almost every morning

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:27.352
my dad would go to
the Jamba Juice,

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:29.722
like, three blocks from my
house, get a Jamba Juice.

00:11:29.755 --> 00:11:31.857
I mean, that was, like,
his favorite thing,

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:35.227
so I figured, fuck it, if
I just get some penicillin,

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:36.562
put it in a Jamba Juice,

00:11:36.595 --> 00:11:38.697
give it to my dad,
he'll drink it,

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.234
he'll be dead, perfect.
Airtight plan.

00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:44.036
So I tell my cousin,
he's like, "All right,

00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:45.404
I mean, I can get penicillin."

00:11:45.437 --> 00:11:47.606
So I was like...

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:51.677
He's like, he can get anything,
trust me.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.278
So he's like, all right.

00:11:53.311 --> 00:11:54.680
I go, one more part of this
plan, everyone will think,

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:55.781
like, I'm the number one
suspect,

00:11:55.814 --> 00:11:57.216
so I'm gonna go to Colorado

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:59.218
and you guys just take care of
this shit.

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:00.686
They're like, all right,
you're kind of a pussy,

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:01.920
but we'll do it.

00:12:01.953 --> 00:12:03.388
And I was like, all right,
good.

00:12:03.421 --> 00:12:05.424
I don't want to go to college
like my dad.

00:12:05.457 --> 00:12:06.726
So...

00:12:08.593 --> 00:12:10.229
I fly to Colorado, you know.

00:12:10.262 --> 00:12:11.897
Me and girlfriend go to
Estes Park.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.632
We go to a hotel, and I call
my cousin Kato.

00:12:13.665 --> 00:12:14.633
I'm like, "Yo, are you ready?"

00:12:14.666 --> 00:12:15.868
He's like, "We're ready.

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:18.370
Extra-large mango
in the fridge

00:12:18.403 --> 00:12:20.205
just waiting for your dad to
come home."

00:12:20.238 --> 00:12:22.775
I was like, all right, cool,
call me when he's dead.

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:24.409
He's like, all right.

00:12:24.442 --> 00:12:26.812
So I wait about a hour,
two hours, no phone call.

00:12:26.845 --> 00:12:28.247
I call him back, I'm like,
"Yo, what happened?"

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.915
They're like, "Well,
your dad came home,

00:12:29.948 --> 00:12:31.550
but he wouldn't take it."

00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:32.918
I was like, "What do you mean
he wouldn't take it?"

00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:34.419
Like, we gave him
the Jamba Juice,

00:12:34.452 --> 00:12:35.954
but he just put it back on
the kitchen counter.

00:12:35.987 --> 00:12:37.589
I was like--and looking back,
I get it.

00:12:37.622 --> 00:12:40.425
You know, my dad was in
Leavenworth and real prison,

00:12:40.458 --> 00:12:42.427
so he knows you don't take,
like, a gift

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.163
from your enemy, you know?

00:12:44.196 --> 00:12:45.764
I don't think he thought we
were trying to kill him,

00:12:45.797 --> 00:12:47.065
but he probably thought
we pissed in it

00:12:47.098 --> 00:12:49.168
or something stupid, right?

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:51.270
So I said, you know what,
forget it.

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:54.106
This plan's stupid.
Just go with the original plan.

00:12:54.139 --> 00:12:57.943
Pack up my brother's stuff,
go to Phoenix,

00:12:57.976 --> 00:12:59.344
I'll fly home, we'll just never
talk to my dad again.

00:12:59.377 --> 00:13:03.015
My cousin's
like "No, fuck that.

00:13:03.048 --> 00:13:04.683
We do it my way now."

00:13:04.716 --> 00:13:06.952
I'm like, "What's your way?"
He's like, "We do it my way.

00:13:06.985 --> 00:13:10.489
We'll call you in an hour,"
and he hung up the phone.

00:13:10.522 --> 00:13:12.457
And I just sat there in
the hotel like,

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:13.826
what are they gonna do?

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:15.294
And this is the plan
they came up with.

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:18.297
So they knew my dad loved
that stupid Camaro

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.966
and it always had to be parked
in the garage.

00:13:20.999 --> 00:13:22.935
So what they did was,
they opened the garage door

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:24.937
and then they went out
and they cut the phone lines

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.805
and the power lines
and the just waited

00:13:26.838 --> 00:13:28.140
for my dad to come home

00:13:28.173 --> 00:13:30.042
in this dark corner
in the garage.

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:32.344
Sure enough, my dad came home
just like they thought,

00:13:32.377 --> 00:13:34.980
parked in the garage, hit the
button to get the garage

00:13:35.013 --> 00:13:36.648
to shut, it wouldn't shut.

00:13:36.681 --> 00:13:38.383
They said he was so frustrated,
he didn't know what was

00:13:38.416 --> 00:13:41.153
going on and he got out of
the car, went over,

00:13:41.186 --> 00:13:44.156
got the garage door, manually
shut it, and locked it.

00:13:44.189 --> 00:13:45.724
And as soon as he locked it

00:13:45.757 --> 00:13:47.125
and started to walk back
through the garage

00:13:47.158 --> 00:13:48.627
into the house,
my brother and cousin

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:50.195
jumped out with golf clubs

00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:54.132
and tried to kill him in
the garage with golf clubs.

00:13:54.165 --> 00:13:58.036
But they were fucking idiots,
because there was no light.

00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:59.838
So they're swinging
their hearts out,

00:13:59.871 --> 00:14:02.174
almost killing each other.

00:14:02.207 --> 00:14:03.976
It's like we needed a better
murder caddy.

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:05.711
They fucked it all up.

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:08.714
But there was--the only light
coming into the garage

00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:10.883
was there was a side door that
led to the backyard,

00:14:10.916 --> 00:14:12.718
and at the bottom of that
side door

00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:14.519
there was a little doggy door,

00:14:14.552 --> 00:14:16.488
and there was a little light
coming through,

00:14:16.521 --> 00:14:18.757
and my dad saw that light and
he just put his shoulder down

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:20.359
and ran and busts
through that door

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:22.928
and fell into the backyard,
jumped over the back wall

00:14:22.961 --> 00:14:25.097
onto the golf course
and ran away.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.065
And that was, like,
17 years ago

00:14:27.098 --> 00:14:30.235
and I never saw him or spoke to
him since that day.

00:14:30.268 --> 00:14:31.904
So my brother and cousin go to
Phoenix.

00:14:31.937 --> 00:14:34.606
Three days later,
I fly back from Colorado,

00:14:34.639 --> 00:14:36.675
and I'll never forget I was
standing in the garage

00:14:36.708 --> 00:14:38.343
with this garden hose

00:14:38.376 --> 00:14:40.512
trying to clean up the mess
they made,

00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:41.880
and that's when it hit me.

00:14:41.913 --> 00:14:43.348
I was like, my dad was right
this whole time.

00:14:43.381 --> 00:14:46.051
His blood is way thicker
than water.

00:14:49.087 --> 00:14:50.622
I'm Brandt Tobler.
You guys have been awesome.

00:14:50.655 --> 00:14:51.690
Thank you guys.

00:14:51.723 --> 00:14:52.891
[cheers and applause]

00:14:52.924 --> 00:14:54.894
