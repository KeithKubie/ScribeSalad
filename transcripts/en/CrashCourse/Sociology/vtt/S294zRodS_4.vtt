00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.820
The average American spends 13 and a half
years of their life in school.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.580
And that's not counting the amount of time
that you spend watching Crash Course.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.470
Getting a bachelor’s degree means spending
upwards of 17 years as a student.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.820
And advanced degrees like medical degrees
or PhDs can tack on another 4 to 6 years on
top of that.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.580
So, why do we spend so much time in the classroom?

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.819
With so much information available to us with
just a few taps on our phones and computers,

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.340
it might seem like sitting in a classroom
to learn about the world isn’t really necessary
anymore.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.560
But educational institutions aren’t just places
where we learn facts – and Google is no substitute
for the social functions that schools provide.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.300
In fact, neither is Crash Course.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:45.420
So let’s take a look at how educational institutions are
organized in our society and what those institutional
structures can tell us about how our society functions.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:56.080
[Theme Music]

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.180
You know what I mean when I talk
about “Education,” right?

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.220
For our purposes, education is the social institution
through which society provides its members with all
kinds of important knowledge,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.060
not just basic facts and job skills but
also cultural norms and values.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.800
And this can come in the form of formal schooling,
where instruction comes from specially trained
teachers, but it doesn’t have to.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.400
What education has looked like across different
eras and different places is very different from
the schooling that you probably know.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.960
Historically, education was a privilege of
the wealthy.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.000
In fact, the word school comes from the Greek
word for leisure – ‘Scole’.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.120
In Ancient Greece, wealthy young men spent
their free time learning from scholars like
Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.100
Nowadays, most high-income countries
have formal schooling systems that are
available to everyone.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.920
So the amount of schooling that the average
person gets in most societies is closely tied to the
country’s level of economic development.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.920
While young people in the US can expect to
spend at least 12 years in school,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.060
those who live in lower-income countries are much
more likely to never get past middle school.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.780
The US, however, will be the setting that we’ll
be using to explore how sociology understands
education as a social institution.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.080
So let’s go right to the Thought Bubble for a
quick overview of how schooling is structured
in the United States.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.300
In the US, publicly funded schools have existed
since almost the beginning of our country.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.260
Thomas Jefferson was an early proponent of
separating schools from religious institutions, which
at the time were the main providers of education.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.040
The widespread availability of public schools
really took off in the middle of the 19th century,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:32.540
when politician and educational reformer
Horace Mann pushed for Massachusetts to create a
formalized, state funded system of primary schools.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.860
By 1918, all states had passed mandatory
education laws, which required children to attend
school until they reached the age of 16.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.620
A major aim of these laws was to promote literacy.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.280
Both Jefferson and Mann pushed for public education
systems because they believed that a well-educated
populace was a necessary requirement for a democracy.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.960
Nowadays, about 87% of students in the US
attend public schools, which start in kindergarten
when children are five.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.960
And when I say public schools, this refers
to schools funded through the government
with taxpayer dollars.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.700
And of course, US public schools are organized
into primary and secondary education.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.560
Compulsory education starts with elementary
school, which begins for most Americans around age
5 and continues through 5th grade, until ages 10 or 11.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.860
These grades are considered “primary”
schooling.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:23.200
Starting at age 11 or 12, children enter middle-
or junior high school, which consists of grades
6th through 8th in most states.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.000
Around age 14, they typically enter high school,
which often includes 9th through 12th grades.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Middle and High school are also referred to
as “secondary schooling.”

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.500
And many school districts offer alternatives
to the standard high school curriculum,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.820
in the form of Vocational and Technical training
schools, sometimes known as VoTech schools.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.980
Votech schools focus on teaching specific
skills, like automotive repair or cosmetology,

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.140
and students leave school with certifications
that help them enter the workforce right away.

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.280
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.740
Another educational option is private school
– those schools not funded by taxpayer dollars.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.480
Why might a family choose a private school
over a public school?

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.660
Well, for one thing, private schools are often able
to tailor their curricula to specific populations.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:08.820
Because public schools are open to everybody, they try
to serve the widest swath of the student populace –
what’s sometimes referred to as ‘teaching the middle.’

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.200
So the 10% of American students who attend
private schools might be there in search of a
more rigorous education.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.620
Parents of kids with disabilities may also choose a
private school that's specially tailored to their child’s
needs, which may not be available in a public school.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.700
And it's worth pointing out that most private
schools in the US are religiously affiliated.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.580
These schools provide religious instruction
alongside academic training – a practice that's
not allowed in public schools.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.060
You know, because of the whole separation
of church and state thing in the Constitution.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.100
Another option for parents who don't want to
send their kids to public school is homeschooling.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.220
That's just where a kid is educated at home,
typically by a parent.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.780
About 3% of students in the US are homeschooled.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.400
All of these different approaches to education
cover the K-12 years, when children are required
to attend school.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.300
But some people may choose to keep going to
school and enter post-secondary institutions,
better known as college or university.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.980
Unlike primary and secondary schooling,
post-secondary schooling – in the US at least –
is largely funded by the students themselves.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.440
Public state colleges and universities are
joint ventures between taxpayers and students,
who pay some tuition to attend.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.340
Two-year colleges, sometimes known as
junior or community colleges,

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:18.360
typically give associates degrees, technical
certifications, and sometimes high-school
equivalency degrees, or GEDs.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:25.300
The highest level of education attained by
28% of Americans over the age of 25 is attending
some college or have a two-year degree.

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.380
Four-year institutions in the US can either be
public universities, funded jointly by state taxes
and student tuition,

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.780
or private universities funded almost exclusively
through tuition and private donations.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.860
The reason I keep talking about funding is that,
in the US, paying for college is one of the highest
barriers to getting a post-secondary education.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.520
As a result, going to college is by no means
a given for Americans.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.960
Only 32.5% of Americans over the age of 25
have graduated with a bachelor’s degree from
a four-year university.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:06:00.320
Of these graduates, about one third will go on to
get more education, like medical school or a masters
or a doctorate in a discipline like sociology.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.080
12% of American over the age of 25 have some
sort of advanced degree.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.220
Education must matter an awful lot for people
to willingly choose to spend so much time
and money on it.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:15.220
And, of course, our schools of sociological thought
can help us understand how educational systems
help shape society,

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.340
and why education carries such
importance in people’s lives.

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.060
Today, we’ll be looking at Structural Functionalism
and Symbolic Interactionism and next week,

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.160
we’ll look more in-depth at education using
a conflict theory perspective.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.200
As you might expect by this point, structural
functionalism looks at how formal education helps
keep a society running smoothly.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.460
Because structural functionalism looks at
everything that way.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.180
And we can think of how education works in society,
in terms of both manifest and latent functions.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.760
Manifest functions are the intended consequences
of education.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.800
And an obvious example of a manifest function is
just...teaching kids the basic facts about the world.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.820
It’s pretty hard to get through the world
without knowing how to read or write.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:56.820
And even for people who don’t use math every
single day, it’s pretty useful to be able to calculate a
20% tip without needing to pull out a calculator.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.760
Another manifest function of schooling is
socialization.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.440
By going to school outside the home, kids
begin to learn norms and values beyond what
their parents might teach them.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.500
For example, schools engage in cultural
transmission, or passing along knowledge
to a new generation of citizens.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:18.320
Children in public schools start their day
by pledging allegiance to the American flag
– and by doing so, learn patriotic values.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:25.780
Similarly, civics and history courses teach them
how political processes work, which helps create a
well-informed, well-functioning civil society.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:33.660
In this way, schools also act to promote social
integration, taking people from different backgrounds
and exposing them to social norms and cultural values,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.060
in an effort to promote a shared
understanding of the social world.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:44.300
And educational institutions do more than just pass
on knowledge – they also help us create new knowledge
through cultural innovation and research.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:50.900
Every major advance in our society – whether it's the
technology of self-driving cars, or new understandings
of the inequalities we see in the world –

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.480
has been possible because it built on the
knowledge we learn in schools.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:08:01.580
Yet another manifest function of schools is to
educate the future workforce, teaching the skills that
people need to be productive members of society.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:07.960
So formal education acts as a form of credentialing,
a way of establishing someone’s qualifications
to work in a certain field.

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.280
You know that diploma you got when you graduated
– or will get when you do graduate?

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.700
That's documented proof of your credentials.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:17.540
And educational credentials are often used
as a way of determining social status –

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:23.000
they determine social placement by telling us
who can access which jobs, and how much they
should be paid for that work –

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.300
factors that determine socioeconomic status.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:31.860
Now, in addition to all of these intended functions
of education, there are some unintended consequences,
or latent functions, of schooling, too.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.720
One of the more important ones is learning
how to be a good 9 to 5 worker.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.380
Horace Mann’s original vision of public schools
was based on a Prussian model of schooling
now known as the ‘factory school model,’

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:46.240
because it teaches children how to work within a
set schedule and listen to authority figures.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.900
Those are skills that come in handy as an
adult when your boss tells you to be at your
desk at 9 in the morning.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:58.260
K-12 Schools also provide childcare that makes working
parents’ lives easier – not the intended purpose of
schools certainly, but a pretty useful latent function.

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.620
And a third latent function of schools is
that they just help you make friends!

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:06.340
Schools help people form social groups by introducing
them to many people around their same age.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.340
This also makes it easy to meet and interact
with potential romantic partners around your age –

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.980
which might be why we see so many college
and high school sweethearts who tie the knot.

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.640
Structural functionalism stresses all the
ways that schooling helps maintains the order
and stability of society.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:26.960
But our other theories of sociological thought point
out the ways that educational institutions may maintain
practices that are not beneficial to everyone.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.820
Recall that symbolic-interactionist approaches
explore how people create the world that we live
in through their day-to-day interactions.

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:39.820
In the context of education, we see this play
out in how stereotypes created by society can
turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.480
Teachers who believe a student has high ability tend
to give that student more attention and feedback –

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:51.380
which in turn helps that student believe that
they have high ability, which in turn helps that
student develop greater academic ability.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:10:00.020
Similarly, if you decide you’re just not a “math person,”
you might try to avoid doing math at all and stop taking
math classes as soon as your school lets you –

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.780
which will pretty much guarantee that you
end up not being all that good at math.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:11.480
Self-fulfilling prophecies can have very real
consequences when its beliefs about student’s abilities
are influenced by stereotypes of race, gender, or class.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.640
The lower graduation rate of racial minorities
is one outcome.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.700
So too is women’s underrepresentation in Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Math fields.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:25.860
Next week, we’ll use the lens of social conflict
theory to explore more about how schooling can
both cause and perpetuate social inequalities.

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:33.140
This week, we discussed the history of education
as a social institution, with a specific focus on
how the US organizes its educational system.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:39.820
We also talked about structural functionalist
approaches to education and some of the manifest
and latent functions associated with education.

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:44.760
Finally, we discussed a symbolic interactionist
approach to education that shows us how self-fulfilling

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.980
prophecies in educational settings contribute
to differences in academic outcomes for students.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:56.700
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr.
