Hi, I'm John Green. This is Crash Course Literature and today we're gonna discuss Lord of the Flies.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.520
Mr Green! Mr Green!
I hate that book.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.460
You know, Me From The Past, I've been
thinking a lot about selfhood lately.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.300
Like, how is it that I am still the same technical person I was when I was 16?

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.880
Because, like, my tastes have changed, my passions have changed, almost all of my cells have even changed.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:30.420
What is it, aside from some tiny strand of memory, that makes the me I was when I was 16 the same me I am today at 38?

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.980
And then I remember.
We both dislike Lord of the Flies.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:42.880
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.460
Right, but personal taste aside, Lord of the Flies is taught in many literature classes, so here we are.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.880
We're gonna kill the pig.
We're gonna cut her throat, spill her blood...

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.660
I don't know what just came over me.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.660
Probably the capacity for evil that William Golding believes lurks in the heart of every man, and also presumably every other person.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:59.780
But more on that in a moment.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.520
Lord of the Flies is a 1954 novel of ideas, by which I mean it is primarily about its ideas.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.580
Other novels of ideas include, like, Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, George Orwell's 1984...

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:20.000
And in my opinion -- and it's just my opinion -- a novel of ideas is only as good, or as bad, as its ideas.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.400
Lord of the Flies is about the murderous shenanigans of young boys marooned on a desert island

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.700
who descend into what Golding thought of as a state of nature after, like, 12 hours alone.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.240
But before we get there, let's talk about William Golding.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.460
So Golding was born in England in 1911.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:41.480
He went to Oxford, published a book of poems that he later disowned, and settled down to teach high school... and then World War II happened.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:49.820
He spent five years in the Navy, eventually captaining a ship filled with explosives and participated in the D-Day invasion, and the war affected him deeply.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.360
He later said, "Before the Second World War, I believed in the perfectibility of social man..."

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.300
"But after the war, I did not."

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.160
"I had discovered what one man could to do another..."

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:07.920
"Anyone who moved through those years without understanding that man produces evil as a bee produces honey must have been blind or wrong in the head."

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.040
After the war, Golding returned to teaching, which he didn't like very much.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.980
In fact, he often spent class periods working on his own novels.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.440
He wrote a couple of books during that time that were never published and then one day said to his wife,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.940
"Wouldn't it be a good idea if I wrote a book about children on an island, children who behave in the way children really would behave?"

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.580
That book became Lord of the Flies, which does make you wonder about the kind of students he was teaching.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.340
In the novel, a group of English schoolboys are being evacuated in the middle of a nuclear war. Probably.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.400
There was stuff about the nuclear war that his publishers made him cut.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.840
So yeah, the plane carrying them is shot down and they're stranded on a desert island.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.100
At first, it's all good fun.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.480
Like, there's plenty of fruit and fish and
fresh water, and they elect a leader, Ralph.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.780
And they build some shelters and light a signal fire in the hopes that they'll be seen and rescued.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.380
But then things start to go, you know, really really wrong.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.920
Like, a group of boys from the school choir,
led by a kid named Jack,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:04.220
become overwhelmed with bloodlust and they dismember one boy, Simon, when they mistake him for a mythic beast.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.280
And then they kill Ralph's sidekick,
Piggy, for basically no reason.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.420
And then they try to kill Ralph, and they probably would have succeeded, but a military ship arrives and he's saved,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.960
and they're all rescued, and I guess it's kind of a happy ending but everyone's too busy sobbing to enjoy it.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:25.520
So I don't want to read too deeply into his biography, but Lord of the Flies definitely grew partly out of Golding's experiences in World War II.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.620
However, it also took cues from literature, so let's look at some of those influences in the Thought Bubble.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.880
Lord of the Flies is sometimes called a Robinsonade, a literary genre named after Robinson Crusoe,

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.340
which explores how people behave when they're stranded in some isolated place.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.440
The most obvious model for Lord of the Flies is Coral Island, a hugely popular Victorian children's book that Golding refers to a couple of times.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:55.460
In Coral Island, a trio of British boys are stranded on an island and they use their bravery and their good Christian values to defeat pirates and savages.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.760
Those boys, by the way, are named
Ralfe, Jack, and Peter

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.840
-- essentially the same names Golding uses for his main characters -- but the similarities pretty much end there.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.440
Like, in Lord of the Flies, the dangers aren't external, they're internal.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.320
There aren't any savages to fight, just the savagery that apparently dwells within each of us.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.600
Or at least, according to Golding,
within all pre-pubescent British boys.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.440
Basically, the difference is philosophical.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.020
Most earlier desert island stories follow the beliefs of the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau,

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:28.540
who believed that humanity was at its best and most innocent in the state of nature and that the social order was a corrupting influence.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.220
Rousseau argued that if we were free from social constraints, we would behave really really well.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:40.820
But Golding is closer in spirit to an old Crash Course regular, Thomas Hobbes, who described life in a state of nature as "nasty, brutish, and short."

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.220
Hobbes thought that without social constraints, we would immediately fall into violence and aggression,

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.520
which is why we needed society and good government to keep people in order.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.700
There's also a bunch of stuff in Lord of the Flies from Shakespeare's desert island story The Tempest,

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.740
and from a Greek tragedy called the Bacchae, which is about the foolishness of trying to impose order onto chaos and the fun of dismemberment.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.560
And you can also hear echoes of
Joseph Conrad's The Heart of Darkness,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.840
in addition to Golding's experiences in World War II, some of his experiences as a school teacher,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.400
and his increasingly pessimistic views about humanity's inherent evil. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.740
So Golding later told an interviewer he thought that the atrocities of World War II could just as easily have happened in England.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.460
He said, "Nazi Germany was a particular kind of boil which burst in 1939."

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.540
"That was only the same kind of
inflamed spot we all of us suffer from,

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.160
and so I took English boys and said, 'Look. This could be you.'"

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.060
He makes this point explicitly in the novel.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.420
At first, Jack says,
"We've got to have rules and obey them."

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.120
"After all, we're not savages."

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.080
"We're English, and the English are best at everything."

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.060
Ah, English exceptionalism.
They're the best at everything, including killing.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.280
I mean, a couple of chapters later, Jack is running around mostly naked with his face painted, throwing spears and trying to kill other boys.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.120
And this points at something really problematic about Lord of the Flies to me.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:03.960
When Golding is describing the boys' descent into so-called savagery, he uses a lot of images of what he thought of as primitive or uncivilised people.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.140
You know, like, spears and face paint and that way of imagining civilisation is flatly wrong.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:12.420
But Golding gives us lots of scenes exploring his ideas about the state of nature.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:18.960
Like, there's a scene early in the book when another boy, Roger, is throwing rocks at some younger boys, but he's deliberately aiming to miss.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.400
"Here, invisible yet strong, was the taboo of the old life," Golding writes.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.760
"Round the squatting child was the protection of parents and school and policemen and the law."

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:35.120
But those taboos break down pretty quickly and soon Roger is torturing other boys, a job he really enjoys.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.400
So much for your mom telling you that bullies are just insecure.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.000
What Golding is saying is that we're all bullies.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.960
We'll act viciously as long as we think we can get away with it.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.240
Before he's killed, Piggy, the fat asthmatic intellectual, asks, "What are we?"

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.880
"Humans, or animals, or savages?"

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.900
And Golding's answer is D -- all of the above.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:59.300
In Golding's world view, the authority and social structures of what he calls civilisation bind us together,

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.340
and without those, the boys on the island never really have a chance.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.740
I mean, they give democracy a try
and there's all that nice fruit,

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.120
but the island's never really paradise because, as we know, going back to the Bible, all paradises contain snakes.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:19.020
And on the island, even when the boys first arrive, the wreck of the plane is referred to as "the scar," and it's something the boys won't look at.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:24.620
And pretty soon some of the younger boys start complaining about a "beastie", some monster that's terrorising them.

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:29.080
But, of course, "the scar" is the arrival of human beings on the island in the first place,

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.960
and it's clear that the "beastie" is the evil loitering inside their six-year-old hearts.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.840
Like I said, Golding was a pretty dark guy.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:40.380
Golding hammers this home -- it must be said he is not an author afraid of hammering home his themes --

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:44.580
in a scene where Simon has a conversation with the rotting head of a dead pig.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.160
I know, I know. It makes Wilson
the volleyball seem so innocent.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.640
Poor Wilson.
You're just a bloody handprint.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.860
Simon thinks the pig head is the lord of the flies and it seems to speak to him.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.180
"Fancy thinking the Beast was something you could hunt and kill!" the pig head says.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.020
"You knew, didn't you?"
"I'm part of you!"

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:07.540
"Close, close, close!"
"I'm the reason why it's no-go."

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.700
Yeah, so that rotting pig head is the depravity within us all.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.020
There's just the one problem,
which is that that's not true.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.300
I mean, it's not even really true in the novel.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.300
If everyone is inherently evil and attracted
to violence and the abuse of power,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.160
then why do Ralph and Piggy resist
becoming members of Jack's gang?

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.080
Why does Ralph risk his life rather than succumb to what he sees as wrong?

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.260
To me, Golding is wrong about both what he calls civilsation, which he imagines as inherently ennobling,

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.960
and what he calls savagery, which he imagines as inherently evil.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.300
We actually know quite a lot about egalitarian hunting and gathering communities,

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:44.260
and one of the things that we know is that they don't closely resemble Lord of the Flies.

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:50.320
The problem of evil is real and I think we delude ourselves if any of us believes that we're somehow exempt from it,

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.280
but I think it's a lot more complicated than Lord of the Flies would have us believe.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.980
And then there is the complete lack of female characters in the novel.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:05.920
Golding said that he made the boys preteens and kept women out of it to avoid complicating the novel with the, quote, "relative triviality" of sex.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.240
But in an actual state of nature, around half of people are women and that shapes the community.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:19.060
So I'd argue the novel isn't really trying to avoid a "relative triviality" so much as it's playing out fears and fantasies of masculinity.

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:24.160
And one question that arises from this line of thought -- would girls be too much of a civilising factor in the novel?

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.480
Or would discovering that girls are also just as evil as boys be too disturbing?

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:36.840
Of course, there is one female in the story, a female pig who is murdered in a weird and highly-sexualised scene in the novel.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:42.020
All of which has led lots of critics to call Lord of the Flies a sexist novel and I have to say I don't disagree.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.660
All of that noted, as W.H. Auden once wrote,
"Some books are undeservedly forgotten."

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.840
"None are undeservedly remembered."

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:55.200
And despite its flaws, Lord of the Flies is a compulsively readable, multi-layered novel that can be read in a variety of ways.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:01.060
Like, on the surface, it's a dark adventure story that tells serious truths that books like Coral Island disguise.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:10.180
You can also see it as a kind of unusually violent coming-of-age novel in which Ralph has to learn how to stand up and be a man, resisting peer pressure and pig-killing.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:15.820
And it can be read as a political allegory about the way that democratic societies give way to totalitarian ones.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:23.280
Or along religious lines, where the island is a stand-in for the Garden of Eden and the book is a working out of how everyone is tainted by original sin.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:30.300
Or, without bringing religion into it, you can read it as a moral allegory about how goodness almost always fails to withstand evil.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:36.560
And there is something deeply true in that because we all know that it is harder to be good than most novels would have us believe.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.480
And lastly, I just wanna touch on the novel's strange and somewhat happy ending.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:46.700
Like, out of nowhere, a ship arrives, which is a lot like this thing that happens in Greek tragedy called "deus ex machina",

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:53.040
where suddenly just when everything seems like it's a total and complete mess, a god suddenly descends and saves the day.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.980
The naval officer who comes onshore probably looks like a god with his bright white uniform and his medals,

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:03.000
but he's carrying a revolver and there's a
guy with a machine gun just behind him.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:10.480
So we get the sense that this is just a grown up, socially approved version of the violence and bloodlust that the boys on the island have discovered.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:18.420
And indeed Golding later wrote that the officer who saves Ralph from the manhunt, quote, "will presently be hunting his enemy in the same implacable way."

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:20.960
"And who will rescue the adult and his cruiser?"

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:24.660
But wars do end, even if the war never ended for Golding.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.020
