Hi. Welcome to Version Control.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:04.300
I'm Carolyn, one of your instructors for the course.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.350
&gt;&gt; And I'm Sarah, your other instructor.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.340
In this course, we'll cover the concept of Version Control and

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.960
why you might want to use it.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, Version Control is sort of like having a giant undo button for

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.530
your project.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.720
&gt;&gt; You mean like this one?

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.320
It makes it easy to save versions of your files at different points in time.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.190
You can also restore previous versions and compare different version.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:25.386
Yeah, it also makes it a lot easier to collaborate with other people.

00:00:25.386 --> 00:00:28.598
&gt;&gt; No more sending huge .zip files of your project back and forth.

00:00:28.598 --> 00:00:32.211
&gt;&gt; Now, learning to use Version Control is a little bit like learning to type:

00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:35.948
it's hard at first, but once you can do it, it makes you a lot more efficient.

00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:39.081
&gt;&gt; You might feel like learning a whole new system to keep track of versions of

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:41.252
your files is a lot of work and maybe not worth it, or

00:00:41.252 --> 00:00:44.200
that if you're hard core enough, you don't need Version Control.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.930
But if you look at successful companies like Google and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.260
Facebook, you'll find that they all use Version Control internally.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.000
What about you, Caroline?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.480
&gt;&gt; Well, when I first started using Version Control,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.300
I basically only used it when I needed to.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.450
But now I like to use it for all of my projects.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.600
It's kind of addicting.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.280
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.960
Let's find out why.
