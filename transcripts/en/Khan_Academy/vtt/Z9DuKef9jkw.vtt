00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.099
- What I hope to do in
this video is get even more

00:00:02.099 --> 00:00:05.681
algebraically familiar with
the Lorentz transformation,

00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:08.028
so that we can recognize
it in its different forms

00:00:08.028 --> 00:00:11.660
and start to build our
intuition for how it behaves.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.516
So let's just write down
the Lorentz transformation,

00:00:13.516 --> 00:00:14.995
or at least the way
that I like to write it.

00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:16.635
So let's just remind ourselves,

00:00:16.635 --> 00:00:18.356
if I'm in my frame of reference,

00:00:18.356 --> 00:00:21.054
I am floating through
space, so I could say s

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:23.122
for Sal's frame of reference.

00:00:23.122 --> 00:00:25.910
Some event in space time,
from my point of view,

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.269
is going to have some x-coordinate,

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.042
I will do that in green,
and it's going to have

00:00:34.042 --> 00:00:38.452
some ct coordinate, I
can do that in orange.

00:00:42.632 --> 00:00:44.764
So the Lorentz transformations
are going to go from

00:00:44.764 --> 00:00:46.489
coordinates in my frame of reference,

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.663
space-time coordinates for an event,

00:00:48.663 --> 00:00:51.608
to my friend's frame of reference,

00:00:51.608 --> 00:00:55.868
so we can say that's the
s-prime frame of reference,

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:58.048
and her frame of reference, the event,

00:00:58.048 --> 00:01:01.615
will have space-time coordinates x-prime,

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:06.355
let me write it this way: x-prime,

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.615
comma, ct-prime,

00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:12.704
I'm really having trouble
switching colors today,

00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:16.175
ct-prime, so let's just
write it down the way

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:17.814
I've written it down
in the previous videos,

00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:20.099
and then I'll do a little bit
of algebraic manipulations,

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:22.564
so we can recognize its different forms.

00:01:22.564 --> 00:01:24.000
So if we want to get x-prime,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.851
we see that it's going to be based on

00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:34.441
the Lorentz factor times x

00:01:36.024 --> 00:01:40.234
minus a scaled version of ct,

00:01:40.234 --> 00:01:42.291
and the scaling factor is beta,

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:44.966
and we will redefine beta in a second,

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:48.157
so beta times ct,

00:01:49.257 --> 00:01:51.897
where our Lorentz factor,

00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:53.126
let me write it over here,

00:01:53.126 --> 00:01:56.913
the Lorentz factor is
one over the square root

00:01:56.913 --> 00:02:00.617
of one minus v-squared over c-squared,

00:02:00.617 --> 00:02:03.688
or we could write it as
one over the square root

00:02:03.688 --> 00:02:05.906
of one minus beta-squared,

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:11.335
where beta is equal to

00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:16.157
v over c. So there you go.

00:02:16.157 --> 00:02:18.820
That's how we get x-prime
and it's gonna be based on

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.862
the Lorentz factors dependent on v

00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:23.534
and of course the rest
of this is going to be

00:02:23.534 --> 00:02:26.120
dependent on x and ct.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.383
And so how do we get ct-prime?

00:02:28.383 --> 00:02:31.929
Well ct-prime is going to be equal to,

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:33.773
I'll just write it right over here,

00:02:33.773 --> 00:02:37.526
ct-prime is going to be equal to

00:02:37.526 --> 00:02:41.018
the Lorentz factor times,

00:02:41.018 --> 00:02:42.242
and once again this is going to be

00:02:42.242 --> 00:02:44.441
the nice symmetry we talked about,

00:02:44.441 --> 00:02:48.603
times ct, we'll do that in orange,

00:02:49.306 --> 00:02:53.363
so ct minus

00:02:53.363 --> 00:02:57.475
beta times x.

00:02:57.475 --> 00:02:59.986
And like I said before, I
like to write it this way.

00:02:59.986 --> 00:03:01.156
I find it easier to remember.

00:03:01.156 --> 00:03:02.731
I find it easier to
remember because it has this

00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:05.057
nice, beautiful symmetry to it.

00:03:05.057 --> 00:03:06.927
When I'm trying to solve for x-prime,

00:03:06.927 --> 00:03:09.383
it's x minus beta times ct.

00:03:09.383 --> 00:03:13.783
When I'm solving for ct-prime,
it's ct minus beta times x.

00:03:13.783 --> 00:03:16.637
And in both cases, I'm
scaling by the Lorentz factor.

00:03:16.637 --> 00:03:18.472
Well let's manipulate this a little bit,

00:03:18.472 --> 00:03:19.771
just to understand a little better,

00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:21.793
and reconcile with what you might see

00:03:21.793 --> 00:03:24.586
with other sources,
including, say, your textbook.

00:03:24.586 --> 00:03:27.482
Well we know that beta
is equal to v over c,

00:03:30.382 --> 00:03:32.920
and this is v over c,

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.618
and so we can write this
as v over c times c,

00:03:36.618 --> 00:03:38.691
this c's going to cancel with that c.

00:03:38.691 --> 00:03:40.635
And so we could rewrite this as

00:03:40.635 --> 00:03:45.245
x-prime is equal to the Lorentz factor,

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:49.553
gamma times x minus vt.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.396
V times t.

00:03:58.396 --> 00:04:00.558
Now this is really
interesting right over here,

00:04:00.558 --> 00:04:04.853
'cause if you'd ignored gamma,
or if gamma was one here,

00:04:04.853 --> 00:04:08.222
this is essentially the
Galilean transformation.

00:04:08.222 --> 00:04:10.806
If it was just x minus vt, that was just

00:04:10.806 --> 00:04:12.824
our intuition about our everyday life,

00:04:12.824 --> 00:04:15.443
but Newtonian physics
would actually tell us,

00:04:15.443 --> 00:04:17.280
and so when you view it in this form,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.214
you really think, okay, you're
just going to scale that

00:04:19.214 --> 00:04:20.883
by this Lorentz transformation,

00:04:20.883 --> 00:04:22.594
which has this interesting behavior

00:04:22.594 --> 00:04:26.275
that if v is much, much smaller
than the speed of light,

00:04:26.275 --> 00:04:28.325
well then, this whole factor

00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:29.889
is going to be pretty close to one,

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.238
and that's why the Galilean
transformation's worked for us,

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:34.992
for kind of everyday velocities.

00:04:34.992 --> 00:04:39.558
But then if v starts to
approach the speed of light,

00:04:39.558 --> 00:04:42.698
this thing blows up and we
get a very different result

00:04:42.698 --> 00:04:46.283
than with our traditional
Galilean transformation.

00:04:46.283 --> 00:04:48.572
Well let's think about
what happens over here,

00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:51.874
and over here, instead
of staying in ct-prime,

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:54.244
I'm gonna also divide both sides by c,

00:04:54.244 --> 00:04:56.113
so we're just solving for time

00:04:56.113 --> 00:04:57.909
as we normally associate it.

00:04:57.909 --> 00:05:01.970
Just the t-prime variables
as opposed to ct-prime.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.527
So let's also divide both sides by c,

00:05:04.527 --> 00:05:07.706
so you divide by c there, and
you can divide by c there,

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:10.207
and you can divide by c there,

00:05:10.207 --> 00:05:12.776
those c's cancel, those c's cancel,

00:05:12.776 --> 00:05:16.119
and so we're left with t-prime is equal to

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:18.081
the Lorentz factor,

00:05:20.176 --> 00:05:25.176
times t times t minus,

00:05:25.185 --> 00:05:27.090
now you're going to get v times x,

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.160
and you're going to divide by
c twice, so over c-squared.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.588
So vx,

00:05:32.588 --> 00:05:37.588
v times x over c-squared.

00:05:41.213 --> 00:05:43.481
And this is actually a more
typical way, both of these,

00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:45.956
of seeing the Lorentz transformation.

00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:48.337
The reason why I don't
like this form as much,

00:05:48.337 --> 00:05:50.573
even though this does
have the neat, kind of,

00:05:50.573 --> 00:05:52.603
when you look at it, it looks
like you're just scaling up

00:05:52.603 --> 00:05:54.093
the Galilean transformation,

00:05:54.093 --> 00:05:56.272
is it you no longer
see the symmetry there,

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.584
and you should see the symmetry there,

00:05:57.584 --> 00:05:58.826
because we're talking about space-time.

00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:02.257
We're not talking about this
independence of space and time.

00:06:02.257 --> 00:06:05.112
We saw how the angles in
the Minkowski diagram,

00:06:05.112 --> 00:06:09.078
how those were symmetrical,
the angles between the regular,

00:06:09.078 --> 00:06:12.331
or the unprimed axes, and the primed axes.

00:06:12.331 --> 00:06:13.603
And so what I don't like about this

00:06:13.603 --> 00:06:15.376
is you no longer see the symmetry,

00:06:15.376 --> 00:06:17.713
while you did see it the
first way that I wrote it.

00:06:17.713 --> 00:06:20.183
And frankly I find this
harder to remember.

00:06:20.183 --> 00:06:21.940
But let's just think
about what happens here

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.390
when v is a very small
fraction of the speed of light.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.290
Well as we've already
said, our Lorentz factor

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.254
is going to be pretty close to one,

00:06:30.254 --> 00:06:33.352
and if v is a very small fraction of c,

00:06:33.352 --> 00:06:36.945
well then this second
term right over here,

00:06:36.945 --> 00:06:39.098
is going to be pretty close to zero.

00:06:39.098 --> 00:06:43.473
And so if v is a small fraction of c,

00:06:43.473 --> 00:06:45.982
then this thing is going to be get pretty,

00:06:45.982 --> 00:06:46.899
just let me just write this down,

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:51.899
so if v is much less than c,

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:54.702
then this is going to reduce to

00:06:54.702 --> 00:06:57.972
t-prime being approximately equal to,

00:06:57.972 --> 00:06:59.241
because our Lorentz factor

00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:00.575
is going to be pretty close to one,

00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:02.586
this is going to be pretty close to zero.

00:07:02.586 --> 00:07:04.678
So this is going to be pretty close to t.

00:07:04.678 --> 00:07:08.877
Likewise, for v

00:07:08.877 --> 00:07:11.547
much lower than c over here,

00:07:11.547 --> 00:07:14.401
our Lorentz factor is going
to be pretty close to one,

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:16.309
and so x-prime is going to be

00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:21.309
approximately equal to x minus vt.

00:07:21.342 --> 00:07:23.022
So for small v's,

00:07:23.022 --> 00:07:25.223
and small can even be
the speed of a bullet,

00:07:25.223 --> 00:07:26.809
or even the speed of the space shuttle,

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:29.175
or things that are much, much smaller

00:07:29.175 --> 00:07:30.271
than the speed of light.

00:07:30.271 --> 00:07:34.243
Three times 10 to the
eighth meters per second,

00:07:34.243 --> 00:07:36.225
that's why the Galilean transformations

00:07:36.225 --> 00:07:38.813
are pretty good approximations.

00:07:38.813 --> 00:07:39.864
So hopefully this starts to give you

00:07:39.864 --> 00:07:41.089
a little bit of intuition.

00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:43.884
Start evaluating this,
evaluate this for v's

00:07:43.884 --> 00:07:46.062
in our everyday life,
and then see what happens

00:07:46.062 --> 00:07:49.883
when v starts to approach
.8 times the speed of light.

00:07:49.883 --> 00:07:54.883
.9 c, .99 c, think about what
happens to the Lorentz factor.

00:07:55.095 --> 00:07:57.445
And hopefully you'll
get an appreciation for

00:07:57.445 --> 00:07:59.520
how this whole thing behaves.
