all of our research is designed to make
 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.300
all of our research is designed to make
sure that the electricity that we have

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310
sure that the electricity that we have
 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.179
sure that the electricity that we have
in the future is reliable and that it

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:27.189
in the future is reliable and that it
 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:29.340
in the future is reliable and that it
meets the needs of the public and what

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350
meets the needs of the public and what
 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.080
meets the needs of the public and what
we've been doing is we've probably been

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090
we've been doing is we've probably been
 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.140
we've been doing is we've probably been
trying to figure out how what are the

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150
trying to figure out how what are the
 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.580
trying to figure out how what are the
crucial needs of the industry not just

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590
crucial needs of the industry not just
 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.320
crucial needs of the industry not just
in the immediate run but trying to take

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330
in the immediate run but trying to take
 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.090
in the immediate run but trying to take
more longer run we're looking at the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100
more longer run we're looking at the
 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.000
more longer run we're looking at the
ways to produce electricity without so

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010
ways to produce electricity without so
 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.770
ways to produce electricity without so
much carbon dioxide going into the air

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780
much carbon dioxide going into the air
 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.020
much carbon dioxide going into the air
and what are the pluses minuses all of

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030
and what are the pluses minuses all of
 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.329
and what are the pluses minuses all of
the various ways for example we've taken

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339
the various ways for example we've taken
 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.479
the various ways for example we've taken
a look at capturing carbon dioxide from

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489
a look at capturing carbon dioxide from
 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:52.920
a look at capturing carbon dioxide from
a power plant and putting a deep

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930
a power plant and putting a deep
 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.600
a power plant and putting a deep
underground that's something nobody else

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610
underground that's something nobody else
 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.789
underground that's something nobody else
in the country is looking at we believe

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799
in the country is looking at we believe
 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:58.229
in the country is looking at we believe
will be able to shape the regulatory

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239
will be able to shape the regulatory
 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.880
will be able to shape the regulatory
environment so we have to figure out

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890
environment so we have to figure out
 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.380
environment so we have to figure out
some way in which we are going to

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390
some way in which we are going to
 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.360
some way in which we are going to
generate this electricity in a more

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370
generate this electricity in a more
 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.130
generate this electricity in a more
sustainable way and so we've been

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140
sustainable way and so we've been
 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.899
sustainable way and so we've been
looking at biofuels we've been looking

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909
looking at biofuels we've been looking
 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:09.380
looking at biofuels we've been looking
at a number of renewable resources

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390
at a number of renewable resources
 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.200
at a number of renewable resources
including wind solar and so on trying to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210
including wind solar and so on trying to
 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.490
including wind solar and so on trying to
figure out how it is they're going to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500
figure out how it is they're going to
 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.980
figure out how it is they're going to
fit into the mix to produce electricity

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990
fit into the mix to produce electricity
 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.380
fit into the mix to produce electricity
that's reliable of high quality and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390
that's reliable of high quality and
 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:28.430
that's reliable of high quality and
that's going to be affordable

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440
