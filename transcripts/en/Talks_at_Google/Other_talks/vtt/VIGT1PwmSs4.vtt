00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:01.530
SHANNON: All right.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.750
Welcome.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.080
Well today, I am
pleased to introduce,

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.580
on behalf of the Talks at
Google program, author Gregory

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.160
Orfalea.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.450
Greg was born and
raised in Los Angeles

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.710
and educated at
Georgetown University

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:16.930
and the University of Alaska.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.860
He is the author or editor of
eight books-- I guess nine now,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.610
including "The Man Who Guarded
the Bomb" and "Angelino Days."

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.580
The recipient of many awards for
his writing, Greg's "Angelino

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.940
Days" won the 2010 Arab
American Book Award

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.370
and was named a finalist for
the PEN USA Award in Creative

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.050
Writing-- I'm sorry,
Creative Nonfiction.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.380
He has taught at the
Claremont Colleges, Georgetown

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.090
University, and
Westmont College.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.890
Greg is here today to talk about
his most recent work, "Journey

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.810
to the Sun, Junipero Serra's
Dream and the Founding

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.970
of California," an authoritative
and incisive biography

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.920
of the man who founded
California's missions.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.570
Combining European
and American history,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.380
his religious scholarship,
geography, and anthropology,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.780
Greg masterfully
recounts the story

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.480
and brings new information
to our knowledge

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.990
of a man whose massive cultural
project not only created

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.310
the blueprint for
modern California,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.660
but changed the
future of our nation.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.870
Please join me in
welcoming Greg Orfalea.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.730
GREGORY ORFALEA:
Thank you, Shannon.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:37.870
Who is God's companion?

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.910
Junipero Serra might have
contemplated this thought

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.840
on the road in the Salinas
Valley of California,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.990
where in 1771 he met
an Indian woman who

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.570
offered him "a present."

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.250
When he asked her name, she
murmured "Soledad," Spanish

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.310
for "solitude."

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.400
Or at least that's what he
heard- "I was astonished,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.970
and turning to my companions
said, 'Here, gentleman,

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.940
you have Maria de la Soledad.'"

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.030
He gave her glass beads
for seeds; she nodded.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.190
As "the name stuck
to the place,"

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.770
Serra made a note
to found a mission

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.850
in that desolate, treeless spot.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.200
Soledad later became the hardest
luck mission of them all.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.210
Serra had undergone
plenty of solitude,

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.030
the "soledad" of the trail,
the one that surrounded

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.440
your neck like water
at night, a "soledad"

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.510
to conquer by singing
Matins at first light.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.780
Not English or
American "soledad,"

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.210
which celebrated being on
one's own, without others;

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.100
Spanish "soledad,"
which longed for them.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.480
Serra was not about
"soledad"-- neither

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.140
were the Franciscan fathers.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.730
He'd swallowed his
fill of it as a boy,

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.940
losing two sisters
and a brother,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.200
working the quiet
fields of Petra,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.630
his home village on the
Spanish island of Mallorca.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.490
But his father's hand,
that leather hand,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.990
was always on his shoulder, and
later his confreres' abrazos;

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.030
even though strangers in the
confessional cut "soledad"

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.930
with their pain.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.090
Serra respected solitude,
the solitude Christ

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.730
felt in the garden the
last night of his life

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.025
when the apostles slept.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.890
But Serra wasn't Simon of the
Desert, standing on his pillar

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:13.960
alone.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.519
He loved community, loved
performing marriages.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.480
He traveled as much as he
could in a pair or group,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.300
because outside
the mission walls,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:33.250
lay a solitude so vast only
the sun could disperse it.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.600
Now the dew was on the leaf,
the earth shorn briefly of dust,

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.980
dark and lovely and cool.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.140
The sun began its climb of
the Santa Lucia Mountains,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.820
casting them in gray outline.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.070
As his mule snorted, taking
him north in the early morning,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:04.530
the sun regarded Serra;
he dared not look back.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.040
The sun, warm on
his forehead, rising

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.780
over the crown of the forest,
now arched in his mind

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.590
above the Tramuntana
range of his old island

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:23.110
and its olive groves to the
sea, the Mediterranean waded

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.150
into the Pacific, the sun
wrapping the world in its arms.

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.290
Who was God's companion?

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.230
He was.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.160
For a second, he
looked at the sun;

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.870
God put a white spot in his eye.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.050
Anybody here ever
looked at the sun?

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.610
Not supposed to do that, right?

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.850
And just to show you how
complicated the choices are

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:02.520
for a writer trying to bring
an 18th century figure back

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.060
to life, I still don't know if
those spots are white or black.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.040
I chose white
though in this case.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.640
What I just read you was
the prologue to the book,

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.726
"Journey to the Sun."

00:06:16.726 --> 00:06:20.350
It's barely more than a page.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.950
At one time, it
was about 20 pages.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.497
My editor, whose name
is Colin Harrison, who

00:06:27.497 --> 00:06:30.990
is an accomplished
novelist, told

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.840
me to throw out the 20
pages of the prologue,

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.690
throw out the 10
pages of the preface,

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.950
throw out the 30 pages
of the introduction,

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.490
everything at the beginning.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.810
And this is what
his rationale was.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.880
Colin said, "I want the reader
to encounter Serra's story

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.760
right from the start and be
pulled in by the force of it,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.960
by that and that alone.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.620
I don't want you parsing
it or indicating upfront

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.780
with the reader should
expect or look for.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.840
I want him captured."

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.210
And in a way, that's kind of
like falling in love, right?

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.520
Nobody explains to you
why they feel that way.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.900
They just do.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.580
You just do.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:25.270
I hope that's what
a good book does.

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.830
The work on the prologue
was only the first

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:34.640
of many waves of
editing the manuscript.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:40.530
It was 1,300 pages at one time.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:45.130
A good part of just 2013 alone
was this relentless onslaught

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.770
to bring it down.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:51.500
I mean there was blood
all over the floor,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.250
Serra martyred many times.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:00.360
My own editor had an
idea-- my own editor,

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.560
Colin Harrison actually, and
my provost at Westmont College,

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:06.160
had a title for a talk.

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.070
I've given two different kinds
of talks for the past two weeks

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.620
on this book tour.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.940
One is a general
summary of Serra's life.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:17.280
And I'm going to do something
different for you Google folks

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.670
because I think you're sort of
natively ready for something

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.560
different.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.470
I'm going to give you the talk
I gave my own faculty, which

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:31.660
is I'm going to give you
five major obstacles I had

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.210
to encounter in
writing this book,

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:42.409
five challenges about dealing
with the life of Father Serra

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:45.110
and indeed researching it.

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.910
And here they are.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.100
I'll summarize it for you.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:49.610
And then we'll go
down one by one.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:55.980
Number one, how to transcend
the regional critique?

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.040
Oh, Serra?

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.360
That's a California story.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:04.720
No New York publisher is going
to be interested in that.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:05.220
OK.

00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:07.940
So the regional critique,
how to get over it.

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.320
Two, how to deal with the
fact that half of Serra's life

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:17.010
is document poor and half
of it is document rich?

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.510
Number three, what
is the pivotal moment

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:25.150
in the Serra story?

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:31.160
Not so easy to figure,
and we'll explore that.

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:36.650
How to understand the fact
of floggings in the missions?

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.060
A tough one, that's number four.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.130
And number five,
what techniques--

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.350
writers' techniques--
what can I bring

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.810
to bear after
writing for 30 years?

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:54.450
What tricks do I have in my
basket and research goals

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:59.860
could I best marshall to bring
a celibate Spanish priest

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:05.720
of the 18th century to
life for a jaded, if not

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.630
cynical, American culture?

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:12.022
That's probably the
hardest one of all.

00:10:12.022 --> 00:10:13.190
OK.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.960
Now, I want to say
at the outset let's

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.320
make this interactive in a way.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.259
We can do the Q&amp;A in
general at the end.

00:10:21.259 --> 00:10:22.800
Shannon, I'd would
be happy to do it.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.490
But jump in if you feel you want
more on something as we go down

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.420
these five obstacles.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.710
I'll pause after
each obstacle to see

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:34.385
if you want to throw
in another obstacle.

00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:41.820
OK, first, how to transcend
the regional critique?

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.270
Anybody have an idea?

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.420
How would you transcend
the regional critique?

00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:58.750
It's only a California
story, right?

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.750
Nobody's going to be
interested in Junipero Serra.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:06.930
We already have William Bradford
and the Massachusetts Bay

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:07.580
Colony.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.480
We have Captain John
Smith at Jamestown.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.060
What do we need Serra for?

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.730
All right, I'll go into it.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:20.370
I wrote the first
outline in 2001.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.820
So it's a 12-year year journey.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.570
I toiled alone without
an agent for a long time,

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:31.180
with that outline
and a sample chapter.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.130
No success.

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:37.100
Even my own former editor-- I
had a great editor at the Free

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:40.320
Press, which is another
subsidiary of Simon &amp; Schuster,

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:44.694
for a book on World War II,
about my father, in the war,

00:11:44.694 --> 00:11:46.360
call "Messengers of
the Lost Battalion."

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.090
My editor was Adam
Bellow, who is

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:51.950
the son of Saul Bellow, the
Nobel Prize winning novelist.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.870
Adam is a pretty
well-educated guy.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:54.970
He went to Princeton.

00:11:54.970 --> 00:12:00.330
He had never heard of
Serra, never heard of him.

00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.310
So to me, now I
thought I was holding

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:06.780
onto a hopeless obsession.

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:11.430
Even my old editor
wasn't going to take it.

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.200
One day, a friend of mine
from Georgetown days,

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.200
my undergraduate days-- his
name is Jason Berry, who

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.240
loved what I was trying to
do and was gung ho about it

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:28.770
from the start-- said send an
outline and a sample chapter

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:30.460
to my agent.

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.840
I think he might look at it.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.070
Now, Jason is an
interesting person.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.280
I don't want to get
too off track on him.

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.510
But I will just say that Jason
Berry was the first author

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.840
to uncover the
pedophilia scandal

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.760
in the Catholic priesthood.

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:53.420
And he remained a
Catholic, after 25 years

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.270
of writing this hellish story.

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.910
I have often told Jason, there's
the book you got to write,

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:04.230
why you stayed after
all that misery.

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:10.190
Well, maybe Francis I is
the better part of it.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:15.080
So Jason's agent, Steve
Hanselman, took a look

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.100
and he got it.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.510
And why did he get it?

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:21.120
Because he was born in
Shafter, California,

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.510
right outside of Bakersfield.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:27.120
But he was living and
working in New York.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.300
So he loved it.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.755
And he knew what
it was all about.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.890
Steve Hanselman understood
that the Serra story

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.820
was one that was
important to him

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:43.480
from childhood, in fact
since the fourth grade.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.920
Now, how many here did a
fourth grade mission project?

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.230
All right.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:51.760
Which mission, Mike?

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:53.810
Do you remember
which one you did?

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:54.610
MIKE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.170
GREGORY ORFALEA: I see that
was a mission you really loved.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.974
Shannon, do you remember?

00:13:59.974 --> 00:14:00.640
SHANNON: Carmel.

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.515
GREGORY ORFALEA: Carmel,
San Carlos Borromeo.

00:14:02.515 --> 00:14:03.910
I just was there.

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:05.730
I love that mission.

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:07.390
Mine was San Juan Capistrano.

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:10.460
Anyone else?

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.140
Anybody do San
Gabriel, down in LA?

00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.480
That's a good one.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.750
Anyway, Steve Hanselman had
done San Juan Capistrano too.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:24.010
Steve was convinced
that Serra badly

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:28.180
needed a realistic,
unbiased treatment, one

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.610
that was both
celebratory and critical.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:35.240
He was convinced that the
story had ripple effects far

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.580
beyond California
and could tell us

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.360
much about the origins of the
Hispanic influenced country we

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.050
were becoming.

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:48.000
So we went at it.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.220
And we totally revised the
outline and the sample chapter.

00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:57.000
But we were turned
down by 12 publishers,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.410
even with a gung ho agent.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:04.970
However, just when I was going
to give up-- isn't that the way

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:05.710
it always is?

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:09.710
Just when you're about
ready to pack it in,

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.800
you get a little tinkle
of a bell on your phone

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:17.390
or at your door.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:21.480
And in this case, it was Colin
Harrison at Scribner, the best

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.840
publisher and the best editor,
in my opinion, in New York.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.810
Colin-- and this is
kind of what he said,

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.800
I'm sort of paraphrasing.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:33.500
I am interested in
alternate foundation

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.810
stories for this country.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:39.870
And this is certainly one we
know almost nothing about.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.810
And I thought, well,
that's how it works.

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:47.390
You're lost and then by dint of
a kindred soul, you're found.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.010
Now, the flip side to
the regional critique

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:52.330
immediately hit me.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.590
Now, we have a contract.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.770
We have a pretty decent advance.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:58.660
I'm raring to go.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.000
The critique about the
smallness of the story

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.930
suddenly becomes the
reality of an immense story.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.730
So what's the fear now?

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.200
And I up to it?

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:11.830
Can I handle this?

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:14.580
I'm a literature
guy, not a historian,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.420
although I've written histories.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.110
My background is
literature and writing.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:21.615
So what can I bring to
this task that's different?

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.250
Well, I thought maybe-- what's
literature most fascinated

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:27.750
with?

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:32.247
Character, character, a
person, that's what I want.

00:16:32.247 --> 00:16:34.940
I want to get into the
character of Serra.

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:37.750
I want the people to
walk in his sandals

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.730
and know what it was like
to live in the 18th century

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:41.840
and to do what he did.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:49.980
Luckily, I had an editor that
divined right away that I

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:54.900
was insecure and bolstered
me almost from the start.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.356
He gave me his cell phone,
his private cell phone.

00:16:57.356 --> 00:16:58.730
I could call him
on the weekends.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.590
This has never
happened to me before.

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:04.254
It happens to very few authors
who aren't best sellers.

00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.920
He said we're going to go at it
chapter by chapter and we did.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.060
22 chapters, we had
22 conversations

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.119
of an hour or more on the phone
for each of those chapters.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:18.619
Uncanny.

00:17:21.349 --> 00:17:21.849
OK.

00:17:21.849 --> 00:17:25.260
Yeah, the question is
what drew me to Serra?

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.589
Well, actually answer is
the regional critique.

00:17:32.589 --> 00:17:33.630
I was part of California.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.290
I don't know.

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:48.190
The earliest memory I have as
a child is about 2 and 1/2,

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:53.820
of having a bird land
on my upturned arm

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:56.500
at San Juan Capistrano Mission.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:18:00.900
And the bird was pecking the
bird seed out of my hand.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.310
There's a photograph of it.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.130
But I hadn't seen the
photo in many years.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:06.520
And in my mind I thought,
oh, it must be a swallow

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:09.140
because the swallows
come back to Capistrano,

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:12.080
on March 19, Saint
Joseph's Feast Day.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.171
And I thought I
was part of that.

00:18:15.171 --> 00:18:16.670
Well, it turned out
it was a pigeon.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.910
But that early memory and
that sense of sacred space,

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:24.970
the sense too of
going to Georgetown

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.730
in the East for college,
feeling like nobody

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.920
understood things that
were really close to me

00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:33.500
from California, the assumption
that there's no history.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.350
Californians are ahistorical.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:36.840
They're trying to
escape history.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.690
That's why people go West.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:44.600
Well, people went West after
the Spaniards were there.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.430
There's a lot of history
before the Americans get here.

00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:51.080
And that's what I want-- I think
I was building up the instinct

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.780
to do this for many years,
particularly in the East,

00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.970
at Georgetown.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:56.760
OK.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.900
Challenge number
two, how to deal

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.310
with the dearth of material
on Serra's early life.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.240
Up until "Journey to the
Sun," there was in fact

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.510
only one extant letter
of Junipero Serra,

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:18.550
up to his leaving Spain forever
at the age of 36 from Cadiz.

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:21.860
OK, so I said one letter for
the first half of his life

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.940
before he set sail.

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.680
That's not a lot.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:31.720
Five letters for Mexico-- he
was in Mexico for 18 years,

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.620
longer than he was here.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:37.760
So six letters up
through age 54.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:41.170
I found two in my journeys.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:43.280
Doesn't sound like a lot.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:49.600
But you guys know better than
I, what that is, a 33% increase.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.080
So I feel pretty
good about that.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:55.960
I also should mention
that part of this problem

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.440
with a dearth of
material-- the challenges,

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.310
you got to become
not just a historian,

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.650
but a sort of
investigative reporter.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:06.720
And you've got to travel.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.813
I did five trips to
Spain and Mexico.

00:20:12.780 --> 00:20:14.590
You've got to
focus on the myths,

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.420
like a laser,
especially the ones that

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.680
are most controversial.

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:24.460
And I've done that I hope
in "Journey to the Sun."

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:31.220
Also the challenge becomes how
to weave a story progression

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:35.130
through the creation
of nine missions?

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:36.700
That's a challenge in itself.

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:42.430
Because no mission's story stops
with the creation of a new one.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:45.760
So you're weaving
this man's life story

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.790
through the nine
missions, which is

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.070
part three of the four
parts of the book.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:53.060
And you've got a chapter
for each mission,

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:58.520
but then they
overlap, interlace.

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.110
For example-- just
a quick example--

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:03.900
the pivotal moment
of the story, which

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.500
I think I'm coming
up to that soon,

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.440
is the attack on
San Diego Mission.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:13.730
But the attack on San Diego
Mission occurs in 1775.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:16.780
Mission San Juan Capistrano
is being founded.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.500
So I have the attack on
San Diego in the San Juan

00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.140
Capistrano chapter.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.520
And those are the kinds of
things you have to deal with.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.430
Now, you may wonder why
is the Serra story so

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:33.670
document poor for the
first 36 years of his life?

00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:38.544
Anybody have any just
random guesses or thoughts?

00:21:38.544 --> 00:21:39.710
There's quite a few reasons.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:44.830
OK.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.410
First of all, he taught
at the Lullian University.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:48.535
He had a chair in theology.

00:21:48.535 --> 00:21:53.840
He was a very respected,
erudite theologian in Palma

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.100
at the time.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.030
That university, the
Lullian University in Palma

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.120
was closed in 1835.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.140
And a lot of the records, and
sermons probably, and lectures

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:09.560
were lost.

00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:14.100
How about 1936 to 1939?

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:17.100
What was going on in
Spain at that time?

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:17.960
AUDIENCE: Civil war.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.000
GREGORY ORFALEA:
Civil war, to which

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.970
I would compare the
Syrians' civil war today.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:30.500
I think that's the one terribly
tragic and bloody parallel

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.860
to what's going on in Syria.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.670
The Spanish Civil War had
Franco wiping out anything

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:39.530
having to do with
Catalan identities.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:42.530
Towns, Basque or
Catalan, everything

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:44.100
was to be Castillian.

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:47.582
The language, the
Catalan dialect,

00:22:47.582 --> 00:22:49.900
he destroyed the dictionaries.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:54.620
So Palma and Mallorca
is part of Catalonia.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:58.150
So it's very likely we lost
Serra, or at least many

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.860
of Serra's holdings at the
time of Generalissimo Franco.

00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:03.990
So when you see
"Guernica," the next time

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:08.460
you see that great painting
by Picasso of "Guernica,"

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:12.080
with the explosions in
San Sebastian and Bilbao,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.920
think about we lost Serra
right there, or at least

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.965
records of Serra.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.490
I did unearth four
sermons of Serra

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:31.460
to Claretian nuns in the
1730s that very few had ever

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.990
seen before in Spanish.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.660
And someone had done a sort
of bad English translation

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.140
in the '90s that I
found in Mallorca.

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.570
I added my own translation.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.430
That really helped
me with his way

00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:46.530
of thinking about God
and grace and suffering.

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:50.100
Walking the streets where
Serra grew up in Petra,

00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.370
being taken around Palma
by a seminarian, who

00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:57.510
was living in the same hall in
the Confendo de San Francisco

00:23:57.510 --> 00:24:01.200
in Palma that Serra had
lived in as a young priest,

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.200
was invaluable.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:07.050
In Barcelona, I sustained
"the terrible triad."

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.350
I don't know if any of you have
ever broken your elbows before.

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:13.650
Like an idiot, I chased
a thief out of the metro

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:16.760
and hit a little
escalan, which we

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:19.350
don't have in our metros,
a little tiny step.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.500
And when flying as
I was chasing him

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:25.380
and smashed my elbow against
stone, and broke two bones,

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.397
the radial, the ulna,
and the tendon came off.

00:24:28.397 --> 00:24:29.980
And they call that
the terrible triad.

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:36.260
So on my wife and I spent a
week in a hospital in Barcelona,

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.800
all in the service of trying
to find some original documents

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.240
of Serra's.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:45.800
And, in fact, I did come up
with an original letter which

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.050
revealed several things
that couldn't possibly

00:24:49.050 --> 00:24:50.950
be seen in the transcription.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.950
I actually held Serra's
goodbye letter to his parents

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:59.160
in my hands, given to me by
a Capuchin monk in Barcelona.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.620
I had to put the white
gloves and hold it.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.590
And I saw two spots, which I'm
going to share with you soon,

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.920
two spots on the goodbye letter.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:12.120
Now, what do you think two spots
would be in a goodbye letter

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.220
to parents?

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:16.660
Llora, tears, yeah, tears.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.630
That's my guess.

00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:20.490
Could be moisture
damage too, I mean.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.600
But that was sort of my feeling.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:30.560
I also uncovered in Oaxaca,
after some relentless research

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.770
and coming up empty
for days, I found

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:40.330
the name of a man who was having
a 14-year affair with a woman,

00:25:40.330 --> 00:25:46.000
who confessed it to Serra.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.270
Now, we knew about this
unknown person's confession.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.960
We didn't know the
name of the man.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.900
It's briefly disgusted
in a 1787 biography

00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:00.380
by a friend of his,
Francisco Palou,

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.830
and then dropped for 200 years.

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:06.700
Briefly mentioned in 1959
by Father Maynard Geiger,

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:08.440
the last major biography.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:12.360
I thought, whoa, I want to
find out who those people were.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.280
And I did.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.050
And once I had the
name of the man who

00:26:16.050 --> 00:26:19.280
was carrying on the affair,
Don Mathias Cortabarria,

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:22.500
I ran around Oaxaca
to five archivists

00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:26.300
And archivists love it when
you give them something.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.540
They just love-- they sit around
in these kind of dreary jobs

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:34.875
all day long-- dust
of the archive.

00:26:34.875 --> 00:26:36.469
And it's pretty grim.

00:26:36.469 --> 00:26:38.010
But when they have
something and they

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.680
know someone's on the trail
of something centuries back,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.910
they love it.

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:43.600
And they just really
worked hard for me

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:47.350
and found many of these names.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:53.130
OK, any questions about the
document-poor, document-rich?

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.430
I should save the
document-rich part of the story

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.335
is that one Serra
gets to California,

00:26:57.335 --> 00:26:59.960
you have 264 letters.

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.410
So it's a bumper crop.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:03.280
Now, it's what do you use?

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:07.510
What do you throw out
and what do you use?

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:08.020
OK.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:11.780
Number three, the
third obstacle,

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.020
trying to pin down
the pivotal moment.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.750
Because a lot of the editors,
prior to Collin taking it,

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:21.100
want to know, OK,
what's the fulcrum here?

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.560
What's the fulcrum of the story?

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.610
I struggled at first.

00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:30.820
I thought maybe it was Serra's
decision to leave everything.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:31.639
He ever went home.

00:27:31.639 --> 00:27:32.930
He never saw his parents again.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.900
He was so nervous about
saying goodbye to them,

00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:40.160
he couldn't address the
goodbye letter to them.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.080
He addressed the goodbye letter
to a cousin, who was a priest,

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.720
and said give it to them.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.380
Could that be the
pivotal moment?

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:49.050
Well, maybe.

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.080
But what do you do then?

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.496
If that's the
pivotal moment, he's

00:27:51.496 --> 00:27:53.720
still got half of his life left.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.545
That doesn't serve.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:00.860
How about the spider
bite at Vera Cruz?

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.740
When he first landed in
Vera Cruz, and he was 36,

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:08.470
he was bitten by a spider,
walking from Vera Cruz

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:10.880
to Mexico City, 250 miles.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:12.220
It festered.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:13.960
It necrotized over time.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:17.520
And it pained him for 25
years, the rest of his life,

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.555
walking all over California.

00:28:19.555 --> 00:28:24.820
A pretty serious pivotal moment,
but a little amorphous too.

00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.580
Was it his despair after
the Cortabarria incident?

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.840
I didn't mention this.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:33.270
But the man who was having
the affair with the woman that

00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:37.360
confessed to Serra, when he
realized that the woman was not

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.710
coming back to him,
he hanged himself.

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:48.930
And this had great repercussions
in Oaxaca and affected Serra.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:56.420
How about Serra's meeting
with the viceroy in 1774, when

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.350
he went all the way
back from Carmel,

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:05.110
down through Baja, over on ship
to San Blas, to Mexico City,

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.850
and pleaded with the viceroy
not to shut the whole

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:13.160
project down because there
was a terrible epidemic

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.070
almost of molestation
by the soldiers,

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:23.650
of the Indian women, which Serra
totally decried and fought.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:28.070
But he was worried because
their one was stopping them.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:31.160
The commandantes were not
cashiering these soldiers,

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:36.440
that the viceroy was going to
end the project at California.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.800
In the end, I
picked the incident

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:42.320
I mentioned to you,
Serra's reaction

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.010
to the murder of Father
Luis Jayme, who grew up

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:50.830
with him in Mallorca, during
the second attack of Mission San

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.650
Diego by the Kumeyaay.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.940
And I'll read just a
brief little part of that,

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.020
and then we'll run to the end.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:03.450
In the wake of the second major
Indian uprising in California,

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:08.520
Serra sat down
December 15, 1775,

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.771
to write a soul-searching letter
to Viceroy Bucareli in Mexico

00:30:12.771 --> 00:30:13.270
City.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:16.690
I should mention that
although the attack took place

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.460
in San Diego, Serra
was not there.

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:19.620
He was in Carmel.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.100
Carmel was his home mission.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.300
So he didn't get the
news for a couple weeks.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.090
But when he did, and he knew
that Indians had been arrested,

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:31.430
at least nine, and then
later a total of 24,

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:36.610
to be executed-- they were on
death row-- he had to act fast.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.380
So he wrote this letter.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:43.860
He contemplated the burned,
shredded baptismal records,

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:48.040
the stolen vestments and
utensils of the Sacristy.

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:51.230
He hovered on giving up.

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:54.780
He reminded Bucareli
of his insistence

00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:58.550
at the beginning of these
conquests quote, "That in case

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:03.660
the Indians, whether pagans
or Christians, would kill me,

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:07.290
they should be pardoned."

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.310
From the very onset of the
Spanish movement into Alta

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:16.470
California, Serra seemed to
sense violence was inevitable

00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:20.380
and he wasn't
going to return it.

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.530
Nor did he want the
military to return it.

00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.090
Serra's insistent
note to Bucareli

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.890
was not only exceptional
in its anticipatory mercy,

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:37.340
it seemed to beg the question
of the whole enterprise.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:40.890
This is a stunning position.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:43.830
It's almost as if Serra
were asking for forgiveness,

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:49.320
not only for the
Indian, but from him,

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:50.850
knowing what the
Indian was going

00:31:50.850 --> 00:31:54.690
to have to give up even if he
felt he was offering a better

00:31:54.690 --> 00:31:58.020
way, salvation, as
he understood it.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:04.380
So Serra attacked the clemency
simply and profoundly.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:08.810
And I'll give you the
exact quote in his letter

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:10.620
to Bucareli.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.990
"To prevent the Indian
from killing others,

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:18.000
let the soldiers protect us
in better fashion than they

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.090
did the now deceased padre.

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:27.240
And as to the killer, let him
live so that he can be saved.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.360
For that is the
purpose of our coming

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:34.140
here and its sole
justification."

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:42.210
In short, "the gospel of love."

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:43.850
All right, the fourth challenge.

00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:44.760
Yes, sir?

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:45.760
AUDIENCE: What happened?

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.051
GREGORY ORFALEA: What happened?

00:32:47.051 --> 00:32:48.780
AUDIENCE: Did the
letter take effect?

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.020
GREGORY ORFALEA: Bucareli
was deeply moved.

00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.840
He ordered all the
Indians released.

00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.250
In fact, one of them, probably
the leader of the attack,

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:03.940
Carlos, whose native name was
Chisli, Carlos and his brother

00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:06.710
Francisco, they were both
in on this rebellion,

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:10.120
became very close to the
missions, particularly

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:10.740
Francisco.

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:14.130
I think he was a leader of
Christian Indians in San Diego.

00:33:14.130 --> 00:33:16.620
Carlos kind of went
in and out of-- he

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.860
was a bit of a recidivist.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.340
But he ended up at
Carmel ironically,

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:24.026
after Serra died, and
had his family there

00:33:24.026 --> 00:33:25.400
and worked the
mission in Carmel.

00:33:29.770 --> 00:33:31.740
The fourth challenge
was how to deal

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.970
with the most troubling,
if not revolting,

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:38.830
fact of Father Serra's life,
that he allowed and even

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:43.920
advocated floggings for penance
and discipline in the missions,

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.060
often against the very Indians
he was otherwise protecting.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:55.660
I'll only say here I was
faced with a twofold problem,

00:33:55.660 --> 00:34:00.420
a moral one and a narrative one.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:03.400
The first was
easier to confront.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.410
Serra was wrong.

00:34:06.410 --> 00:34:08.670
There's no way to gainsay it.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.780
Despite the fact that
disciplinary floggings were

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:15.280
commonly used in schools,
as well as prisons,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:18.239
throughout Europe,
Serra should have

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:22.949
had the wisdom to be as ahead
of his times in this area

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:25.730
as he was in others.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.540
The narrative
problem was tougher.

00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:32.730
If I tackled the issue
of floggings too early,

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:36.500
I might lose the reader's
commitment to the Serra story

00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:37.655
before it even began.

00:34:40.489 --> 00:34:43.489
And although I sprinkled
references to the floggings

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:47.179
in the book prior, I don't
focus intensely on it

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:51.429
until the last
night of his life.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:57.020
And it's the end of part
three of a four-part book.

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:59.650
And that night, I
begin the chapter

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.910
actually with this
quote from that night.

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:07.417
Serra says, "I have come
under the shadow of fear."

00:35:07.417 --> 00:35:09.000
That's when I deal
with the floggings.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:13.340
It's hard to explain them away.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.670
But you have to
remember that this

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:20.430
was a sort utopic
community, the mission.

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:23.730
And the Indians were
not forced to come in.

00:35:23.730 --> 00:35:24.740
That's a myth.

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.900
It wasn't slavery.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:30.440
It was a kind of indentured
servitude though.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.050
Because once they
were in, then they

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:37.140
were committed to a community
that needed their work.

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:39.320
They were given clothes.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:44.670
They were given food and
shelter and a home at a time

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:48.740
when lots was going on
in the native villages.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:50.240
The germs were spreading.

00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:52.920
The microbes were out and about.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.750
And a lot of Indians were dying.

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:58.870
So the mission, and I
say this at one point,

00:35:58.870 --> 00:36:01.040
the great irony of the
California missions

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:07.530
is that they were both
protection and exposure.

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:11.530
The Indians were seen as
children, not-- how can

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:14.460
I say this?

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:17.760
We've all read some books where
the padres refer to their flock

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.120
as "my children."

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.050
I don't think it was
you're inferior than me.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:26.110
But it was a kind of way
of regarding the neophytes,

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:29.240
as they were
called, as newcomers

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.430
in the Christian faith.

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:37.680
As such, the number
of the thrashings

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.490
was half of what
an adult would get.

00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:43.420
That's 12 versus 25.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.470
That still doesn't
make it right.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.204
Personally, I think
probably the worst

00:36:47.204 --> 00:36:48.620
thing about the
thrashings was not

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:51.950
the physical pain,
but the humiliation.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:56.960
People would steal.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.334
There was adultery that went on.

00:36:59.334 --> 00:37:01.500
I don't have to tell you
what went on in New England

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:02.300
with adultery.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:03.260
they didn't whip you.

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:05.410
They burned witches
at the stake,

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:08.110
who they thought to be witches.

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:10.600
We have to be careful
when writing history

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:15.830
of what's known as the
presentism problem,

00:37:15.830 --> 00:37:22.320
to judge the past with
our present attitudes

00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:25.880
and moral standards.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.120
Still, like I say-- and I
make no bones about this,

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:32.310
I think it was wrong.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.856
Yes, sir?

00:37:32.856 --> 00:37:33.772
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:38.549 --> 00:37:40.090
GREGORY ORFALEA: It
was actually part

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:43.450
of the whole Spanish project.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:45.900
And, in fact, it was part
of the English project.

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.950
The English thrashed
their students

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:51.160
at prep schools, such as Eaton.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:51.790
What was it?

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:57.090
Four thrashings was a scrubbing.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:04.350
Six lashes was a
bibling in Eaton.

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:06.310
This was the
standard of the time.

00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:10.150
I suspect it was probably
not much different in Asia.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:13.740
I mean, unfortunately,
corporeal punishment

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.620
or corporal punishment
was a standard.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:21.980
Now, I will hasten to say
that even during Serra's time,

00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.690
people took issue with it.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:25.850
One of the governor's
took issue with it.

00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.590
And he got into a big
argument with him in 1780.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:30.430
And I mention that.

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:34.800
By the 1820s, it was abolished
throughout the Spanish lands.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:39.190
So although it was
the standard, it

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:42.690
was beginning to
come under question.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.730
To move forward
to last obstacle--

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:49.650
and then we'll open it
up-- the last obstacle

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:53.225
was, in the words of Frank Buck,
how to bring him back alive.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:39:00.210
Another way of stating this
is how to make the Serra story

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:04.060
neither hagiography--
and hagiography,

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:10.900
overly praising or
excessive adulation

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:14.470
of the subject-- nor
a broadside attack.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.750
In short, how to make
Serra a real man.

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.820
One way to do this
was to make those

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.370
that he came to save for
Christ, real men and women, that

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.000
is the Indians of California.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.680
So I had to do a lot of
research about Indian culture.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.690
As those of you have
written books know--

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:36.460
or people who've organized
them, been involved

00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:40.800
with researching--
organization is theme.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:44.300
I tried to effect
a kind of ecumenism

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.930
by dividing the first two
parts of the book like this.

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:51.300
Part one is Serra
before California

00:39:51.300 --> 00:39:55.150
and part two is
California before Serra.

00:39:55.150 --> 00:39:57.080
Then we combine
them in part three.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:00.300
And then it's after his
death and the sainthood

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.340
issue in part four.

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:02.390
So it's pretty simple.

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:07.880
But there was a
method to my madness.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.730
Another method of
bringing him back alive

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:11.360
was to bring back
alive the women

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.560
he loved, which included
the Blessed Mother

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:20.860
herself, his sister and mother,
Maria Contreras in Oaxaca.

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.610
That's the woman who
confessed to him, the affair.

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:27.540
And Maria de Agreda-- has
anyone here ever heard

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.650
of the 17th century
nun, Maria de Agreda?

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.240
I had never heard of her
before I started the story.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.230
She was said to have
by bilocated 500 times

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:43.269
from Spain, Agreda,
Spain, to New Mexico.

00:40:43.269 --> 00:40:44.810
And in the book, I
say, well, there's

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.480
a spiritual frequent
flyer if there was one.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:52.050
It's quite a story,
Maria de Agreda.

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:55.840
But all this to say that
other than his Bible

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.040
and his divine office,
the only other book

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:02.070
that Serra had in his
bag all over California

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:04.140
was "The Mystical
City of God" written

00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:08.170
by Maria de Agreda, a
four-volume novelistic

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:10.580
treatment of the Blessed Mother.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.360
Anybody here interested
in women studies,

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:14.300
take a look at that book.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.630
Not too many women novelists
in the 17th century.

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:20.717
And here's one writing
four volumes about Mary.

00:41:20.717 --> 00:41:21.550
Serra was entranced.

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:27.110
Another way I tried to
bring him back alive

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:31.070
was to use fictional
techniques about nonfiction.

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:35.520
And that is, occasionally I
will put interior thoughts

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.710
in italics.

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.460
I try not to overdo it.

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.490
I always ground it
in the real record.

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:44.880
And when the record
runs out, I'll

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:49.830
sometimes use the
subjunctive mood.

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:52.830
And my editor said, oh,
yeah, the subjunctive

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:55.340
will be the salve for the wound.

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:02.630
Beyond research for new
primary and secondary material

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.350
and the somewhat
risky techniques

00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.350
was the matter of
walking in his shoes,

00:42:06.350 --> 00:42:09.260
in Mallorca, mainland
Spain, Mexico,

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.930
and the two Californians.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.150
This was exhausting,
exhilarating,

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:16.990
and for me at times
deeply humbling.

00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:19.910
The Serra story is
interdisciplinary from start

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:20.490
to finish.

00:42:20.490 --> 00:42:23.490
You must steep yourself
in the art he loved,

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:27.030
his theological models,
the history of the times,

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:30.570
the history of the Church,
music, literature, geography,

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:32.220
and the environment.

00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:35.180
And finally, I had a
field day envisioning

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:39.260
the beauty of our wondrous state
through the eyes of one who

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:42.670
fell in love with it for
life, causing great hope

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:44.700
and great pain for
its inhabitants.

00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:47.590
And I'll leave you with
this short paragraph

00:42:47.590 --> 00:42:52.030
of Serra traveling south,
looking out on the water.

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:54.530
Troubled before La
Assumpta-- La Assumpta

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:58.340
is an Indian village near
present-day Ventura-- Serra

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:02.590
saw something out on
the blue of the calm

00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:09.690
morning, a wound on the sea,
a lambent dark red, the kelp

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:14.170
beds, like a stigmata
on the water.

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:16.150
At the hottest
point of the sun, he

00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:20.750
might have climbed off the mule,
taken to the sea, the water

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:24.360
making his robes heavy,
but his heart light.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:29.670
Close up, the kelp was golden,
its pods upright in the water.

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:33.010
The kelp leaf could pass
over his face like a hand.

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:37.260
God, he loved suffering
for this beauty.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.848
Thanks.

00:43:38.848 --> 00:43:44.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:49.400
So a couple of quick images and
then we'll call it an evening.

00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:50.060
This is Mt.

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:54.680
Ronda in Mallorca, a
beautiful upsurge of mountain.

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.940
They're all over the island.

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:59.780
And there are sanctuaries and
monks, monasteries up there.

00:43:59.780 --> 00:44:03.660
This is where one
of Serra's models,

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:05.960
the 13th century
monk Raymond Lull,

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:11.310
claimed to have seen a vision
of Christ crucified while he was

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:13.460
living his dissolute
life, sort of like Saint

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:15.810
Augustine in his 20s.

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:18.830
Raymond Lull was writing a
letter to one of his lovers.

00:44:18.830 --> 00:44:21.750
And he saw this image of
Christ crucified on Mt.

00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:22.250
Ronda.

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:25.030
And it was a place
that Serra loved.

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:26.590
Here's Soller.

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:30.330
Now, what does that remind
you of, that landscape?

00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:31.310
California.

00:44:31.310 --> 00:44:35.450
So I always say, Serra
left home to go home.

00:44:35.450 --> 00:44:36.200
It's beautiful.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:39.625
If you've never been to
Mallorca, you won't regret it.

00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:42.980
This is Soller, which is
where the olive press,

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.550
the great olive press was.

00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:46.870
And Serra and his father
would take the olives

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:50.040
on a mule train over the
mountain, the Tramuntana,

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.920
down into Soller,
which was a port town,

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.670
and put the olives
in the great grinder.

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:58.150
There he is.

00:44:58.150 --> 00:45:04.020
Now, that's probably the only
painting he really sat for.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.990
But we're not even
sure that he did.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.220
But we guess around
1773, we think

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:16.630
it was Jose de Paez, who
was a great Mexican painter.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:20.945
He looks a little
fraught, I'd say, puzzled.

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:27.770
The copy-- the original, if
it ever existed, is no more.

00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:30.620
This is one extant copy.

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:32.940
And it's at Mission
Santa Barbara.

00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:35.510
So if you ever want to see
it, that's where it is.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:37.810
OK, the goodbye
letter to his parents.

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:38.650
I flipped it.

00:45:38.650 --> 00:45:41.940
This is the fourth leaf.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:44.750
Remember, I was
talking about the spots

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:46.500
on the goodbye letter?

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.190
Let's see, can you see it here?

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:51.819
There's one way up here
and then one down here.

00:45:51.819 --> 00:45:53.110
I don't know if you can see it.

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:54.690
It's not quite focused.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:56.430
But it's there.

00:45:56.430 --> 00:46:00.150
Also take a look at how
he finished the letter.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:01.320
This is the actual letter.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:02.350
This is the margin.

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:05.320
And on the side of
the leaf, he just

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:07.570
couldn't stop saying goodbye.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:11.860
Goodbye to my-- please express
goodbye to my cousins, Jose.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.870
And please say goodbye to the
baker down the street in Petra.

00:46:15.870 --> 00:46:17.940
He just filled
this with goodbyes.

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.930
It's obviously a
very painful letter.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:22.800
And then he ends
it, cordial amigo

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.960
in Cristo, your cordial
friend in Christ,

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:30.450
Junipero Serra, Junipero
Serra, indigno sacerdote,

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:33.280
which in Latin is
"unworthy priest."

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.440
But look at this.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.830
There's a little squiggle here.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:40.380
And I think-- and
you wouldn't see

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:45.000
unless you saw the original--
that he added a superlative.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:46.160
It's not "indigno."

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:51.840
It's "indignisimo," which
means "most unworthy priest."

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:56.194
All right, here's
North America in 1663.

00:46:56.194 --> 00:46:56.985
You see California?

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:03.670
It's this huge island.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:07.370
And that's what California
was taken as for a long time.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.500
Into the middle of
the 18th century,

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.670
California was thought
to be an island.

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:15.310
And in this case, it's half the
size of the continental United

00:47:15.310 --> 00:47:16.400
States.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.560
This is "The Founding"
in Monterrey--

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:21.970
the great painting
called "The Founding."

00:47:21.970 --> 00:47:28.980
The painting is 1877, but the
event was 1700-- 1770, sorry,

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:32.130
the second mission.

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:33.680
This is the Vizcaino.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.080
It's no longer there today.

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:38.630
But there was an earlier
mass done in 1602

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:41.050
by the explorer
Sebastian Vizcaino.

00:47:41.050 --> 00:47:44.510
And in it lasted for many
years, until it finally

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:46.690
rotted and was thrown
into the bay when

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:52.090
they were building a
train, in about 1905.

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:55.680
Probably one of the more famous
trees in American history.

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.770
I mentioned Maria de Agreda.

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:02.100
This is a picture of her I
got from Zacatecas in Mexico.

00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:03.660
Here's Maria.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:06.610
And she's sitting next to
one of the evangelists.

00:48:06.610 --> 00:48:10.455
Can you guess which one,
the four gospel writers?

00:48:10.455 --> 00:48:12.560
It's John, Saint John.

00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:16.700
And they each are
wielding a pen-- writers.

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:21.940
And this is the name of
her great book on Mary.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.130
I mentioned to you the
last night of his life

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:27.990
was-- great fear
had come over him.

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:29.510
This is the great fear painting.

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:35.950
If there was any doubt that's
what he had said-- very soon,

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:37.700
he died in 1784.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.220
So six years later, there's
a painting about this moment.

00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:43.210
It was legendary even then.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.960
And it would have to
have been transferred

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:48.780
by his very close friend and
first biographer, Francisco

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:50.056
Palou.

00:48:50.056 --> 00:48:51.180
Here's Serra in the middle.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.160
This is Palou himself,
doing last rites.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:54.840
Can you see?

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:57.140
It's not easy to see it.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.040
Maybe over here, more easy.

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.680
There's a face above Palou.

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.475
Can you see it?

00:49:03.475 --> 00:49:06.360
It's very difficult to see
on this project-- that's

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:09.500
an Indian, Indian chief.

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:13.610
And on the left is probably
Governor Pedro Fagus,

00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:17.210
who clashed with
Serra constantly.

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:18.360
I love this painting.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:21.660
It's shown in Carmel
Mission once a year,

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.230
for the week before Christmas.

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:28.000
And it's Mary being visited
by St. Elizabeth, who's

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.540
pregnant with John the Baptist.

00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:32.930
And Mary, of course, is
pregnant with Christ.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:35.130
The painting was
done around 1500.

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:40.070
And it is in the Uffizi in
Florence, the great Uffizi

00:49:40.070 --> 00:49:40.870
gallery.

00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:42.040
This is a copy.

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:46.890
And the copy-- a very good
one-- is in Carmel Mission.

00:49:46.890 --> 00:49:50.010
Oh god, forget him.

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:51.750
I'm out the childhood window.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:53.760
And the last picture
will make my wife--

00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:59.390
she's in the backyard of
Serra's home in Petra, looking

00:49:59.390 --> 00:50:02.880
a little-- oh, Greg,
isn't it time to go?

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.290
Well, thank you.

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:08.933
[APPLAUSE]
