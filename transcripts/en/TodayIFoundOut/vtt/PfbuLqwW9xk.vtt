00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.680
During the period when the Earth is furthest
from the sun (aphelion), the average temperature

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.360
of the entire planet is about 4°F (2.3°C)
higher than when it is closest to the sun

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.360
(perihelion).

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.399
On average, the intensity of sunlight falling
on Earth during aphelion is about 7% less

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.050
than during perihelion.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.399
Despite this, the Earth ends up being warmer
during the period in which it is furthest

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.700
away from the sun.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.850
So what’s going on here?

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.880
During the winter months, for the Northern
Hemisphere, the overall temperature of the

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.079
Southern Hemisphere, where it is summer, doesn’t
change as much as the other way around.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.489
This is because a much larger portion of the
Southern Hemisphere, compared to the Northern

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:57.409
Hemisphere, is made up of water and water
has a significantly greater heat capacity

00:00:57.409 --> 00:00:58.530
than land.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.739
On a similar vein then, during the summer
for the Southern Hemisphere, the overall average

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.820
temperature of the Southern Hemisphere doesn’t
increase as much as the Northern Hemisphere

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.790
does during its summer, for this same reason.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.520
So the “tl;dr” version is: there is a
lot more land in the Northern Hemisphere than

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.120
the Southern Hemisphere; this land heats up
much faster than water and water cools down

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.410
much slower than land.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.770
So even though there is less intensity of
sunlight during the summer in the Northern

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.010
Hemisphere, the Earth’s average temperature
is higher at this time when it’s furthest

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.400
from the sun.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.340
As you might have guessed then or already
known, the seasons are not caused by the distance

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.940
the Earth is from the sun, but rather are
caused completely by the fact that the Earth

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.330
is tilted on its axis 23.5°.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.710
This is why when it’s summer in the Northern
Hemisphere, it’s winter in the Southern

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.720
Hemisphere, and vice-verse.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.990
Without this tilt, there would be no seasons
and the weather from day to day across the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.510
globe would be relatively uniform.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.180
In this case, there would only be a very slight
variation in temperature as the Earth got

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.430
closer or further away from the Sun, but for
the most part, everything weather-wise would

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:15.569
stay the same year round.
