00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.210
HOST: So I'm incredibly
excited to be here today

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.150
to introduce Kevin Kwan, the
international bestselling

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.950
author of "Crazy Rich Asians"
and "China Rich Girlfriend,"

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.960
the first two of an intended
three novels about the schemers

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.490
and dreamers in
Asia's upper crust.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.060
So my friends and I were
obsessed with the ridiculously

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.860
titled "Crazy Rich Asians"
when we visited Singapore back

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.150
in 2013.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.620
And we would just run around
Asia quoting the book,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.040
even though we were
all not so rich Asians.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.509
And we went wild when
Kevin released the sequel

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.470
earlier this year.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.980
And I would say that's the
great thing about the book

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.500
and the strength of Kevin's
writing-- it doesn't matter

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.880
if you weren't raised in
Asia or you didn't grow up

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.510
with Thai lady maids, the
writing just sucks you in

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.250
and it paints such a vivid
picture of the lifestyle

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.780
and his character's mindsets.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.680
Which also explains
why he's been featured

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.400
in "Vanity Fair," "The
Atlantic," "The Wall Street

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.320
Journal," NPR, among
other media sources,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.510
and that there's now a
movie version in the works

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.520
by the same producers
of "Hunger Games."

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.920
So with that said,
please join me

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.440
in giving a warm Google
welcome to Kevin Kwan who

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.880
will be doing a reading from
his book, after which we will

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.720
precede to Q&amp;A session,
then take questions

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.470
from the audience.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.886
OK, clap.

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:17.296
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.310
KEVIN KWAN: Hey, thanks for
coming here today on your lunch

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.330
break or whatever.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.430
It's just so amazing
to be at Google.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.320
The company that we use every
second of our lives, basically.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.430
So it's really a
thrill to be here

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.140
and to see such a
great turnout to come

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.350
see me read from my book.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.880
So I guess I should just start
with doing a brief reading.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.380
HOST: Yes.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.350
KEVIN KWAN: I just I'd just kick
start things to get the juices

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.914
flowing.

00:01:45.914 --> 00:01:47.080
HOST: China Rich Girlfriend.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.163
KEVIN KWAN: And I'm going
to read from "China Rich

00:01:49.163 --> 00:01:53.155
Girlfriend," my new novel, which
is the sequel to "Crazy Rich

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:54.510
Asians."

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.370
And I'm reading a chapter
I've never read before live.

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.150
So if I stumble, if I trip
and fall, you know why.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.370
"London, 8th of September, 2012.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.310
9:00AM, Greenwich Mean Time.

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.970
A red Ferrari 458 Italia crashed
through the window of the Jimmy

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.970
Choo Shoe Boutique on Sloane
Street sometime between 4:00AM

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.720
and 4:30AM last night.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.810
No one witnessed the incident.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.290
Metropolitan Police
reported that two passengers

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.530
were taken to Saint
Mary's Paddington

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.910
where they're being treated
for serious but non-critical

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.300
injuries.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.550
The vehicle's
owner's name was not

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.620
released pending
further investigation.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.694
Sarah [? Liar ?],
the London Chronicle.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.941
Beijing Capital International
Airport, September 9, 2012,

00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:47.440
7:45PM.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.960
"Wait a minute,
I'm in first class.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.360
Take me to first class."

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.410
Edison Cheng said contemptuously
to the flight attendant

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.660
escorting him to his seat.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.960
"This is first
class, Mr. Cheng,"

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.610
the man in the crispy
navy uniform informed him.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.400
"But where are the cabins,"
Eddie asked, still confused.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.760
"Mr. Cheng, I'm afraid
British Airways does not have

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.804
private cabins in first class.

00:03:13.804 --> 00:03:15.220
But if you'll allow
me to show you

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.630
some of the special
features of your seat--"

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.240
"No, no, no.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.260
That's fine."

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.120
Eddie tossed his ostrich
leather briefcase onto the seat

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.690
like a petulant schoolboy.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:24.850
"Damn it to hell.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.410
The sacrifices I have to
make for this bank today."

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.770
Edison Cheng, the pampered
prince of privative bankers.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.310
Famous in Hong
Kong society pages

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.520
for his bon vivant lifestyle,
his dapper wardrobe,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.610
his elegant wife, Fiona,
his photogenic children,

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.050
and his superb
lineage-- his mother

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.050
is Alexandra Young,
of the Singapore

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.360
Youngs-- was unaccustomed
to such inconveniences.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.110
Five hours ago he
had been interrupted

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.310
during a luncheon at
the Hong Kong Club,

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.760
rushed aboard the company
jet bound for Beijing,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.170
and then hustled on to
this flight to London.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.070
It had been years since he
had suffered the indignity

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.050
of flying commercial.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.800
But Mrs. Bao was on
this godforsaken plane,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.290
and Mrs. Bao needed
to be accommodated.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.810
But where exactly was the lady?

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.880
Eddie expected to find
her seated nearby,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.380
but the chief parser informed
him there was no such person

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.269
by that name in the cabin.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.190
"No, no, she's
supposed to be here.

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.310
Can you check the flight
manifest or something?"

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:22.780
Eddie demanded.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.310
Minutes later,
Eddie found himself

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.950
being led to row 37, seat E of
the aircraft-- economy class--

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.920
where a petite woman
in a white Vicuna

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.650
turtleneck and
gray flannel slacks

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.985
sat sandwiched between
two passengers.

00:04:37.985 --> 00:04:39.990
"Mrs. Bow?

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.090
Bao Shou Yen?"

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:42.950
Eddie inquired in Mandarin.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.610
The woman looked up
and smiled wanly.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.100
"Are you Mr. Cheng?"
"Yes, so glad to meet you.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.300
I'm sorry we had to me like
this," Eddie smile in relief.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.410
He had spent the past eight
years managing the Bao family's

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.810
offshore accounts.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.490
But they were such
a secretive lot,

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:01.957
he had never met any
of them until today.

00:05:01.957 --> 00:05:04.040
Even though she looked
rather tired at the moment,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.670
Bow Shou Yen was
much prettier than he

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.090
had imagined with alabaster
skin, large eyes that slanted

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.170
upwards at the edges,
and high cheekbones

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:14.090
accentuated by the way she
wore her jet black hair,

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.320
pulled into a
tight, low ponytail.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.100
She did not look old enough
to have a son in grad school.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.170
"Why are you seated here?

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:22.700
Was there some mix up?"

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.650
Eddie asked urgently.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:25.450
"No, no.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.240
I always fly economy
class," Mrs. Bao replied.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.510
Eddie couldn't hide
his look of surprise.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.400
Mrs. Bow's husband,
Bao Gowlong, was one

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.500
of Beijing's top politicians.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.960
And what's more,
he had inherited

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.410
one of China's biggest
pharmaceutical firms.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.140
The Baos weren't just one
of his regular clients,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.930
they were his ultra
high net worth clients.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.760
"Only my son flies first
class," Bao Shou Yen

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.500
explained, catching
Eddie's luck.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.210
"Carlton can eat all of
the fancy Western food.

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.250
And being a student
under so much pressure,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.380
he needs all the
rest he can get.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.150
But for me it's not worth it.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.640
I don't touch airplane food.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.680
And I can never sleep on
these long flights anyway."

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.390
Eddie had to resist his
urge to roll his eyes.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.999
Typical mainlanders.

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:12.040
They lavished every penny
on their little emperor

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.660
and suffered in silence.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.610
Well, look where that got them.

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.350
23-year-old Carlton
Bao was supposed

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.740
to be at Cambridge finishing
his master's dissertation,

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.490
but had instead spent
the previous evening

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.340
doing his best Prince
Harry impersonation,

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.230
running up a 38,000 pound bar
tab at half a dozen London

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.190
night spots, wrecking
his brand new Ferrari,

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.440
destroying public property, and
almost getting himself killed.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.512
And that wasn't even
the worst of it.

00:06:37.512 --> 00:06:39.720
The worst of it, Eddie had
been explicitly instructed

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.780
not to reveal to Bao Shou Yen.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:43.820
Eddie faced a conundrum.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.660
He urgently needed to go
over the plans with Mrs. Bao,

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.060
but he would sooner
endure a colonoscopy

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.480
than spend the next 11
hours slumming it in coach.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.990
God in heaven, what if
someone recognized him?

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:57.450
A picture of Edison Cheng
crammed into an economy class

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.290
seat will go viral
within seconds.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:03.040
Yet Eddie begrudgingly realized
that it would be unseemly

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.130
for one of his bank's
most important clients

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.080
to remain here in steerage
while he was up front,

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.150
stretched out on a
flat bed recliner,

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:12.410
sipping 20-year-old cognac.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.150
He eyed the spiky haired youth
slouching dangerously close

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.471
to Mrs. Bao on one side,
and the elderly woman

00:07:17.471 --> 00:07:19.220
clipping her nails in
the air sickness bag

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.330
on her other side, a
solution springing to mind.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:25.060
Lowering his voice, Eddie said.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.530
"Mrs. Bow, I would of
course be happy to join you

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.320
in this cabin, but there
are some highly confidential

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.320
matters we need to discuss.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.750
Would you allow me to arrange
a seat for you up front?"

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.660
"Well, I suppose if
the bank insists,"

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.250
Bao Shou Yen replied
a little hesitantly.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.634
After takeoff when
aperitifs had been served

00:07:45.634 --> 00:07:47.300
and they were both
comfortably ensconced

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.310
in the sumptuous pod-like
seats facing each other,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.160
Eddie wasted no time
updating his client.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.220
"Mrs. Bao, I was in contact with
London just before boarding.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.130
Your son has been stabilized.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.690
The surgery to repair
his punctured spleen

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:02.370
was completely successful.

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.280
And now the orthopedic
team can take over."

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.230
"Oh, thank all the
gods," Bao Shou Yen

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:11.771
sighed, easing back in to
her seat for the first time.

00:08:11.771 --> 00:08:14.020
"We've already lined up the
top reconstructive plastic

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.074
surgeon in London,
Dr. Peter Ashley,

00:08:16.074 --> 00:08:17.490
and he'll be in
the operating room

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.470
alongside the orthopedic
team attending to your son."

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:24.945
"My poor boy," Bao Shou Yen
said, her eyes getting moist.

00:08:24.945 --> 00:08:30.170
"Your son was very lucky."
"And the British girl?"

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.800
"The girl is still
in surgery, but I'm

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.640
sure she'll pull
through just fine,"

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.849
Eddie said, putting
on his peppiest smile.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:42.150
Barely 30 minutes earlier, Eddie
had been on another airplane

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.860
parked in a private hangar at
Beijing Capital International

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:48.330
Airport, taking in the grim
details during a hastily

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.800
arranged crisis management
meeting with Mr. Tin,

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.870
the grey haired security
chief for the Bao family,

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.320
and Nigel Tomlinson,
his bank's Asia chief.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.170
The two men had climbed
aboard the Lear jet

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:03.310
as soon as it had landed,
huddled over Nigel's laptop

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:05.240
while an associate
in London gave

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.230
the latest update via a
secure feed video conference.

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.110
"Carlton is out of surgery now.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:12.585
He was quite a bit banged up.

00:09:12.585 --> 00:09:14.543
But being in the driver's
seat with his air bag

00:09:14.543 --> 00:09:16.920
and everything, he actually
suffered the least injuries.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.500
But of the English
girl, it's touch and go.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.467
She's still in a coma
and they've relieved

00:09:21.467 --> 00:09:22.550
the swelling in the brain.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.280
But that's all they
can do for her now."

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:27.380
"And the other girl?"

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.974
Mr. Tin asked, squinting at the
small, pixelated pop up window.

00:09:31.974 --> 00:09:35.740
"Uh, we're told she
died on impact."

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:37.420
Nigel sighed.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:43.070
"And she was Chinese?"
"We believe so, sir."

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.130
Eddie shook his head.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.679
"What a mess.

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:48.220
We need to track
down the next of kin

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.680
immediately before they're
contacted by the authorities."

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.430
"How do you even fit three
people into a Ferrari?"

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.260
Nigel asked.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.450
Mr. Tin twirled
his phone nervously

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:00.910
on the lacquered walnut console.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.406
"Carlton Bao's father is
on a state visit to Canada

00:10:03.406 --> 00:10:06.740
with the Premiere of China and
nothing must interrupt him.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:09.550
My orders from Mrs. Bao
are that note of a scandal

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.950
must ever reach his ears.

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.640
He must never know
about the dead girl.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.950
Do you understand?

00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.490
There's too much at stake
given his political position.

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:19.756
And it is especially
sensitive with a big

00:10:19.756 --> 00:10:22.130
once in a decade changeover
in party leadership happening

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.490
right now."

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:25.990
"Of course, of course,"
Nigel assured him.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.829
"We will say that the white
girl was his girlfriend.

00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:30.370
And as far as the
father is concerned

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.722
there was only one girl in the
car." "Why does Mr. Bao even

00:10:34.722 --> 00:10:36.180
need to know about
the white girl?"

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.830
"Don't worry, Mr. Tin, I have
handled much worse dealings

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.450
with those [INAUDIBLE]
children in--" Eddie boasted.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.720
Nigel shot Eddie
a warning glare.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.462
The bank prided itself
on utmost discretion,

00:10:47.462 --> 00:10:48.920
and here was his
associate blabbing

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.240
away about other clients.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.670
"We have a tactical
response team in London

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:55.210
that I am personally directing.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.710
And I can assure you we will
do everything to contain this,"

00:10:57.710 --> 00:10:59.730
Nigel said before
turning to Eddie.

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:01.230
"How much do you
think it would take

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:03.640
to keep Fleet Street quiet?"

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:07.740
Eddie inhaled deeply trying
to do some quick calculations.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.260
"It's not just the press.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.340
The policeman, the ambulance
drivers, the hospital staff,

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.740
the families.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.330
There's going to be an ass
load of people to shut up.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:19.932
I would suggest 10 million
pounds for starters."

00:11:19.932 --> 00:11:21.640
"Well, the minute you
land in London, you

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.699
need to take Mrs. Bao
straight to the office.

00:11:23.699 --> 00:11:25.240
We need her to sign
off on a withdraw

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.875
before you take her to the
hospital to see her son.

00:11:27.875 --> 00:11:29.250
I'm just wondering
what we should

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.080
say if Mr. Bao asks
why we needed so much,"

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.040
Nigel pondered.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.730
"Just say the girl needed some
new organs," Mr. Tin suggested.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:41.830
"We can also say that we need to
pay the boutique," Eddie added.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:47.018
Those Jimmy shoes are
bloody pricey, you know?"

00:11:47.018 --> 00:11:49.886
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:54.150
And that's basically
how book two begins.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.650
HOST: Yeah.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:56.810
That's great because
that leads exactly

00:11:56.810 --> 00:12:00.800
in to my first question,
which is where do you

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.270
draw inspiration for your
characters and their antics

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:03.770
from?

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.000
Because I read about
a 2012 Ferrari crash

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.810
in Beijing involving two
young women and the son

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:10.310
of a high level
government official,

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.909
which sounds very strangely
similar to what you just read.

00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:15.700
So I was wondering if
you're an avid reader

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.360
of the local Asian press.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.360
KEVIN KWAN: I really am.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.860
I get lots of Google alerts
on what's happening in China.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.760
And it really was my
intention from the time

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.980
I started the first
books I had always

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.730
intended this to be a trilogy.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.700
And I knew it would
start in Singapore

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:34.770
in sort of this
established Asian capital.

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:38.750
But I really wanted to move the
action in book two to China.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.480
My original intention was to
call the next book "Crazier

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.390
Richer Asians."

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.420
And so naturally you have to go
to China and to the antics that

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.320
are happening there right
now and keep on happening.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.190
HOST: Yeah.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:53.490
That's great because
that leads right

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.920
to another question I have.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.084
KEVIN KWAN: Oh, gosh.

00:12:57.084 --> 00:12:58.500
This is being
videoed, by the way.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.955
HOST: Yes.

00:13:00.955 --> 00:13:04.650
So, yeah, I know you're
working on that third book.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.079
And, like you said, the first
one took place in Singapore.

00:13:07.079 --> 00:13:08.870
And then it went to
China to another level.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:12.260
What is that third
crazier level?

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:13.747
Like where can it go from there?

00:13:13.747 --> 00:13:15.330
KEVIN KWAN: You will
just have to see.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:15.950
HOST: Oh.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.300
KEVIN KWAN: But I really
hope to explore yet

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.130
another facet of Asia.

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:20.630
HOST: OK.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:24.275
KEVIN KWAN: And really sort
of reveal some hidden truths

00:13:24.275 --> 00:13:26.967
to that aspect of Asia.

00:13:26.967 --> 00:13:27.550
HOST: Awesome.

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.620
Very cool.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.220
So I know that you come from
a well off Singaporean family

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.140
yourself.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.960
So I was wondering what
prompted you to write the book,

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.160
and why now?

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.170
KEVIN KWAN: What
prompted and why now.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:43.310
Really it was because
maybe starting five

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.249
or six years ago
I would really see

00:13:45.249 --> 00:13:47.040
all these headlines in
the "New York Times"

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.490
and the "Wall Street Journal"
and various other magazines,

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.320
"Forbes" magazine.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.175
It was all about the Asian
miracle, economic miracle, Asia

00:13:54.175 --> 00:13:55.160
isl booming.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.137
So that would be one sort
of trope of literature.

00:13:58.137 --> 00:13:59.970
And then there would
be these other articles

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.590
about the corruption of
China or the crazy spending

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:05.270
antics of Asians.

00:14:05.270 --> 00:14:09.320
And I just felt that it was such
an unfair portrayal of what's

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:14.050
actually a much more complex
social economic issue that's

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:16.350
unfolding on the other
side of the world that's

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.610
sort of taking place.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.820
And so I really wanted
to write this as a novel

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:21.650
and really tell a
more human story

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.440
of what it's truly
like to be living

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:26.210
in Asia from a family
of extreme wealth,

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.170
and what it's like to not be
from families of extreme wealth

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.470
also.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.597
Because it's such an
interesting confluence

00:14:33.597 --> 00:14:34.680
of events happening there.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.309
HOST: Yeah.

00:14:35.309 --> 00:14:36.600
That definitely is interesting.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.940
And something else that I
thought was really interesting

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.667
is, of course, there's the
difference between old money

00:14:42.667 --> 00:14:45.250
and new money, which we've seen
since the day of like F. Scott

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.060
Fitzgerald, but there's
another layer that you

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.220
add in your book
between the younger

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.790
generation of old money, and the
older generation of old money.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:57.020
Like you see with Astrid and
Edison's love for couture,

00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:02.050
versus their moms who would
stay six in an apartment

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:03.910
room instead of
paying for a hotel.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:05.730
So I was wondering
if that's something

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.020
that you're seeing now.

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:10.870
Is it specific to China
and specific to Asia

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.909
and what exactly was
leading up to that?

00:15:13.909 --> 00:15:15.950
KEVIN KWAN: It's something
I've seen all my life,

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:16.900
quite frankly.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.920
And I think it's a very
typical human nature

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.800
thing for the first
generation to make the money,

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.470
and the second
generation to spend it,

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:26.310
and the third generation to
waste it all away in a way.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.870
But especially in Asia
and in China right now,

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.950
the process of gentrification
and the process

00:15:32.950 --> 00:15:35.770
of fortune making has
been so accelerated

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:39.250
in Singapore and Hong Kong,
it took families decades

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:40.640
to build up fortunes.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.590
Sometimes whole generations
before the next generation

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:44.510
could benefit.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.120
But in China we're seeing it
happen at warp speed, where

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.990
people are making overnight
fortunes, billions

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.730
of dollars over a decade.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:54.950
An interesting statistic
that I just came across

00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:57.980
was that 10 years ago there was
not even a single billionaire

00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.520
in mainland China.

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:04.299
And today, as of last week,
there are 597 billionaires.

00:16:04.299 --> 00:16:05.090
HOST: That's crazy.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.715
KEVIN KWAN: They have
more billionaires

00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:07.760
now than at Google.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.712
Believe it or not.

00:16:08.712 --> 00:16:10.390
No.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:12.430
More than the United
States actually.

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.790
So they've surpassed the
US in billionaire creation

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:19.030
in the last decade.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:21.150
And that's kind of crazy.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.570
So you see the spending and
how it's changed the culture.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.510
HOST: So I saw that the
President of China, Xi Jinping,

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:30.810
spoke out this year advising
the second generation

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:33.560
rich in his country to
think about the source

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:37.160
of their wealth and how to
behave after becoming affluent.

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.380
And some local governments
have taken steps

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.350
to re-educate their
wealthy elite.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.020
And in June, according to
the "Beijing Youth Daily,"

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.660
70 heirs to major
Chinese companies

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.200
had to attend lectures
on filial piety

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.370
and the roles of traditional
values in business.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.361
KEVIN KWAN: They went to wealth
concentration camps, basically.

00:16:54.361 --> 00:16:56.360
A wealth re-education
camp, which

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.420
is interesting because
in the last few years

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.795
so much of their antics
they've been reporting it

00:17:01.795 --> 00:17:03.840
on social media, and it
has been going viral.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.310
There are a few famous cases.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:06.726
I don't want to
mention the names.

00:17:06.726 --> 00:17:09.030
But we all know
about the guy who

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:14.390
Instagram a picture of his
dog wearing two Apple Watches.

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:18.300
And another case of a very
famous media personality

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.279
that was just sort of
photographing piles of cash

00:17:21.279 --> 00:17:23.280
on a bed.

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.280
It's been kind of crazy.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.150
And it's really beginning to
trickle down and really affect

00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:30.000
the general population
of China, who do not

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.760
have billions of
dollars and who are

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.967
angry at the entitlement
of that they see.

00:17:33.967 --> 00:17:35.800
And so I think the
Chinese government really

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.635
is taking this seriously in
terms of this is the future.

00:17:38.635 --> 00:17:40.010
This is the new
generation that's

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:42.445
going to be taking over
all these industries

00:17:42.445 --> 00:17:43.070
and businesses.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.666
And they need to kind
of learn the ropes.

00:17:46.666 --> 00:17:48.415
HOST: In their wealth
concentration camps.

00:17:48.415 --> 00:17:49.123
KEVIN KWAN: Yeah.

00:17:49.123 --> 00:17:49.647
Exactly.

00:17:49.647 --> 00:17:51.980
HOST: Are these kinds of
actions happening in Singapore?

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.059
Or is it very China specific?

00:17:54.059 --> 00:17:55.600
KEVIN KWAN: It's
very China specific.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.090
Because Singapore has a very
sort of established old money

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.100
sort of aristocracy
that's existed

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:02.430
for over a hundred years.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:07.330
So they have learned their
own way over the decades

00:18:07.330 --> 00:18:09.033
how to manage their money.

00:18:09.033 --> 00:18:11.490
How to hide their money.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.527
How to show their money.

00:18:12.527 --> 00:18:14.610
It's a very different mode
of behavior than what's

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.500
happening in China now.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.000
HOST: OK.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.010
That makes sense.

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:23.100
And then speaking of the
crazy antics in China,

00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.440
I know that you've
had to tone down

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.529
a lot of antics for your book
so it would be more believable.

00:18:29.529 --> 00:18:31.320
And I was wondering if
you could indulge us

00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.380
in something that
is real but you

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.800
had to take out of your book.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.050
Or just another real
crazy situation.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.100
KEVIN KWAN: So many things
I had to change or take out

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:43.410
to protect the identities
of people and places

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:46.820
I was able to gain
access to or invited to.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.500
So I can't be too specific
about these instances.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:55.980
But let's just say that so much
of what happens at this level

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.850
is becoming much and
much more hidden.

00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:59.750
We're seeing now
these Chinese families

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.950
moving into really
safeguarding their privacy,

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.360
not wanting to overtly
show off what they have.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.260
So I was able-- when
I was last in China--

00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:13.140
I was able to see some
incredible, incredible

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:14.150
residences, for example.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:17.060
How people live privately.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:19.120
So there's a new
level of discretion.

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.180
How people spend their money--
it's becoming covert now,

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.000
which is interesting.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.420
But it's unfathomable.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:29.476
Their spending in the way that
the Vanderbilts were spending

00:19:29.476 --> 00:19:30.600
at the turn of the century.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.880
Building gigantic
pleasure palaces,

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.260
commissioning planes
from companies,

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.210
these gigantic planes.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:41.830
HOST: Are there koy
ponds in planes?

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.210
That blew my mind.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:46.680
KEVIN KWAN: The Koi
pond, I don't know.

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.880
I've seen and heard of other
planes with crazier stuff.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.356
So the Koi pond was
a really tame version

00:19:53.356 --> 00:19:54.730
of me being able
to say something

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.140
without identifying a plane.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.460
Because there is this one
plane, which I did see,

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.690
which is so specific.

00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.130
And what they managed to
accomplish on this plane

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:05.459
was sort of mind boggling.

00:20:05.459 --> 00:20:06.500
It might involve bowling.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:11.130
HOST: Wow.

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:14.070
How has your response been
from your Asian audiences?

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:17.460
And has that varied
country to country?

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.530
KEVIN KWAN: I think
uniformly there's been

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:21.170
a great deal of excitement.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.960
It's certainly been
much more positive

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.310
than I was anticipating
it to be because I

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.930
do satirize this world.

00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:30.970
But when I was on tour a
few months ago in Hong Kong

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:32.770
and the Philippines,
the response

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:34.980
was pretty much
overwhelmingly positive.

00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.680
There's just so
much excitement I

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.650
think coming from
that part of the world

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.229
that the West is
paying attention now

00:20:41.229 --> 00:20:42.770
and that we're
telling a story that's

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:45.710
contemporary about what's
really happening in Asia now

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.910
and portraying Asians
in a positive light,

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.177
generally speaking.

00:20:49.177 --> 00:20:49.760
HOST: Exactly.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.790
And in a different light than
they're used to being seen in.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:53.940
KEVIN KWAN: Exactly.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:56.660
HOST: Yeah, I felt like a
common motif in your book

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:58.820
is how Westerners
underestimate Asians,

00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.340
whether it's through the opening
scene in the London hotel

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:04.320
in "Crazy Rich Asians," where
the families were discriminated

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.310
against because of their race,
or in "China Rich Girlfriend"

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:09.220
where the designers
had only sent them

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.960
runway looks
specifically tailored

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.990
to the Chinese market
instead of collections

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:14.980
that would be shown
in New York or Paris.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.040
So I was wondering if
this was a reflection

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.650
of the general
underestimation of Asians

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.607
that you're seeing going
on in the world now.

00:21:21.607 --> 00:21:22.565
KEVIN KWAN: Definitely.

00:21:25.905 --> 00:21:27.930
And it's being
turned on its head.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.540
Because, for example, if
you go to Europe now, even

00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:35.370
in New York, most of the people
you see shopping at the top car

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:38.950
dealerships, at the top jewelry
stores on Madison Avenue

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.480
are distinctly Asian.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:45.695
So the wealth
equation has shifted.

00:21:45.695 --> 00:21:48.350
And luxury spending,
the Asian consumer

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:52.010
now accounts for 70% of
the global luxury market.

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:55.760
So all these companies
have to very quickly redo

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.690
their strategies
to respond to that.

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:02.920
HOST: That is crazy.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.800
KEVIN KWAN: It's no
accident that four

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.085
of the top hotels in London
are owned by Singaporeans.

00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:14.480
HOST: Oh, and then
speaking of Singaporeans.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.980
I was wondering because this
is an area filled with Asians

00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.850
from so many
different countries,

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:23.620
how would you describe how
different Singaporean culture

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.400
is to others?

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.344
I know you touched upon
in a little bit before.

00:22:27.344 --> 00:22:30.010
KEVIN KWAN: I think Singapore is
interesting because it's always

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:33.160
been this crossroads
since the 1800's.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.330
It was a port city.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.470
It was sort of the deep border
port in the Southeast Asia

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.970
region.

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:42.100
So it really was kind of
the most multicultural city

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.300
in Asia, I feel.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.490
With this Indian, Malaise,
Chinese, and European

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:50.650
population just co-mingling
and existing and supporting

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:51.970
each other very well.

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:55.770
And it's sort of advanced into
the 21st century with this very

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.120
multicultural city.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:59.690
And it's really
created a dynamism

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:01.770
that's very different
than other cities in Asia

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:06.160
where, for example, Taiwan
is very much a Chinese city.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.630
Hong Kong there's a
colonial British influence

00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:11.910
that's still overwhelmingly the
population that's Cantonese.

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.090
Where then Singapore you have
all these groups and dialect

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:16.740
groups of Chinese,
mixing with Malaise,

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:20.240
with Indians, with Europeans,
now more than ever.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.770
So it's made it a very sort
of cosmopolitan melting pot.

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:24.330
HOST: Got it.

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.590
And that's definitely
reflected in all the food

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:28.450
you mention as well in the book.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:29.240
That makes sense.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:29.948
KEVIN KWAN: Yeah.

00:23:29.948 --> 00:23:32.431
It's the original foodie town.

00:23:32.431 --> 00:23:32.930
HOST: Yeah.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:35.680
It was probably one of the most
enjoyable parts of the books.

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:38.460
So I wanted to talk about
your upcoming movie.

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:43.260
So I love this quote from
you from June of this year

00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.890
in the "Hollywood Reporter."

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:48.700
And I quote, "It's so perplexing
to see how casting in Hollywood

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:49.880
is so defensive.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.960
I think audiences are much more
accepting of casting choices.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.850
When "Crazy Rich
Asians" came out,

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:56.600
there was initial
interest from a producer

00:23:56.600 --> 00:23:59.100
who wanted to change
the heroine, Rachel Chu,

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:00.260
into a white girl.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.010
I tell that story to book clubs
in suburban middle America

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:04.470
and they go crazy.

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:06.580
Why does Hollywood
think we want to see

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:08.290
this movie with white people?

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:09.950
They don't need every
film to be chock

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.890
full of the latest stars."

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.304
So now that you're further
along in the film development

00:24:14.304 --> 00:24:15.720
process, I was
wondering if you've

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.940
run into any difficulties
in casting an all Asian cast

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:21.619
or if that's something
that we're going to see.

00:24:21.619 --> 00:24:23.660
KEVIN KWAN: We're not in
the casting process yet.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:26.180
But I can tell you that the
producers, the financers,

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:29.240
everyone involved is
so excited to really

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:34.680
cast a pan Asian dream team
of actors from North America,

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:36.990
from all over Asia,
to really reflect

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.680
the diversity of
characters in my book.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.000
And there hasn't been
even a suggestion

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.020
that anyone's not
going to be Asian.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:47.040
You know, the book is
called "Crazy Rich Asians."

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.749
And I think not just
Hollywood, but everyone in Asia

00:24:50.749 --> 00:24:52.290
is so fascinated by
this because it's

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:53.539
the first time it's happening.

00:24:53.539 --> 00:24:55.700
And so everyone has
skin in the game.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:58.420
They're all wanting to see
what happens, who is cast,

00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:02.590
and there's tremendous pressure
for Hollywood to do this right,

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:06.830
and to really represent
this right in a way that's

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.860
never happened before.

00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:08.694
HOST: Yeah, exactly.

00:25:08.694 --> 00:25:10.110
KEVIN KWAN: But
definitely I think

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.390
Hollywood has made a lot
of very defensive moves

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:14.810
with their casting choices
in the past few years.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.540
Like with "Aloha"
the Cameron Crowe

00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.610
movie where a Hawaiian
Chinese character turned out

00:25:19.610 --> 00:25:21.490
to be Emma Stone.

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.250
And Hollywood didn't
used to be like this.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.440
If you think back to
the '50s and the '60s,

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.670
really vanguard actors.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:32.590
Hispanic, Chinese, Egyptian.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.030
Omar Sharif to Nancy Kwan.

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:38.890
They made stars and people
would go and see these movies.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.610
And now all they want to do is
cast people that are already

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:42.970
bankable box office hits.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.760
And it's kind of very much
like an Ostrich in the sand

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.020
mentality, I think,
when audiences really

00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.990
want to see new people.

00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.490
they.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.680
Want to see these new stories.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:58.490
Not everything can be a
Marvel comic re-enactment.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:00.020
HOST: So, speaking
of audiences, who

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.870
do you see as your audience
for this new movie that's

00:26:03.870 --> 00:26:04.584
coming up?

00:26:04.584 --> 00:26:06.000
KEVIN KWAN: You
know, we're really

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.250
trying to target this
to a global audience.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:10.870
Because I've seen
with my books--

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.360
my book now has been
translated in to 12 languages

00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.050
internationally.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:16.210
The Hebrew edition
just came out.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:18.186
And everywhere I
go I meet readers

00:26:18.186 --> 00:26:19.560
who are like, oh
my god, you need

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.414
to do Crazy Rich Pakistanis.

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:25.610
You know, I'm from Israel, but
my family is just like this.

00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.100
You need to do Crazy Cheap Jews.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.100
Everyone has found a way to sort
of relate to the characters.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:34.610
And so why wouldn't they
want to see this movie

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.840
about these crazy rich Asians?

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.070
So we don't have one
demographic in mind.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.064
We're hoping to
make everyone happy.

00:26:43.064 --> 00:26:43.730
HOST: Very cool.

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.040
So what are you hoping the
audiences will take away

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.120
from this movie then?

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.870
KEVIN KWAN: I hope they'll just
laugh and have a good time.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:55.590
But also really see the
multidimensionality of Asians

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.740
and what's happening
in Asia right now.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:03.160
That it's not just all war torn
countries and desperate people

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:04.820
having to give
away their babies.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:05.600
Things like that.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.820
There's a new narrative.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:08.801
And these stories
can now be told.

00:27:08.801 --> 00:27:09.300
HOST: Yeah.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.090
Exactly.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:11.730
Yeah, I've heard
your books compared

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.700
a lot to either
Jane Austen novels,

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.100
or maybe even
"Gossip Girl" series.

00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.310
So I was wondering, would
you compare them to that?

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:24.299
And what were your literary
inspirations for this?

00:27:24.299 --> 00:27:25.840
KEVIN KWAN: I mean,
it's interesting.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.923
I mean, Jane Austen is one
of my favorite writers.

00:27:27.923 --> 00:27:31.130
And I do like a lot of these
writers like Edith Wharton

00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:33.710
and F. Scott Fitzgerald
and Dominick Dunne

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.400
and people that were
writing about these circles

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.540
of privilege.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.800
You know, I think since
the beginning of writing,

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.540
since the beginning of
literature, the general public

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:46.600
has always been fascinated by
the foibles of the very rich.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.170
Machiavelli wrote "The Prince."

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:51.850
And then from then on it's
been trollop, and Jane Austen,

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:55.077
it always has been concerning
people of power and privilege.

00:27:55.077 --> 00:27:57.410
And now that the power and
privilege has sort of shifted

00:27:57.410 --> 00:28:00.600
to Asia, this is the new crowd.

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.660
These are the new Elizabeth
Bennets of the world.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.940
HOST: Your book has
been well received

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.040
by many different audiences
regardless of their background.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:16.630
So were there parts that you
saw maybe non-Asian audiences

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:18.440
weren't understanding as well?

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.717
Or was it something that
everyone could relate to?

00:28:21.717 --> 00:28:23.550
KEVIN KWAN: I really
tried to make the story

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:25.090
as universal as possible.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.965
And I wasn't trying to write
for an Asian specific audience.

00:28:27.965 --> 00:28:29.590
If anything, I was
just trying to write

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.330
for a mass American
audience really.

00:28:34.330 --> 00:28:36.570
And I have lots
of footnotes just

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:39.580
to add more detail to some
of the cultural nuances

00:28:39.580 --> 00:28:41.460
of the story, and
things like that.

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.170
So hopefully it's
something that's

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.360
enjoyed and understandable
by everyone.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.850
I did notice though
touring in Asia,

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:50.780
I was in the Philippines
for a couple of weeks.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:55.450
And the Filipinos I think
are like my super fans.

00:28:55.450 --> 00:28:58.200
I'd never seen this many
people turn out for readings,

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.370
and screaming women.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.510
I now know how
Justin Bieber feels.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:05.010
But I realized
something interesting

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.220
was that they're a very
westernized Asian culture.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.720
They're part of Asia.

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:11.042
They get all the Asian jokes.

00:29:11.042 --> 00:29:12.750
But they're also very
Americanized having

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.050
been an American territory.

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:17.720
So they're getting all the
jokes on every level, which

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:20.450
I think has made them
appreciate the book on a much

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:21.331
deeper level.

00:29:21.331 --> 00:29:23.080
And I hope that in
book three I can really

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.810
achieve that so that everyone
can sort of enjoy it,

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:29.040
not just the Filipinos.

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:32.650
HOST: How has the reaction been
from your Chinese audiences

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.350
or your Singapore audiences
where a lot of the book

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.610
does take place in?

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.979
KEVIN KWAN: From what I've
heard, they've been thrilled.

00:29:38.979 --> 00:29:40.770
The book has done really
well in Singapore.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.290
And the Singaporeans I
hear from who like the book

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:45.360
are very happy about it.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.220
There might be some people
who have been not as happy.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:48.720
HOST: Yeah.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:49.580
They probably don't tell you.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.570
KEVIN KWAN: But they
don't say anything.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:51.570
They're too polite.

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:52.800
But we'll see.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:55.659
But it's been generally
extremely positive.

00:29:55.659 --> 00:29:56.450
HOST: That's great.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.860
What audience reaction has
surprised you the most?

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.390
KEVIN KWAN: Actually, from
Asian Americans and Asians

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.160
living in Western countries.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.375
Asian Canadians,
Asian Australians.

00:30:08.375 --> 00:30:10.500
I don't think Asian Americans
were the first people

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.583
to actually read the book.

00:30:11.583 --> 00:30:14.170
I think there was some
skepticism at first.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:16.820
You're confronted by a book
called "Crazy Rich Asians."

00:30:16.820 --> 00:30:18.840
You kind of tend to go,
what's this all about?

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.340
HOST: Yeah.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.220
It did take me awhile
to pick up the book.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:21.850
I'm not going to lie.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:22.558
KEVIN KWAN: Yeah.

00:30:22.558 --> 00:30:25.630
But after it sort of entered
in to the mainstream media

00:30:25.630 --> 00:30:27.730
and more and more people
started talking about it,

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:30.115
I think a lot of the
audience shifted.

00:30:30.115 --> 00:30:33.600
And more and more I began seeing
it interacting with much more

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.190
Asian American audiences.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.992
And for them, there's been
kind of a profound reaction

00:30:37.992 --> 00:30:38.700
from some people.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.160
They've told me how it's
the first time they've

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.830
seen themselves portrayed in
such an honest contemporary way

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:49.310
without all the issues
of previous generations.

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:53.590
So they feel very
kind of inspired

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:59.760
to read about characters who
are empowered, sexy, attractive,

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.500
normal people that just
happen to be Asian.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.070
So that's been a really lovely
sort of fringe benefit, which

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:06.940
I never expected.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.690
AUDIENCE: I find as
I'm reading your book,

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:13.130
my head is spinning with
all the inter-family webs

00:31:13.130 --> 00:31:16.990
of who's involved with who
and how they know each other.

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:20.330
So did you build
these family trees

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:23.460
first and how they would
interweave and interact

00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:24.190
with each other?

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:26.500
Or did that come as
you were writing?

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.330
KEVIN KWAN: I really
built it first.

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.510
I already had an idea of the
sort of very complex structure

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:35.325
of intermarried families.

00:31:35.325 --> 00:31:38.130
And the family tree I think
was the first thing I did.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:39.540
And then I said,
OK, this chapter

00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:40.620
is going to tell the story.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.369
This chapter I'm going
to tell that story.

00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:44.980
And in that way I slowly
kind of put together

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:46.580
this jigsaw puzzle.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.210
But it did start
with the family that

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:53.600
is in the first page
of "Crazy Rich Asians."

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.537
Thanks for asking a question.

00:31:55.537 --> 00:31:57.370
AUDIENCE: I liked your
comment earlier about

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.740
how you felt like things like
the "Wall Street Journal"

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.980
on the "New York Times"
were unfairly portraying

00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.940
these antics of
rich, young, Asians,

00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:09.690
and so one thing I
was wondering was

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:13.370
what's the human side of these
wealthy sides of mainlanders?

00:32:13.370 --> 00:32:15.104
What are their
particular struggles

00:32:15.104 --> 00:32:16.520
that are different
from what we've

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:20.690
seen from other generations
of rich people in general?

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:25.710
KEVIN KWAN: I think that
because for so many of them

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:30.320
these cities and the way of
life has changed so completely

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.130
just in the last
10 years, they're

00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.180
sort of struggling
to find themselves

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.600
in this hyper modern
world, first of all.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:39.639
So I think there's a
lot disorientation.

00:32:39.639 --> 00:32:41.055
There's been a lot
of displacement

00:32:41.055 --> 00:32:44.660
from families being
moved from rural areas,

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:47.600
small towns, small villages,
into the big cities.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.240
And so they're all
having to adapt

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.380
to living together
multi-generationaly

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.460
in these mega cities.

00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:54.120
Number one.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.720
And then number
two, specifically

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.500
for the privileged set
of people, a lot of them

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.417
are being educated in the West.

00:33:02.417 --> 00:33:04.125
In fact, that's kind
of the goal for sort

00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:07.440
of well-to-do Chinese family,
starting from middle class

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:11.520
on up, is you want to send
your kids to Harvard or Yale.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.610
And these kids are getting
Western educations.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.080
And then they're having
to go back and confront

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:18.050
the reality of China.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:21.110
And, you know, the
traditions the cultures

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:24.700
and the expectations of their
parents, of their grandparents.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.350
And there's a huge disconnect
between their new dreams

00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:32.220
and aspirations and what their
country and their society

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:33.442
expects of them.

00:33:33.442 --> 00:33:35.150
AUDIENCE: I'm curious
what you were doing

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:37.800
before you wrote these books.

00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:39.910
And you kind of
touched on the fact

00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:42.370
that the news cycle
inspired you to write this.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.367
But had you always
planned to be a novelist?

00:33:44.367 --> 00:33:45.200
Were you a novelist?

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.730
Do you have other books that
I haven't been made aware of?

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:49.890
Just curious of your journey.

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.340
KEVIN KWAN: Thank you.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.030
I was not a novelist
until three years ago.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.940
My first degree was
in media studies

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.100
actually at the
University of Houston.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.130
And so I always had this
dream after graduating

00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:04.630
with this sort of
communications focused degree

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.930
to then get a design and
visual side of the degree

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:10.100
so I could meld those
two and become sort

00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.050
of like this double threat
in this whole new world

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.460
of the internet and
the World Wide Web

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:16.510
and going into new media.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:19.110
So that was originally
my intention.

00:34:19.110 --> 00:34:20.860
But, you know, life changes.

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.739
And it takes you
along different ways.

00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:26.960
So I went to design school, art
school, after my first degree

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.530
and found myself working for
a very influential design

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:33.550
firm in New York
afterwards-- M &amp; Company.

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:35.219
And from there I
started getting drawn

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:38.499
into being a consultant to a lot
of different media companies.

00:34:38.499 --> 00:34:39.949
So I've worked for Hearst.

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:41.399
I've worked for Conde Nast.

00:34:41.399 --> 00:34:45.120
I've worked for design
firms, architectural firms,

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:51.060
I was part of helping TED.com
relaunch their website in 2008,

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:51.860
I think.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.540
So I had this whole other side
in sort of design consulting.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:57.630
So it wasn't until
2010 that I decided

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:02.220
I wanted to really
write a book like this.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.984
I just kind of went
for it never expecting

00:35:05.984 --> 00:35:06.900
it would lead to this.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:09.520
Just something I was
doing as a hobby.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.400
AUDIENCE: I am wondering
in regards to your movie.

00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.910
Do you plan on sitting
on the dailies?

00:35:15.910 --> 00:35:17.930
Did you ask for
partial cast approval?

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:21.320
How much creative control
did you relinquish?

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.830
KEVIN KWAN: I'm an executive
producer of the movie.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:27.860
So I am as involved
as I want to be.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.050
But I also recognize that
I'm not the expert here.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:33.620
And I've put my trust in this
incredible team led by Nina

00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:35.080
Jacobson at [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:37.130
And she's had an
amazing track record

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:40.170
of making greet books
into great movies.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:42.280
And every author that
she's worked with

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.340
has so far been
really happy with her.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.030
So I'm trying to
really kind of let

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:51.650
that movie team have the
freedom to sort of create this

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:55.405
without being that
control freak author.

00:35:55.405 --> 00:35:57.030
Because at the end
of the day I realize

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.330
a movie is very
different from the book.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:35:59.530
It will never be the book.

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:02.310
First of all, it's going
to be an hour 45 minutes.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:05.330
You can't tell my story
in that length of time.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:09.099
But hopefully it captures
the DNA of the book

00:36:09.099 --> 00:36:10.390
and it's a fun ride for people.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.790
That's my primary concern.

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.030
So will I be sitting on set?

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:16.000
I don't know.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.530
We'll cross that
bridge when we need to.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:22.220
But I'm really focused
on letting this movie

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.210
be what it wants to be.

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.430
AUDIENCE: I was really
curious about all the details

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:27.556
that you had about passion.

00:36:27.556 --> 00:36:29.513
And I have to admit, it's
kind of over my head.

00:36:29.513 --> 00:36:31.440
But how did you do
the research for that?

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.020
And you also mention
talking with people

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:36.490
in keeping their identities,
but at the same time,

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:39.630
are they cool with you giving
a lot of these cool details

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:41.870
about them?

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:43.440
KEVIN KWAN: I
think, first of all,

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.455
in most cases I've
changed the stories

00:36:45.455 --> 00:36:47.100
and scenarios and
the details enough

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:50.040
to where no one's recognizable.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.790
And, number two, there's
nothing malicious

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:52.831
about what I write about.

00:36:52.831 --> 00:36:55.980
So hopefully people
aren't too upset,

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.680
even if they're
somewhat recognizable.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.700
And then to answer
the first question,

00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.290
as a creative and
design consultant,

00:37:02.290 --> 00:37:07.280
it was kind of my business to do
trend forecasting, to be ahead

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.072
of the curve on fashion
trends, design trends,

00:37:10.072 --> 00:37:10.780
things like that.

00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:12.740
So that really
was a natural part

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:16.794
of bringing my experience
into writing that novel.

00:37:16.794 --> 00:37:19.229
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
airlines and everything.

00:37:19.229 --> 00:37:22.660
Were you approached by any
big luxury brands in the movie

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:24.910
or like for the next book
or anything about like, hey,

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:26.290
you should mention
me because I'm

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:27.508
this awesome brand
that represents

00:37:27.508 --> 00:37:28.500
what you're writing about.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.875
KEVIN KWAN: I
haven't and I don't

00:37:29.875 --> 00:37:32.370
think I'd ever do that because
I like having this editorial

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:36.120
independence to really kind of
craft the world I want to craft

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:39.710
and have the characters wear
what I think they should wear

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:42.940
versus having Chanel
endorse everything,

00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:45.570
even though they're in the
book like eight million times

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:48.430
because the women wear Chanel.

00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:50.470
It's an interesting
thought, but it's not

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:53.920
something I don't think I'd
ever want to be part of that.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:55.704
For now, at least.

00:37:55.704 --> 00:37:57.120
Movie might be a
different things.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:59.290
But that's for the movie people.

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:01.445
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:01.445 --> 00:38:03.320
KEVIN KWAN: It's
interesting you say perfect,

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.060
because to me I
think Astrid is such

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.710
an interesting tragic character.

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:08.630
She has the beauty.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:09.690
She has the style.

00:38:09.690 --> 00:38:10.565
She has the breeding.

00:38:10.565 --> 00:38:15.240
She has everything in the
world except happiness.

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.340
And [INAUDIBLE] keeps
getting into trouble

00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:19.120
with his mother
and his grandmother

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:25.735
and all the various
crazies around him.

00:38:25.735 --> 00:38:28.630
HOST: I always thought that
Rachel's portrayal was also

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:29.740
very perfect.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.810
Or every time anyone
described her they're like,

00:38:31.810 --> 00:38:37.270
she's so beautiful and perfect
and funny and smart and nice.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.770
Yeah.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:39.044
That was just my takeaway.

00:38:39.044 --> 00:38:40.460
KEVIN KWAN: So
maybe in book three

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.518
I have to maker her
really trip up much more.

00:38:43.518 --> 00:38:45.354
yeah.

00:38:45.354 --> 00:38:47.020
Well, she had a lot
of blind spots, too.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:47.490
HOST: That's true.

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:47.960
KEVIN KWAN: Wouldn't you say?

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.110
HOST: Yeah.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:51.720
AUDIENCE: So how would
you say the reception has

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.880
been for your second book
compared to your first book?

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:57.790
KEVIN KWAN: It's been
enormously positive.

00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:59.970
I think the reviews
for the second book

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:02.490
actually for the most
part have been even better

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:05.030
than the first book.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.175
And I hear from
different readers

00:39:07.175 --> 00:39:09.300
that say, oh, we loved the
first book so much more.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.120
But I also hear equally
from other readers

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.480
that say, oh, I loved the
second book so much more.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:17.590
So it's been very evenly mixed.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.150
I think a lot of people,
because of the first book

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:23.430
was to them so
different, there's

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:26.050
always a little more
affection for the first book

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:27.160
than for the second.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.640
The second is less novel.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:29.540
I don't know.

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.710
What do you think?

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:33.680
HOST: I find this with
all series of books

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.710
that it's hard to pick
one, because they're

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:38.310
all part of a larger story.

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.270
Like I always use Harry
Potter as an example.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:44.580
I love every single book, but
they build upon one another

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.352
so you can't really take one out
of the equation as much for me.

00:39:48.352 --> 00:39:49.060
KEVIN KWAN: Yeah.

00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:50.290
And I'm really hoping
with the third book

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:52.550
to add yet another level
of dimensionality that sort

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:55.944
of contextualizes
book one and book two.

00:39:55.944 --> 00:39:57.360
And people will
finally understand

00:39:57.360 --> 00:40:02.267
why I did what I did
instead of just being angry.

00:40:02.267 --> 00:40:03.600
There are not many angry people.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.780
But there are a few
that would nitpick.

00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:09.140
It's like, well, there's
a method to the madness.

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:10.580
You'll see.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.080
HOST: Yeah.

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:11.580
Exactly.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:12.280
In the end.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.738
KEVIN KWAN: Believe
it or not, I've

00:40:13.738 --> 00:40:16.430
met a lot of readers who
started with the second book

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:17.950
and have just
enjoyed it equally.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:21.720
I can't imagine
how, having read it.

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:24.270
Because it really starts--
it's like a cliffhanger,

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:27.150
and then book two begins.

00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:29.120
So that's how I would
recommend reading it.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.620
It'll be a much more rich
experience in that way.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:33.120
HOST: Yeah.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.090
Because then you know
the characters better.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.220
As soon as you
said Edison Cheng I

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.850
was like ha-ha, because I
know him from the first book

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.300
and you just know
how ridiculous he is.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.800
KEVIN KWAN: And so
many people would

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.090
tweet me or they would just
say, oh my god, the minute

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.610
he came on page one and
said the famous words

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:55.040
he says, which I
censored for YouTube,

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.050
people would start laughing
the minute he utters

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.472
his trademark swear word.

00:41:01.472 --> 00:41:02.180
HOST: Definitely.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.888
And the same thing
with Katy [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:03.888 --> 00:41:08.610
It's like as soon as she enters,
it's like, yes, she's back.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.360
AUDIENCE: So I absolutely
love the series.

00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:13.090
And I was wondering
when I will no longer

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:15.350
have to wait for the third
book and for the movie?

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:17.674
Do you have any sense of
when those will come out?

00:41:17.674 --> 00:41:19.340
KEVIN KWAN: I mean,
don't hold me to it.

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:21.480
But I'm really hoping for 2017.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.940
Because I have to write
the third book now.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.680
And I'm still on tour.

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.140
So I'm really hoping after this,
this is really the end of tour,

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:36.670
to really buckle down, write
book three, and get it out.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:40.100
I really want this to be over
with too as soon as possible.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.600
HOST: Do you have people
suggesting like crazy things?

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.389
Like in book three
you should do this?

00:41:44.389 --> 00:41:45.430
KEVIN KWAN: All the time.

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.971
All the time.

00:41:45.971 --> 00:41:46.740
You have no idea.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.280
On social media people
send me stories.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.940
People try to cast
themselves in the next book.

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:56.340
I had this Indonesian tycoon
send me videos of his daughters

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.810
Sweet 16 birthday party.

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:02.200
They spent like $10
million on her Sweet 16.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.885
It was out of control.

00:42:06.930 --> 00:42:11.810
And he's like, you should
feature this in the next book.

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.790
Legally I can't feature
that anyone has sent to me.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:15.820
HOST: Yeah.

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.320
OK.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.970
What was one idea where you
heard it and you're like,

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:22.389
this is never going
to be in the book.

00:42:22.389 --> 00:42:24.430
KEVIN KWAN: You're really
putting me on the spot.

00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:26.780
I really can't think
of anything off hand.

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:30.770
There have been so many crazy
suggestions of what to do,

00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:31.500
what not to do.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.030
But I just try to
filter that out

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:36.670
and be true to the story
I always wanted to write.

00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:38.294
AUDIENCE: Was there
an idea of that you

00:42:38.294 --> 00:42:39.585
wish you could put in the book?

00:42:40.888 --> 00:42:42.638
Something that somebody
said and you'd go,

00:42:42.638 --> 00:42:44.295
wow, this is absolutely crazy.

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:48.040
KEVIN KWAN: It's interesting
because in book two

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.840
there's a racing sequence.

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:51.840
I don't know if you've
read the books yet.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.650
Yeah.

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:55.530
It's now become a hobby
of the crazy rich Chinese

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:57.807
to have these drag races.

00:42:57.807 --> 00:42:59.640
They don't do it in
China because they don't

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.765
want to be caught in China.

00:43:00.765 --> 00:43:02.280
So they do it around the world.

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:04.220
They meet up in
California or Sydney.

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:07.410
They bring in their exotic cars
and they do these drag races.

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:10.090
And so I really structured
a whole couple of chapters

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.830
around these pivotal scenes.

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:16.272
And my editor was like, no way.

00:43:16.272 --> 00:43:17.980
She's like, no one's
going to believe it.

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:19.410
I'm like, but it's
really happening.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:20.370
I can show you the headlines.

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:21.536
I can show you the pictures.

00:43:21.536 --> 00:43:23.762
But he's like,
there are things you

00:43:23.762 --> 00:43:26.220
don't want to lose the reader
in the momentum of the story.

00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.905
So I had to take out
most of that scene, which

00:43:29.905 --> 00:43:31.780
maybe will find its way
in to the movie, too.

00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:32.920
I don't know.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:36.320
So there are certain
scenes I wish I could keep.

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.860
But for the sake
of believability

00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.060
was told that it
was better to cut.

00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.200
Thank you so much.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.704
It's really a
pleasure to be here.

00:43:43.704 --> 00:43:44.620
HOST: Thank you, guys.

00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:47.670
[APPLAUSE]
