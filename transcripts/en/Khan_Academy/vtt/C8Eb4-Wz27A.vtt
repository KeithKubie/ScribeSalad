00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.780
- What we're going to do in this video

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.980
is think about Monetary Policy,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.900
which is policy that
a Central Bank can use

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.020
to affect the economy in some way.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.860
This is often contrasted
with Fiscal Policy,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.470
and that would be a government

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.440
deciding to tax or spend in some way

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.870
in order to make
adjustments to an economy.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.530
But to help us think
through Monetary Policy

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.720
let's bring up our model
for the money market.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.450
And just as a little bit of a review,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.903
here on the horizontal axis
I have the quantity of money,

00:00:32.903 --> 00:00:36.120
or else we could imagine that say the M1,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.750
which is cash in circulation
and checkable deposits,

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.870
and then here in the vertical axis

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.030
we have our nominal interest rate.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.040
In this model we have assumed

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.040
a perfectly inelastic money supply;

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.340
that's why we have this vertical line,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.980
which isn't exactly how the world works

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.620
but we'll go with that for
the sake of this video.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.620
And then we have the
demand curve for money.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.860
At high nominal interest rates,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.240
the opportunity cost of
keeping cash is very high

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.180
so people would not want
to keep much of it around.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.370
And then when nominal
interest rates are low

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.380
the opportunity cost, or
at least the perceived

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.490
opportunity cost of
holding cash is a lot lower

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.030
so people might wanna hold more of it

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.910
and so you have a higher demand for money.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.700
And this point where the supply
and the demand intersect...

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.710
We have seen this before,
this point of equilibrium,

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.640
we see that that would result

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.000
in our equilibrium nominal interest rate.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.560
But let's say this is
the world that we are in,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.100
and we are in a recessionary
or a negative output gap.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.150
And you are the Central
Bank of this country.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.220
What could you do?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.337
Well in general, you would say

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:48.777
"Well it would be nice if nominal
interest rates were lower,

00:01:48.777 --> 00:01:51.577
"then maybe people would
be willing to borrow more,

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:53.537
"there'd be more of a demand for money,

00:01:53.537 --> 00:01:56.397
"and they would use that money
in order to make investments,

00:01:56.397 --> 00:01:57.757
"or in order to consume more

00:01:57.757 --> 00:02:00.840
"and we could close
"that recessionary gap".

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.870
But how would you lower interest rates?

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.690
Well one way would be to
increase the money supply.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.690
If we could shift this vertical
line to the right somehow.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.150
But how would you do that?

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.210
We often talk about Central
Banks printing money

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.730
but how did they get that money
actually into circulation?

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.120
How did they actually
increase the money supply?

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.090
Well there's a couple of
tools at their disposal.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.820
One is the idea of Open Market Operations.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.280
Open Market Operations,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.690
and this is the tool that
Central Banks most typically use.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.537
Let's say that this is a
bond that I currently own,

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.947
and a bond is a loan to some
entity and this paper says

00:02:42.947 --> 00:02:44.837
"Hey that entity is going to pay you back

00:02:44.837 --> 00:02:47.120
"with interest at some
point in the future".

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.600
And let's say this is a government bond.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.460
Let's say it's to the U.S. Government.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.570
What the Federal Reserve
might do in the United States,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.960
the Central bank, and this is
how most Central Banks work,

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.793
the Federal Reserve says

00:02:57.793 --> 00:03:00.490
"Hey, I want to increase
the money supply".

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.507
And so they say "Hey I'm gonna go into

00:03:02.507 --> 00:03:05.520
"the open market and buy a bond."

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.110
So, I might not know
who's buying that bond

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.110
but it happens to be the Federal Reserve.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:11.970
And so instead of selling
it to someone else

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.270
who would give me cash that's
already in circulation,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.400
the Federal Reserve

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.780
would be introducing new
cash into circulation.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.500
This might be money
that they just printed.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.840
and I'll say printed in quotes,

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.280
because there's not a lot of physical cash

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.020
or at least as much as there use to be.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.910
These could just be digital numbers

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.170
in banking account at certain places.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.430
But it has the same functional idea,

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.120
that this is part of the monetary base.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.010
And then we've talked about this before.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.100
You have a money multiplier.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.760
I would put this into a bank,

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.890
the bank would loan out a proportion

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.360
of that based on the Reserve requirements,

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.300
and then whoever gets that
would deposit it in a bank

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.590
and that bank could loan
out a certain proportion.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.920
Let's say that the Central Bank

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.963
bought this from me for $1000,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.850
and let's say that our current

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.170
reserve requirement is equal to 12.5%.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.710
Well the effect on the
money supply over here

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.070
won't just be $1,000.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.670
Instead we would move $1,000
times the money multiplier.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.050
And so this would be equal to,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.280
so we would have $1,000,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.340
and what's the multiplier going to be?

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.453
Well it's going to be
one over 12.5%, 0.125.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.930
One over 0.125, this
right over here is eight.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.970
So the money multiplier here is eight.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.510
So the effect of buying that $1,000 bond

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.470
with new printed currency so to speak,

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.120
printed cash so to speak,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:48.120
would actually be to increase
the money supply by $8,000.

00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:52.630
$8,000 increase in money supply.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.490
And obviously $8,000 is not
going to make a big deal

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.260
to an economy like the United States.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.650
But imagine if this was $100 billion.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.800
Well then this would be $800
billion right over here.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.210
And what would happen to this curve?

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.210
Well it would move over,
let's say it moves over here.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:16.270
And so this is money supply
curve two, and then this is M2,

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.870
and now what is our
equilibrium interest rate?

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.510
Well our equilibrium interest rate,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.410
our nominal interest rate
has now gone down; R2.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.300
And this would hopefully have the effect

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.880
that the Central Bank wants.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.180
That hey, now that nominal
interest rates have gone down

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.500
people might borrow more
for more consumption,

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.240
for more investment, and close
that negative output gap.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.840
And it can work the other way as well.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.450
Imagine if in this
situation right over here,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.870
we were in an inflationary output gap.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.230
A positive output gap.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.350
The economy was overheating in some way,

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.020
and the Central Bank
wanted to cool things down.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.427
Well the way they could
do is they could say

00:05:53.427 --> 00:05:55.217
"Well if interest rates
were a little bit higher

00:05:55.217 --> 00:05:56.417
"that might slow things down,

00:05:56.417 --> 00:05:58.560
"there might be less
consumption, less investment".

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.110
How would they do that?

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.920
Well, instead of what they did here

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.020
where they bought bonds to inject cash,

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.810
they could do the opposite.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.630
They could take bonds
that the Central Bank has

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.340
and they could sell those bonds

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.180
and then that would take
cash out of the system.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.390
By taking that cash out of the system

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:18.170
it would take reserves out of the system,

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.790
and it would have the opposite effect,

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.510
and it would shift the
money supply to the left.

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:26.560
And then you would have the
effect of raising rates.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.890
Now another way of
shifting the money supply

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.340
to the right or the left here,
increasing or decreasing it,

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.630
is by changing the actual
reserve requirement.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.890
This is done less frequently
than the Open Market Operations

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.200
but we'll see that that
could have the same effect.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.400
If the Central Bank which can
set the reserve requirement

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.030
were to change it from 12.5%,

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.673
and were to instead make it let's say 10%,

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.862
well then the money multiplier,

00:06:53.862 --> 00:06:56.730
money multiplier...

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.960
and we've the math in other videos,

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.460
it would go from one over 12.5%,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.630
it would go from eight
to one over 10%, to 10.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.120
So the existing reserves,

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.180
instead of having an eight
times multiplier on 'em,

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.990
you would have a 10
times multiplier on 'em.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.230
And once again, that would have the effect

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.220
of increasing the money supply.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.840
Now another tool that's
sometimes associated

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.000
with Monetary Policy is
setting the discount rate.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.580
Now the discount window
at the Federal Reserve

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.580
in the United States
isn't used in situations

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.560
to affect Monetary Policy so much,

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.870
as really being a mechanism of safety

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.360
for our financial system.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.850
So if a bank is running out of reserves,

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:45.190
and so they can still hold up
their commitments to folks,

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.840
they can go to the discount
window of the Federal Reserve

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.480
and borrow money directly from the Fed.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.350
And the Federal Reserve
can set this discount rate,

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.830
but it really becomes
operational during emergencies.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.770
When you hear about the Federal
Reserve setting the rate,

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.330
they're really talking about
the Federal Funds rate.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.440
Federal Funds.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.320
And this is the rate at
which banks lend reserves

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.350
to each other over night.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.910
And the banks are going to
be lending to each other

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:14.743
at slightly different rates,

00:08:14.743 --> 00:08:17.470
but what the Federal Reserve,
the Central Bank will do

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.250
is they'll set a target
Federal Funds rate.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:21.110
So what they will do is

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:22.960
they will target a Federal Funds rate,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.480
and typically use Open Market Operations

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.290
to make that target a reality.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.390
Now the last thing I
want you to appreciate

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.370
in this discussion of Monetary Policy,

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.610
the things that the Federal Reserve can do

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.040
to increase or decrease the money supply,

00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.470
to decrease or increase
nominal interest rates

00:08:41.470 --> 00:08:45.610
is to think about how quickly
these things might happen

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:47.760
and how quickly their effects might be.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.040
There's oftentimes a lag here.

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.760
It might take a little time for
the Central Bank to realize,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.050
hey it looks like we're in
an inflationary situation.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.240
Maybe we got to decrease the
money supply a little bit.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.360
Maybe we gotta take a little bit

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.180
of reserves out of the system.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.270
Or the other way around,

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:03.560
to realize that they're in a recession.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.090
So there's usually a lag there.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:07.050
And then even once they act,

00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:08.970
they enact this Monetary Policy,

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:12.780
it takes time for it to
fully impact the system.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:15.540
It takes time for the interest
rates to truly come down.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.930
And even more, once the
interest rates are down

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.423
it might take time for people to realize

00:09:19.423 --> 00:09:21.390
that hey, maybe I wanna borrow now,

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.110
and what would I use that money for?

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:26.333
And for that that to
actually impact the economy.
