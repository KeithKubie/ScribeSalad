00:00:00.085 --> 00:00:01.148
- [Instructor] What we have here

00:00:01.148 --> 00:00:03.692
is six different scatter plots that show

00:00:03.692 --> 00:00:06.310
the relationship between
different variables.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.817
So, for example, in this one here,

00:00:07.817 --> 00:00:09.623
in the horizontal axis, we might have

00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:11.977
something like age, and then here

00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:13.948
it could be accident frequency.

00:00:13.948 --> 00:00:15.531
Accident frequency.

00:00:16.554 --> 00:00:19.038
And I'm just making this up.

00:00:19.038 --> 00:00:20.698
And I could just show these data points,

00:00:20.698 --> 00:00:23.037
maybe for some kind of statistical survey,

00:00:23.037 --> 00:00:25.761
that, when the age is this,
whatever number this is,

00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:29.145
maybe this is 20 years old,
this is the accident frequency.

00:00:29.145 --> 00:00:31.572
And it could be a number
of accidents per hundred.

00:00:31.572 --> 00:00:33.660
And that, when the age is 21 years old,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.775
this is the frequency.

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:37.818
And so, these data
scientists, or statisticians,

00:00:37.818 --> 00:00:41.512
went and plotted all of
these in this scatter plot.

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:43.847
This is often known as bivariate data,

00:00:43.847 --> 00:00:45.694
which is a very fancy way of saying,

00:00:45.694 --> 00:00:48.226
hey, you're plotting things that take

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:50.011
two variables into consideration,

00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:51.150
and you're trying to see whether

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.367
there's a pattern with how they relate.

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:56.654
And what we're going to do in this video

00:00:56.654 --> 00:01:00.713
is think about, well,
can we try to fit a line,

00:01:00.713 --> 00:01:02.423
does it look like there's a linear

00:01:02.423 --> 00:01:04.933
or non-linear relationship between

00:01:04.933 --> 00:01:07.243
the variables on the different axes?

00:01:07.243 --> 00:01:09.053
How strong is that variable?

00:01:09.053 --> 00:01:11.531
Is it a positive, is it
a negative relationship?

00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:14.659
And then, we'll think about
this idea of outliers.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:15.896
So let's just first think about

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:18.369
whether there's a linear
or non-linear relationship.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.268
And I'll get my little
ruler tool out here.

00:01:21.268 --> 00:01:22.675
So, this data right over here,

00:01:22.675 --> 00:01:26.053
it looks like I could get a,
I could put a line through it

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:28.302
that gets pretty close through the data.

00:01:28.302 --> 00:01:29.702
You're not gonna, it's very unlikely

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:31.857
you're gonna be able to go
through all of the data points,

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:34.520
but you can try to get a
line, and I'm just doing this.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.324
There's more numerical, more
precise ways of doing this,

00:01:37.324 --> 00:01:39.488
but I'm just eyeballing
it right over here.

00:01:39.488 --> 00:01:41.485
And it looks like I could plot a line

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:43.565
that looks something like that,

00:01:43.565 --> 00:01:45.415
that goes roughly through the data.

00:01:45.415 --> 00:01:47.737
So this looks pretty linear.

00:01:47.737 --> 00:01:51.243
And so I would call this
a linear relationship.

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:53.774
And since, as we increase one variable,

00:01:53.774 --> 00:01:55.519
it looks like the other
variable decreases.

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:57.823
This is a downward-sloping line.

00:01:57.823 --> 00:02:00.380
I would say this is a negative.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.237
This is a negative linear relationship.

00:02:04.237 --> 00:02:06.304
But this one looks pretty strong.

00:02:06.304 --> 00:02:10.747
So, because the dots aren't
that far from my line.

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:12.098
This one gets a little bit further,

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:14.833
but it's not, there's not
some dots way out there.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.896
And so, most of 'em are
pretty close to the line.

00:02:16.896 --> 00:02:18.848
So I would call this a negative,

00:02:18.848 --> 00:02:21.800
reasonably strong linear relationship.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.536
Negative, strong, I'll call it reasonably,

00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:28.507
I'll just say strong,
but reasonably strong,

00:02:28.507 --> 00:02:32.674
linear, linear relationship
between these two variables.

00:02:34.255 --> 00:02:35.088
Now, let's look at this one.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:36.298
And pause this video and think about

00:02:36.298 --> 00:02:39.495
what this one would be for you.

00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:40.333
Well, let's see.

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:42.958
I'll get my ruler tool out again.

00:02:42.958 --> 00:02:44.887
And it looks like I can try to put a line,

00:02:44.887 --> 00:02:46.761
it looks like, generally speaking,

00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:49.447
as one variable increases,
the other variable

00:02:49.447 --> 00:02:52.142
increases as well, so something like this

00:02:52.142 --> 00:02:56.774
goes through the data and
approximates the direction.

00:02:56.774 --> 00:02:57.791
And this looks positive.

00:02:57.791 --> 00:02:59.889
As one variable increases, the other

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:02.238
variable increases, roughly.

00:03:02.238 --> 00:03:05.055
So this is a positive relationship.

00:03:05.055 --> 00:03:06.213
But this is weak.

00:03:06.213 --> 00:03:10.708
A lot of the data is off,
well off of the line.

00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:12.291
So, positive, weak.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.572
But I'd say this is still linear.

00:03:15.572 --> 00:03:18.210
It seems that, as we increase one,

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.300
the other one increases
at roughly the same rate,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.418
although these data points
are all over the place.

00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:25.715
So, I would still call this linear.

00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:27.611
Now, there's also this notion of outliers.

00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:29.355
If I said, hey, this line is trying

00:03:29.355 --> 00:03:32.758
to describe the data,
well, we have some data

00:03:32.758 --> 00:03:35.479
that is fairly off the line.

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.552
So, for example, even though we're saying

00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:40.315
it's a positive, weak,
linear relationship,

00:03:40.315 --> 00:03:42.656
this one over here is reasonably high

00:03:42.656 --> 00:03:44.765
on the vertical variable, but it's low

00:03:44.765 --> 00:03:47.544
on the horizontal variable.

00:03:47.544 --> 00:03:49.387
And so, this one right
over here is an outlier.

00:03:49.387 --> 00:03:50.893
It's quite far away from the line.

00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:52.614
You could view that as an outlier.

00:03:52.614 --> 00:03:54.307
And this is a little bit subjective.

00:03:54.307 --> 00:03:55.852
Outliers, well, what looks pretty

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:57.942
far from the rest of the data?

00:03:57.942 --> 00:04:00.618
This could also be an outlier.

00:04:00.618 --> 00:04:02.272
Let me label these.

00:04:02.272 --> 00:04:03.105
Outlier.

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:05.973
Now, pause the video and see if

00:04:05.973 --> 00:04:06.806
you can think about this one.

00:04:06.806 --> 00:04:08.712
Is this positive or
negative, is it linear,

00:04:08.712 --> 00:04:11.495
non-linear, is it strong or weak?

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:13.509
I'll get my ruler tool out here.

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:15.632
So, this goes here.

00:04:15.632 --> 00:04:19.677
It seems like I can fit a
line pretty well to this.

00:04:19.677 --> 00:04:23.911
So, I could fit, maybe
I'll do the line in purple.

00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:26.495
I could fit a line that looks like that.

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:28.410
And so, this one looks like it's positive.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.605
As one variable increases,
the other one does,

00:04:30.605 --> 00:04:32.148
for these data points.

00:04:32.148 --> 00:04:33.774
So it's a positive.

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:35.383
I'd say this was pretty strong.

00:04:35.383 --> 00:04:37.666
The dots are pretty
close to the line there.

00:04:37.666 --> 00:04:38.833
It really does look like a little bit

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:40.968
of a fat line, if you
just look at the dots.

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:42.718
So, positive, strong,

00:04:44.481 --> 00:04:46.814
linear, linear relationship.

00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:52.092
And none of these data points
are really strong outliers.

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:53.617
This one's a little bit further out.

00:04:53.617 --> 00:04:55.303
But they're all pretty close to the line,

00:04:55.303 --> 00:04:58.927
and seem to describe that trend roughly.

00:04:58.927 --> 00:05:02.680
All right, now, let's look
at this data right over here.

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.317
So, let me get my line tool out again.

00:05:06.317 --> 00:05:09.578
So, it looks like I can fit a line.

00:05:09.578 --> 00:05:11.800
So it looks, and it looks like
it's a positive relationship.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.296
The line would be upward sloping.

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:15.123
It would look something like this.

00:05:15.123 --> 00:05:17.564
And, once again, I'm eyeballing it.

00:05:17.564 --> 00:05:19.307
You can use computers and other methods

00:05:19.307 --> 00:05:21.669
to actually find a more precise line

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:23.491
that minimizes the collective distance

00:05:23.491 --> 00:05:26.487
to all of the points, but it looks like

00:05:26.487 --> 00:05:29.713
there is a positive, but I would say,

00:05:29.713 --> 00:05:32.040
this one is a weak linear relationship,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.703
'cause we have a lot of points
that are far off the line.

00:05:34.703 --> 00:05:36.446
So, not so strong.

00:05:36.446 --> 00:05:38.904
So, I would call this a positive,

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:41.821
weak, linear relationship.

00:05:41.821 --> 00:05:43.781
And there's a lot of outliers here.

00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:48.328
This one over here is
pretty far, pretty far out.

00:05:48.328 --> 00:05:49.957
Now, let's look at this one.

00:05:49.957 --> 00:05:50.955
Pause this video and think about,

00:05:50.955 --> 00:05:52.839
is it positive or negative,
is strong or weak?

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.842
Is this linear or non-linear?

00:05:54.842 --> 00:05:55.821
Well, the first thing we wanna do

00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:57.390
is let's think about it
with linear or non-linear.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.281
I could try to put a line on it.

00:06:00.281 --> 00:06:02.024
But if I try to put a line on it,

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:03.845
it's actually quite difficult.

00:06:03.845 --> 00:06:05.381
If I try to do a line like this,

00:06:05.381 --> 00:06:06.214
you'll notice everything is kind

00:06:06.214 --> 00:06:08.554
of bending away from the line.

00:06:08.554 --> 00:06:11.163
It looks like, generally,
as one variable increases,

00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:12.686
the other variable decreases, but they're

00:06:12.686 --> 00:06:15.065
not doing it in a linear fashion.

00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:18.071
It looks like there's some
other type of curve at play.

00:06:18.071 --> 00:06:20.267
So, I could try to do a fancier curve

00:06:20.267 --> 00:06:21.634
that looks something like this,

00:06:21.634 --> 00:06:24.683
and this seems to fit
the data a lot better.

00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:28.820
So this one, I would
describe as non-linear.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.607
And it is a negative relationship.

00:06:30.607 --> 00:06:33.968
As one variable increases,
the other variable decreases.

00:06:33.968 --> 00:06:37.272
So, this is a negative, I would say,

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:40.204
reasonably strong non-linear relationship.

00:06:40.204 --> 00:06:42.104
Pretty strong.

00:06:42.104 --> 00:06:43.057
Pretty strong.

00:06:43.057 --> 00:06:44.838
And once again, this is subjective.

00:06:44.838 --> 00:06:48.110
So, I'll say negative, reasonably strong,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.936
non-linear relationship.

00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:53.694
And maybe you could call
this one an outlier,

00:06:53.694 --> 00:06:55.772
but it's not that far,
and I might even be able

00:06:55.772 --> 00:06:57.718
to fit a curve that gets a
little bit closer to that.

00:06:57.718 --> 00:06:59.675
And once again, I'm eyeballing this.

00:06:59.675 --> 00:07:01.737
Now let's do this last one.

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:06.385
And so, this one looks like a
negative linear relationship

00:07:06.385 --> 00:07:10.564
to me, a fairly strong
negative linear relationship,

00:07:10.564 --> 00:07:12.675
although there are some outliers.

00:07:12.675 --> 00:07:15.479
So, let me draw this line.

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:18.230
So that seems to fit the data pretty good.

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.647
So this is a negative, reasonably strong,

00:07:22.529 --> 00:07:26.172
reasonably strong linear relationship.

00:07:26.172 --> 00:07:28.677
But these are very clear outliers.

00:07:28.677 --> 00:07:31.369
These are well away from the data,

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:34.133
or from the cluster of where
most of the points are.

00:07:34.133 --> 00:07:35.941
So, with some significant, with at least

00:07:35.941 --> 00:07:38.886
these two significant outliers here.

00:07:38.886 --> 00:07:40.538
So hopefully this makes
you a little bit familiar

00:07:40.538 --> 00:07:42.349
with some of this terminology, and it's

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:44.999
important to keep in mind, this
is a little bit subjective.

00:07:44.999 --> 00:07:48.786
There'll be some cases that
are more obvious than others.

00:07:48.786 --> 00:07:50.661
And oftentimes, you
wanna make a comparison,

00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:52.250
that this is a stronger linear,

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:54.456
positive linear relationship
than this one is,

00:07:54.456 --> 00:07:55.539
right over here, 'cause you can see,

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:58.483
most of the data is closer to the line.

00:07:58.483 --> 00:08:03.050
This one is, for sure, this is
more non-linear than linear.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:05.733
It depends how you wanna describe,

00:08:05.733 --> 00:08:07.697
oftentimes, making a comparison,

00:08:07.697 --> 00:08:11.864
or making a subjective call
on how to describe the data.
