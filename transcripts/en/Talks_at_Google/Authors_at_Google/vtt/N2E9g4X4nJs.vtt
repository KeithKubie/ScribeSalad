00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:12.470
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Thanks, I'm happy that so many
of you are interested in talking grammar and

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.470
punctuation.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.929
I'm going to tell you briefly, or as an overview,
what my book addresses. And it doesn't address

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.980
grammar from the ground up. It's not everything
anybody ever learned about grammar or needs

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.980
to know.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.540
It covers just the mistakes that people usually
make or the problems that they usually encounter

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.050
in the sentences that they write. And it really
doesn't matter what you're writing whether

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.030
you're writing for business or you're writing
an email to a friend or you're writing something,

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.370
an academic paper. I mean sentences are sentences.
Fiction doesn't count; poetry doesn't count;

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.129
you can do what you want, you're home free.
But when you're writing about situations that

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.280
have occurred or are occurring or will occur,
then grammar and punctuation do count.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:58.459
So I'll tell you how my book progresses.

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:01.510
It has seven chapters. Now let me start at
the end.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.840
The seventh chapter is on punctuation and
it describes every mark that you'll need when

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.140
you write in business correspondence or for
your school papers or whatever emails to friends.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.710
It tells you what the marks do and what they
won't do.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.000
It tells you the common mistakes that people
make; the confusion that people have sometimes

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.659
between a semicolon and a colon, for example,
or between a dash and a hyphen.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.890
That's, that's a very common confusion that
I run into; people typing a hyphen and thinking

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:46.210
that it's a dash. You know what I'm talking
about? A hyphen is the smallest horizontal

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.759
line that you can find on your keyboard and
in order to create a dash, which is a very

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.340
different mark you need to hit that hyphen
key twice typically. Sometimes it closes up

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.890
on the screen, sometimes it doesn't. But that,
that's a dash and it does something very different

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.890
from what hyphens do.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.391
So people do run into confusion when it comes
to punctuation. As a matter of fact, I would

00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:05.590
say most people couldn't tell you how to use
a comma. Certainly in some sentences we know

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.240
where commas belong, but questions arise.
People typically ask, "Well do you need the

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.770
comma before 'and' when you have three or
more items in a series?" In the writing that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.220
you're reading, the professional writing that
has been professionally written and edited,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.459
sometimes you'll see that comma and sometimes
you won't. I don't know whether you pay attention

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.780
to that kind of thing, of course I do.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.160
But that can be confusing. You know, how come
Time Magazine is not putting it in and the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.800
New Yorker is putting it in? If you take a
look at sentences that contain items in a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.800
series.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.040
The rule is, just to answer that question
right now, that you do put it in. That it

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.750
gives equal attention to all the items in
a series without making the last two look

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.580
more related than any others. That's the tradition,
that's the original rule. Many publications

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.580
follow it and yet some authors and editors
and publications are choosing not to follow

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.950
it. So that's why you see it both ways. I
follow the rule. I, I think it makes sense;

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.599
not just because I like rules, although I
do; but because it makes sense in that it

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:12.220
gives every item equal attention and there's
no lack of clarity communicating that the

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.720
last two items are somehow more related than
the first two, or the first three, anyhow.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.520
So the last chapter does cover all the typical
questions and issues that arise with the different

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:24.520
punctuation marks.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.719
But the rest of the book; the first six chapters
are about grammar and usage.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:36.400
You know there are certain ways in which we
use words that are not strictly a grammar

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.950
matter, but a usage matter. Let me be more
specific. Sometimes with prepositions, you

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.370
know those little words like "of," "to," "from,"
"around," "about," "above," "beyond," "below,"

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.750
"past," "by," "under," "over," those little
words?

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:54.340
We have a lot of idioms. For example we can
be confused "by" something, we can be confused

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.079
"over" something, I believe, I'm probably
acceptable, but we can't be confused "to"

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.720
something. Now that's not grammar. I mean
the grammar's the same with those three examples.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.239
But the usage is not. I mean it's just that
we're never confused "to" are we? We're confused

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:12.080
"by," we're concerned "over," sometimes we
can be confused, oh "in relation to" and we

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.109
can have all kinds of connecting words that
follow "confused," but "to" isn't one of them.

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.800
So my book does cover a couple of usage issues
too.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.440
The first chapter covers case. I'm sorry to
use this grammar term and I'll tell you what

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:33.590
it is. I did use regular grammar terms because
if I had to replace them I would have to use

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.171
words like "hot dog" and "hamburger" and then
you'd have to remember throughout the book

00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:40.420
that a, a "hot dog" is an adjective and a
"hamburger" is an adverb and it seemed to

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.310
me just the same trouble, so I used the regular
words.

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:51.600
Case refers to forms of pronouns. You know,
is it "I" is it "me" is it "myself?" Right?

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.160
"Steven invited Susan and I to dinner." No.
"Steven invited Susan and me to dinner. " Yes.

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.010
Susan, "Steven invited Susan and myself to
dinner," which is a very common error these

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.910
days using myself when it should be "I" or
when it should be "me." That's not correct

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.600
either. When do we use "myself?" Well that's
the kind of thing that Chapter One does cover.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.850
Chapter Two is called, "Agreement" and it
has to do with subjects and verbs. You remember

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:22.460
those? And agreement refers to number. So
if the subject is plural the verb has to be

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.720
in a plural form. If the subject is singular,
etc. Sounds pretty simple and basic; you learned

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.300
it a long time ago; you get it right most
of the time.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.400
But there are situations that confuse us or
situations that we don't handle correctly.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.240
We aren't even confused; we just don't know
what's goin' on.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:47.390
There are some nouns that are singular and
plural in Latin ways that not everybody's

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.670
familiar with; for example, "media." You know
very few people are handling that right these

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:59.500
days. "Media" is plural. "The media are represented
here today." And the singular is "medium."

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:06.800
Of course nobody talks about a newspaper correspondent
as coming from a "medium," but that is the

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.800
singular.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:13.000
Another common confusion is over "criteria"
and "criterion." The "o-n" word again is singular

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.600
and "criteria" is plural. And yet you hear
people saying, "There's one criteria that

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.330
we must follow here." Right? And I always
think, "Oh my goodness sake."

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:26.420
So there are words like that. "Data" is another
one. "Data" is actually plural and so it should

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:33.580
be the "data are" not the "data is." And that
chapter on agreement covers that kind of issue.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.570
What's really plural, what's really singular.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.440
There are many words in our language that
never take an "s," and yet they can represent

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.460
groups, right? Many elements like "information"
and "jewelry" and "advice" and "furniture."

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.100
And if English is your native tongue you know
that automatically. Nobody had to teach you

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:56.020
that, you've never heard those words with
an "s" on the end. So it's easy to select

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.200
the right verb.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.800
But if it's not your native tongue, imagine
it's difficult to come to a language where

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:06.110
usually you can put an "s" on the end of the
word and make it plural. And yet there are

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:11.430
all these exceptions. So if it's not your
native tongue and you're rather new to English,

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:17.940
"advices" probably sounds fine to you. "Informations"
probably not. "Jewelrys," "furnitures," probably.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.200
So the book does address issues like that
too that crop up for non-native speakers,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.490
but primarily it's for native speakers; it's
for educated native speakers; it's for people

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:32.690
who know their language as you do and have
to write.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:38.860
When we speak we of course make mistakes.
Speaking is a much more rapid activity. We

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:45.770
just don't have the time to think about the
proper grammar and usage beforehand. And when

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.960
we speak we have a lot more going for us then
when we write. We have facial expressions,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.030
we've got this hand that waves around and
the other one that holds the microphone. We've,

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:59.250
we've got going for us that we are speaking
at our own pace and the reader, or excuse

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.900
me, the listener is trying to follow us and
so that person doesn't have a lot of time

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.430
to think about our grammar or our word choice
[laughs] because they're busy keeping up just

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.970
trying to get the message.

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:15.690
And yet when we write we have a lot more time
to create what the message is. And the reader

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.770
has a lot more time to get it. The reader's
going at his or her pace.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:24.670
Ah, there's something else that crops up in
the agreement chapter. Pronouns have to agree

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.780
with an earlier noun. I just said, "The reader
is going at his or her pace," and that gets

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:34.950
kind of cumbersome, huh? And yet you can't
just pretend the whole world is male anymore.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:39.659
Well, it probably was never so that you could
pretend it in your life time, but in my life

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:45.279
time, in the beginning, in writing the masculine
pronoun was perfectly acceptable and that's

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:50.129
all you ever saw. But there are ways around
that, and the second chapter does address

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:51.439
them.

00:08:51.439 --> 00:08:56.060
Anytime you get into that "he," "she," "him,"
"her," "his," "her" bind you have to realize

00:08:56.060 --> 00:09:01.050
it's because you're the one who chose to say
"reader" earlier in that sentence, or "visitor"

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:06.399
or "listener" or "user." Right? If you go
back and make that word plural "readers,"

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:10.290
"visitors," "listeners," "users" then you
can follow it up with "they" and "them" and

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.529
"their" and you're out of the "he/she" bind.

00:09:13.529 --> 00:09:15.009
[pause]

00:09:15.009 --> 00:09:18.879
The third chapter's on verb tense and native
speakers of English don't have that many problems

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:22.769
with tense. It's just automatic, we use present
when we need it, past when we need it, future

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:26.560
when we need it. We know how to form them.
We've been hearing them our whole lives. But

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:33.199
we do have some problems with verb tense and
those are represented here.

00:09:33.199 --> 00:09:38.740
For example, if you read an article yesterday
you'd be inclined to write or say about it

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:44.329
that the article "reported" something, right?
And yet that article is still reporting something.

00:09:44.329 --> 00:09:49.750
It's that you read it yesterday and that past
tense is in your memory and so you are saying

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:54.690
that the article "reported that Google did
something." Well it could be that Google did

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.639
something in the past, but the article is
still reporting it. So that really should

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:02.930
be present tense. "The article reports" that
Google did something. Kind of interesting.

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:08.259
Those are the kinds of issues that native
speakers have with tense and those crop up

00:10:08.259 --> 00:10:09.259
in Chapter Three.

00:10:09.259 --> 00:10:15.139
Let's see, case, agreement, tense. Mood. There's
something called "mood" in grammar. Not a

00:10:15.139 --> 00:10:19.879
good mood or a bad mood, but specifically
a subjunctive mood. Never mind you really

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:23.250
don't need the terminology. Let me tell you
what it translates into.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:30.069
When we're speculating about something, we
have a choice. We are trying to convey to

00:10:30.069 --> 00:10:35.800
the listener or the reader that either what
we're speculating about is possible or what

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.459
we're speculating about is impossible, but
we're speculating anyway.

00:10:39.459 --> 00:10:48.639
For example, "If I were from Los Angeles I
would be chilly up here." "If I were from

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:54.920
Los Angeles I would be chilly up here." You
can hear from my verbs "were" and "would"

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:01.690
that I'm not from Los Angeles, right? Now
if I change that sentence and, and say, "If

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:08.560
Carol is from Los Angeles she is surely chilly
up here," now you probably get the message

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.560
that it's possible that Carol's from Los Angeles.
"If Carol is from Los Angeles she is probably

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.720
chilly up here." Do you hear it? It's possible
that she's from LA. Can you hear that possibility?

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:25.259
Let me change the other sentence back into
Carol because it should be consistent. I started

00:11:25.259 --> 00:11:30.250
with "I." The reason I had switched over to
"Carol" is if I don't know whether Carol's

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:36.449
from Los Angeles but its possible, then I
can use "is." If she "is" from Los Angeles

00:11:36.449 --> 00:11:43.550
then she "is" probably chilly, right? But
I can't speculate that way about me. I know

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:47.079
where I'm from. So that's why I had to switch
over to "Carol." Do you see?

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:51.769
So let me put her in the subjunctive. "If
Carol were from Los Angeles she would be chilly

00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:57.499
up here." Now you should be getting the message
that she's not from LA, right? If she "were"

00:11:57.499 --> 00:12:04.300
from LA she would do something. If she "is"
from LA she "is" probably a certain way. The

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:08.689
sentence involving "were" and "would" should
be conveying the message to you that it's

00:12:08.689 --> 00:12:14.480
not happening. I'm speculating about it anyway,
but it's not happening. It's contrary to fact.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:18.689
And the other sentence should be conveying
to you that it's possible. I just don't know.

00:12:18.689 --> 00:12:26.370
"If she is a dancer, she probably needs money."
"If she were a dancer she would need money."

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:29.050
You hear the difference?

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.050
[pause]

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.809
That's what this chapter addresses because
typical native speakers don't understand that

00:12:34.809 --> 00:12:38.100
we're supposed to be using "were." They're
using "was" in all those situations. They

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.120
know they're speculating, but they're using
"was." You know, "If I was there." Well are

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.410
you there? No. You're speculating about something
that isn't possible, right? So if I "were"

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:48.579
there not if I "was" there.

00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:53.709
Do we have to worry about this with every
sentence? No. There are just certain words

00:12:53.709 --> 00:13:00.870
that lead to speculation. "If" is one of 'em.
Everyone sentence involving "if" can be speculating

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:05.360
about something that's not true or speculating
about something that could be true.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.860
"Wish" is another one. "Wish" always leads
to a statement that's contrary to fact or

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.649
you wouldn't be "wishing." "I wish I were."
"She wishes he were."

00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:13.699
[pause]

00:13:13.699 --> 00:13:21.290
No matter who's "wishing" the verb should
be "were." It shouldn't be "was." So the chapter

00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.649
addresses that.

00:13:22.649 --> 00:13:26.829
The next one's on modifiers; a real fancy
term for words that describe. And you might

00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:31.559
say, "Oh that's easy. Words that describe,
adjectives, right?" How many of them are adjectives

00:13:31.559 --> 00:13:35.889
in fact, but in forms that you were never
told are adjectives?

00:13:35.889 --> 00:13:40.519
For example, if I say, "While driving down
the freeway," would you believe that, that,

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:46.389
that whole phrase is an adjective? I'm describing
somebody who's driving down the freeway and

00:13:46.389 --> 00:13:53.369
the word in that opening phrase that is the
descriptive word is the word "driving." So

00:13:53.369 --> 00:13:57.809
when an opening phrase has an action word,
like "running," "walking," "swimming," "dancing,"

00:13:57.809 --> 00:14:01.949
"driving," "researching," "analyzing," "deciding,"
it doesn't matter; that word is trying to

00:14:01.949 --> 00:14:07.839
describe somebody or something. It's usually
a somebody and whoever it is has to follow

00:14:07.839 --> 00:14:09.839
the phrase.

00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:12.999
Let me give you an example and you'll know
that you're gut understands this before your

00:14:12.999 --> 00:14:18.600
head does. "Crawling across the yard the snail
intrigued the baby." Who's crawling?

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.630
[pause]

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:26.029
"Crawling across the yard the snail intrigued
the baby." Who's crawling? The snail. You

00:14:26.029 --> 00:14:30.520
should, well you should think it's the snail.
You have a good imagination if you think it's

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:36.519
the baby. The baby came later. "Crawling across
the yard the snail," hear it? "Intrigued the

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:39.559
baby." So you should be thinking it's the
snail that's doing the crawling. On the other

00:14:39.559 --> 00:14:45.309
hand, if I change it and put the baby next
to the crawling phrase, then you'll be right

00:14:45.309 --> 00:14:47.269
to assume that it's the kid who's crawling.

00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:53.440
"Crawling across the yard the baby followed
the snail."

00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.100
[pause]

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.899
"Crawling across the yard the baby pursued
the snail." Let me change the verb; make it

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:02.889
a little more interesting. "Crawling across
the yard the baby pursued the snail." You

00:15:02.889 --> 00:15:06.369
should be understanding that now it's the
baby that's crawling across the yard.

00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:11.150
Whoever I put next to that crawling phrase
is gonna wind up crawling. Unless I put a

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:15.970
word there that doesn't crawl and then the
reader goes, "What?" And so maybe the reader

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:19.980
figures it out because he understands the
context and he understands who can crawl and

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:25.509
who can't. Still it's not a good sentence
and it's not a sentence that most of us were

00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:31.629
taught about anytime in high school or middle
school or grammar school or even college.

00:15:31.629 --> 00:15:37.750
I could have a Ph.D. in English today and
not understand that kind of sentence structure.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:42.459
And the only reason I really understand all
of these things is that I, during my graduate

00:15:42.459 --> 00:15:46.149
studies focused on the teaching of writing.
It's amazing isn't it?

00:15:46.149 --> 00:15:50.689
But anyway, it's that kind of thing that crops
up in the mod, modifiers chapter.

00:15:50.689 --> 00:15:54.730
There's another really popular one people
saying "like I said," "like I told you." And

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:58.360
that really should be "as I said" and "as
I told you." And of course there's a place

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:04.259
for "like" but not in that particular phrase,
and that chapter explains that.

00:16:04.259 --> 00:16:08.050
After that the sixth grammar chapter's on
connectives; words that connect. We've got

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:13.040
prepositions, as I mentioned it before. You
know the "in," "on," "to," "from." The key

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.730
question that usually pops us is, is it against
the rule to end a sentence in a preposition?

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:22.110
And I think that's about all anybody ever
remembers about prepositions at that, at some

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:26.679
point somebody told them not to end a sentence
in one. Yet, it's fine to do so as long as

00:16:26.679 --> 00:16:31.790
there's a word earlier in the sentence that
goes with that preposition. It's pretty awkward

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.389
to always tuck them back in. You can ruin
a whole idiom.

00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:40.059
For example, "There were, there are certain
things up with which I will not put." I mean

00:16:40.059 --> 00:16:44.250
who writes like that? Who speaks like that?
The idiom is "to put up with." "There are

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:48.100
certain things that I won't put up with."
Okay, that sentence ends in a preposition.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:52.980
So what? It's grammatically correct. It's
a stylistic choice whether you tuck it in

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:56.959
or put it at the end.

00:16:56.959 --> 00:17:02.100
And certainly conjunctions are connectives
too, and, and there are a couple of kinds

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:06.510
of conjunctions and they change the structure
of a sentence. And your punctuation options

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:09.300
are different depending on the kind of conjunction
you're using.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.930
And then there are words very common in the
business world, that are not conjunctions

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:17.790
at all and many people don't realize that.
They're words like "however," "furthermore,"

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:25.660
"nevertheless," "moreover," "besides," "also."
Some of them are small; some of them are larger.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:32.021
They can show the relationship between two
ideas and they can occur right in the middle

00:17:32.021 --> 00:17:38.960
of two sentences, but you need more than a
comma to connect those two ideas. Because

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.620
those particular words "however," "furthermore,"
"therefore," "nevertheless," "moreover" they're

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:47.330
not conjunctions. They don't have glue on
them. They're just transition words. They

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:52.240
have meaning; they're wonderful to use stylistically,
and as I say they're very popular in the business

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:58.050
world, but after the first idea the minimum
punctuation you should have is a semicolon.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:18:04.040
For example, "I enjoy teaching; however, I'm
not gonna do it for the rest of my life."

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.860
Oh. The most common error that I've seen over
the last 35 years of teaching is that people

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:14.280
put a comma before and after that "however."
"I enjoy teaching" comma, "however" comma,

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:18.390
"I'm not gonna do it for the rest of my life."
And that is not Kosher, it's not allowable,

00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:23.130
it's not a stylistic option. You don't have
a glue word in the middle. You have a transition

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:28.050
word. It shows the relationship between the
two ideas, but it doesn't join them.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.990
So all you can really do if you want those
two ideas in the same sentence is to put a

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:37.700
semicolon after the first idea. And, yes,
there will be a comma after the "however"

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:43.760
or the "furthermore" or the "therefore" because
they are introductory words. They're introducing

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.120
the second idea. Your only other option is
to put a period. You can make two sentences

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:51.950
out of 'em, but people know that. What people
don't understand is that these words don't

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:56.800
join ideas and so if you want the two ideas
in the same sentence, you still need some

00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:01.000
glue and the semicolon is that glue.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.710
So that kind of thing is in the connectives
chapter.

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:08.900
Also the notion of parallel structure's in
there; meaning items in a series have to match

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.490
because whenever you have connecting words,
what you connecting, words or phrases or whole

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.150
ideas? And they have to match each other.

00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:22.780
So you, of course, may not write "Mary Jane
enjoys hiking, baking, and to ski." That's

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.900
an error in parallel structure. Items in a
series have to all be parallel, right? And

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:31.030
you may be sitting there thinking, "Oh, easy
I would never write 'Mary Jane enjoys hiking,

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:35.550
baking, and to ski.'" No because those words
are close together and your ear wouldn't allow

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:40.430
it. But when you add more words into the sentence,
which is more typical of business writing

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:44.170
certainly, your ear doesn't always catch the
problem.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:48.550
So it could be "Mary Jane enjoys hiking on
Mt. Tamalpais in the springtime, baking cookies

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:53.710
whenever it rains, and to ski at Lake Tahoe
in the winter." You see? The ear doesn't catch

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:57.980
it right away. Your ear may be catching it
and you have an excellent ear. Or you may

00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.520
be aware of the error because I just gave
you the simplified version of it and you're

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:07.410
lookin' for it. But typically when more words
are involved in each of the items people aren't

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.910
so sensitive to whether they match each other.
And we really should be.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:16.310
I just used the word "whether" which reminds
me of another connective issue. Native speakers

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:22.750
of English are always using "if" when we should
be using "whether," typical mistake? "We need

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.580
to know 'if' we're gonna proceed with this
project?" No. "We need to know whether we're

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:32.270
gonna proceed with this project." Why? Because
when "or not" is understood, when the word

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.670
"or not" can be placed into the sentence,
you don't have to write it and you don't have

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:37.700
to say it.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:43.170
But when you can place it in there that means
the connecting word you need is "whether."

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:50.150
So "We need to know whether 'or not' we're
going to proceed with this project." Not "if."

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:56.130
"If" sets up a condition. "If we proceed with
this project we're gonna need more money."

00:20:56.130 --> 00:21:01.640
In other words, upon a certain condition "we're
gonna need more money." So that distinction

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.480
is also made in the connectives chapter.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:08.610
And the last chapter as I told you is punctuation.
You may be saying, "Oh my God, all these little,

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:12.811
tiny, picky, nitty gritty things." That's
English for you. It's probably any language,

00:21:12.811 --> 00:21:14.390
but here we are with English.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:20.860
And actually it's a very thin book as you
can see. So it's obviously not covering everything

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:25.780
that could be covered under the sun about
this language, but believe me because I've

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:31.050
been in the classroom with people, in business
settings, and at universities, and private

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:37.380
organizations, and government agencies for
so long I do understand what even good writers

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.840
don't always know. And that's what's in this
book.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:46.650
Anyhow, I'll bet you you've got some questions
and I would love to answer them. So if you

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.810
do, please speak up.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:49.810
[pause]

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:50.810
Yes.

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:51.810
[pause]

00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:59.400
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So language evolves over
time with people using it perhaps incorrectly

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.910
so "whom" is probably gonna become "who,"
right? And there are other things like "less"

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:06.920
and "fewer," right? Like the grocery store
you would check out is like "eight items or

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:13.330
less" when it should be "eight items or fewer,"
right? Is this kind of thing ongoing and will

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:14.510
"fewer" become obsolete?

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:19.590
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Well I'm not a soothsayer. I
don't know what will and won't become obsolete.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:24.160
"Whom" is still with us. Professional writers
and editors are still using "whom" and that's

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:28.170
discussed in Chapter One of my book.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:32.260
I can't say, "Oh forget about it." You could
avoid it and get around it and reword the

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:37.780
sentence so that you don't need it. Sometimes,
to be honest, I don't use it where it belongs.

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:41.790
I'll reword the sentence because it sounds
a little stuffy. And that's not the tone I

00:22:41.790 --> 00:22:46.200
want. Other times it's fine. Like "whom did
you vote for?" I mean that's fine with me.

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:51.200
It doesn't sound too bad. But other times
I, I, I will rewrite the sentence just because

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.460
of the tone of "whom." It may disappear, and
I, I understand that's your question.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:01.410
"Fewer" versus "less." Have you seen the grocery
stores lately? You know about eight months

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:07.190
ago I went into a Trader Joe's and it said
"eight items or less" and I went up to the,

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:09.820
[laughs] I'm, I'm crazy, I'm busy. I went
[laughs] up to the Customer Service Department

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:13.520
I said, "You know that really should be 'fewer.'
It shouldn't be 'less.' It really should be

00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.340
 -- " And then I went back to that Trader
Joe's in a couple of weeks and they hadn't

00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:21.610
changed the sign. Months later all the signs
at the Trader Joe's were changed to "fewer."

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:25.860
Whole Foods had "fewer" to begin with. I mean
the word "fewer" in their signs. They were

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:27.790
correct, right on, of course they would be.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:32.180
So, you know, some do; some don't. Will it
disappear? I don't know. You know grammar

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:36.340
seems to be coming back. People seem to be
caring about the correct use of the language

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.340
and who knows?

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.530
Nothing has changed in my lifetime. Let me
put it that way. We're talking about six decades

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:47.080
here. Nothing has changed in my lifetime except
a punctuation issue.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:56.310
When I was about 30, people, I mean publishers
were putting periods and commas inside or

00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:02.510
outside closing quotation marks depending
on what they belonged to. And then it changed.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:08.350
And so now when it's time for a comma or a
period and it's also time for a closing quotation

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:14.490
mark, that comma or period goes inside, don't
even think about it. Well what if the sentence

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:18.090
is 25 words long and only the last word's
in quotes. I said, "Don't think about it.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:22.210
Just put the period in inside," because there's
not an option in this country.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:25.460
And I say this country because that's what
we do here it's not what they do in England

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.310
or Australia or Canada, but it is what we
do here.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.140
That's the only thing that's changed. What
a long answer to a short question.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.140
What else? Yes.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.800
&gt;&gt;female in audience: What do you think can
be done in schools to teach these rules better?

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:43.970
'Cause it seems that a lot of English teachers
teach you the basic rules but are kind of

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:47.400
lax about some of the, some of the structures
here.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.130
&gt;&gt;Janie Bell: I think all the schools should
just order my book and use it.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.250
[laughter]

00:24:51.250 --> 00:24:57.040
Seriously, I wish I had a way. You know my
book so far has not been marketed to schools.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.780
My publisher didn't aim for schools; they
aimed for the marketplace for the ordinary

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.020
individual who has to write which is practically
everybody. And I'm not averse to that. I,

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:14.810
I like it being everywhere and in all bookstores,
but, and on Amazon, but I, I wish it, I wish

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.980
it were marketed, I wish is had been marketed
to the schools because I think that a, a book

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.770
like this would be immensely useful.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:27.170
And you're right to say that teachers are,
did you say lax?

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.170
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Yeah.

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:33.840
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: I'm not sure they're lax. I'm
not sure they know all of the information

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:38.011
that they should really be con, conveying.
It's a, it's a specialized field. And as I

00:25:38.011 --> 00:25:43.090
said a moment ago, if I hadn't specialized
in the teaching of writing as a graduate student,

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:48.640
had I not planned on teaching writing at the
college level, I would be one of those teachers

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.590
too. You know understanding the language pretty
well on a gut level, but not really under,

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:58.290
not being able to communicate it really clearly
as to why it's this way.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:02.520
The word "why" reminds me of something else
and that happens in the connectives chapter.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:07.870
"The reason why is because." Oh what a common
locution these days. If you're using reason

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:12.570
you don't need to say "why" and you don't
need to say "because." It's redundant. They

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.770
all three mean the same thing.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:18.280
So if you've begun a sentence with "reason"
don't use "why" and don't say "is because."

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:24.290
The little connecting word you need is "that."
"The reason I was late today is 'that' there

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:29.430
was a lot of traffic." Not, "the reason I
was late 'is because' there was a lot of traffic."

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:33.370
And not "the reason why I was late is because
there was a lot of traffic." Do you understand

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:36.930
what's going on? "Reason" says it all. If
you don't have the word "reason" you can use

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:40.390
the word "because," if you don't have "reason"
or "because" you can use the word "why;" but

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:42.280
not together.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.640
Sorry. I mean sorry. I digress.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.640
Another question.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.270
Yes, in the back.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.270
[pause]

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.650
Wait one moment you're gonna get a booming
voice.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:58.650
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Can you talk a little
bit about active versus passive verbs? I was

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:04.730
always told in school to avoid passive verbs
like the plague and to just structure your

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:09.570
sentences to always be, to always include
an active verb. Can you talk a little bit

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:10.570
about that?

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:12.340
&gt;&gt;Janice Bell: I can talk a lot about that.
I'm not sure you'd wanna hear it.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:16.580
By the way, it's not covered in my book because
active and passive voice, I'm glad you called

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:21.000
it "voice" and not "tense." Usually people
call it "tense" which is isn't, are matters

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.490
of style. This is style were talking about
here. The active voice is correct and the

00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:31.070
passive voice is correct and you know what
else these days there's, there's not a huge

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:35.110
problem of people using the passive when they
should be using the active. We've sort of

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.070
come over that hump in our society.

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:42.141
When I began teaching writing in organizations
and in businesses, the passive voice was all

00:27:42.141 --> 00:27:45.710
too prevalent and now it's really not. So
we can prove.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:51.120
For those of you who are sitting there thinking,
"What the heck are they talking about?" Anytime

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:56.910
you have an idea you're going to have a subject
and a verb, even the simplest of ideas. You

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:01.460
know, "The dog ate the bone." You've got somebody
at the beginning and you have an action happening.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:08.040
If that somebody at the beginning is doing
the action, and by the way, tense has nothing

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.810
to do with this, it doesn't matter whether
"the dog ate the bone yesterday," whether

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:16.260
"he is eating it presently," whether he "will"
eat it tomorrow, or whether he "had" eaten

00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:22.560
it before I did something else. That dog is
the agent of the action regardless of when

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:28.120
it took place. That whole idea is said to
be written in the active voice.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:33.010
So, "The dog ate the bone" is active. It also
has nothing to do with meaning. If I say,

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:39.040
"The man lay dead on the floor" that's active.
People go, "But, but he's dead." I told you

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:43.020
it had nothin' to do with meaning. Did the
man do the lying on the floor? Did the man

00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:49.640
lie on the floor? I said "the man lay." "Lay"
why, because that's the past tense of "l-i-e"

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.230
believe it or not. That's in my book too.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.970
Anyhow. But that's an active sentence because
the man "did" the "lying" on the floor. The

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:57.590
man did the action.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.600
Whether the dog "eats the bone" now, "will
eat it tomorrow," or "did eat it yesterday,"

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.140
he's doing the action; that's called active.

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:09.490
If I turn it around and start that same idea
with the bone I'm gonna get what we call passive.

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:11.440
And I'll tell you why in a moment.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:16.580
"The bone was eaten by the dog," same idea,
right? But now I've got the "bone" in the

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:23.310
subject position. Grammatically it's the subject
and psychologically it's the subject. When

00:29:23.310 --> 00:29:27.550
I say, "The bone was eaten by the dog" you
should be getting the message that this sentence

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:33.560
is about the bone. It's kind of incidental
that the guy who ate it is the dog, right?

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:39.340
"The dog ate the bone." Subject: dog; focal
point: dog. "The bone was eaten by the dog."

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:42.960
Subject: bone; focal point: bone, right?

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:49.980
That's called passive because the new subject
"bone" didn't do the eating. "The bone was

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:58.280
eaten." "It was considered." "It had been
decided." "It was recommended." You hear those?

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:03.150
Those are typically passive constructions.
The subject of those last three examples is

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:09.840
"it." And yet "it" didn't do the deciding
or the recommending or the considering, right?

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:15.680
Who did? And this is why the gentlemen in
the back was told awhile back by teachers

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.570
"avoid the passive voice."

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:24.060
We don't always need to avoid the passive
voice. It's just that it's a lot better style

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:30.300
to say "who recommended," "who decided," "who
considered" in the business world. And lately

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:33.880
people know that and they're not hiding. They're
not saying, "It is recommended that something

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:38.180
be done." They're saying, "Management recommends
that we do something," right? Isn't that more

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:43.990
typical in the work environment now? Great.
We got over a, one problem in this society.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:48.500
So that's probably, well that's one of the
rea, reasons teachers were telling you to

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:53.140
stay away from passivity. The other thing
is a passive idea, "The bone was eaten by

00:30:53.140 --> 00:30:59.451
the dog" always requires more words than an
active idea. "The dog ate the bone." You hear

00:30:59.451 --> 00:31:00.451
it?

00:31:00.451 --> 00:31:01.451
[pause]

00:31:01.451 --> 00:31:06.970
Five for "dog ate the bone;" seven for "The
bone was eaten by the dog."

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.650
Because to create a passive verb you have
to add a "was" or an "is" or a "will be" before

00:31:11.650 --> 00:31:16.390
another verb. "Was eaten" versus "ate." And
then to tell who did it if you're gonna give

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:20.860
all the information you've gotta add a little
"by" at the end.

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:25.770
Now passivity comes in handy however when
this whole paragraph's gonna be about the

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:28.620
bone. And I don't mind telling you who ate
it, but I'm not gonna start by putting the

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:33.970
spotlight on the dog when the rest of the
focus will be on the bone.

00:31:33.970 --> 00:31:38.370
So that would be a good time to say, "The
bone was eaten by the dog." I could add, you

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.560
might say, "Oh that's such a simple sentence."
Well I'm trying to give you the skeletal version

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:46.320
so you'll understand the answer to the question.
I can add more details. I can say, "Under

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.740
the shade of a magnolia tree in 1938 the bone
was eaten by the dog with great gusto."

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:51.740
[pause]

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:56.160
Still passive, there's only one subject and
verb. I just gave you a lot of description

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:00.870
telling you when and where and how that bone
was eaten. But it's still passive because

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:06.620
that bone was still eaten and if the rest
of the paragraph or report is about the bone

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:08.300
then that's a good choice.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.830
There's another time passivity's very useful
and that's when we don't know who ate the

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:18.210
bone. So, but we do know it was eaten. So,
"Under the shade of a magnolia tree in Southeastern

00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:25.570
Alabama in 1938 the bone was eaten with great
gusto." You see? It's useful when we don't

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.340
know who did what the passive voice serves
us well.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:32.020
I would say that as a group you don't need
to think about this although I did wanna answer

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.810
your question and it may have been interesting
for some of you too.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:40.550
But mostly now we're using active voice telling
who does what, who did what, who would do

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:47.789
what if she could do what, appropriately.
And we are using passive voice automatically

00:32:47.789 --> 00:32:53.830
when we wanna shift the focus onto "the phone
went unanswered." "The phone was unanswered."

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:57.390
You know I, I have no interest in saying,
"Who didn't answer the phone?" That's not

00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:02.900
my point; I'm saying, "The phone was unanswered,"
right? So I think it's pretty automatic now

00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:05.690
and I think we're in good shape. But, does
that help?

00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:06.690
[pause]

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:07.690
Another question?

00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:08.690
[pause]

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:09.690
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Hi, I'm curious to hear
your opinion on corporate buzz words. So here

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:10.690
we say a lot of terms that maybe are changed
from their original meaning to sound more

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:12.180
corporate. So some examples are "take aways,"
"learnings." Like, "What are the learnings

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:16.730
from this presentation?"

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:33.820
One thing that we say a lot on my team is
"bottom lining." So instead of saying, "What's

00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:37.150
the bottom line," we'll say you know, "Make
sure your bottom lining" -

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:38.150
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Um-hum.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:41.580
&gt;&gt;female in audience: or "Make sure you're
working on your bottom lining skills."

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.580
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Um-hum.

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:44.910
&gt;&gt;female in audience: And it drives me insane.
[laughs]

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:46.890
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Does it? I think it's creative.

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:47.890
&gt;&gt;female in audience: But it --

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:48.890
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Why not?

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:51.210
&gt;&gt;female in audience: It serves a purpose
and --

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:55.990
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: It serves a purpose and it also
makes you feel more closely related to your

00:33:55.990 --> 00:34:01.700
language that you can change it to suit your
needs. English is very elastic; very flexible;

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:05.770
it's incorporated all kinds of new vocabulary
words since you've been alive, since I've

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.510
been alive and long before that.

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:11.609
I think it's great that you can take a word
that used to be just in this form and add

00:34:11.609 --> 00:34:18.700
an "ing" and everybody knows what you're talking
about and it's infused with a new life somehow,

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:23.379
so if it suits the organization and everybody
knows what you're talking about and it brings

00:34:23.379 --> 00:34:26.730
you a little closer because you're the only
guys who are bottom lining these days, why

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:32.030
not? Although are you? I don't know. You know
you may be starting a trend.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:36.919
I understand what you are saying that when
things aren't used as we were taught to use

00:34:36.919 --> 00:34:41.869
them it can be aggravating, as you say it's
driving you crazy. But you asked me what I

00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:46.710
think. It wouldn't drive me crazy. I think
it's adorable. [laughs]

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:47.710
[laughter]

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:51.720
I'd, I'd go right into it if I could. I don't
work for Google so I'm not gonna be bottom

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:57.060
lining, but, it's, it makes one think. It's
refreshing, I think.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:02.319
That's just my take. Huh? This is just an
opinion, there's no rule.

00:35:02.319 --> 00:35:03.319
[pause]

00:35:03.319 --> 00:35:04.319
Anybody else?

00:35:04.319 --> 00:35:05.319
[pause]

00:35:05.319 --> 00:35:06.319
Yes.

00:35:06.319 --> 00:35:07.319
[pause]

00:35:07.319 --> 00:35:12.829
&gt;&gt;female in audience: So I'm just tryin' to
wrap my head around a specific example that

00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:13.980
you said.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.390
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Which one?

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.390
&gt;&gt;female in audience: So "data" is plural.

00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:17.390
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: It is.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.329
&gt;&gt;female in audience: So "the data were complicated?"

00:35:19.329 --> 00:35:22.079
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: That's right. And they probably
still are because they still exist. See that's

00:35:22.079 --> 00:35:23.079
the other thing about tense --

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:25.099
&gt;&gt;female in audience: So they use is because
it sounds like idiom, like the idiom, like

00:35:25.099 --> 00:35:29.579
why do people use "the data is complicated?"

00:35:29.579 --> 00:35:33.950
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: They don't understand that it's
a Latin word that is plural. That's why. It's

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:40.460
just, I think it's really a matter of maybe
ignorance is too harsh a word, but not knowing

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.499
how 'bout that, kind of like "bottom lining."

00:35:43.499 --> 00:35:47.310
That's what I think. They don't understand
that "data" is plural. The word "data" yeah.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:58.349
"Phenomena" is plural. So you know to say,
"This is a new phenomena" is not right, "phenomenon"

00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:59.349
with an "o-n."

00:35:59.349 --> 00:36:04.270
These are just words that come from Latin
we still have them in our language, as they

00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:09.549
were born. They didn't change a whit and you
know we get used to a lot of, a lot of mistakes

00:36:09.549 --> 00:36:12.160
and so they don't sound bad anymore.

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:16.349
For example probably "like I said" doesn't
bother you at all. It, you're used to it.

00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:23.310
Hardly anybody says, "as I said," you know.
So may, perhaps before I began to speak you

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:27.619
weren't bothered by "the reason why we did
this is because funding was short at the time."

00:36:27.619 --> 00:36:32.369
Maybe that would, wouldn't have bothered you
either. Maybe it won't bother you in the future.

00:36:32.369 --> 00:36:36.109
God bless you, how wonderful. [laughs] It
bothers me terribly.

00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:41.190
So what, when we get used to hearing something
over and over and over we think it's fine

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:44.859
and then somebody comes up and says, "No,
it's not" and that's gonna bother you for

00:36:44.859 --> 00:36:47.210
awhile, surely comma, surely period.

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:48.210
[laughter]

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:51.079
Who else? Yes.

00:36:51.079 --> 00:36:52.079
[pause]

00:36:52.079 --> 00:37:05.059
&gt;&gt;male in audience. So I had a quick question.
I see this a lot of times in English and I

00:37:05.059 --> 00:37:08.690
wasn't sure if it was correct, but a lot of
times I'll see something like, "I want to

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:09.690
tell you," or "I want to write you to let
you know," or along those lines -

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:10.690
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Uh-huh.

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:11.690
&gt;&gt;male in audience: but they use the past
tense with "I wanted."

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:12.769
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Oh yes. It, again remember a
moment ago I was saying that because we read

00:37:12.769 --> 00:37:17.839
something in the past we tend to ascribe past
tense to that thing like, "The article stated"

00:37:17.839 --> 00:37:22.319
or "The report implied" and we have to remember,
no I read it in the past but the article is

00:37:22.319 --> 00:37:25.539
still "stating" and the report is still "implying"
and they should be present tense.

00:37:25.539 --> 00:37:31.400
Same thing happens when we write sentences
like the one that you just gave. "I wanted

00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:36.900
to let you know." Well don't you still want
to let the person know? It's a habit and everybody's

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:40.250
fallen into it and it sounds fine and nobody
looks at it. When you do look at it though

00:37:40.250 --> 00:37:44.359
you realize you don't need an "e-d" there;
get rid of it. "I want to let you know." It's,

00:37:44.359 --> 00:37:47.829
it's a small change, but you know everything
in my book and everything were talking about

00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:52.170
is a small change. You put 'em all together
and they make a big difference in the way

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:55.230
your writing comes across. "I want to let
you know."

00:37:55.230 --> 00:38:00.220
Another one along those same lines to use
your phrase is,

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:01.220
[pause]

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:02.720
oh let me see,

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.720
[pause]

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:10.220
um, what is it, something about receiving
your letter. Oh, it's a little different.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:16.049
"We have received your letter of October 15th."
How many times did you receive that letter?

00:38:16.049 --> 00:38:20.259
Because have done something is supposed to
be for repeated past action and if it just

00:38:20.259 --> 00:38:24.760
happened once you should be writing, "We received
your letter." That's what that reminds me

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.760
of.

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.749
But you're right, "I wanted to let you know."
"I wanted to thank you." Oh you don't still

00:38:28.749 --> 00:38:33.589
want? You do still want. So you know take
a, take a closer look at it.

00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:36.299
I just remembered I'm not supposed to cross
this line which is why I made a face. [laughs]

00:38:36.299 --> 00:38:39.180
Anyway, that's a good question.

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.180
[pause]

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:47.460
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So you kind of have to
follow up on that. So if you said something

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:52.819
like, "I ate at a great, I ate at a great
rest, I ate at a restaurant last night. The

00:38:52.819 --> 00:38:58.099
vibe was great or the vibe, or the atmosphere"
'cause the atmosphere's still there.

00:38:58.099 --> 00:38:59.099
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Yes.

00:38:59.099 --> 00:39:01.859
&gt;&gt;male in audience: So would you say, "The
atmosphere is great" or "was great?"

00:39:01.859 --> 00:39:05.339
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Well is depends on what you're
counting as atmosphere, if it includes the

00:39:05.339 --> 00:39:10.470
people and the particular food that was served
and the fact that there was a party singing

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:14.249
next to you, I don't, it could be a "was."
You know "The vibe was great, the atmosphere

00:39:14.249 --> 00:39:18.799
was great." If you're not sure that it still
is great or that it will be when somebody

00:39:18.799 --> 00:39:22.079
else goes there you can use the past tense,
so that one's up for grabs.

00:39:22.079 --> 00:39:27.490
You, "The décor is beautiful," probably they
didn't change the décor in one day. You know

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:32.499
you, we can be careful and, and, and think
about this especially when we write. We don't

00:39:32.499 --> 00:39:38.619
always think about all these issues when we
speak and so errors tumble out of our mouths.

00:39:38.619 --> 00:39:44.200
But as I say listeners are much more forgiving
than readers. Forgiving, they don't even notice

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:46.789
what we're doing when we're talking they're
just trying to keep up.

00:39:46.789 --> 00:39:52.269
But you put it on paper and people do notice.
They don't always know what it is, but they

00:39:52.269 --> 00:39:56.710
get a feeling like, "Uh-oh, that read funny."
[laughs] Right? That didn't seem right.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.249
So anyway that's a good question.

00:39:58.249 --> 00:40:00.380
[pause]

00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.380
Any other questions?

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:02.380
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Right here. [laughs]

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:03.380
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Right, oh hi.

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.980
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Hi, I just wanted to
know your opinion on using contractions in

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:16.539
emails and writing. Is it too informal? That's
kind of what we're taught in college and school

00:40:16.539 --> 00:40:17.749
I think, but in business writing.

00:40:17.749 --> 00:40:19.809
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: What do you think I wanna say?
I'm just curious.

00:40:19.809 --> 00:40:20.990
&gt;&gt;female in audience: That it's okay.

00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:22.970
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Yeah. I seem like that kind
of girl don't I? [laughs] It's just fine.

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:26.970
I mean if I like bottom lining why would I
be against contractions?

00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:32.200
It really depends on the tone of your document
or the kind of document. If you're writing

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:37.869
to a co-worker or a friend certainly if it's
an informal document you should write as you

00:40:37.869 --> 00:40:42.569
speak, for the most part. A little bit better
in that we'll try to get over the errors we

00:40:42.569 --> 00:40:47.769
have when we speak. But I think contractions
are, are, are marvelous for that. They mimic

00:40:47.769 --> 00:40:50.180
the way in which we ordinarily use the language.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:55.550
And maybe then if you're writing a formal
report or an analysis of some sort and it's

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:59.960
gonna, it's, it's far reaching or even if
it's not far reaching but it's going to somebody

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:04.630
at the top or somebody who's gonna make a
decision and you want this document to seem

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:07.749
more formal, then don't contract.

00:41:07.749 --> 00:41:13.890
Or if you want to emphasis the "not" in a
sentence "We do not put up with this kind

00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:17.660
of behavior" rather than "We don't put up
with this," you hear it? It's much more emphatic.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:24.579
So there are times for spelling out certainly,
but I would say go with what you would do

00:41:24.579 --> 00:41:28.900
when you speak. Sometimes we speak more formally
because we're addressing groups or we're talking

00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:34.329
about a serious issue and we don't even use
contractions then. So I would go with my gut

00:41:34.329 --> 00:41:35.980
if I, if I were you, not if I was you.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:36.980
[pause]

00:41:36.980 --> 00:41:37.980
Yes?

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:38.980
[pause]

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:45.830
&gt;&gt;male in audience: I'd like to know your
opinion on people who are communicating over

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:52.060
BlackBerry's for business purposes. So typically
out of the office could be late or you know

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:56.910
even early before going to work, are they
excused for contractions like "Thanks, t-h-x"

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:00.030
in those situations or is that an egregious
error?

00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:07.450
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: No, of course it's not an error.
In a space that small what the hell could

00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:08.450
you communicate -

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:09.450
[laughter]

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:13.119
if you didn't abbreviate? I mean, and it's,
it's a challenge, it's a new game, it's a

00:42:13.119 --> 00:42:19.819
whole new opportunity for your mind to come
up with creative abbreviations that you're

00:42:19.819 --> 00:42:23.339
sure your reader will understand, I guess.
That's, so you're not trying to hang the reader

00:42:23.339 --> 00:42:26.880
up half a day to understand what you were
talking about. But that's perfectly fine and

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.950
logical as a matter of fact, right?

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:36.970
That doesn't fall into the realm of error,
that's deliberate. That's a challenge; that's

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:37.970
fun.

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:38.970
[pause]

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:50.140
&gt;&gt;male in audience: This is kind of in the
same vein and I apologize if you already this,

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.609
I got here a little late. In back to back
or back and forth email communication is it

00:42:53.609 --> 00:42:56.970
necessary to always say, "Hi, so and so?"
Like,

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:59.980
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Get's old doesn't it?

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:03.099
&gt;&gt;male in audience: I mean yeah, I mean if
it's back and forth can you just go right

00:43:03.099 --> 00:43:04.099
into what you're about to say?

00:43:04.099 --> 00:43:07.200
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Well I don't think there are
any rules for this. I can tell you what I

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.660
do, that I, I don't say, "Hi so and so" every
time and often I don't even say, "Janis" at

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:15.849
the end. It's like a conversation, right?
The only difference is there's a, a little

00:43:15.849 --> 00:43:20.270
bit more of a delay, sometimes not much of
one between what one person says and the other

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:23.750
person says. But if you're going back and
forth like that and it's absolutely clear

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:29.619
what the context is and that other person
knows who's writing and what about, well I

00:43:29.619 --> 00:43:33.480
don't see any problem leaving off the "Hi,
Linda" and the "Love, Bill."

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:39.880
&gt;&gt;male in audience: And also do you, do you
recommend any sort of etiquette for correcting

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:40.880
other's grammar. When is that appropriate?

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:41.880
[laughter]

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.609
I, I , I, I've always been, I've always understood
that it is not appropriate unless you're an

00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:48.559
English teacher to sort of correct someone
else's grammar, but maybe you have a different

00:43:48.559 --> 00:43:49.559
opinion.

00:43:49.559 --> 00:43:55.339
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: And it isn't always appropriate
when you're an English teacher either.

00:43:55.339 --> 00:44:03.560
I suggest that you give your take on a grammar
situation when somebody asks you. That's what

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:05.119
I suggest.

00:44:05.119 --> 00:44:09.660
Even I don't correct people's grammar when
they're writing to me or when they're speaking

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:15.349
to me because first of all they haven't asked
for it and it, it derails the conversation.

00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:18.859
Even if I weren't an English teacher or, maybe
it's a little bit more forgivable because

00:44:18.859 --> 00:44:23.759
I am as you suggest, but still it, it takes
the conversation into grammar and that's not

00:44:23.759 --> 00:44:28.259
what we were talking about. It also probably
makes the person feel ill at le, ill at ease,

00:44:28.259 --> 00:44:33.410
if not embarrassed, or maybe even a little
less than friendly toward you, the one who

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:34.410
did it.

00:44:34.410 --> 00:44:39.549
But you know there are people who do ask questions,
especially of me and maybe even of you. You

00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:42.519
know, "Should it be 'of' should it be 'to,'"
what would you do? Would you say "of" or "to"

00:44:42.519 --> 00:44:47.180
here? And sometimes either one works; sometimes
one is preferable and you can certainly give

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.650
your answer.

00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:54.140
I would have to say what's the situation,
I mean if, if it's a cousin of yours or a

00:44:54.140 --> 00:44:58.480
sister or a, a, co-worker whose performance
you're trying to improve, I was, I think I

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:04.920
would still get that person's solicitation.
I would wait for the question. I would wait

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.940
for that person to ask me to help out.

00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.251
Are you inclined to do that? It --

00:45:09.251 --> 00:45:10.251
[laughter]

00:45:10.251 --> 00:45:11.251
No.

00:45:11.251 --> 00:45:12.251
[laughter]

00:45:12.251 --> 00:45:16.730
No. I mean I do it in my head. I do it in
my head when people speak, but I'm not gonna

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:20.440
say, "Hey you know that 'if' should have been
a 'whether.'" "Hey you know what you've got

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.079
a double negative in that sentence and it
doesn't," "You know what your parallel structure's

00:45:23.079 --> 00:45:26.390
off." "You know what you're throwing the word
'only' in too soon every time."

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:27.390
[laughter]

00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:30.989
That's such a cute one, by the way. We do
throw the word "only" in too soon most of

00:45:30.989 --> 00:45:31.989
the time.

00:45:31.989 --> 00:45:38.530
Let me give you a, a sentence with, let me
give you a typical error. "Yesterday I only

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:43.190
rented a Volkswagen." Now I don't know what
kind of meaning you get out of that. Probably

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:48.170
from my inflection, my face, my hand you're
understanding that a Volkswagen is not a very

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:53.130
big car or a very big expenditure or something
like that, it's just a Volkswagen. But what

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:58.769
I actually said is, "Yesterday I only rented,"
that's what I said. That's not the inflection

00:45:58.769 --> 00:46:02.749
I gave it, but you're writing doesn't have
inflection. You're writing doesn't have any

00:46:02.749 --> 00:46:08.609
tone to it or any verbal emphasis to it. So
if somebody reads, "Yesterday I only rented

00:46:08.609 --> 00:46:13.160
a Volkswagen," that's indeed the message that
they may get, that you just rented one, you

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.660
didn't buy one.

00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:18.150
Look at how the meaning changes depending
on where I put "only." I'm gonna take that

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:26.710
same core sentence. "Only yesterday I rented
a Volkswagen." "Yesterday only I rented a

00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:33.089
Volkswagen." "Yesterday I only rented a Volkswagen."
"Yesterday I rented only a Volkswagen." You

00:46:33.089 --> 00:46:38.579
see what's happening? "Only" shines its light
to the right, it shines its light on the next

00:46:38.579 --> 00:46:43.970
word. So if I say, "Only yesterday," you get
it, oh so recently. If I say, "Only I," you

00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:49.739
get it, no one else. "Only rented," didn't
buy. "Only a Volkswagen," no big deal.

00:46:49.739 --> 00:46:53.640
The same thing happens if I put it at the
end of a sentence. "Yesterday I rented a Volkswagen

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:57.910
only." It can't shine its light to the right
'cause there ain't nothin' to the right. So

00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:00.150
it goes back on the Volkswagen.

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:04.539
In other words, if I say, "Only a Volkswagen,"
the meaning is the same as, "a Volkswagen

00:47:04.539 --> 00:47:11.190
only" period. Because there's only one word
that "only" can shine its light on and that

00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.319
is the word "Volkswagen."

00:47:13.319 --> 00:47:18.440
I'm hearing "onlys" thrown in too soon all
the time. And yet when I hear them I don't

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.290
say, "Hey, hey, hey you're 'only' should have
been a little you know, a little bit later

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.390
you didn't wait." You know -

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:24.390
[laughter]

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:28.170
No, certainly not. But I note it and that's
how you know noting and noting and seeing

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:34.029
and hearing and reading and all these years
is, is what made me distill the most common

00:47:34.029 --> 00:47:38.180
problems for people whose grasp of the language
is firm and put them in this little book.

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:42.829
You can, I'm so happy that you, I don't have
to convince you to get this book, you have

00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:46.990
this book; it's in front of you. I, I hope
only that you enjoy it.

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:52.020
See most people would say, "I only hope,"
wouldn't they? Isn't that common? "I only

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:56.109
hope that you enjoy it." "I only hope," that's
all I'm doing is hoping. What a small action

00:47:56.109 --> 00:48:02.630
hoping is. It is what I'm trying to say? No.
I'm trying to say, "I hope only one thing."

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:06.989
"I hope only that you'll enjoy it." Interesting,
huh?

00:48:06.989 --> 00:48:13.599
Now you're gonna start hearing all the premature
"onlys" in the sentences around you. They're

00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:15.400
plentiful, believe me.

00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:16.400
Anybody else have a question?

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:17.400
Yes.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.400
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Well thank you first Janis
for, for joining us. It's been a pleasure

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.400
and I assure you that if we see anybody in
this room saying "only" or "whether" inappropriate,

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.400
or "only" or "if" inappropriately we'll make
sure to call them out.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:21.400
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: [laughs]

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.400
&gt;&gt;male in audience: But I was actually curious
you said you haven't seen a lot of trends

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.410
except for the inside the quotation marks
period, comma, whatever.

00:48:23.410 --> 00:48:26.839
In the writing of your students have you seen
any just general abilities changing, better

00:48:26.839 --> 00:48:31.099
or worse? I've actually heard a teacher say
or claim that the writing has gotten better

00:48:31.099 --> 00:48:35.160
since the Internet age because we're more
comfortable with our medium, the computer,

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:53.200
and we're also more concise in general. I
don't if that's a good thing or a bad thing,

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:58.750
but have you seen any trends like that change
since the real innovation of the computer?

00:48:58.750 --> 00:49:03.430
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Honestly no. When the word processor
first came into being people were saying,

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:06.801
"Oh, it's gonna make everybody's writing so
much better." Well it made it easier to type,

00:49:06.801 --> 00:49:10.130
it made it easier to correct, but the grammar
and the usage and the punctuation were exactly

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:15.069
the same. And the same thing with the way
computers are now days, I mean they make,

00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:18.950
they make the process of writing the easiest
it can possibility be and that's wonderful

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:23.960
and you can, ah, you can do anything you wanna
do and embellish it in any way you want, but

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:29.099
people's understanding of the language hasn't
changed. And therefore I don't, I would say

00:49:29.099 --> 00:49:33.519
that perhaps it's gotten a little less formal
which our whole society has gotten.

00:49:33.519 --> 00:49:39.910
Language has gotten less formal because of
popularity of email and the frequency with

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:44.420
which we now write to one another. But, you
know, I'm constantly seeing "i-t apostrophe

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.640
s" where it doesn't belong all over the email.
I'm seeing commas in between complete sentences.

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:51.630
Complete sentence comma, complete sentence
comma, complete sentence period. Just because

00:49:51.630 --> 00:49:55.260
they're short and they're related people don't
know how to join 'em. So I don't see that

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:56.549
changing, I really don't.

00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:57.549
[pause]

00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:58.690
&gt;&gt;male in audience: One last question.

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:02.400
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: If I did I wouldn't have a job.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.400
[laughter]

00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:04.400
[pause]

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:10.839
&gt;&gt;commentator: Alright. Well, thank you again,
Janis for joining us. It's been a pleasure

00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:11.839
and I'm sure you'll be staying around to answer
any other last questions you didn't want to

00:50:11.839 --> 00:50:12.839
throw out in the mic.

00:50:12.839 --> 00:50:16.660
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: I sure will and I also wanna
tell people to feel free to go to my Website

00:50:16.660 --> 00:50:24.509
which is janisbell.com. J-a-n-i-s is the Janis
part. And there's a little bit of information

00:50:24.509 --> 00:50:27.390
and even a song that I sing to greet you.
You'll, you'll enjoy it.

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:28.390
[laughter]

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:29.390
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: [laughs]

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:34.060
&gt;&gt;female in audience: Janis is also gonna
be sticking around to sign books if anybody's

00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:35.109
interested in that.

00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:36.250
&gt;&gt;Janis Bell: Thanks so much.

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:39.299
