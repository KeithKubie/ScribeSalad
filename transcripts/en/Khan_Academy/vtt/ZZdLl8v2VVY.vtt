00:00:00.297 --> 00:00:03.327
- [Instructor] "A new solar-powered
bicycle can reach speeds

00:00:03.327 --> 00:00:08.327
"of up to as high as 30 miles per hour."

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.640
So just as I read it, that felt awkward.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.977
It felt like I said more
than I needed to say.

00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:15.980
"Up to as high as 30 miles per hour."

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.290
Not even looking at the
choices, if I were to write this

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.670
in a more concise way,
in a kind of a cleaner,

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.787
more efficient way, I would say,

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:23.977
"new solar-powered bicycle can

00:00:23.977 --> 00:00:27.870
"reach speeds of up to 30 miles per hour."

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.230
I don't even have to write "as
high as 30 miles per hour."

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.060
So let's see what our choices are.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.990
So, I already said I
definitely want to change it.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:36.790
So I'm not gonna pick "no change."

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.157
And just replacing this with

00:00:38.157 --> 00:00:42.000
"up to" isn't one of these choices.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.070
So I'm gonna have to look

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.757
a little bit more closely at these.

00:00:44.757 --> 00:00:49.157
"A new solar-powered
bicycle can reach speeds of

00:00:49.157 --> 00:00:53.630
"upwards and close to 30 miles per hour."

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.590
This also feels very bulky,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.300
way more words than I need to use.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.690
And it also doesn't make a lot of sense

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.160
to be "upwards and close to."

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.500
I mean, are they think upwards of

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.340
30 miles per hour and also close to?

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.430
It feels like a very strange phrasing,

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.967
and definitely using more
words than I need to use.

00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:12.907
"A new solar-powered
bicycle can reach speeds of

00:01:12.907 --> 00:01:16.230
"nearly 30 miles per hour."

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.280
Yeah, I like that.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.870
It's actually, in some
ways it's more concise.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.270
And actually it's one word versus

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.260
two words that I had right over here.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.870
So I like that, "nearly."

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.360
That's very clean, very concise,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.357
really straight to the
point, easy to read.

00:01:29.357 --> 00:01:31.567
"A new solar-powered
bicycle can reach speeds of

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:34.090
"nearly 30 miles per hour."

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.780
And then over here, the last choice,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.660
you have "nearly as high as."

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.100
So once again this feels very bulky.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.190
It's using more words than I need to use.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.270
When I can just use "nearly,"

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.630
why would I use "nearly as high as?"

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.033
So I would rule that one out as well.
