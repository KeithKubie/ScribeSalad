JONATHAN ALFERNESS:
I'm Jonathan Alferness.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.180
I lead up our mobile display
ads products at Google,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:11.900
and I have Russ
Ketchum with me here.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.720
Russ is on the Google
Analytics team.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.800
We've been doing an
awful lot of work

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.110
across Google to make
game development as

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.690
easy as possible for all of you.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.500
You've heard of a
lot of great things

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.460
already about how
we're taking a lot

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.730
of the mundane, everyday
work out of what you're

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.010
doing, trying to
enable all of you

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.120
guys to focus on what's
really important, right?

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.474
Creating these amazing games
and getting them out there.

00:00:35.474 --> 00:00:37.140
We're going to spend
the next 30 minutes

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.220
or so talking about
some of the advancements

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.610
that we're delivering in
AdMob across a whole variety

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.190
of different tools to, again,
minimize the pain that you

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.720
guys have to deal with
in terms of monetizing

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.940
your applications.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.060
An awful lot to talk about,
so let's get started.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.732
So AdMob and game developers
goes back a long, long time.

00:00:54.732 --> 00:00:56.940
I've been working with AdMob
for the last three years

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.060
or so, Google has owned AdMob
for the last four years,

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.250
but going even further
back than that,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.270
AdMob and game
developers have had

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.114
a long-lasting relationship.

00:01:10.114 --> 00:01:11.530
The other thing
that's really nice

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.640
here is that advertisers love
reaching out and engaging

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.822
with users in these types
of environments, right?

00:01:17.822 --> 00:01:19.280
You guys build
these amazing games,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.040
you know how immersed
these users are.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.690
And advertisers having
access to this audience

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.520
has really been a great
partnership as well.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.590
Over the course of
the last few years,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.540
in general, we've been
delivering about 50%

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.440
of the revenue generated
through AdMob, through Google's

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.850
in-app advertising suite has
flown to game developers.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.010
So that's a phenomenal
way that game developers

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.910
have been able to
continue to monetize,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.590
to continue to create these
phenomenal experiences.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.580
But we're all here talking today
because this industry keeps

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.930
marching forward, and
it keeps changing out

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.290
from underneath us, right?

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.720
And in fact, even though by the
end of this year, more than $18

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.080
billion will flow through
mobile advertising systems,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.870
we understand that the mobile
app and the game economy

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.797
is changing as we speak.

00:02:08.797 --> 00:02:10.380
In fact, Bob was up
here and talked us

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.970
through example, example,
example, about how all of this

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.030
is changing right out
from underneath us.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.460
Let's talk about at
least three factors here

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.150
that we're adapting to
at Google and at AdMob.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.480
The first is users.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.270
Users are clearly voting
with their fingers.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.220
These are touch devices
after all, so that works.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.290
And in fact, Bob's
example showing you

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.310
where we went from a
$0.99 game to a free game

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.660
with in-app purchase, and
how that spiked installs,

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.570
is a great example for
how users are voting.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:43.650
Users are voting to actually
download and install

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.600
free games-- freemium
games-- well more

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.900
than they are premium games.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.320
That's the first shift that
we're seeing in the market.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.860
The second is from a
revenue perspective.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.940
Anybody out there who's
employing in-app purchases

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.980
in their games
understands this, right?

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.610
The amount of revenue
that's being generated

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.660
through in-game
purchases is soaring.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.590
And this has come on rather
quickly, and in some extremes,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.030
it's making up as
much as 90% or more

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.285
of a game developer's revenue.

00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:13.910
That's a very important
fact, and we're

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.070
going to come back
to that in a second.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.580
And the third thing
is developers.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.280
I remember when I first took on
the AdMob business at Google,

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.910
and I was rather
surprised whenever

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.500
I would talk to my
publishers or my advertisers.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.650
It was all about, just
get me as many installs

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.557
as you possibly
can, I don't care.

00:03:31.557 --> 00:03:33.390
Get me as many installs
as you possibly can,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.930
as cheap as humanly possible.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.870
And here I'm scratching
my head, having

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.750
worked on online advertising
my whole life, and said, well,

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.350
but doesn't it matter what
kind of users you install?

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.270
I mean, after all, you want
to get value out of the users

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.710
that you're paying to install.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.120
And that has been a
fundamental shift,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.380
I'd say, in the last two years.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.280
The shades have been pulled
back from people's eyes.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.130
And as developers,
you all understand

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.310
that it's the types of
users that you acquire

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.580
that are fundamental to
the types of experiences

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.360
that you build, and how
well that game can monetize.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.680
We're going to talk a lot
about that user's piece

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.980
as well as we keep
moving forward.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.750
So we've invested a ton
in this ecosystem already,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.350
but it's just the beginning.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.120
So again in 2010,
Google acquired AdMob.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.215
It took us a little
while, but by 2012, we

00:04:20.215 --> 00:04:23.110
had already plugged all of
those AdMob app developers--

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.660
largely game developers--
into the vast, million plus

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.510
advertisers that we have
on the AdWords platform.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.120
And we continued
these integrations

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.820
over the last couple
of years as well,

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.080
so that AdMob is now an integral
part of the Google advertising

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.350
ecosystem with AdWords, with
our display ads products.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.180
And at the end of last
year, at the end of 2013,

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.010
we re-launched the AdMob
publisher platform,

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:48.580
now sitting on top of Google
hardware, Google software,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.790
and Google data centers.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:53.050
And it has opened up
the door so that we

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.090
can continue to innovate
and produce and create

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.790
more tools for you
guys, moving forward.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:01.080
It's nice to sort of think
that a lot of this mundane work

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.790
is behind me and the team.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.320
Now that we're on
these platforms,

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.214
we can innovate
even more quickly.

00:05:06.214 --> 00:05:08.130
So we're going to talk
you through the future.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.360
2014 is where we're
starting to release

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.810
some of these new features.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.690
We're going to talk
more about those now.

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.080
But you can think about AdMob
as being the app developer

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.550
platform across Google.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.660
Where we're going to connect you
not just to monetization tools,

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.510
but to all of the
tools that you guys

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.690
need to succeed as
game developers.

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.310
Again, we're trying to take as
much of this work away from you

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:30.476
guys as possible-- you're
certainly welcome to do it

00:05:30.476 --> 00:05:33.500
if you'd like-- so that you can
focus on creating these truly

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.405
phenomenal games.

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:41.700
So we're going to talk about
three specific areas here.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.899
And this lines up-- at
least it should line up--

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:45.940
with what we're seeing in
the industry right now.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.830
The first is how important it
is to understand your audience.

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.900
We're going to give
you tools to do this.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.430
A lot of this comes
back to the fact

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.320
that different users engage in
your games in different ways.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.050
Understanding the
value of your users

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.010
is critical to being able to
optimize those experiences.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.570
And it's also
critical to understand

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.090
how to segment your audience
into individual populations

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.400
such that you can take different
action on those populations.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.900
Because of the importance
of in-app revenue,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.570
we're doing a ton to
help you guys focus,

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:18.650
and maximize, and grow
this in-app revenue.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.760
And it depends on understanding
who those users are,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.430
and these two features are
going to be very nicely coupled

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.160
together.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.530
And last, it is all
about maximizing revenue

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.419
across the spectrum.

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:32.960
You guys want to
make sure you're not

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.699
leaving any money on the table.

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.990
Such that you can continue
to pour these resources back

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:38.189
into developing great games.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.480
And we're going to talk you
through how to do that, not

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.420
just with Google demand sources,
but also across a variety

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.219
of third party ad
networks as well.

00:06:46.219 --> 00:06:47.760
So at Google we've
been working hard,

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.980
not just on the AdMob team, but
with a whole suite of partners.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:54.230
Most importantly, with our
Google Analytics friends

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:58.361
and partners, to do a truly
phenomenal integration.

00:06:58.361 --> 00:06:59.860
I'd like to bring
Russell Ketchum up

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.880
on stage to talk us
through that first piece.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.171
Russ, why don't you come on up?

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.640
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.015
RUSSELL KETCHUM:
Thanks Jonathan.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.000
So yeah.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.190
As Jonathan just introduced
me, I'm Russ Ketchum.

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:16.190
I'm the lead product manager
for Google Analytics for apps,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.890
and also Google Tag Manager.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.770
But I'm here with
the AdMob team today,

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.970
because I get to really
announce something

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.600
that both of our teams
are really excited about

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.110
and that we've had to be quiet
about for a little too long.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:31.574
So today I get to take the
wraps off a new version of AdMob

00:07:31.574 --> 00:07:33.990
that we're going to be rolling
out here in the next couple

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:38.240
weeks, that introduces Google
Analytics and AdMob as one

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.220
seamless experience.

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.180
So the result is, we're
committing to AdMob becoming

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.650
this single
destination at Google

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.000
for cross-platform developers,
monetization, promotion,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.164
and now analytics needs.

00:07:51.164 --> 00:07:53.080
So something I want to
just kind of highlight,

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.800
right from the
beginning, is this

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.560
isn't a light-weight
version of Google Analytics,

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.350
or a handful of reports.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.480
This is everything
that Google Analytics

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.950
has built for app developers,
fully available inside AdMob.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.880
If you're already one of
the developers using AdMob--

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.860
or I'm sorry, using
Google Analytics-- we

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.900
have hundreds of thousands of
apps on both iOS and Android

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.370
who are doing it-- this
is your new best place

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:22.940
to access your Google
Analytics data.

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.610
And so why are we doing this?

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:29.050
It's not just about making
reports easier to get to.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.730
I mean, of course, that's nice.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.679
But it's actually
not just something

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:35.230
that's a nice-to-have for
developers at this point,

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.549
it's a requirement.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.429
You need to have
your rich in-app user

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.250
data at your fingertips
at all times.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.000
So you need to be
able to quickly glean

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.360
insights about your users, and
then take action about them.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.660
And so that's why Google
Analytics is now in AdMob.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.069
So I want to
highlight just the tip

00:08:53.069 --> 00:08:54.610
of the iceberg and
some functionality

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.260
that I'm going to
preview now, we're

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.010
going to hear more
about it from Jonathan,

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:00.490
and then we have two
different sessions on Google

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.354
Analytics this afternoon,
starting at 2:30,

00:09:02.354 --> 00:09:04.270
that I would invite
everybody to come back to,

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.380
that really goes into detail.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.680
But as a preview, what we're
looking to do with Google

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.970
Analytics can be seen through
our user segmentation engine--

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:13.790
our audience
segmentation engine.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:16.750
So Google Analytics has
incredibly robust segmentation

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:17.250
ability.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.100
In fact, you can create
over a thousand segments

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:21.580
for an individual app.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.270
And when you do that, you can
fully describe your user base.

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:27.250
You can compare one group
of users to another,

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.750
you can see what
makes them similar,

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.550
what makes them different, and
really what makes them tick.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.490
And what you want
to do, is you want

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:36.470
to use this data to take
action when it matters.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.010
And like I said, we've
got a bunch of stuff

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:40.690
we'll be previewing
this afternoon that

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.240
shows you how to do that.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.300
But for now, I want
to really stress

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.160
how easy it is for
you to get going

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.170
with Google Analytics in AdMob.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.270
So I'm going to jump to just
a series of slides that talks

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:52.740
as through that.

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.460
So just to get
everybody oriented,

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.250
this is what AdMob
looks like today.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.210
And you can see the three main
tabs there across the top.

00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.280
Where you have Home,
Monetize, and Promote.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.260
So in just a few
weeks, we're going

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.670
to be unveiling the Analyze tab.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.060
And so this is really the
face of Google Analytics

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.792
inside AdMob.

00:10:11.792 --> 00:10:13.250
And so what I'm
going to do is just

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:15.050
step you through the
process to get started

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:16.546
with Analytics for
the first time.

00:10:16.546 --> 00:10:18.170
So there's two ways,
I can start either

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:19.810
just by clicking
on the Analyze tab,

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.768
or that promotional
message you're seeing there

00:10:21.768 --> 00:10:26.069
at the top right,
and once I do--

00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:27.610
and once the screen
changes, there we

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.800
go-- I'm taken to
the sign-up page.

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.310
We've taken the entire
Google Analytics sign-up

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:35.440
and have reduced
it to two steps.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.220
So all of the key informations
here-- Google Analytics

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.110
is really well known for its
data-sharing policies, the fact

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.449
that we give developers
ownership of their data,

00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:45.740
and they can choose then to
share that back with Google

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.990
at different features--
that's all here.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.140
If you're using Google
Analytics already,

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.780
you can go ahead and link to
an existing account right here.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.890
But if you're not,
with just one click,

00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:57.450
you can go ahead and accept
the terms of service,

00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.580
and you get a quick
set of instructions

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:02.020
about what to do next.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:04.550
And it's really quick,
it's really just one line.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:08.460
Once you continue, you
land on this next page.

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.050
And this is the
app set-up screen.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.760
This gives you
everything you need

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.406
to use Google Analytics in
your app from one screen.

00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:16.030
You see it automatically
the first time

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:17.821
and it's always available
from our left nav

00:11:17.821 --> 00:11:19.260
from that point forward.

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.640
So from here you can
download the SDKs,

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.724
you can download our
easy-to-use developer guides,

00:11:23.724 --> 00:11:25.556
and of course, your
tracking IDs that you're

00:11:25.556 --> 00:11:27.154
going to use in your
individual apps.

00:11:27.154 --> 00:11:28.570
And with that
information, you can

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.490
start monitoring
your in-app user

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.989
behavior in about five minutes.

00:11:31.989 --> 00:11:34.530
That's how quick it is to get
going with the Google Analytics

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.720
SDKs.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.250
So once I've done that, this
is really the heart of it.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:42.960
So this is Google Analytics
reporting inside AdMob.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.040
From this point
forward, whenever

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.560
I click the Analyze tab,
I'm taken right here.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.730
At the top left, you
have an app picker.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.710
I mean, Google Analytics is a
very robust digital analytics

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.121
platform, you can
track websites,

00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:56.620
you can track really
anything thanks

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.770
to our universal
analytics platform.

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:01.940
But with this, we're putting
the focus entirely on apps.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.060
So that drop down menu
you can kind of make out

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.470
of the top left, that gives
you all of your AdMob apps.

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:09.010
And you can easily just
switch from one to another.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.620
There's also a brand-new feature
for Google Analytics in here,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:15.390
as well, that allows you to
report across all of your apps.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:17.292
And that reporting,
that set-up, is all

00:12:17.292 --> 00:12:19.500
taken care of automatically
just through that process

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.780
I stepped through.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:23.620
So here we're looking at
our app overview report.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.460
This is the basic view
in Google Analytics.

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.760
There's literally dozens
and dozens of other reports

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.719
there in the side nav.

00:12:28.719 --> 00:12:30.260
I'm not going to go
through them now,

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:34.030
but that's what we have the
sessions for later today.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.290
So to bring it back full
circle, we find ourselves back

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:39.480
on the AdMob Home tab.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.340
So Analyze is here,
and you'll notice

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.820
at the left, where there
was a promotional message,

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.060
and there were only two
columns of metrics below it,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.640
we're now seeing all of our
key Google Analytics metrics

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.880
brought together in
one single place.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.710
It's a true cross
product and cross-app

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:55.260
dashboard for the first time.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:56.830
And we're pretty excited.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:59.910
You guys excited?

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.540
You guys sound lukewarm, but
we're going to get you there.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.726
So I'm going to invite
Jonathan back up

00:13:04.726 --> 00:13:06.350
to actually talk
about how we can start

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.260
using some of this
data in context.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:09.887
Thanks.

00:13:09.887 --> 00:13:11.220
JONATHAN ALFERNESS: Thanks Russ.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.770
That was awesome, man.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:14.290
This is great,
we've been excited

00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.530
about this for a long time.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:18.950
And again, it's about a
comprehensive package.

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.967
It's not just about
monetizing across the board,

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:24.050
and making everything feel
the same for all users.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.466
What we've learned
at Google, what

00:13:25.466 --> 00:13:27.350
I know you guys know
as well, is that it's

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.620
really critical to understand
these users at the user level,

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.120
right?

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.380
Break them into buckets.

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:33.780
Break them into
audiences, and be

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:35.600
able to do things
differently with that.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.714
Google Analytics takes us
so far in that direction

00:13:39.714 --> 00:13:41.255
and I am sure that
you guys are going

00:13:41.255 --> 00:13:44.770
to unlock all kinds of
magic with this integration.

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:46.760
We couldn't be more
excited about what

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.660
we're talking about here today.

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.680
Let's move on.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.460
Let's talk about that the
next big announcement.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.660
And that forms around
in-app purchase.

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.920
There's a conundrum here.

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.830
There's a problem.

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.090
And you'll see the
lead-in and why analytics

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.100
is so important in
a second, right?

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:07.050
Anybody who has in-app
purchases in a game,

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.940
understands that the
vast majority of users

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.470
are not paying for
these purchases.

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:13.410
It's rather odd, it's
a very small percentage

00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:16.970
of users who likes to purchase
these elements in games.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.040
We ran a survey that
said about, well,

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.810
15% of users across
games, broadly,

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:26.650
are the users who are
actually purchasing in-game.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.130
We've certainly seen stats
and examples where that 15%

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.360
looks huge, where some games
it's as small as a percent,

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:36.640
or even less than
a percent of users,

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.880
who are not only the only users
making these in-app purchases,

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.750
but if you go back to the
amount of volume and revenue

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.540
that's coming through
in-app purchases.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:50.520
Those tiny slices of users
are the primary monetization

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.450
vehicles for these applications.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:55.859
So you've got maybe 5,
10, 15% of your users

00:14:55.859 --> 00:14:57.900
who you want to be able
to show in-app purchases,

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.265
because they will engage.

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:00.870
But what do you
do with the rest?

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:05.460
What do you do it the
other 85, 90, 99% of users?

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.330
Well, I think the
industry norm--

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:11.230
we have lots of examples like
this-- you segment your users.

00:15:11.230 --> 00:15:14.880
For those users who are going to
engage in an in-app purchases,

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:17.310
it's quite a good
experience for them.

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:20.460
Show them in-app promotions.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.940
But for the remaining
segment of users,

00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:24.730
it's sort of their
responsibility

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.610
to help you guys
monetize, as well.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:29.780
After all, they're playing
this game for free as well.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.565
And typically, what folks
have been doing more and more

00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:33.690
is they've been segmenting.

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:35.970
So that larger chunk
of users ends up

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.770
seeing in-game ads--
advertisements.

00:15:38.770 --> 00:15:41.410
And the world is working hard
at making the ads that show up

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.220
inside games, inside
applications, much,

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:43.850
much better.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:46.225
We'll talk a little bit about
what we're doing at Google.

00:15:46.225 --> 00:15:49.260
But think app promo, think
promotions for other games,

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.110
and things like that as well.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.950
Things that can actually be
very useful to those users.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:56.940
So what we're announcing here
is the ability to do this.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.630
Not just the segmentation
that Russ was talking about,

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.276
but the ability to act on that
segmentation inside AdMob.

00:16:03.276 --> 00:16:04.650
it's pretty fricking
cool, right?

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:06.358
So you'll be able to
segment these users,

00:16:06.358 --> 00:16:09.127
use business logic to help
understand the buckets,

00:16:09.127 --> 00:16:10.960
and then figure out
what you're going to do,

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.793
and what you're going
to serve to each user.

00:16:12.793 --> 00:16:14.916
Let's walk you
through an example.

00:16:14.916 --> 00:16:16.790
So first and foremost,
you need to find a way

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:21.054
to define who your "special"
or premium users are.

00:16:21.054 --> 00:16:23.470
And with Google Analytics, as
Russ just talked us through,

00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:24.626
this is a piece of cake.

00:16:24.626 --> 00:16:26.750
But we want to make it
easy, no matter what you do.

00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.320
So you can even do some
of this basic segmentation

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.000
through AdMob alone.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.830
In this case, we're going
to find our premium users,

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.790
and we're going to define these
premium users as folks who've

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.279
played the game in
the last 24 hours,

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:41.570
folks who've purchased in
the past-- you know they have

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.460
a propensity to purchase
again-- and in this case,

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.010
they're stuck on level 10.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:49.560
Well there's a great
opportunity to put a purchase

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.590
in front of this user.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:53.779
So let's talk about how
we'd actually do that.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:56.070
So the first thing that you
do is, once you've actually

00:16:56.070 --> 00:16:59.060
segmented your users as I said
before, the user's playing

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.840
the game, the user's going
to run into this fail mode,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.940
again, this is level
10, they've failed,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:05.990
they couldn't get through it.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:07.740
Now what do you do?

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.589
Now you use our in-app
purchase tools inside AdMob

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.230
to sell them the
item-- in this case,

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:14.410
we love our exploding
pixies-- they'll blow up

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.290
all the blocks on the
board on level 10,

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:18.560
and you'll get through this.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.329
And you'll also
make a lovely $1.99

00:17:21.329 --> 00:17:22.829
from these users
who've already been

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:25.810
shown to engage on these
in-app purchases in the past.

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:26.780
Great.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:28.799
So what do I do with
the rest of my users?

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.840
OK, well, they're going
to play the game as well.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.800
In this case, they fail.

00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:35.330
Could be anywhere, but in
this case it's level 10.

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.396
And we know that they don't
have that tendency to buy,

00:17:38.396 --> 00:17:39.770
so these guys have
been segmented

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:40.930
into the other bucket.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:43.690
And again, the in-app
purchase tools inside AdMob

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.790
allow us to show them ads.

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:49.180
Big, bold, beautiful--
in this case,

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.860
it's an app promotion ad-- it's
an interstitial, much like we

00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.930
showed in the previous case.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.030
For those of you out
there who don't know,

00:17:57.030 --> 00:18:00.270
interstitials really seem to be
growing, not just in popularity

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:03.500
with developers, like all
of you, but in popularity

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.420
with users as well.

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.480
At first, it seems a little
bit counterintuitive.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:10.320
Well shit, this ad's an awful
lot bigger than a banner ad,

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.800
how can users actually
like this experience more?

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:16.380
Well, banner ads tend to be
in the midst of game play.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.980
They tend to distract
users from what

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:22.160
they might be seeing as they're
immersed in these experiences.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.770
Interstitial ads line up very
similar to what we've all

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.410
grown accustomed
to with television.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.520
I watch 15 minutes
of television--

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.536
and if I don't have
TiVo-- I sit there

00:18:31.536 --> 00:18:33.410
and I watch about three
minutes of commercial

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:35.640
and then I go back to
the television, right?

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.390
Commercials are,
frankly, interstitials

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.900
and the nice thing
about it in-game,

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:41.240
and in-app is that
you can choose

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.060
where the interstitials show up.

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:45.330
So you can interrupt the
user at an appropriate time,

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.140
at this point, at
the end of the level.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:49.810
OK, if the user doesn't care
about this particular ad,

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:53.650
it is no problem for her to
simply close the interstitial,

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:57.195
but if they do, it's the right
time for an interruption.

00:18:57.195 --> 00:18:59.820
I just wanted to make sure I did
a shout-out for interstitials.

00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:01.780
Because we're pretty
excited about this,

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.220
both from a revenue perspective,
but also from a user

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.390
quality perspective.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.010
So that's our in-app
purchase work.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.130
And we're really excited,
again, to give you

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.480
guys the building blocks,
the frameworks that you need,

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.010
so that you don't have to build
this logic inside your apps,

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:16.480
inside your games.

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.140
Let us do this
hard work for you.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.190
OK, how many of you out
there actually do show ads

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:25.140
in your games?

00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.210
In-game advertising?

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.890
Advertising?

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:27.160
Yeah.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.390
Yeah.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.560
OK.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.350
So there's some of you.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.070
There's some others
who won't admit it.

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:32.236
How many of those, who have
their hands up, actually

00:19:32.236 --> 00:19:33.910
use more than a
single demand source?

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.220
More than one ad network?

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.040
Yeah, yeah.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:38.045
Just about all of you.

00:19:38.045 --> 00:19:39.570
You know this problem.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.110
And my guess is, you know
this problem very, very well.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.360
All the different ad networks
that you're bringing in,

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:45.780
they perform differently.

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.200
And unfortunately, it's not like
they just perform differently

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.340
and then they maintain
that constant performance

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:52.550
across time.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.000
That would make
life way too easy.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.460
These ad networks
perform differently given

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.520
time of day, day of week,
geography, et cetera.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.800
And if you're doing
everything that you possibly

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.350
can to make sure that
your monetizing in full,

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.050
you're constantly tweaking
this stack rank, the mediation,

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.494
the waterfall of all these
different ad networks.

00:20:12.494 --> 00:20:13.910
And if you're
really smart, you've

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:15.877
got different setups for
different geographies,

00:20:15.877 --> 00:20:18.210
different setups for different
games, god, I don't know,

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.960
different setups for
different times of the week.

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.950
It sounds like too much work.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:25.500
Especially to us at Google,
who've gotten really,

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.330
really good at being able
to automate this stuff

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.590
and maximize revenue.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:34.250
So the next feature that
we're announcing today,

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.900
is a substantial step to improve
the efficiency of ad network

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:40.280
optimization.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:45.310
Inside AdMob, we'll have a
new ad network optimization

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.230
feature.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:47.930
And what we're doing
is we're continuing

00:20:47.930 --> 00:20:50.080
to work with these
third party ad networks.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.750
We understand that
you're getting

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:53.980
different types of demand
through different networks

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.430
around the world.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:58.870
That the app economy
has not yet converged

00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.854
on things like ad exchanges
the way the desktop world has.

00:21:02.854 --> 00:21:04.270
So we're embracing
this, but we're

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.970
trying to do this in
a much smarter way.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:10.830
We've built a ton of
plug-ins, adapters, APIs,

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.830
so that we can go
and we can pull data

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.300
from these third party ad
networks as close to real time

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.010
as possible, while
balancing and managing

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.740
the trade-offs between our
systems and the ad network

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.390
systems.

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:25.660
But this gives us the ability to
constantly reorder and re-stack

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.500
this rank of ad networks
based on the trends

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:30.130
that we're seeing.

00:21:30.130 --> 00:21:32.170
And if you think
into the future,

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:34.650
Google's awfully good at
using machine learning

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.550
to be able to predict trends.

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:39.140
So we're working on bringing
that predictability into our ad

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:42.070
network optimization
algorithms, as well.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:45.890
So this is great, and given that
I have a number of static ad

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:47.720
networks that I'm
pulling in demand from,

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.230
at least my computer
science brain tells me,

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:52.430
this is about as
optimal as I can get,

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:55.210
until I go through
a single exchange.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.860
Except there's one other piece,
which is Google's demand.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.770
So Google has demand coming in
through AdWords, third parties,

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.705
a whole variety of
different demand sources.

00:22:02.705 --> 00:22:04.580
So what are we going to
do that, with respect

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.370
to these third
party ad networks?

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.372
So that's a feature that
we're calling Live CPM.

00:22:09.372 --> 00:22:11.330
It's pretty cool, if you
think about it, right?

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:14.930
We know before serving
the ad, at least what

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:16.680
we think each of
these ad networks

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:19.120
is going to return
in terms of value.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.760
We don't know for
sure whether or not

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.080
they're going to
actually have an ad,

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:24.920
but we know the
upper bound, roughly,

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.480
of what the value from each
ad network is going to be.

00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.750
Yet what we know with a
lot more precision, what

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:34.430
we know with 100% accuracy, is
what Google's demand sources

00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:37.600
can fill this impression with,
and what the value of that

00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.690
will be.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:42.270
So the Google demand
actually floats

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.000
through the lines of third
party ad networks here.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.010
And it gets plugged in at
exactly the right place.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.872
So if your top third
party ad network

00:22:50.872 --> 00:22:53.330
is going to monetize better
than that Google demand source,

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:53.830
fine.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:56.250
We'll go and we'll request
the ad from the top ad network

00:22:56.250 --> 00:22:57.750
and we'll show that one.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:00.850
If that ad network had no
ad, and the Google Live

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:03.520
CPM was the second one
in line, then we'll go

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.450
and we'll bring
that piece of Google

00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:08.390
demand in to fill
that impression.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:12.070
Again, it's a really
fundamental change.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:14.010
It enables optimization.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:17.662
It enables maximizing revenue,
without you guys sitting there,

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:19.370
calling up your friends,
OK, what are you

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.453
getting from ad network A?

00:23:20.453 --> 00:23:21.800
Oh shit, I was getting this.

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.910
What's their fill rate?

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.670
OK, what's the probability?

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:26.300
OK, I'm going to
put him here, him.

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:28.332
Just let us figure
this out for you.

00:23:28.332 --> 00:23:29.540
We're completely transparent.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.780
You'll see the data
that we're doing.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.290
We're not trying to play
any games behind the scenes.

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:36.550
But we're just trying to take
away one more piece of pain.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:38.880
And keep in mind, that
this Live CPM really

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.560
enables us to squeeze the
maximum value out of the system

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.920
by looking at the exact value
that Google's demand can offer

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.010
any impression, any
user that you have.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.340
It's pretty cool work.

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:54.600
In fact, we've had this in beta
now with a number of our game

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.170
developers, our app
developers, and some

00:23:57.170 --> 00:24:02.050
have seen as much as a
200% lift in revenue.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:05.410
Now you're not necessarily going
to get that across the board,

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.120
but I can guarantee you today,
that you're leaving money

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.070
on the table, that our new ad
network optimization features

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.710
will help you bring off and
reinvest into the great games

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:14.585
that you're building.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:18.930
So the last thing that I
want to announce today.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:22.960
It is a crazy
world that you guys

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.230
are helping create, and
innovate, and constantly

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:27.180
move forward.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.710
The trends are changing
at enormous speeds.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:34.351
And it's hard for
all of us to keep up.

00:24:34.351 --> 00:24:35.850
So at Google we've
worked incredibly

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.150
hard to deliver what we're
calling the App Developer

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:39.790
Business Kit.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:41.770
And this works for
app developers,

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:43.000
but also for game developers.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.374
We're talking
through the trends.

00:24:44.374 --> 00:24:46.470
A lot of what Bob was
up here talking about,

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.600
ahead of Russ and I,
are going to be in here.

00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.229
So trends, information
for you to use,

00:24:51.229 --> 00:24:53.020
for you to share with
your marketing teams,

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.110
for you to share
with your executives.

00:24:55.110 --> 00:24:57.360
As well as tips
and tricks for how

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.970
to think about
building, not only truly

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:04.390
engaging and
compelling experiences,

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.960
but the kit goes into a
lot more detail explaining

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.080
what we've glossed over
at high levels here,

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:13.120
so you know how to squeeze every
last dollar out of your app.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.870
So that you can be fully
maximizing the revenue

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:18.820
that you're getting, but
also keeping your users

00:25:18.820 --> 00:25:22.770
engaged, keeping them coming
back time and time again.

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.670
So that you can build not
just a successful single game,

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.780
but you can build an entire
empire, an entire enterprise

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.496
of games moving forward.

00:25:31.496 --> 00:25:33.370
We're really excited
about this, take a look.

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:38.120
It's live right now
on google.com/admob.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:41.080
Again, just to repeat, because
I know you guys have lunch,

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.130
and I know you've been
in here all morning.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:45.290
First and foremost,
we are giving you

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:48.450
tools to fundamentally
unlock insights

00:25:48.450 --> 00:25:53.170
and understand the users that
you have in your games today.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.850
And that is driven
by Google Analytics,

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:57.770
and Google Analytics
fully integrated

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.360
into our AdMob
publisher platform.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.760
Second, we're
going to enable you

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.800
to grow this great
in-app purchase

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.490
revenue that many of you
are already capitalizing on,

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.670
to leverage the
segmentation and the user

00:26:08.670 --> 00:26:10.700
understanding tools
from Google Analytics,

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.020
and bring that in
proper, so that you

00:26:13.020 --> 00:26:16.620
can do the right things for the
right users at the right time.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.330
And last, we're helping
you maximize your revenue

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:23.270
across both of these segments
of users, but also across Google

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:26.990
demand sources, and
third party ad networks,

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:30.267
to the fullest possible
at this point in time.

00:26:30.267 --> 00:26:32.600
Thank you guys so much, we're
really excited about this.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.810
We'll be hanging
around in the back

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.170
if you guys have questions.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.130
With that, really appreciate it.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:42.710
[APPLAUSE]
