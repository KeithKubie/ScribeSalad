00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.071
( intro music )

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:16.583 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:17.783
Good morning.

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:20.887
I hope it's all right to start
with a bit of controversy

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:24.223 line:0%
that we need to double
food production by 2050

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:26.825 line:0%
to feed the expected nine
billion people on the planet.

00:00:26.825 --> 00:00:29.261 line:0%
This is part of the
productionist ideology

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.865
that has driven the
agricultural frontier

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.933
into the world's
remaining forests.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.836
I dispute that we need to
double food production.

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:39.872
Indeed, we have to ask
ourselves the question,

00:00:39.872 --> 00:00:41.707
are we capable of it?

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.576
Yeah, I believe we are,

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:46.312
but at what cost
would that happen?

00:00:46.312 --> 00:00:49.348
At the moment, the main
way in which we are

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:51.116
increasing production globally,

00:00:51.116 --> 00:00:53.752
is to extend the
agricultural frontier,

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:56.389
and we have to remember
that food production

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.692
by taking over habitats and
turning it into our fields

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:01.961
is the single biggest
environmental impact

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:04.463
that humans have
had on the planet.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:06.266
Does that mean we should
stop growing food?

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.267
No.

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:08.734
Does it mean we
have to grow food

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.104
in more sensitive
ways and use that food

00:01:11.104 --> 00:01:15.074
that we do grow for what it
is which is embedded land,

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:17.176
embedded water,
embedded emissions,

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:19.746
embedded love and care.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:21.681
If we take that attitude,

00:01:21.681 --> 00:01:24.451
we don't need to double
food production by 2050

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.420
'cause we already grow
enough food on this planet

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.188
to feed 12 billion.

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:32.692
We need to use it more
carefully and waste less of it.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.795
Green beans, they've
come to symbolize for me

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:39.398
some of the stupidities
in the global food system,

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:42.302
but also some of the
great opportunities

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:45.471
that actually exist and how
easy it is to tackle them.

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:49.409
I started my food
waste campaign actually

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.843
back when I was 15.

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:53.545
I was collecting food waste
from my school kitchens,

00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:56.282
collecting these big yellow
buckets of swill, all the stuff

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:59.218
that my school friends had
turned their noses up at,

00:01:59.218 --> 00:02:00.720
and I fed them to my pigs.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.590
I went to the local baker,
and green grocer and markets,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.392
and also to a farmer who
was throwing away potatoes

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:09.662
that were wrong shape or
size for the supermarkets.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:10.963
That was great.

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:12.231
My pigs loved it.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.600
They squealed every time
I came back from school

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.036
with these yellow buckets.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:18.637
It was a very happy time.

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:19.906
My dad was growing vegetables,

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:21.073
and I had chickens.

00:02:21.073 --> 00:02:23.876
I swapped manure
for his offcuts

00:02:23.876 --> 00:02:25.611
from the vegetables
in his garden,

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:26.845
and it was a great system.

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:28.280
But most of the food
that I was collecting

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.916
was fit for human consumption,

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.218
and I knew I was just
scraping the surface.

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:34.686
I went on to start eating
a lot of this food myself,

00:02:34.686 --> 00:02:37.456
good fresh food out of dumpsters

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:38.657
round the back of
the supermarkets.

00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:40.293
I talked to those
supermarkets about

00:02:40.293 --> 00:02:41.861
the food they were
putting in bins,

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:44.130
and couldn't they give
it to homeless charities?

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.165
Couldn't they sell it to their
customers for half price?

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:48.334
Even give it away
for free, do anything

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:51.036
but lock it in bins and send
it off to landfill sites.

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:53.839
They didn't want to
talk to me at that time.

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:57.176
So I started taking
things into my own hands,

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:59.913
taking them home and
eating that stuff.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.881
I did it as a way
of demonstrating

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.716
that if someone like me who
can perfectly well afford

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:06.285
to buy food can
live off dumpsters,

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.420
something was very
wrong with the system.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.790
I started taking
journalists, TV cameras

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.625
round the back of
supermarkets showing them

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:15.261
the sheer quantity of
food being put in there,

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:18.297
and that a lot of it was
still within its date.

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:20.733
Those dates themselves
were suspect.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:24.236
So that really kicked off an
awareness-raising campaign.

00:03:24.236 --> 00:03:26.372
We got a lot of press for that,

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:28.808
and it started this dialogue

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:30.175
first of all in
the United Kingdom,

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:32.845
and then increasingly
in other countries.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:36.081
I eventually got round
to writing my second book

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:39.218
which was "The Waste:
Uncovering the
Global Food Scandal",

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:42.421
and I realized when
I and went and did

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.223
the global research, I
went around the world,

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:45.958
I went up and down
the supply chain,

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.493
that actually that
stuff from the back

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:49.928
of the dumpsters, that was
the tip of the iceberg.

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:52.031
And, in fact, most
of the food waste

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.667
that is occurring was further
up in the supply chain,

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.269
and principally on farms.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.807
So when in 2013 we were
invited by the United Nations

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:04.376
Environment Program
to bring our positive

00:04:04.376 --> 00:04:08.547
win-win solution promoting
campaigns to Kenya,

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:11.918
our challenge was to feed
the 500 environment ministers

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:16.488
and U.N. delegates in
Nairobi with food waste

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:18.424
sourced in Kenya.

00:04:18.424 --> 00:04:20.626
Now you think, "Wow,
there are millions

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:21.994
of hungry people
in that country.

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:23.629
Surely, they're not
wasting food like

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.664
we are in the rest
of the world."

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:28.835
Sadly, we found that they are.

00:04:28.835 --> 00:04:32.104
Not because of neglect or
because they don't care,

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:34.706
but because of first
of all infrastructure

00:04:34.706 --> 00:04:37.277
and the lack of it on
small holder farms,

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:39.812
and secondly, and this is
where the beans come in,

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:42.581
the buying practices of
European supermarkets

00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:44.383
who source their
horticultural products

00:04:44.383 --> 00:04:45.484
from those countries.

00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:46.719
It's a boom industry,

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.655
and a lot of people are
making a lot of money

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:51.658
in good ways growing good food.

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:55.528
I'm going to bring your
attention to the word trimmed

00:04:55.528 --> 00:04:57.196
in this photograph.

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:00.666
You will notice, if anyone
who has grown beans,

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:02.434
that these beans
have been trimmed

00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:05.170
not where they taper at the end

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.539
where they're getting
a bit thinner,

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:08.975
but right in the
middle of the bean.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:12.544
That's because beans grow in
lots of different lengths,

00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:16.181
and yet this plastic
carton is one length.

00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:19.418
To get them into
these plastic cartons,

00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:21.687
they're trimming the beans off,

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:23.790
sometimes 30 percent
of the bean off.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.859
I visited farmers who were
wasting 30 to 40 percent

00:05:26.859 --> 00:05:28.294
of the food they grow.

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:30.830
That's 30 to 40 percent
of the land and the water

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.465
used to grow that food

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:34.833
in a country where people
are going without land,

00:05:34.833 --> 00:05:36.769
shifting their
agriculture further up

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:39.105
into the mountains,
chopping down more trees,

00:05:39.105 --> 00:05:41.741
causing interruptions of
the hydrological cycle.

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:45.711
I visited depots
exporting beans to Europe

00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:48.681
who were wasting 20
tons a day at least

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:49.882
of good fresh food.

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:52.451
All of that I would
have been very proud

00:05:52.451 --> 00:05:54.720
to grow on my own allotment,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.921
but they're wasting it,

00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:57.823
and the contractors who
come and collect this waste

00:05:57.823 --> 00:05:59.024
to feed to cattle

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:01.327
have to sign a contract
saying that they won't feed

00:06:01.327 --> 00:06:02.895
any of this food to people.

00:06:02.895 --> 00:06:05.031
That's a crime.

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.699
We took this evidence to
some of the supermarkets

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.402
who were implicated
in this supply chain,

00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:12.938
and we showed them
what we had seen.

00:06:12.938 --> 00:06:15.508
They undertook to change their
policies over that night.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:18.177
They knew how embarrassing
it was going to be

00:06:18.177 --> 00:06:20.913
if this kind of thing
got to their consumers.

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:22.881
We'd also talked
to the supermarkets

00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:24.884
about the bananas they
were going to waste.

00:06:24.884 --> 00:06:27.719
Again, cosmetic standards.

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:29.621
Bananas, when you go into a shop

00:06:29.621 --> 00:06:31.190
they're all in perfect bunches,

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.391
they're all the same size,

00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.126
they've all got exactly
the same curvature.

00:06:34.126 --> 00:06:35.761
They're the same diameter.

00:06:35.761 --> 00:06:37.530
Bananas don't grow like that.

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.965
In order to achieve
that uniformity,

00:06:39.965 --> 00:06:42.501
all the ones that don't
comply get discarded.

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.171
This is the waste of
one banana plantation

00:06:45.171 --> 00:06:47.873
after one day of
harvest in Ecuador.

00:06:47.873 --> 00:06:50.810
Bananas being wasted
in Costa Rica.

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:55.480
When I first visited a carrot
production unit in England,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:57.215
I remember going into the yard

00:06:57.215 --> 00:06:58.484
and seeing this great big bin,

00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:00.953
a little bit like this
one, full of carrots.

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:02.921
I said, "Oh, these must
be your premium carrots

00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:04.723
going to the supermarkets."

00:07:04.723 --> 00:07:07.159
"No, these are the waste ones."

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:09.896
"Why? What's wrong
with these carrots?

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:12.297
They're better than any
carrots I've ever grown."

00:07:12.297 --> 00:07:13.899
He held it up to the light,

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:16.168
and he said, "You can see
there's a slight
curvature there,

00:07:16.168 --> 00:07:18.737
and the supermarket we're
supplying doesn't allow that.

00:07:18.737 --> 00:07:20.706
They have to be
perfectly straight."

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:23.275
These ones, you can see,
are perfectly straight,

00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:26.245
but they're too long to
fit into the containers,

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.780
and they're being discarded.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.782
The very best fate that
some of these carrots get

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:30.916
is to be fed to livestock.

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:32.718
That's a sub-optimal
use of resources

00:07:32.718 --> 00:07:34.554
to put it mildly.

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:39.091
Go one step down
the supply chain

00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:40.192
to the manufacturers.

00:07:40.192 --> 00:07:42.128
When you buy that
loaf of sliced bread,

00:07:42.128 --> 00:07:44.796
I want a show of hands
who lives in a household

00:07:44.796 --> 00:07:48.734
where somebody eats the first
and last slice of the loaf?

00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:51.136
Most people.

00:07:51.136 --> 00:07:53.872
But when you go to a
supermarket or Pret a Manger,

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:55.774
or one of the other
shops that provide you

00:07:55.774 --> 00:07:57.343
with these sandwiches
that are ready-made

00:07:57.343 --> 00:07:58.744
and very often delicious,

00:07:58.744 --> 00:07:59.945
saves you a lot of hassle.

00:07:59.945 --> 00:08:01.814
I mean, making a
sandwich is pretty tricky

00:08:01.814 --> 00:08:02.948
to do at home, right?

00:08:02.948 --> 00:08:03.983
( audience laughter )

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:07.486
Okay, have you ever seen
one of those sandwiches

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:09.188
with a crust on it?

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:13.559
So, I kept on thinking what
happens to all these crusts?

00:08:13.559 --> 00:08:14.860
( audience laughter )

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.262
Surely, they turn
them into bread crumbs

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:17.663
or some other thing.

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:19.264
We've come up with
loads of different ways

00:08:19.264 --> 00:08:20.799
of using odds and ends of bread,

00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:22.301
and in our traditional cuisines.

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:24.637
Do you eat bread and butter
pudding in the States?

00:08:24.637 --> 00:08:27.506
We have a lovely dessert
with raisins and cream.

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:29.508
Anyway, there's lots of things
you can do with this bread

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:32.077
so I assumed the
industrial, efficient

00:08:32.077 --> 00:08:34.447
production systems had
come up with something.

00:08:34.447 --> 00:08:36.415
Unfortunately, I found
that wasn't the case.

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:40.118
13,000 slices of fresh
bread being discarded

00:08:40.118 --> 00:08:42.922
from a single factory every day.

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.990
Multiply that out to all
the other sandwich factories

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:46.459
that exist in the world.

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:49.996
17 percent of every loaf
going into this factory

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:51.296
was being lost,

00:08:51.296 --> 00:08:53.666
17 percent of the fields
growing that wheat.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.501
You may as well pick
them up into space

00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:57.102
and chuck them away 'cause
that's what we're doing

00:08:57.102 --> 00:08:58.871
when we chuck away this food.

00:09:01.606 --> 00:09:03.608
So we set about
campaigning about this.

00:09:03.608 --> 00:09:05.411
First of all, I wrote my book,

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:07.512
and that exposed
the global figures.

00:09:07.512 --> 00:09:13.552
I knew that 350 pages of
densely-argued, data-rich book

00:09:13.552 --> 00:09:15.454
was only going to
reach a certain sector

00:09:15.454 --> 00:09:16.422
of the population,

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:18.123
an important sector, the
ones making decisions,

00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:20.992
but I knew I had to take
this message to the millions,

00:09:20.992 --> 00:09:23.262
high-profile,
public-facing campaigns.

00:09:23.262 --> 00:09:25.264
I'd always fed
myself out of waste.

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:27.767
I thought, "What would it
be like to feed 5,000 people

00:09:27.767 --> 00:09:28.967
out of waste?

00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:30.602
What would it be
like to bring together

00:09:30.602 --> 00:09:32.370
all the organizations
who have come up

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.772
with solutions to this problem

00:09:33.772 --> 00:09:35.708
whether it's redistribution
organizations,

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:37.476
campaigning organizations,

00:09:37.476 --> 00:09:40.713
people who like ugly
fruit and vegetables,

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:43.481
bring them all together, have
a massive festival, ( laughter )

00:09:43.481 --> 00:09:45.184
get loads of press attention,

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:46.418
get this into the press."

00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:48.454
That is going to change
the minds of the CEOs

00:09:48.454 --> 00:09:50.822
who make decisions about what
ugly fruit and vegetables

00:09:50.822 --> 00:09:52.324
should look like.

00:09:52.324 --> 00:09:55.261
Since then, we've come up
with a lot of great formats.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.497
Disco Soup was something
we first tried in 2012

00:09:58.497 --> 00:10:00.900
in Paris at our Feeding
The 5,000 Event,

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:04.069
and we had 2,000 people in
front of the Hotel de Ville

00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:07.573
dancing in the rain
whilst chopping all these

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:09.241
ugly fruit and vegetables
and turning them

00:10:09.241 --> 00:10:11.277
into fruit salad and salad.

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:12.477
It got a lot of attention,

00:10:12.477 --> 00:10:14.279
and Disco Soup since
then has become a format

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:15.748
that's spread around the world.

00:10:15.748 --> 00:10:18.150
I'll give you a taste
of what it feels like

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.719
to be at one of our events.

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:23.722
( piano music )

00:10:23.722 --> 00:10:25.090
(Event's host):
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:27.726
Big Ben is sounding 12 o'clock.

00:10:27.726 --> 00:10:30.796
Welcome to Feeding The 5,000!

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.302
Well, Feeding The 5,000
is about a really good

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:38.304
partnership between a
number of organizations

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.339
to really try and raise
awareness of the issue

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.908
of food waste both
from retailers,

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:45.645
from consumers, from a
whole range of people.

00:10:47.613 --> 00:10:50.516
(Event's host): We want
to feed 5,000 people,

00:10:50.516 --> 00:10:53.585
but we also want to
feed you with food

00:10:53.585 --> 00:10:56.154
that would otherwise be wasted.

00:10:56.154 --> 00:10:57.757
The food that you're
being offered today

00:10:57.757 --> 00:11:00.226
is stuff that goes
into landfills.

00:11:00.226 --> 00:11:02.261
It's perfectly acceptable.

00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:04.430
It's good grub, but
what we have got

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:06.431
is we've got stuff that
the supermarkets say no to,

00:11:06.431 --> 00:11:07.866
and consumers say no to.

00:11:07.866 --> 00:11:10.936
In this country, we
waste so much surplus,

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:14.206
fit-for-consumption food, and
it should be going to people.

00:11:16.474 --> 00:11:18.109
With our population increase,

00:11:18.109 --> 00:11:21.813
we're getting to the point that
food waste, it's ridiculous

00:11:21.813 --> 00:11:23.148
especially in the U.K.

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:25.417
Yeah, hopefully things like
this will raise awareness

00:11:25.417 --> 00:11:27.286
and stop food waste
in the future.

00:11:29.654 --> 00:11:31.356
Friends of the Earth
are here to demonstrate

00:11:31.356 --> 00:11:33.325
how much food that can't
be used for humans,

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:34.660
can be used for animals.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:36.228
So we've got some
live pigs that we're

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:38.897
actually feeding the waste
from apple pressing today.

00:11:38.897 --> 00:11:40.099
The visitors here today

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:42.267
are going to drink
the apple juice,

00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:43.969
and then the pressed apples
are actually being fed

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:45.470
to our pigs as well.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.873
So it there to demonstrate
a much more efficient way

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:50.276
of using food so it
doesn't go to waste.

00:11:50.276 --> 00:11:52.711
60 million tons of
food waste are being

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:55.146
thrown away every year.

00:11:55.146 --> 00:11:56.782
For the average
family, they could save

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:59.651
50 pounds a month simply
by making the most

00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:01.153
with the food they buy.

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:03.021
(Event's host): The vegetables
that are being used for lunch

00:12:03.021 --> 00:12:05.291
are mulch, all right?

00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.227
'Cause basically
there are issues,

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:10.629
but they are fresh
and very tasty.

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:15.167
All these carrots are not
suitable for supermarkets,

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:16.935
wrong size, wrong shape.

00:12:16.935 --> 00:12:18.737
So just highlighting
the unnecessary waste

00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:20.505
of food here today.

00:12:20.505 --> 00:12:23.241
Getting people to
help bag stuff up,

00:12:23.241 --> 00:12:25.978
and then we can deliver
it off to charities.

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:28.313
I've being a freegan
for 30 years.

00:12:28.313 --> 00:12:31.250
Such a crazy world that
we live in at the moment

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.118
with so much food wasted,

00:12:33.118 --> 00:12:37.589
and so much starvation in the
other parts of the planet.

00:12:37.589 --> 00:12:39.524
We need to all respond
to this by saying,

00:12:39.524 --> 00:12:41.693
"Look, the global
food waste scandal

00:12:41.693 --> 00:12:43.461
whereby we waste
a third of the entire

00:12:43.461 --> 00:12:46.966
world's food supply is
something that we can solve."

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:49.301
It's causing
environmental destruction.

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:51.035
It's contributing
to global hunger,

00:12:51.035 --> 00:12:52.771
but the solutions are delicious,

00:12:52.771 --> 00:12:55.540
and that involves
eating and enjoying food

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:57.042
rather than throwing it away.

00:12:58.343 --> 00:13:02.147
( applause )

00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:03.348
Thank you.

00:13:03.348 --> 00:13:06.652
They're great fun and,
moreover, they get

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:07.986
a lot of press.

00:13:07.986 --> 00:13:10.322
That is what puts
pressure on the companies

00:13:10.322 --> 00:13:12.157
and the governments who
can change the policies

00:13:12.157 --> 00:13:13.826
regarding food waste.

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:15.360
One of the lessons
that I learned

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.496
when I studied what was
happening with regard

00:13:17.496 --> 00:13:18.930
to food waste in America,

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.299
is you have gleaning networks.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.368
You have volunteers actually
going to these farms,

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:24.436
collecting some of
this reject produce

00:13:24.436 --> 00:13:25.804
and getting it to hungry people.

00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:27.439
No one was doing it in Europe

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:29.975
so instead of promoting another
organization's activities,

00:13:29.975 --> 00:13:31.609
we set it up ourself.

00:13:31.609 --> 00:13:32.978
Since then, it's been replicated

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.413
in other European countries,

00:13:34.413 --> 00:13:35.980
and we've been commissioned
by the European Commission

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.416
to take it to other countries.

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:39.952
It's a great way also of
getting the message out

00:13:39.952 --> 00:13:41.519
about the causes
of this food waste,

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:43.655
and what we can do to tackle it.

00:13:43.655 --> 00:13:47.459
I am really keen to
bring Feeding The 5,000

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:48.793
to the United States.

00:13:48.793 --> 00:13:50.228
We're in conversations
with a number

00:13:50.228 --> 00:13:52.197
of different organizations
who want to tell us

00:13:52.197 --> 00:13:54.599
what the priorities
here should be.

00:13:54.599 --> 00:13:57.102
Portion sizes are one of them.

00:13:57.102 --> 00:14:00.539
Portion sizes in the
United States are shocking.

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:02.574
( audience laughter )

00:14:02.574 --> 00:14:04.242
This is some global
data I generated

00:14:04.242 --> 00:14:06.077
when I wrote my book.

00:14:06.077 --> 00:14:09.781
What it shows is the food supply

00:14:09.781 --> 00:14:12.283
that is actually available
to every population

00:14:12.283 --> 00:14:14.753
in every country in the world.

00:14:14.753 --> 00:14:16.922
Essentially, to cut
a long story short,

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:19.024
it shows that in America

00:14:19.024 --> 00:14:22.361
there are twice as many
calories available to eat

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:24.062
as is actually required.

00:14:24.062 --> 00:14:26.798
That obviously is a
public health disaster.

00:14:26.798 --> 00:14:28.834
It's an environmental disaster,

00:14:28.834 --> 00:14:30.469
and it's a huge opportunity

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:32.237
'cause if we can
bring that down,

00:14:32.237 --> 00:14:34.272
we can bring down
the food footprint

00:14:34.272 --> 00:14:35.673
of the United States.

00:14:35.673 --> 00:14:38.277
We can bring down the
problems of obesity,

00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:40.545
and we can bring down
the environmental impact

00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:42.181
of food production

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:46.352
simply by avoiding
producing, selling, eating

00:14:46.352 --> 00:14:47.619
too much food.

00:14:47.619 --> 00:14:49.188
It's good for everyone.

00:14:49.188 --> 00:14:50.456
It saves money.

00:14:50.456 --> 00:14:52.558
It saves the planet.

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:56.261
I think that we can stop
wasting so much food,

00:14:56.261 --> 00:14:58.864
and it's going to be tasty.

00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:00.132
Thank you very much.

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:01.467
(applause)

00:15:01.467 --> 00:15:06.071
( outro music )
