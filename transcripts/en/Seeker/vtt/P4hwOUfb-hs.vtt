Hey DNews friends and family, as you know
if you've been around over the last few months,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.540
DNews got a rare look inside the Svalbard
Global Seed Vault -- well, surprise!

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.270
We not only shot old-fashioned two-dimensional
video in there, we also shot Virtual Reality.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.689
Now, on our sister channel SeekerDaily, you
can step inside the Svalbard Global Seed Vault

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:25.149
and feel what it's like to stand in a place
very,very few people get to see in person.

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:29.319
And while inside, you can learn about the
first ever withdrawal from the Doomsday Vault,

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:34.590
by Syrian seed banks whose crops were destroyed
by the Syrian Civil War, and ISIS.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.130
This is some serious science, on the front
line of the Syrian crisis.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:54.500
