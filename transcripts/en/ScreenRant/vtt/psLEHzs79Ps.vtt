Know Your Movies: 20 Amazing Movie Secrets
That Will Blow Your Mind #3.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.359
Mad Max: Fury Road
Actor Hugh Keays-Byrne had his face hidden

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.220
behind a mask as the villain of the Mad Max
reboot, but audiences were originally going

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.860
to see him play a superhero of a million faces,
as the Martian Manhunter in director George

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.090
Miller's cancelled DC Comics team-up, Justice
League Mortal.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.530
For editing Fury Road, George Miller turned
to his wife, editor Margaret Sixel, claiming

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.559
that if a man did it, it would look like every
other action movie. What she didn't know was

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.410
that he had filmed over 480 hours of film
in the desert, which took a full three months

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.289
just to watch it all.

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.320
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
Batman Vs Superman director Zack Snyder took

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.860
plenty of shots at director JJ Abrams' Star
Wars reboot, while both movies filmed at the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.860
same time. But Abrams got the last laugh,
including a scale model of Batman's Tumbler

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.330
Batmobile on the outer hull of the Millennium
Falcon.&nbsp;

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.190
To keep his mind off of Star Wars when he
wasn’t filming, JJ Abrams took in the Broadway

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.980
musical “Hamilton”. When meeting the musical’s
creator Lin-Manuel Miranda backstage, Miranda

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.321
told Abrams to call if he needed new cantina
music. When it came time to record, Abrams

00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:28.090
made good on the offer, sharing vocals with
Miranda in the finished song.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.590
Jurassic World
There's no Jurassic Park without John Hammond,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.420
so director Colin Trevorrow made sure to add
a bronze statue of the park creator in his

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.253
big-budget sequel. It was assumed Hammond
would have died prior to the movie, but when

00:01:39.253 --> 00:01:44.040
actor Richard Attenborough passed away before
release, the statue became a memorial to the

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.040
man, not the character.&nbsp;

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.710
The stars of the original movie are mostly
left out of Jurassic World, but the return

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.740
of 'Mr. DNA' was total fan service. The director,
a huge fan of the original, even recorded

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.780
his impression of the late voice actor Greg
Burson for a temporary track. The impression

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.150
was so good, the audio team just left it in
as is.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.520
Frozen
Jennifer Lee was the first woman to direct

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.680
a Disney movie, and given Frozen's success,
she picked the right one. But fans probably

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.160
don't know that she also lent her voice to
the movie, playing Elsa’s mother, the Queen

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.160
of Arendelle.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.270
The Avengers: Age of Ultron
Fans of Marvel's heroes were probably too

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.080
distracted to notice the subtle war being
fought between the team's two leaders. The

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.891
official posters were split between putting
Iron Man front and center, or Captain America

00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:26.860
- a major hint at the conflict and Civil War
coming years later.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.420
Captain America: The Winter Soldier
No fan will forget the scene in which Cap

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.580
takes down an elevator filled with SHIELD
personnel. What makes it even more impressive

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.530
is that it was the&nbsp;first scene shot&nbsp;for
the sequel, setting the stage for the gritty,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.370
hard-hitting follow-up story fans couldn't
get enough of.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.000
The Lego Movie
The directors of this toy adventure relied

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.030
on CG to bring the LEGO to life, but also
used a ton of the real thing. Benny the Space

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.450
Guy is only in the movie since director Chris
Miller played with him when he was little

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.390
- in fact, his actual space set is used in
the film.&nbsp;

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.880
Guardians of the Galaxy
Marvel's shared universe means plenty of cameos

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.650
from the same actors, but there's at least
one problem. How is it that the young girl

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.480
looking for Captain America's autograph is
played by the same woman as Star-Lord's dying

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.750
mother more than forty years later? Actress
Laura Haddock plays both, but is almost unrecognizable

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.750
on her deathbed.&nbsp;

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.511
It's hard to keep the tears back when Peter
Quill reads the final note from his mother,

00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:20.209
and was even harder for Pratt. The actress
had to quickly record the voiceover in the

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.970
back of a car, just so Pratt could listen
to it during the actual scene, and truly sell

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.990
the connection and flood of memories.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.650
Fans had some nitpicking to do when Star-Lord
and Gamora float through space without any

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.370
injuries. But the filmmakers actually worked
with NASA on the science of the scene, learning

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.270
that humans could survive just as long as
the characters, without serious health problems.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.270
It turns out the movie is science fact, not
fiction.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.850
X-Men Days of Future Past
Surprisingly, Wolverine wasn't planned to

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.959
show his bare backside when he arrives in
the past of 1973. But on the day of the shoot,

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.819
Jackman told the director that if he were
waking up to a beautiful woman, he wouldn't

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.560
be wearing underwear. Everyone was convinced,
blurring the line on whether he's playing

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.400
himself, or Wolverine in that particular moment.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.500
It's never explicitly stated, but it's implied
that Quicksilver is the son of Magneto, just

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.760
as he was in the X-Men comics. Most fans accepted
the idea immediately... Probably not realizing

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.790
that the on screen father and son, Michael
Fassbender and Evan Peters, are less than

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.290
ten years apart in age. Who knew?

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.280
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
The rebooted Turtles may be mutant cg creations,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.549
but the designers turned to real life actors
who summed up their personalities. Leonardo's

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.439
face was based on Russell Crowe, Raphael on
Clint Eastwood, Donatello on Leonard Nimoy,

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:27.449
and Michelangelo on Bill Murray. Fans can
decide how close they came.

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.630
Man of Steel
Knowing that moviegoers always assume a superhero's

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.189
costume exaggerates the actor's muscles, Zack
Snyder and Henry Cavill wanted to prove their

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:39.270
Superman was something different. Cavill refused
steroids to help him build muscle before his

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.909
shirtless scenes, dropping his body fat to
the levels of professional bodybuilders - just

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:45.970
7%. The results... speak for themselves.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.129
Gravity
Nearly every part of this space survival story

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:52.230
was created in a computer, but that only gave
the crew a chance at an incredible joke. At

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.249
some points in the movie, reflections of a
camera man or boom mic appear in the astronauts’

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.740
helmets, as if they were mistakes that slipped
through editing. Instead, they were put there

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.770
by the animators as an inside joke most viewers
will never notice.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.830
Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice
The workout demands for the Justice League

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.159
lead-in swung for the fences, with Henry Civil
packing on TWICE the muscle of Man of Steel.

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:17.580
Not to be outdone, the physically larger Affleck
made sure to gain thirty pounds of muscle

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.879
- and drop to just 8% body fat to make sure
Batman was every hit as intimidating, even

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.129
without heat vision.

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:27.460
Captain America: Civil War
The movie's not even here, but one of its

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.610
most iconic shots has already been revealed.
And it's not fiction, either: The directors

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.590
had star Chris Evans actually suspended between
a crane and helicopter, using his very real

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.099
muscles to hold them together. Cg isn't always
the answer, apparently.

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.479
Those are some of our favorite mind blowing
movie facts, but let us know which ones we
