00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.120
That's me!

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.240
I'm on Svalbard, an archipelago 800 miles
from the North Pole.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.960
There are polar bears and glaciers, and also
the most amazing genetic library I have ever

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.960
seen...

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.270
Howdy seeders of knowledge, Trace here for
DNews.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.430
If you’ve never heard of Svalbard before,
it’s this place right here.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.470
Waaay up there on top of the planet.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.220
It's far away from civilization, but Svalbard
might be one of the most important places

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.850
in the world.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.470
The place in charge of protecting the future
of our food.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.200
In there, you have 13,000 years history of
agriculture.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.680
It's quite amazing.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.070
That's Marie Haga, she's the Executive Director
of the CropTrust, the group that oversees

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.420
the Svalbard Global Seed Vault.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.960
Inside that vault are boxes, and inside the
boxes?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.960
Seeds.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.530
Quite simply, seeds.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.120
Normally somewhere between 300 and 500 seeds
in these aluminum foil envelopes, and that's

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.720
all there is.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.720
Nothing else.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.720
Seed vaults exist in most nations.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.720
There are 1750 of them across the planet.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.720
But sometimes, they fail.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.720
This is where the Svalbard Global Seed Vault
comes in.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.620
We collect seeds from absolutely all over
the world, or countries or institutions and

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.610
jails choose to use this as a backup facility.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.590
The main reason it's so far North is because
Svalbard is cold.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.960
It's got a permafrost, meaning the ground
never really thaws, even in the summer.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.660
Seeds like to be stored long term at minus
18 degrees.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:42.260
It's a great advantage then when the permafrost
gives minus 6 at the outset.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.400
By digging a 130 meter tunnel deep into the
mountain, the vault is under that permafrost,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.270
meaning they only had to cool it the remaining
12 celsius.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.820
At that temperature, the 860 thousand varieties
currently in the vault can be held for decades;

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.700
some wheat varieties could last a 1000 years!

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.700
But it wouldn't be DNews if we didn't say
more research is needed.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.700
They don't have this all figured out.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.700
Seeds have been saved by farmers since the
dawn of agriculture, but saving for a year

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.700
is one thing, they're talking about saving
them for GENERATIONS.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.700
That's not easy.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.700
Especially since our bananas don't even have
seeds, so CropTrust uses cryopreservation

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.700
for those, same with coconuts.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.700
So, nations around the world put their seeds
in this Vault on Svalbard.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.700
But CropTrust doesn't own them.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.700
See, Svalbard is governed by Norway, but party
to an international demilitarization treaty;

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.700
meaning it's neutral ground for places like
Russia and Ukraine, whose seeds sit on the

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.700
same shelf… even the hermit kingdom of North
Korea can store their seeds there.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.700
But aside from serving as a backup for the
global food machine, the Seed Vault also represents

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.700
something else… a genetic library of evolutionary
successes.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.700
Wheat originates in, certainly the Middle
East, probably in Syria.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.120
Now we grow wheat absolutely all over the
world.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.660
It has taken many thousand years for these
plants to move around the globe.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.090
The challenge these days is really that the
climate changes so fast, so the plants are

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.819
not able to adapt.

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:45.489
// This is why we need to introduce, for example,
genes from a wild relative.

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:53.359
That can ma ke sure that wheat can grow in
funny climates, with, for example, less water.

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.319
Or that it's able to fight a new disease that
stems from climate change.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.319
We actually think that these wild relatives
of the domesticated species can really be

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.319
game changers in the way that we develop plants.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.219
So scientists are tirelessly travelling the
world to gather more seeds, and bring those

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.219
into the vault too.

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:05.219
They gotta GROW that library, know what I
mean?

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:06.219
Pun intended.

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.489
But it's not a joke, because farmers don't
want to GROW all these crops; they need to

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.489
make dollahs.

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.999
And they and agribusinesses grow for YIELD.

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:16.640
But, when we choose yield over diversity,
we lose genetic variety.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.930
We in the U.S. only have about 10 percent
of the variety of fruits and vegetables that

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.239
used to exist.

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:29.409
So if a disease strikes, say bananas, like
is happening now, they could go extinct, and

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.110
there's nothing we can do; there aren't any
other varieties to experiment with.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.109
Which is why we're cataloging and saving seeds
in this vault…

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:45.359
There are 4500 varieties of potatoes, 3000
varieties of coconuts, 35,000 varieties of

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:53.420
corn, 125,000 varieties of wheat, or 200,000
varieties of rice.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.279
// One of those might have the trait that
we need in the future to adapt the rice to

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:05.549
whatever it is, higher temperature, higher
salinity in the soil, more unpredictable weather,

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.819
a variety that can fight a new pest or a new
disease.

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.400
For each one, we lose.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.879
We lose options to develop plants with traits
in the future.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:16.945
There are 29 crops in the world that are the
MOST important.

00:04:16.945 --> 00:04:17.945
Rice, wheat, corn, potatoes, coconuts, barley…
and a number of others, but even though we

00:04:17.945 --> 00:04:18.945
don't grow them all we need to save these
thousands of varieties, and once they're sequenced

00:04:18.945 --> 00:04:19.945
their genetic information can be mined to
create the future of biodiversity.

00:04:19.945 --> 00:04:20.945
In the end, the Seed Vault isn't just a place
where seeds sit, waiting to be genetically

00:04:20.945 --> 00:04:25.541
sequenced, and grown again to secure our food
supply for the 9 or 15 billion people who

00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:27.090
will live on the Earth of the future.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.319
It's also library of nature's trial and error
for dealing with the shifting planet we live

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:36.800
on, and it's one of humanity's greatest science
projects.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:05:19.339
It's ongoing, it's complicated, and it's just
plain awe inspiring.
