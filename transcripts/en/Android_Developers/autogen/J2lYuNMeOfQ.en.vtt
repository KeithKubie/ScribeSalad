00:00:01.052 --> 00:00:03.260
 Hello and welcome to this video 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.170
 Where we will show you all the wonderful things we have added 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.960
 To Google Play Services 4.4. 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.750
 As you now know, Google Play services are amazing. 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.680
 This also means that when using Google Play services, 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.660
 Oh, morning coffee. 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.070
 Let's start right now. 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.230
 Here are the key features of version 4.4. 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.020
 New tools have been added to identify activities 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.696
 To the API Locations interface. 

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:30.210
 Yaaah! 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.259
 As for the Google Android Maps API we have attached 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.640
 Some additions to indoor maps and - Shishsh. 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.570
 That's true. 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.440
 This is great and we will only reveal it later. 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.280
 We've also added some new things to Play Games services 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.170
 And Wallets. 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.680
 We'll end this video with promotions 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.690
 In-app for mobile apps. 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.520
 Before we address this, let's start 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.730
 With activity recognition tools in the API Locations interface. 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.180
 As you know, 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.260
 The possibility of detection has already been provided 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.340
 Whether devices on a bicycle or car or fixed in place 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.500
 Or slanted or moving. 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.640
 Well, these are already many features. 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.910
 But we decided to add more 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.370
 We are pleased to offer two other activities: 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.270
 Walking and running. 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.570
 Thank you. 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.220
 That's true. 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.110
 We added walking and jogging to activity detection tools. 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.400
 But we thought, why do not we have some bananas here 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.045
 While experimenting with these things. 

00:01:24.045 --> 00:01:25.677
 What am I doing now? 

00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:27.010
 You're going. 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.260
 That's true. 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.850
 this is very good. 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.200
 What am I doing now? 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.091
 You run. 

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:37.340
 That's true. 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.880
 this is very good. 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.088
 Keep running. 

00:01:40.088 --> 00:01:41.541
 This is good for your health. 

00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:44.220
 What am I doing now? 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.890
 You are driving a bicycle. 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.140
 That's true. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.088
 this is very good. 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.390
 No. 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.386
 Do not stop running. 

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:55.760
 You are very close to the Googleplex. 

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:04.740
 Let me tell you. 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.660
 It was tired and enjoyable, 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.580
 Although this application was only experimental. 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.780
 Imagine what your apps can do with this interface. 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.340
 Let's take a look at the Google Maps Android API interface now 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.940
 Let's start with the indoor maps where you can choose 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.780
 Detecting decks when focusing on a new building 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.020
 You will certainly discover the activity of the building 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.950
 And the floor. 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.710
 This is for example the second floor 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.020
 From D Gates at San Francisco Airport. 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.040
 Well, let us turn to - Ladies and Gentlemen, 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.480
 That's right, we're going to announce something very important. 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.310
 Let's add Street View to Google Maps Android API 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.620
 With warm applause. 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.940
 Go back to work. 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.990
 Okay Sir. 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.520
 You can now include Street View imagery in an activity, 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.980
 Allowing your users to explore the world through panoramic views 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.245
 360-degree control programmatically 

00:02:54.245 --> 00:02:57.370
 Zoom in / Zoom in and the orientation of the Street View camera 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.470
 And show camera movements. 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.760
 Great, this is a great addition. 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.440
 Imagine all these great additions and what you can do with your applications. 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.020
 Now go to Play Games services. 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.100
 We introduced in version 4.3 Game Gifts 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.400
 Which allows you to order gifts or wishes. 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.280
 Now, we're able to request a new API 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.840
 So you can choose many game gift recipients. 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.910
 In terms of games, this means the possibility of occurrence 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.050
 More cooperation and social participation between players. 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.230
 This takes us to the Wallet API interface 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.770
 We added Wallet Fragments to the Instant Buy API. 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.340
 Thanks to Wallet Fragments, it has become extremely easy 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.930
 Merge the Buy with Google button into your app. 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.370
 All you have to do is create and add these parts. 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.700
 As a way to enjoy, see how shopping can be done 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.290

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.670
 The user logs in to an application using Google Plus Sign-In and selects 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.440
 Google Adjustable Bike to purchase them using 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.510

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.440
 And so on. 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.000
 You buy a bike in 10 seconds. 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.500
 Let's end by talking about mobile ads where we've added 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.710
 In-app promotions. 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.230
 This is an API that allows publishers 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.830
 View in-app promotions 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.480
 Enabling users to purchase goods 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.899
 Advertised directly within the app. 

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:20.630
 By these plugins, users can buy products that 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.830
 They are easily charged, as advertisers can 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.000
 Access to consumers The application is able to understand communications. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.450
 No one is a loser. 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.110
 We got to the end of the video however 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.800
 Stay connected because we will announce more. 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.710
 Now it's your turn to start up and create great apps. 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.620
 And do not forget to tell us everything about your experience. 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.170
 Oooh! 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.170
 Be more careful 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:49.020
 When climbing.
