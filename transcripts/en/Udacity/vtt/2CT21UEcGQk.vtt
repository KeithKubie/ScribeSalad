00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.500
Now let's do an exercise called Junk Yard.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.610
Find an example of a data visualization that contains chartjunk and

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.380
describe the elements that are considered chartjunk.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.460
Post your original image, your description and

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.290
a sketch of the improved version of the visualization.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.120
You don't need to re-create the data visualization precisely, but

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.320
you can if you're familiar with visualization software.
