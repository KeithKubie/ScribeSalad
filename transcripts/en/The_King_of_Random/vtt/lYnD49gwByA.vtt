00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.759
Guys for this video. I'm going to show you a cool little survival hack

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.478
You can use to make an emergency survival whistle out of an Empty Bullet casing

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.649
So let's imagine. You're stranded in the forest

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.299
and you need some way to signal for help when you glance down at the forest floor and you just happen to notice one of

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.279
These cartridge casings sitting under the branch this shell is from a two to three cartridge

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.249
But any long narrow casing like this should work now the first thing

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.279
We need to do is actually shave off the tip of this cartridge casing

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.898
so we're just left with this fat part at the bottom you can easily do that with some concrete or a

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.779
Rock like this and we're going to use that almost as improvised

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.820
Sandpaper because what we need to do is sand the brass all the way back to this bigger casing back here

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.329
It's going to take a little bit of work

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.889
But it is very possible to do now if you're somewhere closer to civilization

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.430
You could use concrete to curb on your road or even a paver stone or if you even have some metal files that will work

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.749
Better, but the essential idea is we need to shave this back until it gets to about there

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.190
It's going to take a few minutes

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.250
but eventually you can see we actually get the cartridge casing ground down and there are some little bits inside where you can take a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.010
Sharp rock now and just kind of dig those out to clean it up

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.939
We want the inside of that to be as smooth as possible

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.319
you can see they're like little flakes of brass in there that need to come off

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.258
That's what we're looking for right there the next thing

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.849
we need to do is come back about half to three quarters of an inch and grind a small hole in the top in a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.009
Way that there's a flat side on the mouth and and then a gradual sloping side toward the back

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.840
Take your casing with the open end

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.210
overlapping the edge a little bit and then tilt it a little bit and at that angle we're just gonna run this back and forth

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.220
And it's good to take a few minutes

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.470
But we want to keep doing this until we dig a hole right through

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.709
That side of the casing this is going to be the whistle part of our whistle

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.760
Already starting to get a hole through there

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.810
You can see it's already starting to take the whistle shape this edge could be a little bit flatter

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.909
So I'm going to just adjust my angle a little bit

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.460
There we go now all this brass in here

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.159
we can just carve that out with a rock or a

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.079
Knife or a file or whatever the case may be but we just want to clean up that hole and open it up alright

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.449
So that actually went a lot faster than I thought maybe about two minutes

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.050
And we got this thing ground down if you look at the profile of this casing though, you can see that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.550
There's a vertical line near the mouthpiece and then a sloping line for at the back of the bullet

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.369
That's exactly what we're looking for and there's still a piece on the inside there

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.110
But I can use a stick to go down there

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.580
And yeah look there's the whole flap right there you might just want to rub it back and forth a few times to clean out

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.330
Some of those brass Burrs, but essentially that is our whistle

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.049
What I need to do now is find some kind of a stick that will fit perfectly into the front piece here with just enough

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.749
of a gap on the top to allow air to flow in and

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.219
Split over that whistle on the back all we have to do is a little bit of trial and error until we find a nice

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.220
Tight fit and then take a little bit off the top

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.200
Now we can use the rock to grind this down to make a flat surface as well

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.389
But essentially we're looking for something that will just fit very

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.039
snugly inside of that casing the last thing to do is just to trim a little bit of the stick off the tops that we

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.619
Have an air gap for our air to flow through and split on the whistle so let's mark that piece right there and then either

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.300
File or carve with a knife a little bit off the top just a sliver and that looks good

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.480
So now we have to do is break the stick off file it down, and we got ourselves a whistle

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.090
Mm fiber

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.340
Hey

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.209
That sounds amazing so look at the positioning of that see how the wood is actually right on the indent where it starts sloping upward

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.109
So right there is a perfect bullet shell whistle that we made with stuff

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.300
We found right here in the forest how cool is that guys?

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.679
Actually hurts my ears and definitely loud enough to find some help when you're in need in the woods

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.990
So there you have a guy is a cool little trick for turning scrap bullet casings into emergency survival Whistles

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.770
Thanks so much for joining me for this project, and I'll be looking for you the next video. Talk to you then

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:07.810
you
