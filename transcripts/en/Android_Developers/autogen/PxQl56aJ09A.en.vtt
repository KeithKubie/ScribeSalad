of go into that a little bit so we're
just going to say this is how you

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230
just going to say this is how you

you can see it's pretty easy what you do
 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:30.869
you can see it's pretty easy what you do
is you basically stop all your other

your application while you do that you
 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.500
your application while you do that you
make sure that you have this this file

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510
make sure that you have this this file

you're using Wi-Fi or using cellular
 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:59.729
you're using Wi-Fi or using cellular
networks so you'll actually see that if

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739
networks so you'll actually see that if
 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.550
networks so you'll actually see that if
you do like an IP addr that way you can

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560
you do like an IP addr that way you can
 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.830
you do like an IP addr that way you can
see you know what network interface is

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840
see you know what network interface is
 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.059

you know there might be an issue with

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340
you know there might be an issue with
 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:57.379

be a nice big red box that tells you
 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.040
be a nice big red box that tells you
what is wrong and maybe even how to fix

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050
what is wrong and maybe even how to fix
 

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:10.430
what is wrong and maybe even how to fix
it

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440
it
 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.220
it
so here we're saying that we just tested

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:13.230
so here we're saying that we just tested
 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:14.659
so here we're saying that we just tested
it doesn't look like you have the

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:14.669
it doesn't look like you have the
 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.360
it doesn't look like you have the
presence of cache headers now that could

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.370
presence of cache headers now that could
 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.430
presence of cache headers now that could
be an issue down the road because what

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440
be an issue down the road because what
 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.260
be an issue down the road because what
if somebody needs to go back to that

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:21.270
if somebody needs to go back to that
 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.850
if somebody needs to go back to that
resource or you have another thing that

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860
resource or you have another thing that
 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.640
resource or you have another thing that
uses that same resource that has to be

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650
uses that same resource that has to be
 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.920
uses that same resource that has to be
redownload 'add and that can be a pretty

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930
redownload 'add and that can be a pretty
 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.800
redownload 'add and that can be a pretty
big thing so why would you do that to

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:30.810
big thing so why would you do that to
 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.420
big thing so why would you do that to
your user when you're within the same

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:32.430
your user when you're within the same
 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:32.930
your user when you're within the same
session

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:32.940
session
 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.610
session
I can understand getting rid of it after

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:34.620
I can understand getting rid of it after
 

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.100
I can understand getting rid of it after
the session is over but you're you're

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.110
the session is over but you're you're
 

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.560
the session is over but you're you're
still there so why why not hold onto it

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:39.570
still there so why why not hold onto it
 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:44.659
still there so why why not hold onto it
so here's the other issues that we saw

00:07:44.659 --> 00:07:44.669
so here's the other issues that we saw
 

00:07:44.669 --> 00:07:46.450
so here's the other issues that we saw
and this is where it kind of gives you

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460
and this is where it kind of gives you
 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.430
and this is where it kind of gives you
that information and you can see I've

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440
that information and you can see I've
 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.150
that information and you can see I've
blurred out any of the people that might

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160
blurred out any of the people that might
 

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.370
blurred out any of the people that might
be involved so you can see that the

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:55.380
be involved so you can see that the
 

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.640
be involved so you can see that the
images are a little too big these were

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:58.650
images are a little too big these were
 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.700
images are a little too big these were
the images that it pulled up these

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:01.710
the images that it pulled up these
 

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.420
the images that it pulled up these
actually looked to be desktop quality

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:05.430
actually looked to be desktop quality
 

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.000
actually looked to be desktop quality
when I actually went to those links and

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:08.010
when I actually went to those links and
 

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.950
when I actually went to those links and
looked at them which can be really nice

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960
looked at them which can be really nice
 

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.740
looked at them which can be really nice
if you have a very high quality device

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:11.750
if you have a very high quality device
 

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.230
if you have a very high quality device
but I was testing on a couple of

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240
but I was testing on a couple of
 

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.659
but I was testing on a couple of
different devices and some of them were

00:08:17.659 --> 00:08:17.669
different devices and some of them were
 

00:08:17.669 --> 00:08:20.570
different devices and some of them were
not high quality devices so it ended up

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:20.580
not high quality devices so it ended up
 

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.420
not high quality devices so it ended up
taking up a lot more space with actually

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:23.430
taking up a lot more space with actually
 

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:27.850
taking up a lot more space with actually
no no positive outcome from it right and

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:27.860
no no positive outcome from it right and
 

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.890
no no positive outcome from it right and
again the minify of of all of that you

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900
again the minify of of all of that you
 

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:34.459
again the minify of of all of that you
could have saved 7% just by getting rid

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:34.469
could have saved 7% just by getting rid
 

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:37.339
could have saved 7% just by getting rid
of empty spaces seven percent of that

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:37.349
of empty spaces seven percent of that
 

00:08:37.349 --> 00:08:40.000
of empty spaces seven percent of that
whole string could have been saved

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.010
whole string could have been saved
 

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.770
whole string could have been saved
so what's another thing cool thing that

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:42.780
so what's another thing cool thing that
 

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:44.660
so what's another thing cool thing that
you can do with this tool is you can

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:44.670
you can do with this tool is you can
 

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.180
you can do with this tool is you can
actually dictate your own profile so if

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:47.190
actually dictate your own profile so if
 

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.710
actually dictate your own profile so if
you wanted to track something that was

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720
you wanted to track something that was
 

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.780
you wanted to track something that was
maybe a really small network you have a

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:50.790
maybe a really small network you have a
 

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:51.980
maybe a really small network you have a
certain set of parameters that you're

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:51.990
certain set of parameters that you're
 

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:53.960
certain set of parameters that you're
exactly trying to meet in a certain set

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:53.970
exactly trying to meet in a certain set
 

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:54.710
exactly trying to meet in a certain set
of conditions

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:54.720
of conditions
 

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.960
of conditions
you can actually tell it exactly what

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:56.970
you can actually tell it exactly what
 

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.329
you can actually tell it exactly what
you want to have happen is your target

00:08:59.329 --> 00:08:59.339
you want to have happen is your target
 

00:08:59.339 --> 00:09:03.410
you want to have happen is your target
okay I only want to use like 95

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420
okay I only want to use like 95
 

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.809
okay I only want to use like 95
millijoules of energy to perform this

00:09:05.809 --> 00:09:05.819
millijoules of energy to perform this
 

00:09:05.819 --> 00:09:08.990
millijoules of energy to perform this

transaction am I good or am I not so
 

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.129
transaction am I good or am I not so
this can actually give some of that

00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:10.139
this can actually give some of that
 

00:09:10.139 --> 00:09:11.660
this can actually give some of that
information inferred based off of

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:11.670
information inferred based off of
 

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.610
information inferred based off of
knowing how much power is used by the

00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:13.620
knowing how much power is used by the
 

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:16.490
knowing how much power is used by the
radio and you can actually set that so

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:16.500
radio and you can actually set that so
 

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.019
radio and you can actually set that so
it makes it really easy for you to test

00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:18.029
it makes it really easy for you to test
 

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:22.610
it makes it really easy for you to test
this in the future so here's kind of an

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:22.620
this in the future so here's kind of an
 

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.340
this in the future so here's kind of an
overview of what our data looked like so

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:25.350
overview of what our data looked like so
 

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:28.400
overview of what our data looked like so
it's showing a lot of unknown now

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:28.410
it's showing a lot of unknown now
 

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.710
it's showing a lot of unknown now
normally it would show a lot of like

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720
normally it would show a lot of like
 

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.400
normally it would show a lot of like
images JPEG or images PNG but we're

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:34.410
images JPEG or images PNG but we're
 

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:36.199
images JPEG or images PNG but we're
doing some things to kind of obfuscate

00:09:36.199 --> 00:09:36.209
doing some things to kind of obfuscate
 

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:37.970
doing some things to kind of obfuscate
some of that and do some actual data

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980
some of that and do some actual data
 

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.470
some of that and do some actual data
batching to make that a little more

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480
batching to make that a little more
 

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.269
batching to make that a little more
efficient so it's not going to be

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279
efficient so it's not going to be
 

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:43.220
efficient so it's not going to be
immediately recognizable that hey that's

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:43.230
immediately recognizable that hey that's
 

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.980
immediately recognizable that hey that's
a jpg file but you can see you know

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:45.990
a jpg file but you can see you know
 

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:47.389
a jpg file but you can see you know
doing a lot of search results we got a

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399
doing a lot of search results we got a
 

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:51.259
doing a lot of search results we got a
lot of JSON requests and we can see hey

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:51.269
lot of JSON requests and we can see hey
 

00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:54.230
lot of JSON requests and we can see hey
you know it moved pretty fast we weren't

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240
you know it moved pretty fast we weren't
 

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.400
you know it moved pretty fast we weren't
using a crazy amount of data and that it

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:58.410
using a crazy amount of data and that it
 

00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:01.910
using a crazy amount of data and that it
generally looked pretty good right now

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920
generally looked pretty good right now
 

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.410
generally looked pretty good right now
if you're familiar with Network Monitor

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.420
if you're familiar with Network Monitor
 

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.530
if you're familiar with Network Monitor
the Diagnostics are going to look very

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:05.540
the Diagnostics are going to look very
 

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:09.199
the Diagnostics are going to look very
very similar so we're looking at this

00:10:09.199 --> 00:10:09.209
very similar so we're looking at this
 

00:10:09.209 --> 00:10:11.240
very similar so we're looking at this
from a forensic point of view and you

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.250
from a forensic point of view and you
 

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:14.509
from a forensic point of view and you
can see exactly what happened when I was

00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519
can see exactly what happened when I was
 

00:10:14.519 --> 00:10:17.030
can see exactly what happened when I was
going through various points so when I

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040
going through various points so when I
 

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.999
going through various points so when I
first load it that's the gray then we

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:20.009
first load it that's the gray then we
 

00:10:20.009 --> 00:10:22.819
first load it that's the gray then we
have the first burst of the big red

00:10:22.819 --> 00:10:22.829
have the first burst of the big red
 

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:25.519
have the first burst of the big red
which is me performing the search then

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:25.529
which is me performing the search then
 

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:27.110
which is me performing the search then
there's some little dots for loading

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120
there's some little dots for loading
 

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.189
there's some little dots for loading
extra search result data when going down

00:10:31.189 --> 00:10:31.199
extra search result data when going down
 

00:10:31.199 --> 00:10:32.960
extra search result data when going down
and scrolling more and fetching and

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:32.970
and scrolling more and fetching and
 

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.699
and scrolling more and fetching and
getting that stuff in and then you can

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:34.709
getting that stuff in and then you can
 

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:37.579
getting that stuff in and then you can
actually see up when do I actually tap

00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:37.589
actually see up when do I actually tap
 

00:10:37.589 --> 00:10:41.059
actually see up when do I actually tap
on tap on an item and then I tap on an

00:10:41.059 --> 00:10:41.069
on tap on an item and then I tap on an
 

00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:42.650
on tap on an item and then I tap on an
image of the item so I like got to the

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660
image of the item so I like got to the
 

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.540
image of the item so I like got to the
image page and then I tapped on like the

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:44.550
image page and then I tapped on like the
 

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.759
image page and then I tapped on like the
big images right so you can see exactly

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:46.769
big images right so you can see exactly
 

00:10:46.769 --> 00:10:49.850
big images right so you can see exactly
what that was and you know what was the

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:49.860
what that was and you know what was the
 

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:51.530
what that was and you know what was the
amount of time that I was actually using

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:51.540
amount of time that I was actually using
 

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.110
amount of time that I was actually using
what they call RRC basically it's how

00:10:54.110 --> 00:10:54.120
what they call RRC basically it's how
 

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.319
what they call RRC basically it's how
much radio time were you using was it a

00:10:57.319 --> 00:10:57.329
much radio time were you using was it a
 

00:10:57.329 --> 00:11:01.610
much radio time were you using was it a
lot was it at the whole thing of the

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:01.620
lot was it at the whole thing of the
 

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.379
lot was it at the whole thing of the
bandwidth at once and it really wasn't

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:03.389
bandwidth at once and it really wasn't
 

00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:04.939
bandwidth at once and it really wasn't
you can see it was kind of yellow and

00:11:04.939 --> 00:11:04.949
you can see it was kind of yellow and
 

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:06.530
you can see it was kind of yellow and
kind of green and when you're dealing

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:06.540
kind of green and when you're dealing
 

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:07.860
kind of green and when you're dealing
with a immediate user

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:07.870
with a immediate user
 

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.540
with a immediate user
interaction well you are the forefront

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:09.550
interaction well you are the forefront
 

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:11.700
interaction well you are the forefront
application that's actually pretty

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:11.710
application that's actually pretty
 

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.650
application that's actually pretty
awesome it's quite a few of them will

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:13.660
awesome it's quite a few of them will
 

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.829
awesome it's quite a few of them will
run very very read to do the same same

00:11:16.829 --> 00:11:16.839
run very very read to do the same same
 

00:11:16.839 --> 00:11:21.000
run very very read to do the same same
kind of thing and you can also see at

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.010
kind of thing and you can also see at
 

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:23.220
kind of thing and you can also see at
the bottom that you actually get you

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:23.230
the bottom that you actually get you
 

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.990
the bottom that you actually get you
know what ports were what were your

00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000
know what ports were what were your
 

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.329
know what ports were what were your
endpoints what traffic was going where

00:11:27.329 --> 00:11:27.339
endpoints what traffic was going where
 

00:11:27.339 --> 00:11:31.290
endpoints what traffic was going where
and how much of it so we have a

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:31.300
and how much of it so we have a
 

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.390
and how much of it so we have a
statistics page it as well so we

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:33.400
statistics page it as well so we
 

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.690
statistics page it as well so we
actually get to see how big were the

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:36.700
actually get to see how big were the
 

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.820
actually get to see how big were the
packets that I was sending how long did

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:38.830
packets that I was sending how long did
 

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:42.090
packets that I was sending how long did
it go how fast was I running and what's

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:42.100
it go how fast was I running and what's
 

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.800
it go how fast was I running and what's
kind of my score what what did I do

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:43.810
kind of my score what what did I do
 

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.990
kind of my score what what did I do
really well it and what can I improve it

really well it and what can I improve it
 

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.880
really well it and what can I improve it
so in this case I really could improve a

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:50.890
so in this case I really could improve a
 

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:53.460
so in this case I really could improve a
lot on my tightly grouped connections so

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:53.470
lot on my tightly grouped connections so
 

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.220
lot on my tightly grouped connections so

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:02.519
server requests of a bunch of different
endpoints would probably increase some

00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:02.529
endpoints would probably increase some
 

00:12:02.529 --> 00:12:04.829

image to make sure that you're using
only a certain amount of memory but I'm

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:03.630
only a certain amount of memory but I'm
 

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:06.020
only a certain amount of memory but I'm
sure most you guys know that because the

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:06.030
sure most you guys know that because the
 

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.050
sure most you guys know that because the
out of memory error sucks and it really

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060
out of memory error sucks and it really
 

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.730
out of memory error sucks and it really
sucks to see it on your log reports

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:10.740
sucks to see it on your log reports
 

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.130
sucks to see it on your log reports
right and images are one of the biggest

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:13.140
right and images are one of the biggest
 

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.410
right and images are one of the biggest
things that will cause those things to

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:15.420
things that will cause those things to
 

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.840
things that will cause those things to
happen especially full-page images right

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:17.850
happen especially full-page images right
 

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:21.230
happen especially full-page images right
and you know somebody who's got a $50

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:21.240
and you know somebody who's got a $50
 

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:23.660
and you know somebody who's got a $50
phone they don't really think about the

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:23.670
phone they don't really think about the
 

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:25.670
phone they don't really think about the
fact that well maybe it might have some

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680
fact that well maybe it might have some
 

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.720
fact that well maybe it might have some
issues cuz it was $50 phone and stuff so

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:29.730
issues cuz it was $50 phone and stuff so
 

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.430
issues cuz it was $50 phone and stuff so
let's think about this if you need

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440
let's think about this if you need
 

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.850
let's think about this if you need
transparency you basically need to look

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:34.860
transparency you basically need to look
 

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.840
transparency you basically need to look
at a RGB either four four four four or

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:38.850
at a RGB either four four four four or
 

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.790
at a RGB either four four four four or
eight eight eight eight eight eight

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800
eight eight eight eight eight eight
 

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.880
eight eight eight eight eight eight
eight eight is full everything right but

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:43.890
eight eight is full everything right but
 

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.450
eight eight is full everything right but
what would a RGB four four four four be

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:47.460
what would a RGB four four four four be
 

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:50.270
what would a RGB four four four four be
good at it's really awesome at

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:50.280
good at it's really awesome at
 

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:53.960
good at it's really awesome at
simplified iconography something like a

00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:53.970
simplified iconography something like a
 

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:56.750
simplified iconography something like a
lot of the material design pictures

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:56.760
lot of the material design pictures
 

00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.360
lot of the material design pictures
photographs things like that do amazing

00:16:59.360 --> 00:16:59.370
photographs things like that do amazing
 

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.510
photographs things like that do amazing
and look exactly the same if you look at

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:02.520
and look exactly the same if you look at
 

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.390
and look exactly the same if you look at
the a RGB eight eight eight eight versus

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400
the a RGB eight eight eight eight versus
 

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.309
the a RGB eight eight eight eight versus
the four four four four and you've just

00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319
the four four four four and you've just
 

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.520
the four four four four and you've just
saved a ton of bits by doing so you've

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:10.530
saved a ton of bits by doing so you've
 

00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:12.319
saved a ton of bits by doing so you've
essentially cut your package in half

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:12.329
essentially cut your package in half
 

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:17.449
essentially cut your package in half
it's awesome but okay well I don't need

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459
it's awesome but okay well I don't need
 

00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:19.460
it's awesome but okay well I don't need
transparency but I would really

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:19.470
transparency but I would really
 

00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:21.170
transparency but I would really
appreciate having all that nice little

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:21.180
appreciate having all that nice little
 

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:23.179
appreciate having all that nice little
compression you thing going on without

00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:23.189
compression you thing going on without
 

00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:26.510
compression you thing going on without
losing anything right so we're not

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520
losing anything right so we're not
 

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.490
losing anything right so we're not
reducing the color space we just take

00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500
reducing the color space we just take
 

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.250
reducing the color space we just take
away transparency and that gives you the

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260
away transparency and that gives you the
 

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.370
away transparency and that gives you the
RGB five six five so you get full color

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380
RGB five six five so you get full color
 

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:37.460
RGB five six five so you get full color
get all the nice gradients that you

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:37.470
get all the nice gradients that you
 

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.760
get all the nice gradients that you
don't get in a RGB four four four four

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:39.770
don't get in a RGB four four four four
 

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:42.470
don't get in a RGB four four four four
but it gives you all the same things

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480
but it gives you all the same things
 

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.990
but it gives you all the same things
that you would expect in a JPEG image

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000
that you would expect in a JPEG image
 

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.910
that you would expect in a JPEG image
just you haven't even gone to the loss

so nice but I'm sure they have a lot of

00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:22.970
so nice but I'm sure they have a lot of
 

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:26.890
so nice but I'm sure they have a lot of
people doing it and compression on the

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:26.900
people doing it and compression on the

people doing it and compression on the
network is not compression in your Heat

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:28.550
network is not compression in your Heat
 

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.260
network is not compression in your Heat
right so it's gonna load the same size

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:32.270
right so it's gonna load the same size
 

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.950
right so it's gonna load the same size
no matter what and you know what else

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:35.960
no matter what and you know what else

should probably design your API is to

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600
should probably design your API is to
 

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:44.050
should probably design your API is to
handle multiple screen sizes so now we

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:44.060
handle multiple screen sizes so now we
 

00:19:44.060 --> 00:19:47.290
handle multiple screen sizes so now we
need to go to how do I make that so I

00:19:47.290 --> 00:19:47.300
need to go to how do I make that so I
 

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.330
need to go to how do I make that so I
can track for all those different screen

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:49.340
can track for all those different screen
 

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:52.150
can track for all those different screen
sizes and networks kind of at the same

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160
sizes and networks kind of at the same
 

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.600
sizes and networks kind of at the same
time right so you need to adjust it

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:55.610

based off of your network type this is

00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:58.460

at this I mean it sounds really cool
right but how do you actually take this

00:20:32.769 --> 00:20:32.779
right but how do you actually take this
 

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:34.989
right but how do you actually take this
and make it look like real things right

00:20:34.989 --> 00:20:34.999
and make it look like real things right

kind of a big deal right so how do I
 

00:21:11.179 --> 00:21:13.319
kind of a big deal right so how do I
take that and condense it down to

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:13.329
take that and condense it down to
 

00:21:13.329 --> 00:21:16.569

mobile web rendering pieces it can all
be convergent you really only need to

00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:32.779
be convergent you really only need to
 

00:21:32.779 --> 00:21:36.279
be convergent you really only need to
have them make it in three sizes those

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:36.289
have them make it in three sizes those
 

00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:40.059
have them make it in three sizes those
three sizes are 1536 by 1904 which is

accounting for the navbar so what we

00:21:55.629 --> 00:21:55.639
accounting for the navbar so what we
 

00:21:55.639 --> 00:21:58.149
accounting for the navbar so what we
have here is basically 4k with navbar

00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159
have here is basically 4k with navbar
 

00:21:58.159 --> 00:22:02.109
have here is basically 4k with navbar
and 4k with hardware buttons and those

00:22:02.109 --> 00:22:02.119
and 4k with hardware buttons and those
 

00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:06.489
and 4k with hardware buttons and those
are just different different scales now

00:22:06.489 --> 00:22:06.499
are just different different scales now
 

00:22:06.499 --> 00:22:09.009
are just different different scales now
what's cool is that basically most of

00:22:09.009 --> 00:22:09.019
what's cool is that basically most of
 

00:22:09.019 --> 00:22:13.629
what's cool is that basically most of

quad-hd scaling and you don't have to

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:20.570
quad-hd scaling and you don't have to
 

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:22.540
quad-hd scaling and you don't have to
worry about that as much so basically

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:22.550
worry about that as much so basically
 

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.730
worry about that as much so basically
your images for Samsung's you can

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:24.740
your images for Samsung's you can

you can actually take these values and
 

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:45.550
you can actually take these values and
directly integrate them into your own

system now this was based off of what we

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:47.660
system now this was based off of what we
 

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:51.670
system now this was based off of what we
considered in scope as far as devices go

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:51.680

so this is stuff that we wanted to

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320
so this is stuff that we wanted to
 

00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.530

to put our data together when we're
 

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.760
to put our data together when we're
using mobile networks or when our users

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:45.770
using mobile networks or when our users
 

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:49.000

that the user doesn't care about and
that honestly in a lot of cases you

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440
that honestly in a lot of cases you
 

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.350
that honestly in a lot of cases you
probably don't need but I know it's hard

sir

00:29:14.659 --> 00:29:14.669
 

00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:20.100
so what's the name of certain API within

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:20.110
so what's the name of certain API within
 

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:22.650
so what's the name of certain API within
Android that makes it really easy for

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:22.660
Android that makes it really easy for
 

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:25.799
Android that makes it really easy for
you to bundle all your data be I in the

far back you win sir the final one is

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:31.390
far back you win sir the final one is
 

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:36.510
far back you win sir the final one is
for you so does anybody have any

00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:36.520
for you so does anybody have any
 

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:37.529
for you so does anybody have any
questions

00:29:37.529 --> 00:29:37.539
questions
 

00:29:37.539 --> 00:29:49.430
questions
oh wow okay lots of questions you sir

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440
 

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:58.860
you're gonna have to repeat that so I

00:29:58.860 --> 00:29:58.870
you're gonna have to repeat that so I
 

00:29:58.870 --> 00:30:01.580
you're gonna have to repeat that so I
have looked at that a little bit really

00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:01.590
have looked at that a little bit really
 

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:06.270
have looked at that a little bit really
so yes I have

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:06.280
so yes I have
 

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.200
so yes I have
it's just that having that implemented

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:09.210
it's just that having that implemented
 

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.940
it's just that having that implemented
I'm unaware of anybody who's actually

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:11.950
I'm unaware of anybody who's actually
 

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.940
I'm unaware of anybody who's actually
like moving towards that at this point

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:14.950
like moving towards that at this point
 

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.960
like moving towards that at this point
so I mean it'd be nice but it's just not

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:18.970
so I mean it'd be nice but it's just not
 

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:22.080
so I mean it'd be nice but it's just not
not happened at this at this stage I

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:22.090
not happened at this at this stage I
 

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:23.850
not happened at this at this stage I
don't think all right any other

00:30:23.850 --> 00:30:23.860
don't think all right any other
 

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:42.049
don't think all right any other
questions

00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059
 

00:30:42.059 --> 00:30:46.310
yes it's defined by that because it's

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320
yes it's defined by that because it's
 

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:50.640
yes it's defined by that because it's
because it's hard to pull data from as

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:50.650
because it's hard to pull data from as
 

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.100
because it's hard to pull data from as
to what your exact speed on that network

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:53.110
to what your exact speed on that network
 

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:55.500
to what your exact speed on that network
is at that point there's some tools that

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:55.510
is at that point there's some tools that
 

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.750
is at that point there's some tools that
allow you to do that and I've also done

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760
allow you to do that and I've also done
 

00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.330
allow you to do that and I've also done
direct tracking so for those those

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:00.340
direct tracking so for those those
 

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:01.830
direct tracking so for those those
numbers those are based off of me

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840
numbers those are based off of me
 

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.220
numbers those are based off of me

possible but it's very unless you have

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:15.640
possible but it's very unless you have
 

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.010
possible but it's very unless you have
something that's constantly pinging

00:31:17.010 --> 00:31:17.020
something that's constantly pinging
 

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.620
something that's constantly pinging
you're never gonna know exactly what

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:19.630
you're never gonna know exactly what
 

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:21.840
you're never gonna know exactly what
time responses and how quickly

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:21.850
time responses and how quickly
 

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.150

something's moving without actually this

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:24.160
something's moving without actually this
 

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.770
something's moving without actually this
this you get for free this is

00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:25.780
this you get for free this is
 

00:31:25.780 --> 00:31:27.240
this you get for free this is
information that's broadcast by the

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:27.250
information that's broadcast by the
 

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:29.730
information that's broadcast by the
system and that you can just plop it in

00:31:29.730 --> 00:31:29.740
system and that you can just plop it in
 

00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:31.860
system and that you can just plop it in
and you can immediately make the best

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:31.870
and you can immediately make the best
 

00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:33.720
and you can immediately make the best
inference that you can as far as the

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:33.730
inference that you can as far as the
 

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:37.110
inference that you can as far as the
network quality goes and you know also

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120
network quality goes and you know also
 

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.060
network quality goes and you know also
be pretty smart when it comes to how

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:39.070
be pretty smart when it comes to how
 

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.820
be pretty smart when it comes to how
you're actually putting stuff together

00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:40.830
you're actually putting stuff together
 

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.520
you're actually putting stuff together
so my average speed when we were using

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:44.530
so my average speed when we were using
 

00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:46.590
so my average speed when we were using
the application was only like 43

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:46.600
the application was only like 43
 

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.120
the application was only like 43
kilobytes per second that's pretty small

00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:50.130
kilobytes per second that's pretty small
 

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.500
kilobytes per second that's pretty small
right so that means that that could

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:52.510
right so that means that that could
 

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.950
right so that means that that could
actually I've made it so that I'm not

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:55.960
actually I've made it so that I'm not
 

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.190
actually I've made it so that I'm not
constantly hitting big numbers and I'm

00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200
constantly hitting big numbers and I'm
 

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.860
constantly hitting big numbers and I'm
using as little network as I can even

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:01.870
using as little network as I can even
 

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.210
using as little network as I can even
though I was on a super high quality

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:03.220
though I was on a super high quality
 

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:05.820
though I was on a super high quality
network right by condensing things I'm

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:05.830
network right by condensing things I'm
 

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:24.779
network right by condensing things I'm
able to make that happen

00:32:24.779 --> 00:32:24.789
 

00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:27.489
see you can you can do both this is

00:32:27.489 --> 00:32:27.499
see you can you can do both this is
 

00:32:27.499 --> 00:32:30.850
see you can you can do both this is
basically just a and if you have

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:30.860
basically just a and if you have
 

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:33.100
basically just a and if you have
something that's critical like that it's

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:33.110
something that's critical like that it's
 

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:37.029
something that's critical like that it's
probably best to do both but it's extra

00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039
probably best to do both but it's extra
 

00:32:37.039 --> 00:32:40.360
probably best to do both but it's extra
computational overhead and that

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:40.370
computational overhead and that
 

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.769
computational overhead and that
something like this allows you to

00:32:41.769 --> 00:32:41.779
something like this allows you to
 

00:32:41.779 --> 00:32:43.299
something like this allows you to
especially when you're not the primary

00:32:43.299 --> 00:32:43.309
especially when you're not the primary
 

00:32:43.309 --> 00:32:45.549
especially when you're not the primary
network sorry they're not the primary

00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559
network sorry they're not the primary
 

00:32:45.559 --> 00:32:48.909
network sorry they're not the primary
application up maybe you're just making

00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919
application up maybe you're just making
 

00:32:48.919 --> 00:32:50.980
application up maybe you're just making
sure that that user session stays active

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:50.990
sure that that user session stays active
 

00:32:50.990 --> 00:32:54.159
sure that that user session stays active
or you're passing back just some metrics

00:32:54.159 --> 00:32:54.169
or you're passing back just some metrics
 

00:32:54.169 --> 00:32:55.299
or you're passing back just some metrics
that you collected while they were

00:32:55.299 --> 00:32:55.309
that you collected while they were
 

00:32:55.309 --> 00:32:57.190
that you collected while they were
actually using the application but maybe

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200
actually using the application but maybe
 

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.560
actually using the application but maybe
you didn't want to interfere with the

00:32:59.560 --> 00:32:59.570
you didn't want to interfere with the
 

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:03.039
you didn't want to interfere with the
application being used at the time so by

00:33:03.039 --> 00:33:03.049
application being used at the time so by
 

00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:05.379
application being used at the time so by
kind of understanding that hey I'm not

00:33:05.379 --> 00:33:05.389
kind of understanding that hey I'm not
 

00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:06.909
kind of understanding that hey I'm not
on a great quality network I'm gonna

00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919
on a great quality network I'm gonna
 

00:33:06.919 --> 00:33:11.139
on a great quality network I'm gonna
wait until I see this number pop up then

00:33:11.139 --> 00:33:11.149
wait until I see this number pop up then
 

00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:13.600
wait until I see this number pop up then
I'm gonna try and shoot it right and you

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:13.610
I'm gonna try and shoot it right and you
 

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.149
I'm gonna try and shoot it right and you
can also use job scheduler to kind of

00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159
can also use job scheduler to kind of
 

00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:18.039
can also use job scheduler to kind of
help with some of that too this is just

00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:18.049
help with some of that too this is just
 

00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:20.680
help with some of that too this is just
kind of there's a whole bunch of

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:20.690
kind of there's a whole bunch of
 

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.119
kind of there's a whole bunch of
sessions that Google is done on job

00:33:22.119 --> 00:33:22.129
sessions that Google is done on job
 

00:33:22.129 --> 00:33:23.710
sessions that Google is done on job
scheduler that you might find really

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:23.720
scheduler that you might find really
 

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.019
scheduler that you might find really
really nice and actually I really want

00:33:26.019 --> 00:33:26.029
really nice and actually I really want
 

00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:29.169
really nice and actually I really want
to go to do it Joanna's doze thing at

00:33:29.169 --> 00:33:29.179
to go to do it Joanna's doze thing at
 

00:33:29.179 --> 00:33:30.549
to go to do it Joanna's doze thing at
some point but I know it's like

00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559
some point but I know it's like
 

00:33:30.559 --> 00:33:33.009
some point but I know it's like
happening at the same time but does that

00:33:33.009 --> 00:33:33.019
happening at the same time but does that
 

00:33:33.019 --> 00:33:34.509
happening at the same time but does that
kinda under answer your question a

00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519
kinda under answer your question a
 

00:33:34.519 --> 00:33:37.480
kinda under answer your question a
little bit all right cool any other

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:37.490
little bit all right cool any other
 

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:50.049
little bit all right cool any other
questions so I found that WebP equality

00:33:50.049 --> 00:33:50.059
questions so I found that WebP equality
 

00:33:50.059 --> 00:33:52.810
questions so I found that WebP equality
is a little bit higher than regular JPEG

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:52.820
is a little bit higher than regular JPEG
 

00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.330
is a little bit higher than regular JPEG
but I think it also depends on what

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:54.340
but I think it also depends on what
 

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:58.690
but I think it also depends on what
compressor you use on your JPEG I'm not

00:33:58.690 --> 00:33:58.700
compressor you use on your JPEG I'm not
 

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:00.609
compressor you use on your JPEG I'm not
super great at knowing like everything

00:34:00.609 --> 00:34:00.619
super great at knowing like everything
 

00:34:00.619 --> 00:34:03.580
super great at knowing like everything
I'm not so I'm a little bit of a pixel

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:03.590
I'm not so I'm a little bit of a pixel
 

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.590
I'm not so I'm a little bit of a pixel
fiend so I'm definitely like we have to

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600
fiend so I'm definitely like we have to
 

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.899
fiend so I'm definitely like we have to
have quiet quality assets but at the

00:34:07.899 --> 00:34:07.909
have quiet quality assets but at the
 

00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:09.849
have quiet quality assets but at the
same point in time you have to determine

00:34:09.849 --> 00:34:09.859
same point in time you have to determine
