00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:09.089
I've never done something like this before. I've seen all kinds of populations of patients in emergency departments,

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.600
but to actually get out in the camps and see their way of life is really giving me some important insight.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.740
This is a consortium of five universities and Emory is the head.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.280
The reason I wanted to come here was because

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.680
I wanted to hone down my clinical skills, keep developing them,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.760
but also to learn about the plights of the migrant farm workers in the United States.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.720
If there's food on your table, thank a farm worker. They're here because we need them. It is a vital aspect of our economy.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.160
They do our hardest tasks. They work for ten hours a day. Their access to health care is very limited.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.360
Being a nurse, you have to be really flexible, and working with a population who possibly doesn't

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.760
speak the same language with you, you have to adapt your methods.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.280
But that's kind of the fun part about it. You kind of have to how be creative and figure out how you're going to take care of the patients.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.560
This is public health on the hoof. We are delivering preventive care and episodic care for the migrant farm workers and their children.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.380
We have always worked with the federally-funded Farmworker Ellington Clinic.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.840
The Emory program has helped us because we've built a lot of partnerships

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.200
and we've been able to contact experts

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.880
in different areas that have been able to help us out with with problems.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.520
At Cox Elementary, the undergraduate nursing students, we rotate through three different stations.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.200
Making sure they're healthy. We look at them head to toe.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.860
Every child gets seen -- they get a full physical, they get dental, they get gross fine motor development.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.580
Then the migrant workers come at night and it is episodic care.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.860
The first night of night camp... it was an an experience. It was a lot more people than I expected. It was a bit hectic at first.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.560
So at the night camps we help with intake of the men. We see what their chief complaints are, see what other

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.540
disciplines they want to see, if they want to see nurse practitioners. We also provide foot care for them.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.340
Some of the common health problems that I've seen amongst the patients here...

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.920
The most prevalent I think is acute back pain.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:28.320
Work-related muscle fatigue from repetitive motion, bending over and picking up and throwing melons into the back of trucks.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.280
They get pesticide rashes.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.300
They get pesticide burns on their feet from standing in the pesticide-laden  water.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.160
It's actually really shocking,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.940
because a lot of the men there are really young, but we'll find that

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.840
their blood pressure is super high, their blood glucose is really high,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.500
haemoglobin could be low.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.520
So even though they're young men that look very healthy, because of the conditions that they're living in, it really shows when we're testing them.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.060
They have more of every kind of problem that you can imagine.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.640
We do a lot of health education, health promotion, prevention.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.840
So we try to advise them to drink water,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.800
eat more leafy greens and vegetables.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.660
But unfortunately, a lot of the men are limited in their access to the kind of food that they got to choose to eat.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.300
So we try to work with them to see what's accessible to them.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.960
It's helping to provide a public health education within the confines of someone's environment.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.220
I really love the interdisciplinary aspect of this program. It's something that I hadn't really experienced before.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.280
It's an interprofessional effort between nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physical therapists, dental hygienists.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.000
And we all work together very well.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.940
So we have a great communication and we all have the same common goal,  which is just to take care of the patients.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.900
I love seeing how the students learn and grow and how they see health care in a different way.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.200
I think that experience like this just keeps you humble.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.440
I really think it's going to help me pause and look at the patient in a much more holistic sense.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.840
I'll be a better provider when I come across different kinds of population.
