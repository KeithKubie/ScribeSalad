00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.490
Use the quadratic formula to
solve the equation, negative x

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.189
squared plus 8x is equal to 1.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.300
Now, in order to really use the
quadratic equation, or to

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.920
figure out what our a's, b's and
c's are, we have to have

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.110
our equation in the form, ax
squared plus bx plus c is

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.490
equal to 0.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.110
And then, if we know our a's,
b's, and c's, we will say that

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.060
the solutions to this equation
are x is equal to negative b

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.480
plus or minus the square root
of b squared minus 4ac-- all

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.730
of that over 2a.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.910
So the first thing we have to
do for this equation right

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.505
here is to put it
in this form.

00:00:40.505 --> 00:00:42.990
And on one side of this
equation, we have a negative x

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.850
squared plus 8x, so that looks
like the first two terms. But

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.220
our constant is on
the other side.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.560
So let's get the constant on the
left hand side and get a 0

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.100
here on the right hand side.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.880
So let's subtract 1 from both
sides of this equation.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.800
The left hand side of the
equation will become negative

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.010
x squared plus 8x minus 1.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.460
And then the right hand
side, 1 minus 1 is 0.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.890
Now we have it in that form.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.725
We have ax squared
a is negative 1.

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:17.900
So let me write this down.
a is equal to negative 1.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.450
a is equal to negative 1.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.695
It's implicit there, you could
put a 1 here if you like.

00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:26.530
A negative 1.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.030
Negative x squared is the same
thing as negative 1x squared.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.210
b is equal to 8.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.270
So b is equal to 8, that's
the 8 right there.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.535
And c is equal to negative 1.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.500
That's the negative
1 right there.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.390
So now we can just apply
the quadratic formula.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.290
The solutions to this equation
are x is equal to negative b.

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:06.190
Plus or minus the square root
of b squared, of 8 squared,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.110
minus 4ac-- let me do it in that
green color --minus 4,

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.430
the green is the part
of the formula.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.990
The colored parts are the things
that we're substituting

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.620
into the formula.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.300
Minus 4 times a, which is
negative 1, times negative 1,

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.640
times c, which is
also negative 1.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.250
And then all of that-- let me
extend the square root sign a

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.080
little bit further --all
of that is going to be

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.570
over 2 times a.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.280
In this case a is negative 1.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.130
So let's simplify this.

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.710
So this becomes negative 8, this
is negative 8, plus or

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.650
minus the square root
of 8 squared is 64.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.700
And then you have a negative 1
times a negative 1, these just

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.850
cancel out just to be a 1.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.370
So it's 64 minus is 4.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.670
That's just that 4 over there.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.050
All of that over negative 2.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.790
So this is equal to negative
8 plus or minus the

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.740
square root of 60.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.850
All of that over negative 2.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.730
And let's see if we can
simplify the radical

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.530
expression here, the
square root of 60.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.500
Let's see, 60 is equal
to 2 times 30.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.620
30 is equal to 2 times 15.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.310
And then 15 is 3 times 5.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.500
So we do have a perfect
square here.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.600
We do have a 2 times
2 in there.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.330
It is 2 times 2 times
15, or 4 times 15.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.620
So we could write, the square
root of 60 is equal to the

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.000
square root of 4 times the
square root of 15, right?

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.810
The square root of 4 times
the square root of 15,

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.850
that's what 60 is.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.420
4 times 15.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.300
And so this is equal to-- square
root of 4 is 2 times

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.700
the square of 15.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.220
So we can rewrite this
expression, right here, as

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.000
being equal to negative 8 plus
or minus 2 times the square

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:09.010
root of 15, all of that
over negative 2.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.480
Now both of these terms right
here are divisible by either 2

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.180
or negative 2.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.380
So let's divide it.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.920
So we have negative 8 divided
by negative 2, which is

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.669
positive 4.

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.029
So let me write it over here.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:25.210
Negative 8 divided by negative
2 is positive 4.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.340
And then you have this
weird thing.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.680
Plus or minus 2 divided
by negative 2.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.070
And really what we have
here is 2 expressions.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.940
But if we're plus 2 and we
divide by negative 2, it will

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.400
be negative 1.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.530
And if we take negative 2 and
divide by negative 2, we're

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.460
going to have positive 1.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.380
So instead of plus or minus, you
could imagine it is going

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.400
to be minus or plus.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.470
But it's really the same thing.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.720
Right?

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.050
It's really now minus or plus.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.570
If it was plus, it's now
going to be a minus.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.595
If it was a minus, it's now
going to be a plus.

00:04:52.595 --> 00:05:00.110
Minus or plus 2 times the
square root of 15.

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.220
Or another way to view it is
that the two solutions here

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:14.090
are 4 minus two roots of 15,
and 4 plus two roots of 15.

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.420
These are both values of x
that'll satisfy this equation.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.670
And if this confuses you, what I
did, turning a plus or minus

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:21.590
into minus plus.

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.550
Let me just take a little
bit of an aside there.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.110
I could write this expression
up here as two expressions.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:29.850
That's what the plus
or minus really is.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.820
There's a negative 8 plus 2
roots of 15 over negative 2.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.100
And then there's a negative
8 minus 2 roots of 15 over

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.060
negative 2.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.030
This one simplifies to--
negative 8 divided by

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.260
negative 2 is 4.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.680
2 divided by negative
2 is negative 1.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.150
2 times a 4 minus the
square root of 15.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.580
And then over here you have
negative 8 divided by negative

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.630
2, which is 4.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.870
And then negative 2 divided by
negative 2, which is plus the

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:01.730
square of 15.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.010
And I just realized I made
a mistake up here.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.030
When we're dividing a 2 divided
by negative 2, we

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.270
don't have this 2 over here.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.040
This is just a plus or
minus the root of 15.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.580
We just saw that when
I did it out here.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.300
So this is minus the
square root of 15.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.300
And this is plus the
square root of 15.

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.540
So the two solutions for this
equation-- It's good that I

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.820
took that little hiatus there,
that little aside there.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.220
The two solutions could be 4
minus the square root of 15,

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.430
or x, or and, x could be 4 plus
the square root of 15.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:37.120
Either of those values of x
will satisfy this original

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.210
quadratic equation.
