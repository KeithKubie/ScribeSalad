00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.110
SUBJECT: I think on day
hikes, it's really easy just

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:07.230
to go out and sort of be
wowed by how big the world is

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.640
and how beautiful it is.

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.240
But when you're on a trail
that is like the PCT,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.940
it's over 2,000
miles, and you're

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.830
doing this day after day,
everything sort of gets

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.379
boiled down to the most
simple parts of your life.

00:00:19.379 --> 00:00:20.795
You wake up and
you eat breakfast.

00:00:20.795 --> 00:00:23.340
You get dressed and you
take down your tent.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.810
And you walk.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.960
In your mind, it's truly just
-- it's slowing things down.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.730
It's steady and it's constant.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.892
And it really, truly is
a very active meditation.

00:00:32.892 --> 00:00:34.350
INTERVIEWER: You
decided you wanted

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.410
to take on the Pacific
Crest Trail, or the PCT.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.280
What is that?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.650
SUBJECT: The Pacific
Crest Trail is

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.840
one of the three biggest
national scenic trails

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.990
in the United States.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.110
It's a footpath that goes
from Mexico to Canada.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.560
It passes through the Mojave
Desert, the southern Sierras,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.390
the high deserts of
Northern California,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.170
the Cascades in
Oregon and Washington.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.830
I've been in this sort of space
of deciding whether or not

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.480
outdoor education
is a career that I

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.190
want to devote the
rest of my life to.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.110
And about a year
and a half ago, I

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.500
said, heck, I want to know
if I can actually do this,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.820
and if I can do it on my own.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.230
INTERVIEWER: How did
your parents react?

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.105
Were they supportive?

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:13.382
SUBJECT: They were
so supportive.

00:01:13.382 --> 00:01:15.090
I remember the first
time I called my mom

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.600
and I said, so, I think
I'm going to hike the PCT.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.810
And she was like,
of course you are.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.355
Like why would you
do anything else?

00:01:23.355 --> 00:01:26.180
INTERVIEWER: What did that feel
like when you first set off,

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.180
and you're on the trail?

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.340
SUBJECT: I was scared.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.970
I was really nervous.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.220
You sort of-- you get
out into the desert,

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.780
and like the first
couple of nights

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.990
you sort of realize
like, oh my gosh.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.880
I'm hiking the PCT.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.920
But I was never alone, you know?

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.440
You're only alone as much as
you want to be on the trail.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.700
There's so many people.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.950
So many good people out there.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.310
And so I kind of teamed
up with a little group,

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.380
and we traveled together
for most of the desert.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.065
And we were able to kind
of go through it together.

00:01:58.026 --> 00:02:00.650
INTERVIEWER: While
you were on the trail,

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.570
a very traumatic
situation happened.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.820
Can you tell me what happened?

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.293
SUBJECT: Yes.

00:02:06.293 --> 00:02:11.280
When I hiked out over Kearsarge
pass with my hiking partner

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.580
and a friend of
mine, I was greeted

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.960
by all of my uncles, and their
partners, and my brother,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.130
and our family dog.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.280
And I was told that
my parents had just

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.340
been killed in a car accident.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.750
Obviously, that rocked my world.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.800
That just changed everything
I thought I knew about myself

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.430
and about what I
was doing there.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.450
After I found out, I
sort of just walked off

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.210
and found a little river.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.230
I remember not being able
to feel any of the water,

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.740
and there was snow everywhere.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.620
It must have been cold, but
I couldn't feel anything.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.900
And I remember starting to say
out loud I have to keep going.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:56.840
I have to keep going.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.780
And it just sort of became
like a chant, almost.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.910
And I was whispering it, and
then I was saying it louder.

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.660
INTERVIEWER: So you
decided to keep going.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.910
SUBJECT: I did.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.887
Yeah.

00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:08.720
I did like dig deep,
and say, you know what?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.340
I'm not going to let this
define myself or my experience,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.132
and I'm going to
be stronger for it.

00:03:16.132 --> 00:03:18.590
You know, I know my parents
wouldn't want me to turn around

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.141
for the world.

00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.450
INTERVIEWER: How did the
trail become a form of therapy

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.210
for you?

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.876
SUBJECT: I would wake
up in the morning,

00:03:25.876 --> 00:03:27.860
and there were some
days where you just

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.310
feel like you've lost all
desire to do anything, really.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.470
The last thing you
want to do is get out

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.190
of your warm sleeping bag and
hike 20 miles, but you do it.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.791
And once you're doing it, just
emotion-- it's everywhere.

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:42.290
It's high.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.790
It's low.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.530
It's just like-- it felt like
it was just yanking me around,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.197
this reality of this.

00:03:47.197 --> 00:03:48.530
My parents are just been killed.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.260
Like, what do you do
with that information?

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.590
The trail just guides you
into this pace of walking,

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.935
and just-- it's the
right speed to travel,

00:03:57.935 --> 00:03:59.660
and it's the right
speed to heal,

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.240
because you're not--
you can't run from this.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.220
You also can't sit still.

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.510
So by walking, you're moving.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.600
You're moving forward,
you're moving through it.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.702
But you're not running from it.

00:04:10.702 --> 00:04:11.820
We're all different.

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.650
We all heal differently,
and this is what

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.202
I need to do to begin to heal.

00:04:19.202 --> 00:04:21.410
INTERVIEWER: How do you
think your parents would feel

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.933
about this journey that
you've taken on and conquered

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:26.790
on the Pacific Crest Trail?

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.160
SUBJECT: I don't think they
would have expected anything

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.180
less, honestly.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.900
The trail became
something different.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:41.445
It no longer became something
that I was doing just for me.

00:04:41.445 --> 00:04:43.409
And I think they'd be
tremendously proud.

00:04:56.666 --> 00:04:58.870
INTERVIEWER: Now
meet Louis Bird,

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.940
an inexperienced
rower who decided

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.620
to cross the Pacific Ocean.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.540

he took up this challenge.
