scholarship here at Columbia and sort of

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890
scholarship here at Columbia and sort of
 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.310
scholarship here at Columbia and sort of
talk about some of the issues that we

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320
talk about some of the issues that we
 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.160
talk about some of the issues that we
encounter with data in journalism and

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170
encounter with data in journalism and
 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.780
encounter with data in journalism and
it's kind of an interesting space for

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790
it's kind of an interesting space for
 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.540
it's kind of an interesting space for
journalists because even though what we

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550
journalists because even though what we
 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.130
journalists because even though what we
call in the field computer-assisted

reporting has actually been around for

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910
reporting has actually been around for
 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.970
reporting has actually been around for
decades it's always for the most part

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980
decades it's always for the most part
 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.630
decades it's always for the most part
been a very niche practice but I am part

been a very niche practice but I am part
 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.030
been a very niche practice but I am part
of a now swelling number of ranks of

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040
of a now swelling number of ranks of
 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.450
of a now swelling number of ranks of
folks in the industry who use data and

basis to produce journalism and also to
publish publish our work so I just sort

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240
publish publish our work so I just sort
 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.750
publish publish our work so I just sort
of wanted to talk about what sort of my

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760
of wanted to talk about what sort of my
 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.400
of wanted to talk about what sort of my
background interest in this comes from

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410
background interest in this comes from
 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.510
background interest in this comes from
the fact that having worked in a

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520
the fact that having worked in a
 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.460
the fact that having worked in a
newsroom in part because this came from

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470
newsroom in part because this came from
 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.160
newsroom in part because this came from
such a small community within the

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170
such a small community within the
 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.020
such a small community within the
industry we don't really have a lot of

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030
industry we don't really have a lot of
 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.150
industry we don't really have a lot of
really well developed practices around

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160
really well developed practices around
 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.570
really well developed practices around
data management and some of our best

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580
data management and some of our best
 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.790
data management and some of our best
efforts we found we're very short coming

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800
efforts we found we're very short coming
 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.470
efforts we found we're very short coming
and it's interesting because I think

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480
and it's interesting because I think
 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.600
and it's interesting because I think
that unlike a lot in a way we're coming

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610
that unlike a lot in a way we're coming
 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.490
that unlike a lot in a way we're coming
at this from the opposite direction that

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500
at this from the opposite direction that
 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.930
at this from the opposite direction that
a lot of people in universities are

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940
a lot of people in universities are
 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.150
a lot of people in universities are
right which is that as journalists were

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160
right which is that as journalists were
 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.979
right which is that as journalists were
generally not the subject matter experts

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989
generally not the subject matter experts
 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.870
generally not the subject matter experts
we're not the people with the data or

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880
we're not the people with the data or
 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.850
we're not the people with the data or
their people who want to sort of be able

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860
their people who want to sort of be able
 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.580
their people who want to sort of be able
to access and interpret the data and so

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590
to access and interpret the data and so
 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.770
to access and interpret the data and so
for us the sort of integrating and

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780
for us the sort of integrating and
 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.160
for us the sort of integrating and
analyze is really is a fun is an

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170
analyze is really is a fun is an
 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.720
analyze is really is a fun is an
essential part of it in a way it's

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730
essential part of it in a way it's
 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.580
essential part of it in a way it's
almost the way that we discover the data

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590
almost the way that we discover the data
 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.240
almost the way that we discover the data
that we use to do our work because

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250
that we use to do our work because
 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.460
that we use to do our work because
access to the data set while it can be

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470
access to the data set while it can be
 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.130
access to the data set while it can be
difficult is only the first part of

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
difficult is only the first part of
 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.570
difficult is only the first part of
making it useful for what we do and the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580
making it useful for what we do and the
 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.949
making it useful for what we do and the
necessity to integrate that with the

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959
necessity to integrate that with the
 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.860
necessity to integrate that with the
expertise of researchers in the field is

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870
expertise of researchers in the field is
 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.199
expertise of researchers in the field is
what actually lets us draw value from it

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209
what actually lets us draw value from it
 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.020
what actually lets us draw value from it
so this is an example of coverage from

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030
so this is an example of coverage from
 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.320
so this is an example of coverage from
the guardian UK during the 2011 riots

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330
the guardian UK during the 2011 riots
 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.240
the guardian UK during the 2011 riots
there I'm not sure how familiar folks

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250
there I'm not sure how familiar folks
 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.160
there I'm not sure how familiar folks
are with this you probably heard that

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170
are with this you probably heard that
 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.270
are with this you probably heard that
you know you probably heard about this

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280
you know you probably heard about this
 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.130
you know you probably heard about this
story what I think was really unique

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140
story what I think was really unique
 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:20.259
story what I think was really unique
about the the use of data and this comes

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269
about the the use of data and this comes
 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.030
about the the use of data and this comes
from the data blog at the Guardian which

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040
from the data blog at the Guardian which
 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.710
from the data blog at the Guardian which
is perhaps best known for its work in

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720
is perhaps best known for its work in
 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.970
is perhaps best known for its work in
the wikileaks case just prior to this

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980
the wikileaks case just prior to this
 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.850
the wikileaks case just prior to this
was that the work that

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860
was that the work that
 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.950
was that the work that
the guardian did and why this was so the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960
the guardian did and why this was so the
 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.510
the guardian did and why this was so the
sort of integrate and analyze part of

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520
sort of integrate and analyze part of
 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.340
sort of integrate and analyze part of
this was that they used a combination of

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350
this was that they used a combination of
 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.530
this was that they used a combination of
data sources in order to sort of

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540
data sources in order to sort of
 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.330
data sources in order to sort of
discover and tell the story of the UK

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340
discover and tell the story of the UK
 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.220
discover and tell the story of the UK
riots so what you're seeing right here

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230
riots so what you're seeing right here
 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.650
riots so what you're seeing right here
is a sort of a variation on a map and i

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660
is a sort of a variation on a map and i
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.450
is a sort of a variation on a map and i
won't i won't risk trying to go to the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460
won't i won't risk trying to go to the
 

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.060
won't i won't risk trying to go to the
live version but what you're seeing is

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070
live version but what you're seeing is
 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.550
live version but what you're seeing is
is sort of the the integration of

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560
is sort of the the integration of
 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.440
is sort of the the integration of
multiple data sets so what the Guardian

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450
multiple data sets so what the Guardian
 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.110
multiple data sets so what the Guardian
did was a combination of use using user

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120
did was a combination of use using user
 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.390
did was a combination of use using user
reports one of the biggest parts of this

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400
reports one of the biggest parts of this
 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.130
reports one of the biggest parts of this
story when it broke was just trying to

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140
story when it broke was just trying to
 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.900
story when it broke was just trying to
find out where the riots were happening

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910
find out where the riots were happening
 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.560
find out where the riots were happening
it was really it really caused a quite a

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570
it was really it really caused a quite a
 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.080
it was really it really caused a quite a
panic in the UK actually the way that

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090
panic in the UK actually the way that
 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.550
panic in the UK actually the way that
these riots spread around the country

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560
these riots spread around the country

of this story the real question was just
 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.099
of this story the real question was just
where are these things happening and so

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109
where are these things happening and so
 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.050

riot related offense and then they
 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.660

overlaid that with with demographic data
 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.760

this is called the deprivation index in

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770
this is called the deprivation index in
 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.560
this is called the deprivation index in
the UK which is basically a measure of

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570
the UK which is basically a measure of
 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:57.930
the UK which is basically a measure of
poverty and this was all inspired by the

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940
poverty and this was all inspired by the
 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.220
poverty and this was all inspired by the
fact that David Cameron had made a

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230
fact that David Cameron had made a
 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.380
fact that David Cameron had made a
public statement that the riots had

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390
public statement that the riots had
 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:06.630
public statement that the riots had
nothing to do with poverty and it seems

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:06.640
nothing to do with poverty and it seems
 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:08.640
nothing to do with poverty and it seems
remarkable which is exactly what the

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650
remarkable which is exactly what the
 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.900
remarkable which is exactly what the
editor thought and which is why this

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910
editor thought and which is why this
 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.260
editor thought and which is why this
analysis was performed it also produced

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:13.270
analysis was performed it also produced
 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:15.390

insights of the story which was the
 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.630
insights of the story which was the
so-called understood as a so-called riot

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:18.640
so-called understood as a so-called riot

commute which in understanding what was

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:20.890
commute which in understanding what was
 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.860
commute which in understanding what was
happening was looking at where people

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870
happening was looking at where people
 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.660
happening was looking at where people
were rioting and actually even before

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670
were rioting and actually even before
 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.750
were rioting and actually even before
this part of the story was told was was

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:27.760
this part of the story was told was was
 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.400
this part of the story was told was was
contrasting where arrest where arrested

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410
contrasting where arrest where arrested
 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.890
contrasting where arrest where arrested
suspects lived versus where they had

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900
suspects lived versus where they had
 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.770
suspects lived versus where they had
rioted and and this became interpreted

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:37.780
rioted and and this became interpreted
 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.120
rioted and and this became interpreted
as the riot commute and what was

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130
as the riot commute and what was
 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.740
as the riot commute and what was
discovered was that it was actually a

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750
discovered was that it was actually a
 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.110
discovered was that it was actually a
very organized effort it wasn't people

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120
very organized effort it wasn't people
 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.210
very organized effort it wasn't people
sort of running into the streets enraged

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220

they were leaving their homes they were
getting on the nearest train they were

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990
getting on the nearest train they were
 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.360
getting on the nearest train they were
traveling to city centres and then they

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370
traveling to city centres and then they
 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.040
traveling to city centres and then they
were rioting in particular locations and

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050
were rioting in particular locations and
 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.840
were rioting in particular locations and
at particular times which gave a very

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850

like Facebook and Twitter had been used

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:41.200
like Facebook and Twitter had been used
 

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.500
like Facebook and Twitter had been used
to organize these riots and therefore

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:43.510
to organize these riots and therefore
 

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:45.720
to organize these riots and therefore
needed the UK government needed a

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:45.730

down these services in the case of
 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.260
down these services in the case of
public emergency and this is a pretty

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:52.270
public emergency and this is a pretty
 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:54.240
public emergency and this is a pretty
significant issue particularly in the UK

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.250
significant issue particularly in the UK
 

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.260

two data sets as you can imagine we miss
 

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.590
two data sets as you can imagine we miss
a lot of both of these pictures so

00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600
a lot of both of these pictures so
 

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.049

and so it misses out on a lot of the

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:49.900
and as those engagements move online we
 

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.780
and as those engagements move online we
can begin to track them now sometimes

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:51.790
can begin to track them now sometimes
 

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:54.540
can begin to track them now sometimes
some types of tracking or creepy and

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:54.550
some types of tracking or creepy and
 

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.160
some types of tracking or creepy and
aren't appropriate but some types of

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:56.170
aren't appropriate but some types of
 

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:58.410
aren't appropriate but some types of
tracking are very appropriate and things

00:18:58.410 --> 00:18:58.420
tracking are very appropriate and things
 

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.220
tracking are very appropriate and things
that we should be building I heard

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:00.230
that we should be building I heard
 

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:02.740
that we should be building I heard
and things that we should be building

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:02.750
and things that we should be building
 

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:06.220
and things that we should be building
into our tool and into our platforms and

this is in fact the social norm in
 

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.970
this is in fact the social norm in
social media today so Twitter we just

social media today so Twitter we just
 

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.630
social media today so Twitter we just
heard at Twitter and and mendeley and

engagements at appropriate at an
appropriate level of granularity and an

appropriate level of granularity and an
 

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:27.150
appropriate level of granularity and an
accepted level of granularity so as our

accepted level of granularity so as our
 

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.770
accepted level of granularity so as our
engagements move online we can track

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:29.780
engagements move online we can track
 

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.620
engagements move online we can track
them and then we can analyze data about

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:32.630
them and then we can analyze data about
 

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.280
them and then we can analyze data about
our data and from this we can inform our

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:36.290
our data and from this we can inform our
 

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:38.799

data learn to build our tools all the
 

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.200
data learn to build our tools all the
things that I think people will be

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:44.210
things that I think people will be
 

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:45.490
things that I think people will be
talking about earlier today and we'll

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:45.500
talking about earlier today and we'll
 

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.020
talking about earlier today and we'll
talk about later again this this all

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:50.030
talk about later again this this all
 

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:51.850
talk about later again this this all
when we think about all the different

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:51.860
when we think about all the different
 

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.500
when we think about all the different
types of engagement and all the

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:53.510
types of engagement and all the
 

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:55.750
types of engagement and all the
different types of engages it lets us

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760
different types of engages it lets us
 

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.360
different types of engages it lets us
move from a metric of is the data

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:58.370

measured by citations which is good but
 

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.510

still just one dimensional that doesn't

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520
still just one dimensional that doesn't
 

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.130
still just one dimensional that doesn't
capture everything and it makes a

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:15.140
capture everything and it makes a
 

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:16.630
capture everything and it makes a
one-dimensional set of winners and

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640
one-dimensional set of winners and
 

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.720

losers to a real palette which I like to
 

00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.020
losers to a real palette which I like to
think of as a flavor palate um and which

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:23.030
think of as a flavor palate um and which
 

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.669

I like to think of in terms of ice cream

00:20:24.669 --> 00:20:24.679
I like to think of in terms of ice cream
 

00:20:24.679 --> 00:20:28.289
I like to think of in terms of ice cream
because ice cream is delicious so um so

00:20:28.289 --> 00:20:28.299
because ice cream is delicious so um so
 

00:20:28.299 --> 00:20:30.789
because ice cream is delicious so um so
people could argue that there's one best

kind of ice cream say chocolate and many
people would agree with them but that

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:35.179
people would agree with them but that
 

00:20:35.179 --> 00:20:37.090
people would agree with them but that
really depends on your use most people

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:37.100
really depends on your use most people
 

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.680

just lots of kinds of ice cream we want
 

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:54.730
just lots of kinds of ice cream we want
them all to exist which means we need

for example there could be data sets

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:02.090
for example there could be data sets
 

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:05.020

many types of data sets it's important
 

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.500
many types of data sets it's important
that we analyze the data about our data

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:52.510
that we analyze the data about our data
 

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.620
that we analyze the data about our data
to be able to get these nuances and I'll

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:55.630
to be able to get these nuances and I'll
 

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.100
to be able to get these nuances and I'll
mention because I often i often don't

00:21:59.100 --> 00:21:59.110
mention because I often i often don't
 

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.740
mention because I often i often don't
because it's still in the future but um

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:01.750
because it's still in the future but um
 

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.170
because it's still in the future but um
all of these things that i've talked

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:04.180
all of these things that i've talked
 

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:06.630
all of these things that i've talked
about are largely in terms of

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640
about are largely in terms of
 

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:09.360
about are largely in terms of
quantitative numbers but obviously what

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:09.370
quantitative numbers but obviously what
 

00:22:09.370 --> 00:22:11.340
quantitative numbers but obviously what
we really want to get to is qualitative

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:11.350
we really want to get to is qualitative
 

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:13.170
we really want to get to is qualitative
information and real world changing

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:13.180
information and real world changing
 

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:15.420
information and real world changing
impact that still beyond most of what we

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:15.430
impact that still beyond most of what we
 

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.430
impact that still beyond most of what we
can do but that's that's obviously the

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440
can do but that's that's obviously the
 

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:20.520
can do but that's that's obviously the
goal to measure impact flavor even more

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:20.530
goal to measure impact flavor even more
 

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:23.640
goal to measure impact flavor even more
deeply than than is simple today so how

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:23.650
deeply than than is simple today so how
 

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:26.310
deeply than than is simple today so how
can we do all of this what is possible

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320
can we do all of this what is possible
 

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.850
can we do all of this what is possible
now what data exists and how can we

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:29.860
now what data exists and how can we
 

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.060
now what data exists and how can we
analyze it I'm going to go through these

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:32.070
analyze it I'm going to go through these
 

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.470
analyze it I'm going to go through these
briefly and then hopefully we can have

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480
briefly and then hopefully we can have
 

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.170
briefly and then hopefully we can have
good questions at the end after all the

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:37.180
good questions at the end after all the
 

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.700
good questions at the end after all the
sessions so I'm going to be talking

doing more of this will help us
 

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.590
doing more of this will help us
understand impact better secondly more

support for all types of engagement so

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880
support for all types of engagement so
 

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.870

right now um when metrics exist they

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880
right now um when metrics exist they
 

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.410
right now um when metrics exist they

that you're doing can be done
automatically and where we look for for

would like to be able to do but perhaps

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:22.330
would like to be able to do but perhaps
 

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:27.120
would like to be able to do but perhaps
are not able to yet so i'm wondering in

00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:27.130
are not able to yet so i'm wondering in
 

00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:29.670
are not able to yet so i'm wondering in
particular about the analysis of

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680
particular about the analysis of
 

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:33.450
particular about the analysis of
unstructured data like text video or

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:33.460
unstructured data like text video or
 

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:38.510
unstructured data like text video or
speech so Susan you you talked about the

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:38.520
speech so Susan you you talked about the
 

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.760
speech so Susan you you talked about the
analysis of the Medicare data and needed

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:41.770
analysis of the Medicare data and needed
 

00:42:41.770 --> 00:42:43.800
analysis of the Medicare data and needed
to be able to look at the columns and

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:43.810
to be able to look at the columns and
 

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:47.579
to be able to look at the columns and
you still then had a table or a chart

00:42:47.579 --> 00:42:47.589
you still then had a table or a chart
 

00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:50.250
you still then had a table or a chart
and I'm wondering whether if you're able

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:50.260
and I'm wondering whether if you're able
 

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.760
and I'm wondering whether if you're able
to look in at some kind of text if that

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:53.770
to look in at some kind of text if that
 

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:57.870
to look in at some kind of text if that
could tell you more and for heather i

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880
could tell you more and for heather i
 

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:00.900
could tell you more and for heather i
would ask in your analysis of citations

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:00.910
would ask in your analysis of citations
 

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:04.710
would ask in your analysis of citations
whether if you're able to look in at the

00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720
whether if you're able to look in at the
 

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.410
whether if you're able to look in at the
text and to see what people are saying

00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:07.420
text and to see what people are saying
 

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.140
text and to see what people are saying
about the citations if that could help

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:10.150
about the citations if that could help
 

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:12.570
about the citations if that could help
you more in terms of coming up with

00:43:12.570 --> 00:43:12.580
you more in terms of coming up with
 

00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:16.410
you more in terms of coming up with
impact so maybe Susan thank you yeah so

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:16.420
impact so maybe Susan thank you yeah so
 

00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.450
impact so maybe Susan thank you yeah so
I also take this as an opportunity to do

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:18.460
I also take this as an opportunity to do
 

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:19.950
I also take this as an opportunity to do
a small plug which is that also at the

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:19.960
a small plug which is that also at the
 

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.359
a small plug which is that also at the
journalism school and part of something

00:43:21.359 --> 00:43:21.369
journalism school and part of something
 

00:43:21.369 --> 00:43:22.410
journalism school and part of something
called the towel center for digital

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:22.420
called the towel center for digital
 

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.140
called the towel center for digital
journalism which among other things

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:25.150

overseas a dual degree program in

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:26.680
overseas a dual degree program in
 

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.730
overseas a dual degree program in
computer science and journalism so I

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:29.740
computer science and journalism so I
 

00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:32.339
computer science and journalism so I
think in journalism I mean our field is

00:43:32.339 --> 00:43:32.349
think in journalism I mean our field is
 

00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:33.810
think in journalism I mean our field is
actually turning very much towards

00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:33.820
actually turning very much towards
 

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.020
actually turning very much towards
computer science and in it least insofar

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:37.030
computer science and in it least insofar
 

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:38.400
computer science and in it least insofar
as you say to sort of we're very

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:38.410
as you say to sort of we're very
 

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:40.110
as you say to sort of we're very
pragmatic people right so we want to

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:40.120
pragmatic people right so we want to
 

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:45.240
pragmatic people right so we want to
a problem and you know text analysis i

00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:45.250
a problem and you know text analysis i
 

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.050

journalists there there are a lot of
 

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:52.320
journalists there there are a lot of
things that we can do and i have a bit

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:52.330
things that we can do and i have a bit
 

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:54.000
things that we can do and i have a bit
of a background in computer science but

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:54.010
of a background in computer science but
 

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:55.200
of a background in computer science but
when we start to talk about text

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:55.210
when we start to talk about text
 

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:56.720
when we start to talk about text

enormous amount of capacity I mean it's
 

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:11.010
enormous amount of capacity I mean it's
both in the journalism and frankly in

both in the journalism and frankly in

just you know I mean I think something

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:20.860
just you know I mean I think something
 

00:44:20.860 --> 00:44:23.370
just you know I mean I think something
like WikiLeaks is a perfect example and

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:23.380
like WikiLeaks is a perfect example and

and what we tend to do often or where

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200
and what we tend to do often or where
 

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.710

the our field is moving is both in

00:44:28.710 --> 00:44:28.720
the our field is moving is both in
 

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.820
the our field is moving is both in
reaching out to computer science and

00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:29.830
reaching out to computer science and
 

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.070
reaching out to computer science and
reaching out to our audience and I think

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:32.080
reaching out to our audience and I think
 

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.930
reaching out to our audience and I think
this is actually where you know some of

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:33.940
this is actually where you know some of
 

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.150
this is actually where you know some of
what Heather was talking about really

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160
what Heather was talking about really
 

00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.040
what Heather was talking about really
sort of resonates is this idea that we

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:38.050
sort of resonates is this idea that we
 

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:40.650
sort of resonates is this idea that we
can look at what people are doing with

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:40.660
can look at what people are doing with
 

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:44.130
can look at what people are doing with
our data and and saying about it her

00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:44.140
our data and and saying about it her
 

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:45.840

example brought to mind the fact that

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:45.850
example brought to mind the fact that
 

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:47.670
example brought to mind the fact that
the Guardian data blog that I mentioned

00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680
the Guardian data blog that I mentioned
 

00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:50.430
the Guardian data blog that I mentioned
was one of the first outlets to

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:50.440
was one of the first outlets to
 

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:51.870
was one of the first outlets to
aggressively publish the data behind

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880
aggressively publish the data behind
 

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.320
aggressively publish the data behind
their articles and and that's one of the

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:55.330
their articles and and that's one of the
 

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:57.420
their articles and and that's one of the
ways they generated such an active

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:57.430
ways they generated such an active
 

00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:00.120
ways they generated such an active
readership and they also very often put

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:00.130
readership and they also very often put
 

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:02.160
readership and they also very often put
out calls to their readers to do

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:02.170
out calls to their readers to do
 

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:05.580
out calls to their readers to do
analysis and visualization and say what

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:05.590
analysis and visualization and say what
 

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:06.600
analysis and visualization and say what
do you make of this I know they're

00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:06.610
do you make of this I know they're
 

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:08.520
do you make of this I know they're
running a contest right now so I think

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:08.530
running a contest right now so I think
 

00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:10.740
running a contest right now so I think
there's a two-pronged approach the

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:10.750
there's a two-pronged approach the
 

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:13.650
there's a two-pronged approach the
challenge is that again as journalists

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:13.660
challenge is that again as journalists
 

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.090
challenge is that again as journalists
we don't have the expertise all the time

00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:15.100
we don't have the expertise all the time
 

00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:18.120
we don't have the expertise all the time
and so it's it's it's hard to engage the

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:18.130
and so it's it's it's hard to engage the
 

00:45:18.130 --> 00:45:19.650
and so it's it's it's hard to engage the
computer science when you don't know

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:19.660
computer science when you don't know
 

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.290
computer science when you don't know
what you're looking for but at the same

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:22.300
what you're looking for but at the same
 

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:26.490
what you're looking for but at the same
time and so for us the the the flip side

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:26.500
time and so for us the the the flip side
 

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.470
time and so for us the the the flip side
of that is engaging our readers who very

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480
of that is engaging our readers who very
 

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:32.000
of that is engaging our readers who very
often have expertise that we don't have

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:32.010
often have expertise that we don't have
 

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:35.100
often have expertise that we don't have
Heather do you work the comments yeah

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:35.110
Heather do you work the comments yeah
 

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:36.840
Heather do you work the comments yeah
I'd love to comment um it's a great

00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:36.850
I'd love to comment um it's a great
 

00:45:36.850 --> 00:45:39.360
I'd love to comment um it's a great
point so I think in terms of text

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:39.370
point so I think in terms of text
 

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:41.700
point so I think in terms of text
analysis which maybe I'll just answer it

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:41.710
analysis which maybe I'll just answer it
 

00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:43.470
analysis which maybe I'll just answer it
from that perspective there is a lot

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:43.480
from that perspective there is a lot
 

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:44.970
from that perspective there is a lot
that we could learn from computer

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:44.980
that we could learn from computer
 

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.340
that we could learn from computer
science and and the computer science

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:47.350
science and and the computer science
 

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:48.990
science and and the computer science
could help with in fact it's a

00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.000
could help with in fact it's a
 

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.760
could help with in fact it's a
frustration for me a huge frustration

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:50.770
frustration for me a huge frustration
 

00:45:50.770 --> 00:45:53.440
frustration for me a huge frustration
that um that

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:53.450
that um that
 

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:56.339
that um that
computer scientists right now often use

00:45:56.339 --> 00:45:56.349
computer scientists right now often use
 

00:45:56.349 --> 00:46:01.210
computer scientists right now often use
movie reviews and they use Twitter

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:01.220
movie reviews and they use Twitter
 

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.880
movie reviews and they use Twitter
archives and things for doing their text

00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:03.890
archives and things for doing their text
 

00:46:03.890 --> 00:46:05.920
archives and things for doing their text
analysis because our research papers

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:05.930
analysis because our research papers
 

00:46:05.930 --> 00:46:08.829
analysis because our research papers
aren't available for them to easily mine

00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839
aren't available for them to easily mine
 

00:46:08.839 --> 00:46:12.700
aren't available for them to easily mine
and this means that the every every text

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:12.710
and this means that the every every text
 

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:16.060
and this means that the every every text
mining problem is most easily customized

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:16.070
mining problem is most easily customized
 

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:18.130
mining problem is most easily customized
it works best when it's customized to

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:18.140
it works best when it's customized to
 

00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:21.750
it works best when it's customized to
the type of content and we're behind on

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760
the type of content and we're behind on
 

00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:24.280
the type of content and we're behind on
doing text analysis on the type of

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:24.290
doing text analysis on the type of
 

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:26.260
doing text analysis on the type of
writing that scientific papers and other

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:26.270
writing that scientific papers and other
 

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:28.150
writing that scientific papers and other
research is written in because that text

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:28.160
research is written in because that text
 

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.089
research is written in because that text
isn't available um so so some of the

00:46:31.089 --> 00:46:31.099
isn't available um so so some of the
 

00:46:31.099 --> 00:46:33.190
isn't available um so so some of the
things that computer scientists right

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200
things that computer scientists right
 

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.319
things that computer scientists right
now doing using the type of queries that

00:46:38.319 --> 00:46:38.329
now doing using the type of queries that
 

00:46:38.329 --> 00:46:43.980
now doing using the type of queries that
we can easily do which is binary queries

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:43.990
 

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:48.880
on text that is an open access um we we

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:48.890
on text that is an open access um we we
 

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.220
on text that is an open access um we we
can't even find out when when some when

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:51.230
can't even find out when when some when
 

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:53.020
can't even find out when when some when

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:07.460
that data and and it's about their paper
 

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:08.950
that data and and it's about their paper
believe me I would have tried to do this

00:47:08.950 --> 00:47:08.960
believe me I would have tried to do this
 

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.480
believe me I would have tried to do this
and it is really and others have tried

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:10.490
and it is really and others have tried
 

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:12.520
and it is really and others have tried
to and it is not easy and that is the

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:12.530
to and it is not easy and that is the
 

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:15.970
to and it is not easy and that is the
most simple of tasks right now it's it's

00:47:15.970 --> 00:47:15.980
most simple of tasks right now it's it's
 

00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.059
most simple of tasks right now it's it's
unstructured data but it's important to

00:47:19.059 --> 00:47:19.069
unstructured data but it's important to
 

00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:21.010
unstructured data but it's important to
go beyond that to write and understand

00:47:21.010 --> 00:47:21.020
go beyond that to write and understand
 

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.490
go beyond that to write and understand

ARPA and so we are looking at some of

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:24.250
ARPA and so we are looking at some of
 

00:48:24.250 --> 00:48:26.610
ARPA and so we are looking at some of
these issues it would be you know great

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:26.620
these issues it would be you know great
 

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.310
these issues it would be you know great
to get together with you and talk about

00:48:29.310 --> 00:48:29.320
to get together with you and talk about
 

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.680
to get together with you and talk about
how we could combine our talents but I I

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:31.690
how we could combine our talents but I I
 

00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:37.080
how we could combine our talents but I I
would second your plug all our data we

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:37.090
would second your plug all our data we
 

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:40.320
would second your plug all our data we
can only access on the government's

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:40.330
can only access on the government's
 

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:47.160
can only access on the government's
computers because the with the the

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:47.170
computers because the with the the
 

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:49.380

publishers have not made it open access

00:48:49.380 --> 00:48:49.390
publishers have not made it open access
 

00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:53.220
publishers have not made it open access
so we have to do all our computation not

00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:53.230
so we have to do all our computation not
 

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:56.220
so we have to do all our computation not
on our local computers precisely because

00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:56.230
on our local computers precisely because
 

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:59.310
on our local computers precisely because
of the copyright issues so if I get you

00:48:59.310 --> 00:48:59.320
of the copyright issues so if I get you

of the copyright issues so if I get you
on that if I could just jump in to say

00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:01.510
on that if I could just jump in to say
 

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:03.600
on that if I could just jump in to say
that's not an excuse for any of us right

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:03.610
that's not an excuse for any of us right
 

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:04.920
that's not an excuse for any of us right
I think you would agree with this we

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:04.930
I think you would agree with this we
 

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:06.780
I think you would agree with this we
need to keep asking and we need to keep

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:06.790
need to keep asking and we need to keep
 

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:08.310
need to keep asking and we need to keep
demanding both you never know what

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:08.320
demanding both you never know what

you're going to get and people won't
give it to unless they recognize that

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:12.070
give it to unless they recognize that
 

00:49:12.070 --> 00:49:14.400
give it to unless they recognize that
there's a real need so we all need to

00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:14.410
there's a real need so we all need to
 

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:15.900
there's a real need so we all need to
ask and I think that's part of our

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:15.910
ask and I think that's part of our
 

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:18.840
ask and I think that's part of our
responsibility all right so let's open

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:18.850
responsibility all right so let's open
 

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:29.370
responsibility all right so let's open
up to the audience yeah Oh over here in

I would recommend that you do your
 

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:50.800
I would recommend that you do your
analysis on open access articles this

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:50.810
analysis on open access articles this
 

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:54.550
analysis on open access articles this
way you're ignoring the publishers works

00:49:54.550 --> 00:49:54.560
way you're ignoring the publishers works
 

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.710
way you're ignoring the publishers works
that they're not enabling you to use and

00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720
that they're not enabling you to use and
 

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.990
that they're not enabling you to use and
you're rewarding the open access

00:49:58.990 --> 00:49:59.000
you're rewarding the open access
 

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.020
you're rewarding the open access
articles we we do on open access as well

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:05.030
articles we we do on open access as well
 

00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:07.599
articles we we do on open access as well
but there's an order of magnitude larger

00:50:07.599 --> 00:50:07.609
but there's an order of magnitude larger
 

00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:09.880
but there's an order of magnitude larger
number of articles that we have

00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:09.890
number of articles that we have
 

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:11.890
number of articles that we have
available to us that are not open access

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:11.900

this is a general question about

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:56.630
this is a general question about
 

00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:59.380
this is a general question about
integration so and how would you

00:50:59.380 --> 00:50:59.390
integration so and how would you
 

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:01.720
integration so and how would you
describe in simple words what do you

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:01.730
describe in simple words what do you

think are the most challenging barriers

00:51:05.290 --> 00:51:05.300
think are the most challenging barriers
 

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.890
think are the most challenging barriers
for you in integrating your ether genius

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:08.900
for you in integrating your ether genius
 

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.800
for you in integrating your ether genius
data so well it's more about the

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:11.810
data so well it's more about the
 

00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:13.660
data so well it's more about the
structure it's more about the semantics

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:13.670
structure it's more about the semantics
 

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:17.500
structure it's more about the semantics
I don't know whatever you think i would

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:17.510
I don't know whatever you think i would
 

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:20.410
I don't know whatever you think i would
say in our field for journalism one of

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:20.420
say in our field for journalism one of
 

00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.150
say in our field for journalism one of
the biggest problems we have is just

00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160
the biggest problems we have is just
 

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.690
the biggest problems we have is just
this the siloed coding so I mean the

00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:25.700
this the siloed coding so I mean the
 

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:28.240
this the siloed coding so I mean the
coding as in the end coding of the same

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:28.250
coding as in the end coding of the same
 

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:31.510
coding as in the end coding of the same
entity with different references and the

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520
entity with different references and the
 

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.309
entity with different references and the
inability the lack of knowledge about

00:51:33.309 --> 00:51:33.319

00:51:33.319 --> 00:51:36.640
inability the lack of knowledge about
how to correlate those you know followed

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:36.650
how to correlate those you know followed
 

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:40.380
how to correlate those you know followed
by just sort of format differences right

00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:40.390
by just sort of format differences right
 

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:43.480
by just sort of format differences right
so that that's a big that's a big issue

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:43.490
so that that's a big that's a big issue
 

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:46.099
so that that's a big that's a big issue
for us

00:51:46.099 --> 00:51:46.109
 

00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:52.109
i guess i would i would say that a big

00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:52.119
i guess i would i would say that a big
 

00:51:52.119 --> 00:51:56.010
i guess i would i would say that a big
issue also is is knowing what the

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:56.020
issue also is is knowing what the
 

00:51:56.020 --> 00:51:58.170
issue also is is knowing what the
integrations actually done when you

00:51:58.170 --> 00:51:58.180
integrations actually done when you
 

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:00.480
integrations actually done when you
zipper two things together certain

have you you know have you what have you
 

00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.349
have you you know have you what have you
left behind what you know often when

00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359
left behind what you know often when
 

00:52:07.359 --> 00:52:09.230
left behind what you know often when
you're doing this on large data sets

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240
you're doing this on large data sets
 

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:11.460
you're doing this on large data sets
it's a little bit difficult to know

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:11.470
it's a little bit difficult to know
 

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:13.770
it's a little bit difficult to know
what's there and what's been what you

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:13.780
what's there and what's been what you
 

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.660
what's there and what's been what you
know what sort of systemic things might

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:15.670
know what sort of systemic things might
 

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:17.990
know what sort of systemic things might
have happened in the process so

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000
have happened in the process so
 

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:21.300
have happened in the process so

students to to start to ask those

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200
students to to start to ask those
 

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.230
students to to start to ask those
questions right to interrogate that

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:25.240
questions right to interrogate that
 

00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.730
questions right to interrogate that
process a little bit more to open it up

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:26.740
process a little bit more to open it up
 

00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.200
process a little bit more to open it up
a little bit more and then also to

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:28.210
a little bit more and then also to
 

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.300
a little bit more and then also to

steps are often steps that are you know

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:32.830
steps are often steps that are you know
 

00:52:32.830 --> 00:52:34.290
steps are often steps that are you know
maybe it happens in a spreadsheet

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:34.300
maybe it happens in a spreadsheet
 

00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.060
maybe it happens in a spreadsheet
somewhere maybe it happens in a bit and

00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:36.070
somewhere maybe it happens in a bit and
 

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:37.800
somewhere maybe it happens in a bit and
you know how do you document that how do

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:37.810
you know how do you document that how do
 

00:52:37.810 --> 00:52:39.450
you know how do you document that how do
you keep track of those steps so someone

00:52:39.450 --> 00:52:39.460
you keep track of those steps so someone
 

00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:44.160
you keep track of those steps so someone
later can build on it I'd say data that

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:44.170
later can build on it I'd say data that
 

00:52:44.170 --> 00:52:47.490
later can build on it I'd say data that

one of our colleagues pointed out that

00:52:59.490 --> 00:52:59.500
one of our colleagues pointed out that
 

00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:02.250
one of our colleagues pointed out that
tenure is a very strong motivator in our

00:53:02.250 --> 00:53:02.260
tenure is a very strong motivator in our
 

00:53:02.260 --> 00:53:05.490
tenure is a very strong motivator in our
community and during your presentation

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:05.500
community and during your presentation
 

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:10.710
community and during your presentation
it occurred to me that what would appear

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720
it occurred to me that what would appear
 

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:13.440
it occurred to me that what would appear
in a tenure promotion packet of the

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:13.450
in a tenure promotion packet of the
 

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:15.720
in a tenure promotion packet of the
future would be an interesting thing to

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:15.730
future would be an interesting thing to
 

00:53:15.730 --> 00:53:17.730
future would be an interesting thing to
wireframe could you describe some of the

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:17.740
wireframe could you describe some of the
 

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.290
wireframe could you describe some of the
components I may think you had a slide

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:19.300
components I may think you had a slide
 

00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:22.770
components I may think you had a slide
eventually that had some features on it

00:53:22.770 --> 00:53:22.780
eventually that had some features on it
 

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:24.420
eventually that had some features on it
but what what would you expect to see

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:24.430
but what what would you expect to see
 

00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:27.839
but what what would you expect to see
there for sure and I'll in fact take the

00:53:27.839 --> 00:53:27.849
there for sure and I'll in fact take the
 

00:53:27.849 --> 00:53:30.750
there for sure and I'll in fact take the
opportunity to plug a publication that I

00:53:30.750 --> 00:53:30.760
opportunity to plug a publication that I
 

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:34.800
opportunity to plug a publication that I
had in January in nature which is not an

00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:34.810
had in January in nature which is not an
 

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:37.170
had in January in nature which is not an
open-access publication I will admit it

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:37.180
open-access publication I will admit it
 

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:40.050
open-access publication I will admit it
was a comment so please shoot me now so

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:40.060
was a comment so please shoot me now so
 

00:53:40.060 --> 00:53:45.240
was a comment so please shoot me now so
um so I think that the great thing about

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:45.250
um so I think that the great thing about
 

00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:47.400
um so I think that the great thing about
alternative products and including those

00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:47.410
alternative products and including those
 

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:49.829
alternative products and including those
in tenure and in grant applications

00:53:49.829 --> 00:53:49.839
in tenure and in grant applications
 

00:53:49.839 --> 00:53:52.620
in tenure and in grant applications
which are key times and hiring which are

00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:52.630
which are key times and hiring which are
 

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:54.210
which are key times and hiring which are
key times when people are making the

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:54.220
key times when people are making the
 

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:56.940
key times when people are making the
case that they've had impact a great

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:56.950
case that they've had impact a great
 

00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:58.560
case that they've had impact a great
thing about alternative products like

00:53:58.560 --> 00:53:58.570
thing about alternative products like
 

00:53:58.570 --> 00:53:59.700
thing about alternative products like
data sets is

00:53:59.700 --> 00:53:59.710
data sets is
 

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:02.570
data sets is
they don't have an established impact

00:54:02.570 --> 00:54:02.580
they don't have an established impact
 

00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:05.099
they don't have an established impact
thing to rely on like journal impact

00:54:05.099 --> 00:54:05.109
thing to rely on like journal impact
 

00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:08.310
thing to rely on like journal impact
factor and they they can't easily get

00:54:08.310 --> 00:54:08.320
factor and they they can't easily get
 

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:11.579
factor and they they can't easily get
one and that means that the impact

00:54:11.579 --> 00:54:11.589
one and that means that the impact
 

00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:14.010
one and that means that the impact
metrics I think will be data set level

00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:14.020
metrics I think will be data set level
 

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:15.870
metrics I think will be data set level
they won't be about the container they

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:15.880
they won't be about the container they
 

00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.970
they won't be about the container they
won't be about where it's hosted they'll

00:54:17.970 --> 00:54:17.980
won't be about where it's hosted they'll
 

00:54:17.980 --> 00:54:19.290
won't be about where it's hosted they'll
be about the impact that that particular

00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:19.300
be about the impact that that particular
 

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:22.609
be about the impact that that particular
item has made and so I think that um

00:54:22.609 --> 00:54:22.619
item has made and so I think that um
 

00:54:22.619 --> 00:54:26.609
item has made and so I think that um
that those metrics should be sometimes

00:54:26.609 --> 00:54:26.619
that those metrics should be sometimes
 

00:54:26.619 --> 00:54:29.310
that those metrics should be sometimes
quantitative with numbers and context

00:54:29.310 --> 00:54:29.320
quantitative with numbers and context
 

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:31.589
quantitative with numbers and context
and context that's relevant for that

00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599
and context that's relevant for that
 

00:54:31.599 --> 00:54:33.120
and context that's relevant for that
particular situation whether it's

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:33.130
particular situation whether it's
 

00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:34.829
particular situation whether it's
discipline specific or data type

00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839
discipline specific or data type
 

00:54:34.839 --> 00:54:37.650
discipline specific or data type
specific or and I think they should also

00:54:37.650 --> 00:54:37.660
specific or and I think they should also
 

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:40.109
specific or and I think they should also
often be qualitative so so the

00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.119
often be qualitative so so the
 

00:54:40.119 --> 00:54:42.390
often be qualitative so so the
quantitative numbers are often a place

00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400
quantitative numbers are often a place
 

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.150
quantitative numbers are often a place
to drill in and start to see um who's

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.160
to drill in and start to see um who's
 

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.430
to drill in and start to see um who's
done what with it and and and find the

00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440
done what with it and and and find the
 

00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.839
done what with it and and and find the
deeper story and so there should often

00:54:48.839 --> 00:54:48.849
deeper story and so there should often
 

00:54:48.849 --> 00:54:51.060
deeper story and so there should often
be a sentence or two like that I think

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:51.070
be a sentence or two like that I think
 

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:54.000
be a sentence or two like that I think
some funders are starting to suggest

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:54.010
some funders are starting to suggest
 

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:56.130
some funders are starting to suggest
having sentences like that and that

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:56.140
having sentences like that and that
 

00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:58.980
having sentences like that and that
accompany grants yeah if I can add to

00:54:58.980 --> 00:54:58.990
accompany grants yeah if I can add to
 

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:05.760
accompany grants yeah if I can add to
that the interesting thing so the the

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:05.770
that the interesting thing so the the
 

00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:09.390
that the interesting thing so the the
idea that a data set or in my field code

00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:09.400
idea that a data set or in my field code
 

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.240
idea that a data set or in my field code
would be counted in a in a 10-year case

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:12.250
would be counted in a in a 10-year case
 

00:55:12.250 --> 00:55:14.760
would be counted in a in a 10-year case
it's a little bit difficult because you

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:14.770
it's a little bit difficult because you
 

00:55:14.770 --> 00:55:18.150
it's a little bit difficult because you
end up I think that the tenure

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160
end up I think that the tenure
 

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.320
end up I think that the tenure
committees don't quite know what to

00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:19.330
committees don't quite know what to
 

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:21.089
committees don't quite know what to
don't recognize the amount of work that

00:55:21.089 --> 00:55:21.099
don't recognize the amount of work that
 

00:55:21.099 --> 00:55:22.890
don't recognize the amount of work that
goes into a piece of code the amount of

00:55:22.890 --> 00:55:22.900
goes into a piece of code the amount of
 

00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:25.050
goes into a piece of code the amount of
work that goes into data so the

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:25.060
work that goes into data so the
 

00:55:25.060 --> 00:55:26.790
work that goes into data so the
publication obviously that's the

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:26.800
publication obviously that's the
 

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.460
publication obviously that's the
priority right and then the code and the

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:29.470
priority right and then the code and the
 

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:31.020
priority right and then the code and the
amount of time and the community gives

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:31.030
amount of time and the community gives
 

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:32.910
amount of time and the community gives
it sort of hard to evaluate those and so

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:32.920
it sort of hard to evaluate those and so
 

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:34.859
it sort of hard to evaluate those and so
I think maybe the the wireframe of the

00:55:34.859 --> 00:55:34.869
I think maybe the the wireframe of the
 

00:55:34.869 --> 00:55:36.240
I think maybe the the wireframe of the
future has to have something that would

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:36.250
