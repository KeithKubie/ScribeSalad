00:00:21.708 --> 00:00:24.990
PROFESSOR: Today, we're going
to be working on fall 2010,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.360
problem set number 2, and
we're going to be doing

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.200
problem number 4.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.030
I'm going to start off by
reading the problem.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.970
There's a lot of information
here, so I've written up some

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.220
of the key points on the board
for you guys already.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.240
It is exactly 24 hours before
Lauren's physics final.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.830
She has an economics final
directly after her physics

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.810
final, and has no time
to study in between.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.390
Lauren wants to be a physicist,
so she places more

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.630
weight on her physics
test score.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.560
Her utility function is
given right here.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.550
Where p is the score of her
physics final and e is the

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.740
score of her economics final.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.665
Although, she cares more
about physics, she

00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:04.280
is better at economics.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280
For each hour spent studying
economics, she will increase

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.560
her score by three points.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.640
But her physics score will only
increase by two points

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.830
for every hour spent
studying physics.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.170
Studying zero hours results
in a score of

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.310
zero on both subjects.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.960
Although natural log of zero
is not defined, assume her

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.070
utility for a score of zero
is negative infinity.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.730
Now, we're going to go ahead
and we're going to work

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.300
through parts A, B, and C, A, B,
C, and D and then we'll do

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.510
part E, which is a new
scenario afterwards.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.740
Part A, we're going to find the
constraints that Lauren

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.790
faces in her test score
maximization problem.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.260
And part B, we're going to
find how many hours does

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.340
Lauren optimally spend studying
physics, how many

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.950
hours does she spent
studying economics.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.270
And hours are divisible, so
we don't need whole number

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.120
solutions for the hours spent
studying physics and the hours

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.550
spent studying economics.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.740
So for part A, all we're looking
for is we're looking

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.810
for the constraints.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.020
And it sounds like the
constraint that Lauren is

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.310
really facing in this scenario
is the amount of

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.770
time that she has.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.509
It seems like Lauren's pretty
intense about studying, so in

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.630
the 24 hours before the test,
she's not getting any sleep.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.370
She's going to spend all
of this time studying.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.980
So we're going to have two hours
variables to represent

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.970
the hours she spends studying
physics and the hours she

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.350
spends studying economics.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:33.360
And we know that the hours,
when we add them together,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.610
they're going to have to be
less than or equal to 24.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.160
Now, if this is our constraint,
we really know

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.190
that if she's trying to maximize
her scores and if

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.650
that's all she really cares
about, she's not going to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.120
spend less than 24
hours studying.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.320
So we can actually just say
that the sum of those two

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.200
hours-- her hours spent studying
physics and her hours

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.780
spent studying economics are
going to be equal to 24.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.000
So that's the first constraint
that Lauren is going to face.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.040
The second constraint that she's
going to face, and it's

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.190
not necessarily an
intuitive one--

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.940
or it is actually really
intuitive, but it's also a

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.190
trivial one.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.810
It's just that she can't spend
less than zero hours studying

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.880
physics or studying economics.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.210
So we're going to add those
constraints in as well.

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.530
And the final constraints
are actually production

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.100
constraints.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.640
If the hours spent studying--

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.430
these aren't actually what
she's interested in.

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.160
What she's interested in
are the p and the e.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.870
That's how she's going to
get her utilities--

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.520
through the test scores.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.360
So what we need is we need to
find how she produces her

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.720
physics score.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.530
If she gets two points for every
hour she spent studying,

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.140
her physics score is going to
be p equals 2 times Hp--

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.690
that's the production of
her physics score.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.640
The production of her economics
score is going to

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.190
equal 3 times He, since we know
that she's a little bit

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.820
better at economics
than physics.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.650
So these are the constraints
that we're going to face in

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.370
the problem.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.680
Let's go ahead and move on to
part B. And for part B, what

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.870
we're going to try to do is
we're going to try to take

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.620
these constraints and we're
trying to maximize the amount

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.180
of utility she's going
to get from studying.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.720
So what we're doing for part B
is we're going to maximize

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.710
utility, and we're going to
plug in some of these

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.840
constraints.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.530
Before we can do this, we really
need to get down to

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.650
first-order conditions.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.620
We need to be able to take the
derivative with regards to

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.670
only one variable.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.890
So we have to get-- instead of
p and e here, we're going to

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.400
try to get only one variable.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.940
And the variable we're going to
get in there is going to be

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.560
the hours spent study
economics.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.240
So we're going to get it
all in terms of He.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.810
So we need to find a way to
replace both e and p with He.

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.740
In this case, replacing e
with He is really easy.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.740
We can just say that e is
going to equal 3He.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.150
Replacing p with the He or the
hours spent studying economics

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.060
is a little bit more
difficult.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.120
We're going to go to
this equation.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.260
And we can say that
Hp is going to be

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:33.470
equal to 24 minus He.

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.930
And then for this Hp, we're
going to plug this into our

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.310
production function for
the physics score.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:50.250
So we get that p is equal
to 2 times 24 minus He.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.650
So we're going to take these two
equations that we have in

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.316
and we're going to substitute
for e and p

00:05:57.316 --> 00:05:58.566
in our utility function.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.430
And so we're going to maximize,
and the way we're

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:35.720
going to maximize is by just
taking the first-order

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.970
conditions or the FOC.

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.970
And the FOC in this case
is just going to be the

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.590
derivative with respect to He.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.040
When you take the derivative
with respect to He, what

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:56.400
you're going to get is 0.6 times
negative 2 all over (48

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:06.983
minus 2 He) plus 0.4 times
3 all over 3He.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:12.350
And the reason this first-order
condition is going

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.800
to help us is because
we know to maximize.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.030
We just set the first-order
condition or the derivative

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:22.810
with respect to He
equal to zero.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:25.514
And from here, we can
solve out for He.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.530
And when we solve for He, we
find that the hour she spends

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.766
studying economics is going
to equal to 9.6.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.960
And we know that any time she
spends not studying the

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.770
economics, she's studying
physics, since all she cares

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:46.020
about is her test scores.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.070
She's going to spend
the remaining 14.4

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.570
hours studying physics.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.960
This is our answer for part B.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:09.340
Now, part C just asks us, "What
economics and physics

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.145
test scores will she achieve?"
so we're looking for the e

00:08:12.145 --> 00:08:13.840
star and the p star.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.950
We can just take the hour she
spent studying physics and the

00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.930
hours she spends studying
economics and we can plug

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:23.550
these back into her production
functions for her physics

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:27.300
score and an economics score.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:33.330
So, for part C, her economics
score is going to be equal to

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:35.565
3 times 9.6.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:45.620
She's going to get a 28.8
on her economics test.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:54.040
And for her physics
test, she's also

00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:04.350
going to get a 28.8.

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:09.310
Probably the not the best test
scores in the world.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.940
Let's go ahead and look at part
D. Part D asks us, "What

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:16.400
utility level will she achieve
with these test scores that

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.170
she has?" Now, to find the
utility levels, all we have to

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.790
do is we have to go back to our
utility function that we

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.460
wrote down in part A, and we're
just going to plug in

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.850
the two test scores that she
received, and we can solve

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:31.620
through for overall utility.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.940
And so when you grab a
calculator, and you solve

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.350
through for this equation, what
you're going to find is

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:12.850
you're going to find her overall
utility level is going

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:15.210
to be equal to 3.36.

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.090
And when we're measuring
utility, we don't have any

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.190
units on this.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.010
The units, we usually think of
as utils, but we can just keep

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:21.730
it like this.

00:10:21.730 --> 00:10:24.660
Just know that in relativistic
terms, her

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.970
utility is that 3.36.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:32.290
And this is going to be useful
for part D. Because in part E,

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.160
we have the option of sending
Lauren off to

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.630
an economics tutor.

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.090
And we're going to be comparing
her utility after

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:44.040
going to the economics tutor
to this utility of 3.36.

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.270
And by comparing her new utility
with the old utility,

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.740
we can see if her utility's
higher after going the

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:50.900
economics tutor.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.400
We can see if that's a good
decision for her.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.090
So now that we finished
calculating the utility for

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.080
Lauren in the initial case where
she had 24 hours and no

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.040
help, now we're going to move
on to part E. Part E says,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:05.660
"Suppose Lauren can get
an economics tutor.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.300
If she goes to the tutor, she
will increase her economics

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.710
test score by five points for
every hour spent studying,

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.290
instead of three points.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.380
But will lose four hours
of study time by

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:16.810
going to the tutor.

00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.570
She cannot study while at the
tutor, and going to the tutor

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.050
does not directly improve
her test score.

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.090
Should Lauren go
to the tutor?"

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:26.630
Now, for this problem,
we can go back

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:28.730
to our initial scenario.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.560
Where we had our constraint
for the amount of

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.010
time Lauren can spend.

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:35.380
If Lauren goes to the tutor, it
sounds like she's going to

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.540
spend about four hours in the
car driving to the tutor's

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.470
house and back.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.150
So instead of having 24 total
hours of study time, her new

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:48.630
constraint is that her total
study time Hp plus

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.740
He is equal to 20.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.090
That's the downside.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.030
The upshot of it is that her
production function for

00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:59.970
economics test scores is no
longer three points for every

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:06.210
hour she spent studying, now she
gets five point for every

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.150
hour she spends studying.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:11.000
So we're going to go through the
exact same process for A,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.520
B, C, and D that we did before,
only now we're going

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.090
to use our new constraints
to solve for the

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:18.340
maximization problem.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.580
Before we start off for our
maximization problem and

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.150
solving for the first-order
conditions, what we have to do

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:31.690
is we have to get it all in
terms of one variable.

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.000
And the variable we're going to
get it in terms of is the

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.870
hours of economic
studying or He.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:45.340
So from the utility function, to
solve or to plug in for e,

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:53.290
the He, we have that e is going
to equal five times He.

00:12:53.290 --> 00:13:00.510
For p, we know that Hp is
equal to 20 minus He.

00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.490
That just says that any time
she's not studying economics,

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:05.770
she's going to be studying
physics.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:12.580
We can plug this into our
p equals 2 times Hp.

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:21.200
So we know that p is going to
equal 2 times 20 minus He.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.500
Let's go ahead and plug this
and this into our utility

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:27.830
maximization problem and solve
for the first-order

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:29.080
conditions.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.230
So we're maximizing
utilities--

00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:56.510
so we're going to take
the derivative with

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:58.020
respect to He again.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:59.610
When we do that,
we get our FOC.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.660
And again, for the maximization
problem, we can

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.310
just set that equal to 0.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:33.000
Solving out for He, we find
that she's going to spend

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.560
eight hours studying
economics.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:46.430
And we also find that any time
she's not spending studying

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.320
economics, she's going to
be studying physics.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:56.080
So she's going to spend 12
hours studying physics.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.750
Now, we're not done with part
E because really all we have

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.580
to do for this problem is we
have to solve for her new

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:05.130
utility using these hours that
she spends studying.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.380
And we have to compare her new
utility to her old utility of

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.980
3.36 to see if she's better
off or worse with the

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.720
economics tutor.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:18.360
In her production function for
economics test score, we know

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:22.980
that for each of those eight
hours you spend studying, her

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.670
test score's going to improve
eight points, so her new

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.850
economic score is 40.

00:15:29.850 --> 00:15:33.350
And we know that for each of
those 12 hours she spends

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:38.910
studying physics, her score's
going to improve two points.

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:44.510
So her physics score has dropped
a little bit to 24.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:51.280
When we plug in for e and p into
our utility function, we

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.290
can find her utility level
with the economics tutor.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:08.960
When we solve through for these
natural logs, we're

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:19.150
going to find that her new
utility is equal to 3.38.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.990
And since the problem asks
us to actually make

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:22.220
a qualitative judgment--

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.840
is she better off or worse off,
we need to compare her

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:36.240
utility before of 3.36 to
her new utility of 3.38.

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.460
This is the comparison that
we're interested in.

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.910
And when we make this
comparison, we can see that in

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.900
relative terms, she's a little
bit better off going to be

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:47.415
economics tutor because her
utility has risen two

00:16:47.415 --> 00:16:50.010
hundredths of a point.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:53.840
So in this case, for part E,
we found that her utility

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.640
increases even though she's
lost time because her

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.680
production function for her
economics to score has gone

00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:03.050
up, and that she's better off
going to the economics tutor

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:05.369
because of that increase
in utility.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.010
So the point of this problem was
to look at the different

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.880
constraints that consumers face
when deciding where to

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:14.079
spend their time or where to
spend their money, and to see

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.530
how those different constraints
affect their

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:17.780
utility levels.
