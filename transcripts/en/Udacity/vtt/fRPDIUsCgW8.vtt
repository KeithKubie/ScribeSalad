If you answered, it not longer exists then you might be a baby. Because the

00:00:05.083 --> 00:00:09.764
duck is under the towel, of course. But Piaget explains that infants think and

00:00:09.764 --> 00:00:12.410
live and the they hear now, meaning they can't understand if they

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.949
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:18.018
statements. For example, if I cover the duck with the towel, then the duck is

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:22.795
under the towel of course. So, given what we know about infants' cognitive

00:00:22.795 --> 00:00:27.010
capabilities. We know that when the duck is covered, they think it no longer

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.220
exists.
