00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.330
Even just using orientation and width. We can

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.540
easily place different form factors into a few buckets

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.380
that we can target. Note that using media

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.090
queries, we're defining these buckets in terms of things

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.850
like physical dimensions, width and height. Not in

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.530
terms like for an iPhone 5, do this. This

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.170
strategy, along with the fluid design strategies we

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.830
learned in the last lesson, helps our designs adapt

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.650
to general scenarios, and, new devices as they come along.
