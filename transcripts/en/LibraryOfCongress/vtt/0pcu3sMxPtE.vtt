00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:09.450
&gt;&gt; They told me to start.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.220
Wow. I've got reverb
in my own voice.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.930
Hello, thank you for coming.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.540
Thanks to the Library of Congress.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.560
Thank all of you book
lovers out there.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.640
I'm glad a number of you
found your way to this room.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.020
We'll try to make it worth your
while for these 45 minutes.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.790
My feeling is it's
going to flee past.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.980
We would like to save some time at
the end to hear from several of you

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.500
to just shoot your hand up and I'll
try to find you and you stand up

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.760
and shout your question out.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.720
Informality is the key here.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.510
We want this to be a
conversation among the three of us.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.140
Not in any sense presentation.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.040
Although our two authors,
I'm the moderator,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.650
my name is Paul Hendrickson.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.300
I'm going to -- so Mary Dearborn
here on my immediate left

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.320
and Nicholas Reynolds beside her.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.360
Both authors of recent
Hemmingway books.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.220
Mary's published in May of this
year and Nicholas in March.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.650
I'll do a tiny bit more of a formal
introduction in a few moments,

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.480
but I wondered just to get our
juiced marinating, whether yours,

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.520
as well as ours, whether I could
just toss out a question to Mary

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.410
and Nicholas and after they
say something about it,

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.910
maybe I'll have a way in as well.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.320
I think it's the unanswerable
question,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.790
therefore, let's start out with it.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.700
The question, why do
we keep returning?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.820
Why does Earnest Hemmingway seem
an almost inexhaustible American

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.420
subject for biographers
and literary historians?

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.990
Faulkner, yes, Fitzgerald, yes,

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.310
Emily Dickenson, yes,
Robert Frost, yes.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.130
But Earnest Hemmingway, the
industry rolls on and on and on

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.920
under the American literary knife.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.030
Mary, please.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.330
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Paul.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.040
What I can say is it's
what he wrote and I think

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.520
that somehow you are all here,
we're all here because we connect

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.760
in some way to what we read.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.150
For me it's been the
short stories and over

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.540 position:56%
and over again I can imagine myself,
even as Nick Adams or even in --

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.070
or inhabit stories like even the
killers, that in a way that I don't

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.400
with other writers and I
feel connected in that way.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.730
I think that's true for most of us.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.050
We come to Hemmingway through
our reading rather than --

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.190
I think there's a potent
Hemmingway myth, talk about later,

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.220
but and if we get through his work.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.520
&gt;&gt; Good, thank you.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.260
Good. Good pithy answer.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.280
Nicholas?

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.470
&gt;&gt; So, I would say part of the
reason -- I would agree with Mary,

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:40.030
first of all -- I started
out as a Hemmingway reader

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.100 position:56%
and lover long before as I thought
of myself as any kind of biographer.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.990 position:56%
But one of the thing that
fascinates the biographer is there's

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.740
so many different Hemmingways.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.960
And he's so good at so
many things in his life,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.160
it's almost like there's
a Hemmingway role

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.420
for almost any population.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.620
You know, are you a sailor, well,
then there's that part of his life.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.560
Are you a hunter, a fisherman,
are you a spy, are you a soldier?

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.010
There's almost a Hemmingway for
everyone and I think that accounts

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.710
for some of the attraction.

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.850
&gt;&gt; Beautiful again.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.750
Both of -- both Mary
and Nicholas saying,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.550
"The work, the work, the work."

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.720
And then you find the life in a
sense and Nicholas making a point

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.770
that there's a Hemmingway
for everyone,

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.380
because he lived so many lives.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.510
My own little take on it might
be this, I'm stealing actually

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.520
from a book I wrote,
"Hemmingway's Boat."

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.430
I's something along the
lines of this, I think,

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:53.030
that the Hemmingway -- I totally
agree it's the work, those stories.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.310
Big Two Hearted River was the
story that took me over when I was

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.190
on a camping and fishing trip on
the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:03.530
I do also think this.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:08.060
the Hemmingway myth, however
much oversold and devalued,

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.570
can still powerfully stand in this
new century, now 17 years old,

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.870 position:56%
for a great many tensions unresolved
in American males and not only males

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:24.520
or so I believe, but I also believe
that all of Hemmingway's writing,

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.250 position:56%
every bit of it, even at its most
self-parodistic and papa cult worst,

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.820
is seeking to be about
the living of this life,

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.740
the doing of this life,
the being of this life.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.390
And in that sense the work and
even I am willing to say so much

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:47.080
of the coarsened personal
history can be thought

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.830 position:56%
of as something spiritual and indeed
almost holy and for those of you

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.800
who want to laugh me off
this stage feel free.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.070
But that is why I think we
keep coming back and back.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.890
I would like to more formally
introduce our two panelists.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.520
Both of whose books came out,
as I said, in recent months.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:17.570
And both of them receiving some
wonderful, wonderful reviews.

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.300
Mary Dearborn, her
biography Earnest Hemmingway,

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.700
Mary received a doctorate in
English and comparative literature

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.940
from Columbia where she was a
Mellon fellow in humanities.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.330
She is a thorough going
American biographer.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:39.060
A whole raft of books,
I can't say them all.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:43.330
But the life of Peggy
Guggenheim, Normal Mailer,

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:47.150
who some people have accused of
being a vest pocket Hemmingway.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:54.510
I don't think if you read Mary's
book -- he stands on his own.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.560
Mailer, a biography.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.180
A biography of Henry Miller.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:04.500
Title, "The Happiest Man Alive."

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.720
I said reviews.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:17.130
Just to say one, a reviewer
said this, "A nuanced portrait,

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.630
a powerful work that
draws on new material,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.650
as well as offering fresh
insightful perspectives on one

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:30.330
of American literatures
most complicated icons."

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.270
Nicholas Reynolds.

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:38.510
His book is entitled,
"Writer, Sailor, Soldier, Spy."

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.970
Nicholas has worked in the
fields of modern military history

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:46.580
and intelligence for 40 years.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.010
He actually is a former
United States Marine.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.740
In the 1970s serving as an
infantry soldier and officer.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:03.470
And then migrating I think might be
the way to say it, as a historian.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:08.370
He was a colonial in the reserves
and in charge of field history

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.130
and deploying historians
around the world.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:17.820
Most recently he worked as the
historian for the CIA museum.

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.410
Responsible for developing
its strategic plan.

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:28.320
So, his book is more narrowly
focused in some ways than Mary's,

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:32.220
but we will bat around its ideas.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:39.000
Just to quote one review, from
the London Review of Books,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.590
"Reynolds looks among the shadows

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.970
and finds a Hemmingway
not seen before."

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.090 position:56%
So, each of our authors now is going

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.890
to give the briefest little
synopsis presentation,

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:02.720 position:56%
whatever it might rightly be called,
of what they were trying to do

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.000
with their book and I think it
will go 4 or 5 minutes at most

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.350
and then we'll bat some ideas
around and we'll keep going.

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.280
Mary, please, start.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.180
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you, Paul, thank
you for that introduction

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.340
and no thanks for that
first question.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.430
I did want to talk -- I have
three main points I want to make

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.430
and the first is because
everyone is curious about it.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.860
I'm the first woman to write
a biography of Hemmingway.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.190
And that both means a lot and
it doesn't mean much at all.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:39.400
But just one quick thing about
why I thought I had something new

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.800
to say about this as a woman.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.970
Because I started my research
at the University of Texas

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:52.330
at the Harry Ransom Center and
I was looking at Hemmingway's,

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.640
Earnest Hemmingway's
mother's papers.

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:56.290
That's what they have there mostly.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:57.590
Grace Hemmingway.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:59.350
She's a remarkable woman.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.210
What I found there, there's
a very large archive.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:07.840
Her letters and all kinds of
documents and charts she wrote out,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.170
was that it didn't' seem to me

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.210 position:56%
that the previous male
biographers had even looked at them.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.140
And there was so much in there.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.440
I mean, there was so much

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:21.740
that I could have just written
a book about Grace alone.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.550
Anyway, then I felt there
was probably something new

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.690
for a woman to say.

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:33.110
I also felt that there is, as you
all know, this is my second point,

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.560
a very potent Hemmingway myth.

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.460 position:56%
A very potent legend about
Hemmingway, the man, the hyper male.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:46.040
It's repeated over and
over again, I think,

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:50.320
in these biographies
by man -- these --

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:52.480
&gt;&gt; Male biographies.

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:53.780
&gt;&gt; That's excluded.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:59.210
I think that we all have -- I think
that writers who write about him

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:04.430
and that his readers we have a lot
of stake in seeing him this way.

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:09.440
And I'm not sure how useful it is.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.530
and I think what I get -- I think
I bring my own baggage to my study

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.010
of Hemmingway, but I don't
think I have much investment

00:11:18.010 --> 00:11:19.890
in that particular myth.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:24.060
So, that my third point, which
is something I just discovered

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:27.980
when I was out promoting the
book, it sounds kind of obvious,

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.290
but that in place of the
legend, what do I have?

00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:35.190
Well, I have the work,
but you know, okay --

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:40.730
but what I had was this
incredibly human person

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:44.290
that few of us really know about.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.540
You know, the work and we
sort of know this legend.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:54.210
But we don't know this really
human guy who is like -- he's a --

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.890
I agree with Paul, yet I'm not
sure I think it's spiritual.

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:02.400
I think a book slide, this is a
very human person, very talented,

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.790
but at the same time,
parodistic of his own talent.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:11.900
An extremely charming
guy, but extremely --

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:17.870
charming and loving person, yet
he was not able to keep a friend.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.160
He wasn't able really to love.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:26.930
All these things at the
same time, words and all.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:31.160
He was extremely crippled
by several things.

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:35.560
He had a number of traumatic
brain injuries and he probably had

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:41.650
that accumulative brain injury
problem, he was bipolar,

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:46.530
he was an alcoholic and he
was taking various kinds

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:51.030
of psychotic drugs that
didn't really work then.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:55.780
So, by the end he was a model
-- he was a very human person.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.460
And I found when I was
on the road talking

00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:01.030
about him I got so
protective of him.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:06.140
I just -- it was like he was
alive and I wanted to protect him.

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.100
And I think that has
its source in the sense

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:15.530
that he was this very
particular human being.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:21.990
&gt;&gt; What an interesting thing to say
that you found yourself protective

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:27.990
of him, even as you were
doing the biographer's task

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:29.650
of ruthlessly dissecting.

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:33.980
Beautiful for me to hear.

00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.140
And thanks for keeping
to those 4 or 5 minutes.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.560
Nicholas, can you do the same?

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.720
&gt;&gt; I'll try.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:43.450
I'll start by ripping off
something Mary just said

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:46.310
and that is being protective
of Earnest.

00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:52.580
I was doing a show in Boston a
couple weeks ago and it was one

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:57.230
of these late night shows and
half way through the guy goes,

00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:59.910
"Wait a minute, let's stop here
a minute, you started off talking

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.110
about Hemmingway, now
you're talking about Earnest

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:04.440
like he's a member of your family."

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:09.390
And I think that was a very
astute observation on his part

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.690
and that's kind of how I feel now,

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.580
I don't like everything
Earnest did in his life.

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:17.170
I admire a lot of things.

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.930
I don't like other things,
but he's still a member

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.850
of the family whether
like it or not.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:27.160
So, I'll tell you a little tiny
bit of the history of the book

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.540
and I didn't start out
to write this book.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.350
You know, I was a fan, I was,
you know, of various sorts.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.480
I'm used to having people tell me
what to do and I'll do it as well

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.320
as I can and then go
onto the next task.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.060
And in this case I was
doing something else.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:45.140
I was researching American
intelligence in World War II

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:50.690
for the CIA museum and I
remembered that the Hemming--

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:54.000
especially Earnest, had been
involved in intelligence

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.790
in World War II and I wanted
to refresh my memory on that.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.770
and I eventually came
up to the conclusion

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:08.310
that all three Hemmingway men, who
were of military age more or less,

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:12.050
Earnest was actually over
military age in World War II,

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:15.570
but they all came independently
to OSS.

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:22.640
So, population of 130 million
and OSS there were more 13,000

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:27.200
on any given day, and three,
yet three Hemmingway men show up

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.900 position:56%
and they want to join or think
about joining, in Hemmingway's case,

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.780
Martha actually put
his name forward.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:40.030 position:56%
And so that kind of lit the fire
for me and then I kept going pulling

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:43.330
on the thread, finishing
the work for the CIA museum

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.780
and then continuing on my own.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:51.810
And what -- so, mostly I was
trying to satisfy my own curiosity,

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:57.710 position:56%
especially after I came upon this
book, "Spies," which is the history,

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.520
it's published by Yale University
Press and it's the history

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.850
of Soviet espionage
in the United States.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.020
And I'm used to going to -- at
that point I was used to going

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.990
to the index very sophisticated
research technique.

00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:11.940
I'm finding Hemmingway's name.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:13.840
And it was usually something
contextual, you know.

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.090
It would be around the time of this
crisis, Hemmingway had published X

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:22.040
or Y or he was a rising star
or he reflected this or that.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.870
But, no, there's like a subchapter,
10 or 15 pages, about Hemmingway

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:31.360
and the NKVD, which is the
predecessor of the KGB,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.090
basically Stalin's secret service.

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.970
And in there there's a
verbatim quote from a KG --

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:41.050
NKGB, slash, NKGB document,
that says,

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:45.170
"Earnest Hemmingway was
recruited for our work

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.960
for ideological reasons."

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.120
And that just blew me away.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.820
That deeply upset me as
a lifelong Hemmingway fan

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:57.880
and I started going
-- looking for the --

00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.440
looking for some kind
of explanation.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.820
What are we supposed
to think of Earnest.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.500
It's like you find
out that you're --

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:10.270
you know, one of your relatives is
an embezzler or, you know, done --

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:13.360
committed some other crime and all
the time you thought, oh, well,

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.620
they're really a fine,
upstanding person.

00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.690
And so it was troubling to me
and so I went and searched.

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:27.170
Tried to find the answer, which
comes from many little places,

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:32.430
it comes from a letter here, it
comes from a quote in a book,

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.660
it comes from unpublished papers.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.400
And initially I thought he
story didn't' really have legs.

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.230
I thought it was mostly a World
War II story, that, you know,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.010
was an interesting sidebar to
World War II intelligence history

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:49.170
and to Hemmingway biography
and as I get into it deeper

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.870
and deeper I found that
it had a lasting affect

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:59.210
that extended beyond the war and
I also found that it was connected

00:17:59.210 --> 00:18:01.930
to what he did before the war.

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:07.200
That the pivotal thing in this
story is the Spanish Civil War

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.010
and his dedication to antifascism.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.000 position:56%
That's kind of the driver for his --

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.700
I won't say political
thinking, political attitudes.

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.450
He wasn't a political scientist,
he was -- he was a novelist,

00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:21.050
he was an artist, so he
really had attitudes more

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:23.570
than reasoned political positions.

00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:29.660
So, long story short, I
eventually -- I didn't have --

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.190
you know, there wasn't -- I didn't'
sit down and write an outline,

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:33.720
I just started to write it one day.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.540
And, you know, pretty
soon I had five chapters

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.600
and then I started
getting rejected by agents,

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.250
which I think happens
to all of us who write.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:47.320
And then I found a wonderful agent
who liked it enough to believed

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.290
in it to take it over
the finish line.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:51.590
&gt;&gt;Thank you, thank you.

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.650
We'll be circling back
to that shortly,

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:58.690
because there's much more
about the spy business.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:03.800
I love what you just said, you
just sat down and started writing.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:10.920
I think the writer starts in
chaos and confusion and tries

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.030
to work himself toward
clarity and form.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.430
That's what I tell
my writing students

00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:17.880
at the University of Pennsylvania.

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.270
The reason I'm here
moderating, I think,

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:25.870
is because I published a
Hemmingway book, but not this year.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:30.790
It was published in 2011, it's
called, "Hemmingway's Boat."

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.460
Everything he loved
in life and lost.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:39.180
And if I can speak even shorter
in a minute and a half about what

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.080
that book is about, to give
you some sense of context.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.810
I think I was trying to write
a book about the strange,

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:51.640
sad distance from a Brooklyn
boatyard named Wheeler Shipyard,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:57.680 position:56%
to a tight oak paneled entry way in
a bunker like house in Ketchum Idaho

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.330
when the world went away
from a suffering man

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.220
in fractions of a second.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:06.160
"Hemmingway's Boat" is largely
the story of the span of years

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:13.570 position:56%
between the first week of April 1934
and the first week of July 1961.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:16.010
But the narrative doesn't
always stay there.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:20.260
In my quirky way I kept
wanting to travel elsewhere.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.950
No human history every
proceeds in a straight line.

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.870
Perhaps least of all
Earnest Hemmingway's.

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:31.470
His prose was wonderfully rooted
in geography and linear movement,

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:36.930
but his life, like his boat, beat
against so many cross currents.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:40.760
It was trying to come to
a modest understanding

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:45.800
of an almost insanely complicated
life through the narrative lens

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.790
of something in the material
world he loved very much.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:55.290
A possession that was intimately
his and he hers for 27 years,

00:20:55.290 --> 00:21:00.570
which were the final 27 years,
her name was Pilar, and she lasted

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:05.100
through three wives, the
Nobel Prize and all his ruin.

00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:07.920
My aim, if I had a stated aim,

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:12.670
is to try to lock together
the words Hemmingway and boat,

00:21:12.670 --> 00:21:16.810
in the way that they'll lock
together an equally American words,

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:22.670
DiMaggio and bat or Satchmo and
horn, quickly means something

00:21:22.670 --> 00:21:25.660
in the minds of a lot of people.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:29.360
The material thing in question
was not a figment or a dream

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.390
or somebodies psychosexual
interpretation, she was actual.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:39.860
And that is "Hemmingway's Boat."

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:50.080
When we started here I said,
"Spiritual and almost holy."

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:56.370
I would also say, just as Mary
has reminded us and Nicholas to,

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:00.390
that at every turn
Hemmingway betrayed himself.

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:06.200
His high human aspirations,
which he continually somehow

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.540
for some psychic reason and
we're not psychiatrists,

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:15.200
he was needing and
wanting to sabotage.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.840
Nicholas, back to you for a moment.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.140
On this spy craft.

00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:24.080
Being recruited by the
Soviets, you found this out

00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:25.950
and that got your attention.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.650
He even had a code name, right?

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:29.950
&gt;&gt; He was Argo.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.250
&gt;&gt; Argo was his code name.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:37.930 position:56%
But -- so the audience can be clear,
what did he do as a Soviet spy?

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.370
No money was exchanged.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:44.860 position:56%
Did he actually contribute anything
in actual spy craft for the Soviets?

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.030
This is during the
Spanish Civil War,

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:52.540
the Soviets are the clearly
most anti-fascist group

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.090
out there, is that true?

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:59.150
So, Hemmingway, who's just
politically turning anti-fascist,

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:04.210
would have a reason to be enamored
of this, but what happened?

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:10.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, the way I like to think about
this is when he was with the Soviets

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.920
in Spain he -- it was like dating.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.450 position:56%
It was like getting to know the
espionage and intelligence business.

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:25.420
And he did things for them
there on a casual basis

00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:28.170
that they would have
wanted after recruiting him.

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:33.010
So, he did a propaganda film, he
spoke to people on their behalf,

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:38.130
tried to get them to hew the
company line, he wrote for Pravda.

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:41.640
There's a couple of articles
he would probably prefer us not

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:42.940
to remember.

00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:51.060
And he participated in a
paramilitary operation that drove

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:53.270
For Whom the Bell Tolls,
drove the plot

00:23:53.270 --> 00:23:55.280 position:56%
of For Whom the Bell Tolls later on.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.690
So, those are the kind of things
that the Soviet intelligence,

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.240
which is -- and Russian
intelligence,

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:07.560
it's been happening for decades.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.150
Maybe -- well, now
about a 100 years.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:17.420
And , you know, it's an enterprise
that does classical espionage,

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:21.070
which is steal the -- government
official steals the secrets

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.050
from the safe, turns them
over to the bad guys.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.150
And other things that
are much more amorphous.

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:28.720
There about influence, they are

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:33.070
about lower level confidences,
not state secrets.

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:36.280
And that's the sort of thing they
were looking for from Hemmingway.

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:40.900
And, so, the recruitment
comes at the end of 1940

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.870
or possibly the very
beginning of 1941,

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.500
and then it's like getting married.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.090 position:56%
So, before he was dating the Soviets
and that was fun and exciting

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:52.360
and what not, and now all of a
sudden he's married to the Soviets.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.200
He understands what recruitment is

00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:02.350
and he almost immediately takes
a deep breath and says, "Hmm,

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:04.670
I wonder if that was
such a good idea."

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:10.570
So, as a recruited soviet
spy he does almost nothing,

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:17.040
except agree to further meetings
and make a number of meetings

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:21.490
with Soviet spies who
mostly are asking him, "Say,

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:23.860
remember when you signed up with us

00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:25.960
and said you'd do whatever
you could to help us?

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.260
Well, we're ready now."

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:28.600
And he would say, "I'm
ready too, you know,

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.120
and I'll get on it tomorrow."

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.960
But somehow tomorrow never came.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.740
&gt;&gt; Can I break in here?

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:39.030
This spying story that
Nicholas traces, doesn't --

00:25:39.030 --> 00:25:42.670
the book doesn't begin and
end with the Spanish Civil War

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:46.590
and his flirtation, if that's
the word, with the Soviets.

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.830
It comes up through spying for --

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:53.710
working on America's
side during World War II

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.460
and his fishing boat, Pilar.

00:25:56.460 --> 00:26:00.940
And then later on -- so I want
Mary to be able to jump in.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.690
In fact, maybe switch
it to Mary now.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:08.130
But later on Hemmingway's
extreme paranoia,

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:13.220
whether his earlier spying
adventures, Soviets spying

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.520
for America, it was going --

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.210 position:56%
they were going to lob grenades down
the conning towers of German subs.

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:21.390
What a loony sounding idea.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:22.690
With his little fishing boat.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:26.180
He weaponized highlife
players, right?

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.480
From Cuba.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.280
So, Nicholas traces
this all the way through

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.430 position:56%
and then the extreme paranoia in
the 50s when Hemmingway is convinced

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:41.300
that J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI
are tailing him at every turn.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.520
Mary would have a lot
to say about this.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:51.140
I wonder though if we can for a
minute get back -- Mary, I don't --

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:55.250
I want to tread lightly, because
you make a point of saying

00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:59.500
in your book that,
yes, and the promoters,

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.930
the publicity people said,
you're the first woman ever

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:07.800
to do a full biography
of Earnest Hemmingway.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.630
True fact, the first full length
biography period in 15 years.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:16.120 position:56%
But Mary said, there, you know, this
doesn't necessarily mean that much.

00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.570
Mainly I find I am
interested in different aspects

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:21.610
of Hemmingway's life from the ones

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:24.430
that drew his previous
male biographers.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:27.800
Very very deep in Mary's book.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.820
We're in the late 400
pages of her book.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:38.090
You said something that hit
me at dead center and I wanted

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.320
to noodle it a little
and congratulate you.

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.210
I have deep feelings about this.

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:49.860
You said, "Earnest was
extremely brave to take

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.980
up such issues in his fiction."

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.740
She is talking about the posthumous
novel, "The Garden of Eden."

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.090
And for those of you who
are Hemmingway aficionados

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:04.860
or even casual students, you
possibly know that that book is

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:11.550
so deeply invested in gender
issues, transgender issues.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:18.460
So, you said he was extremely
brave to take this up

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:25.350
and I'm really thrilled, pleased,
grateful that you put it that way.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:28.120
Would you say a little
more about that?

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.720
And, Nicholas, feel free
in a minute to jump in.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:35.070
&gt;&gt; Leave it to the
English professor.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.700
&gt;&gt; I just think it
is extremely brave.

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:43.030
I think anyone who's tried
-- it's not the case with me,

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:46.550
but people who've come out
to their families as gay

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:51.790
or decide what they want is to be
with somebody of the same gender,

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:55.670
I think that takes
incredible courage and to admit

00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.640
to what you would like to do

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.380
in bed is take some people
a lifetime, or so I gather.

00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:08.360
And Earnest, I think, was
transfixed by gender issues.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.730
And by that I mean of
switching gender roles sexually,

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.470
but in all kinds of
other ways as well.

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:27.540
And -- there was one night when his
wife, his fourth wife Mary was away

00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:32.650
and he got -- Hemmingway was
kind of obsessed with hair color.

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:37.540
This went with the being
interested in changing sex roles,

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:41.750
because he would imagine
in Garden of Eden himself

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:45.830
and his female partners cutting
their hair the same length,

00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:49.690
the look alikes or the
different ones could be the boy

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.640
or the girl or coloring it.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.380
So, he was really obsessed
with coloring hair.

00:29:56.380 --> 00:30:01.230
And the fourth wife, Mary,
was blonde and he was just -

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.170
it's almost comical,
in each letter, "Well,

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.290
I think you could a
little bit more ash blonde,

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:10.260
there's a moonlight blonde
that I'm thinking of."

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:12.290
He does it with something
that translates to --

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.220
but, anyway, she was away

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:19.700
and one night he died his hair
red and he'd been drinking.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:25.160
And then he wrote about it to
Mary the next day and he said,

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.450
"I woke up and I said, "oh, my god.

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:30.470
And what are all -- what are
the servants going to think,

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:33.830
what are the guys going to
think, what am I going to do?"

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:42.810 position:56%
And he said, "Then I said to myself,
'This is a one and only life."

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:46.880
And that's something that he said a
lot in the last decade of his life.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:51.670
And I think not when he
was feeling suicidal.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:55.630
He felt that this was
-- we only live once.

00:30:55.630 --> 00:30:57.120
I mean, it's a cliché.

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.140
And then he would go after
what he wanted sexually

00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.510
or for the fantasies, he
would air them in his fiction.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.260
He never would have published
Garden of Eden in his lifetime.

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.130
He didn't believe it
could be punished.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:12.100
But he wanted to write it out.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.820
I think that, yes, I think
that is extremely brave.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:19.010
&gt;&gt; He wanted to write it out.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.930
See, here's where I
come down on that.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:26.630
So many Hemmingway scholars,
writers, would be out there saying,

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:31.060
"Ah ha, we've caught
him red-handed."

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.370
He left this material behind.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:38.780
Wasn't he the first one who
would have known that all

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:42.410 position:56%
of the posthumous grave diggers
would have discovered this material.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.650
So, I think the missing link

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:53.740
in so much Hemmingway writing is
not willing to see and acknowledge

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:56.590
and say as you just
said in your text

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:59.260
that how extremely
brave of him to do this.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.530
Nicholas, you're book's not
about any of these issues,

00:32:02.530 --> 00:32:04.170
but you had to have
thought about this.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:10.620
&gt;&gt; A couple things come to mind and
one is that he did live so fully,

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:12.450
that ties in with what
we said earlier

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:14.640
about the different Hemmingways.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.300 position:56%
And, you know, you look at Earnest's
life you see a guy who lived it

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:22.540
to the fullest extent possible
and that's one of the things that,

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.570
you know, that's a different
way of saying the same thing,

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:26.000
that there were many Hemmingways,

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.270
but there was always a
Hemmingway living very fully.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:34.720 position:56%
The only other thing that comes to
mind is he said at one point that he

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:39.710
and Gregory, his transgender
son were the closest,

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:46.930
of his sons he understood
Gregory's psyche or identified

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:52.580
with it more closely than
either Jack or Patrick.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.050
&gt;&gt; There's a very powerful
thing Normal Mailer said,

00:32:55.050 --> 00:32:58.640
Mary Dearborn has a
whole book about him.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.260
Mailer said, "It may even
be that the final judgment

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.580
on his work may come to the
notion that what he failed

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:10.990
to do was tragic, but what
he accomplished was heroic,

00:33:10.990 --> 00:33:16.170
for it is possible he carried the
weight of anxiety within himself,

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:20.820
which would have suffocated
any man smaller than himself."

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:26.020
That was a very resonate quote
for me and what I was doing

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.430
when I was working on Hemmingway.

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.170
Elaine Showalter, who reviewed
Mary's book in the New York Times

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:37.860 position:56%
and talked about Nicholas's as well,
at the end of her review she said,

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:42.670
"You know, we all have been
subscribing to this business

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:46.410
that his insides were eaten
out by the diseases of fame,

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.070
the sin of pridefulness,
the curses of megalomania,

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:52.200
the onslaughts of bipolarism."

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.400
But Showalter's point also was,

00:33:55.400 --> 00:34:00.830
in the Garden of Eden he's
revealing perhaps a man at the end

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:03.650
of his life, when he's
all used up trying

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.670
to tell new truths about himself.

00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:11.050
So, you can almost flip
the tragedy upward.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.660
Because isn't it so
essentially brave and beautiful.

00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:17.580
I knew this was going to flee by,
I think we have about 8 minutes.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:21.420
Somebody from the audience
ask something.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:23.820
If you don't we'll continue here.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.320
Yes, shout it out, sir,
shout it out quickly.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.480
&gt;&gt; This question is
for Nicholas Reynolds.

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:35.650
Mr. Reynolds, back in the 50s
[inaudible] Cuba overseas he had

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:42.750
contacts of the kind with
the rebels [inaudible].

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:44.050
In Spain [inaudible].

00:34:44.050 --> 00:34:49.180
CIA, Yale, Princeton men, ones
that were into literature,

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:57.420
for them Hemmingway
was God the father.

00:34:57.420 --> 00:35:02.760
And God, the father, with his
[inaudible] past in the 30s,

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:09.100
you know, still had [inaudible]
contacts in the 50s, and Spain,

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:16.380
like I said, nobody knows what
he's going to say or do next.

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:21.520
Is there any evidence that he was
under surveillance either in Spain,

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.850
Cuba or anywhere else by the CIA?

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:26.770
Were the CIA [inaudible]
is that a possibility?

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.640
&gt;&gt; So, my -- I -- when I got
to a point in my work, yes,

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:36.630
I worked at CIA, yes, I had
access at the CIA computers.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:43.670
But once I was doing work
on Hemmingway for myself,

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:49.120
I couldn't just roam the
files and call it up.

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:50.420
So, [inaudible] Hemmingway.

00:35:50.420 --> 00:35:58.430
And eventually got a response
and the response to me indicates

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:00.770
that he did not have a CIA file.

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:04.120
So, you know, maybe it's out there,
maybe it's not, but I doubt it.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:07.970
FBI file, he does have an FBI file.

00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:09.270
&gt;&gt; It's thick, right?

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.570
&gt;&gt; Well, yes and no.

00:36:10.570 --> 00:36:13.550
It's 128 pages.

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:16.250
It's on the FBI website,

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:19.980
but it shows that their interest
was moderate compared to some

00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.330
of the people he worked
with like George Ivins,

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:26.910
the Dutch communist photographer.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:31.780
His file, George's
file is 6, 700 pages.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:38.120 position:56%
So, I don't have enough time to go
into Hemmingway and J. Edgar Hoover,

00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:40.550
but in the end J. Edgar
Hoover writes a thing

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:41.990
on Hemmingway's file
saying, "You know,

00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:44.160
this wasn't such a
bad guy after all."

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:51.900
&gt;&gt; But even if it's 128 pages, two
pages could make you a paranoid man

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:55.200
if you think somebody's
watching you.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:57.730
If you are susceptible
to those diseases.

00:36:57.730 --> 00:36:59.030
Sir?

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:02.950
&gt;&gt; Yes. As you all know there
-- the New York Times --

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.250
&gt;&gt; A little louder.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:13.900
&gt;&gt; As you all know, the New York
Times has a thing every Sunday

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:19.410
where they ask authors if they
could have a literary dinner party

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.710
who would they invite?

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:25.270
And I've always -- while
Hemmingway is my favorite author,

00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:28.500
but variety because of
his fascinating life,

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.920 position:56%
I've always been a little concerned,

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:38.030
would I really want him
as a dinner party guest.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:43.350
Because I feel he might
suck all the air

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:47.590
out of the room and
everybody in there.

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.890
&gt;&gt;Right.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:52.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, since you all are the experts
on him in the world right now,

00:37:52.450 --> 00:37:57.710
convince me that I would want
him as a guest at a dinner party.

00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:59.910
&gt;&gt;Mary, tackle that.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:01.210
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.510
I don't know.

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:07.170
I think -- I would not
ask him to a dinner party.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:11.840
He would probably drink too much

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:19.910
and start telling the same
stories over and over.

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:23.520
Actually I'm not kidding really.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.840
But if I could have dinner
with one author, one on one,

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.540
that would be Hemmingway.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:37.090
And, you know, I'd like
to talk to him about stuff

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:38.390
where nobody could overhear us.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:40.240
And, yeah, I think.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.190
&gt;&gt; They are flashing
the 5 minute card.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.990
We'll see what we can get.

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:55.690
Ma'am, put the microphone
down to your face.

00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:01.190
&gt;&gt;We were in Key West recently
and took the tour of the house,

00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:05.300
so I had to buy your
book, Ms. Dearborn.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:10.740
And because I worked with young
children there were two things

00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:17.940
in the book that just really
were red flags for me.

00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:28.140
One that his mother would
hold him and shoot a gun

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.660
so that he would hug her tightly.

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:35.660
So I think the picture on
your book was pretty obvious,

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:37.520
it's what happened after that.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.460
The other one was that the
two children, his sister

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:46.220
and he were sometimes
both dressed as girls

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.980
and then other times
both dressed as boys.

00:39:48.980 --> 00:39:54.270 position:56%
So, I haven't finished the book, but
I would assume that what's happened

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:58.380
from him came from
those early experiences?

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:05.020
&gt;&gt; That's a whole -- we
could go 45 minutes on that.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:06.320
[Talking over each other]

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.950
&gt;&gt; I'll just keep it brief and
say, yes, it definitely did.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:18.100
But a lot of what happened in the
Hemmingway family was genetic.

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:23.090
He did -- he lived by the
gun, he died by the gun.

00:40:23.090 --> 00:40:25.530
His father shot himself with a gun.

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:27.290
And three -- probably half

00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:31.280
of the Hemmingway children
many believe killed themselves,

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.580
three out of six, that's a lot.

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:33.880
That's genetics.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:36.060
That's -- a lot of other
things went into it,

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:39.550
but that will have to do for now.

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:43.530
&gt;&gt; You know, in this pious
Midwestern suburban Chicago family

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:46.980
of eight, six children and
two parents, half took --

00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:50.670
at least half took their
lives by their own hand.

00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:52.400
It was encoded in the DNA.

00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.700
Sir?

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.040
&gt;&gt; I read all three of your
books and they were all great

00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:01.200
for different reasons, so I'm
glad to see you here today.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:02.500
Quick question.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:06.500
Did he ever get close to publishing
any of the books published

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.670
after his death and what did
Scribners and his family do to try

00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:13.520
to get him to finish those books?

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.160
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's a good question.

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:20.820
Scribners was not so keen on what
he was doing in the second half

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.400
of his career and I'm thinking
especially "Across the River

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:29.350
and into the Trees," which
was really a colossal failure.

00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:32.930 position:56%
Max Perkins, who've you've all heard
of, editor of Genius, he had died

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:36.240
and nobody was there to sort of say
-- to rain Earnest in or to say,

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.540
"That's not your best work."

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:38.840
Now, he did at the same time he
wrote, "The Old Man in the Sea,"

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:40.140
which won him back a
lot of his audience.

00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.440
I liked the story, I like
to tell us that for all

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.740
that I think his talent fell apart

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.040
and Scribners didn't
know what to do with him.

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:45.340
On the other hand he put together
in the last year of his life one

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:46.640
of his most charming books,

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.940
"A Moveable Feast,"
about his life in Paris.

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:49.240 position:56%
It's totally made up and full of
falsehoods, but it's a charming book

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.540
and he still had it together.

00:41:50.540 --> 00:41:51.840
But Scribners had really lost
control and when you say --

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.140
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.440
Another thing that moves me, when
we talked about facing these --

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:55.740
if the deepest things that
are moving toward the end

00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:57.040
of your life are these gender
possibilities and transgender

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.340
and you're willing to write it.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:41:59.640
Not publish it, but write
it and leave it behind.

00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.940
The other thing that moves
me so tremendously is

00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.240
that Earnest Hemmingway went to
his writing desk every morning

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.540
that he could in all those
last years knowing that so much

00:42:03.540 --> 00:42:04.840
of it was a shadow of what
he had formerly written.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:06.140
That in itself is a heroic act.

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.440
Nicholas, say the last word.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.740
&gt;&gt; I think of the body of
work that he left more or less

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.040
as the inheritance for his family.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.340
He was taxed to death
during his life.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:12.640
the house was -- he
must have realized

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.940
by then the house was
unlikely to be --

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.240
it would be a property that the
Hemmingway family could dispose of

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.540
and he's got this body of
work that he leaves for them

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:17.840
to publish posthumously
and, you know,

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.140
my educated guest is that's
something he's leaving

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:20.440
for Mary and the boys.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:21.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's a --

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:23.040
&gt;&gt; That's a good one.

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.340
&gt;&gt; I think that's a practical
and realistic answer.

00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:25.640
Are we -- we're done.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:26.940
&gt;&gt; We're done, no way.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.240
&gt;&gt;Thank you.

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:29.540

of the Library of Congress.
