00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.920
The moon is the closest celestial body to
Earth.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.250
Humans have been gazing up at it for our entire
existence, finally landing on its surface

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.480
in the 1960s.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.620
We’ve walked on the moon, carried out science
experiments on the moon, we’ve even driven

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.340
a car, hit golf balls and briefly grew cotton
on the moon.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.680
So, the obvious next question is, when are
we going to start living on the moon?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.291
For decades pop culture has been teasing us
with lunar colonies, military bases, space

00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:35.160
hotels and more, but in order to populate
the moon, or other planets, we may need to

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.430
start small.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.300
So, how close are we to a lunar base?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.570
Now, let’s first clear up what we mean when
we say “lunar base.”

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.460
We’re not talking about a bustling, domed
metropolis.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.330
We’re talking about, an outpost, a lab,
a lunar habitat where scientists, or possibly

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.250
rich tourists, can live and work for an extended
period of time, maybe something similar to

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.070
the 6 month average stay of an astronaut on
the ISS.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.700
For the
first time in human history we are going to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.420
the Moon not to go and come back, but we are
trying to go to the Moon and stay there, hence

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.670
we need to have a Moon base, like a base where
we could live through science, through operations

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.670
with maybe six astronauts altogether.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.940
Only twelve people have ever set foot on the
moon, the last being Eugene Cernan and Jack

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.479
Schmitt during Apollo 17 way back in 1972.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.009
Since then we’ve accomplished many amazing
things in space, from landing a rover on Mars

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.219
to a breathtaking flyby of Pluto.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.929
But we haven’t sent anyone back to the moon...yet.

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:50.029
I think what we're going to see is a big ramping
up of interest in lunar exploration, both

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:55.009
in orbit and at the surface, internationally,
from national agencies and governments, but

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.520
also from the private sector and from commercial
entities.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.069
This interest is going to be driven by science,
by engineering, by technology development,

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.509
by preparing for future exploration, by understanding
the resources that we find locally at the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.280
Moon, and how we can use those things to prepare
us for what we do later…

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.240
You see, setting up a base on the moon may
be key to, not only understanding our past,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.820
but to jumpstarting our future.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.680
We can study the impact craters and geology
to help us better understand the formation

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.750
of our solar system.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.420
We can set up radio telescopes on the far
side which would be shielded from Earth’s

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.730
electromagnetic interference, which would
enable us to better study the big bang.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.930
And we can use a moon base as a testing ground
for an eventual space colony.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.910
Because, right now, we have no data on the
health of astronauts living on another astronomical

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.940
body for months at a time.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.560
And maybe most importantly, we can discover
how efficiently we can be on another world,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.290
since we won’t be able to ship all of our
supplies.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.690
So if we as a species want to go beyond, if
we want to live in space, if we want to work

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:03.930
elsewhere in the solar system, then the way
we do that is we go to the Moon, and we learn

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.560
to live and work for prolonged periods of
time away from the Earth

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.580
using the resources that

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.340
we find locally.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.710
One possible important resource might be newly
confirmed lunar ice, which scientists think

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.700
we could use to create rocket fuel.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.330
We could extract the ice, isolate the oxygen
and hydrogen, and manufacture fuel on the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.340
moon, meaning lunar visitors wouldn’t be
bogged down with the extra weight of return

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.340
fuel.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.930
Another resource is the regolith, which some
space agencies think may be the key to building

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:33.930
a moon base.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.900
Well, if you wanted to build a moon base,
the sort of obvious thing is you'd want to

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.030
use lunar regolith as your basic building
material, because there's lots of it.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.730
If you have to import your construction materials
from Earth, it's just a ridiculously expensive

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.870
thing to do, you know?

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.510
So you need to develop the capacity to turn
regolith into something useful, and there's

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.790
been a lot of proposals.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.070
What we should do is something completely
different, that is we have to ship to the

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.110
moon a 3D printer and the 3D printer, using
the dust that is already on the Moon, so the

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.180
Moon regolith, would build completely automatically
using the sunlight endlessly available on

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.960
the Moon surface,
by baking layer after layer the Moon base

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.660
in a completely automatic manner.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.280
Others think we could start shipping modules
to the moon piece by piece, similar to how

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.490
we’ve built space stations in low earth
orbit.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.540
Or we could just dig an underground bunker,
tunneling under the regolith.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.650
But whichever plan we go with, there needs
to be thick walls between the people inside

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.850
and the harmful environment outside.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:39.100
The Moon can be very hot during the daytime
and very cold at night, so you need to be

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.280
able to moderate those temperatures so that
astronauts can live in a comfortable environment.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.960
You're also exposed to radiation that comes
from the Sun and from deep space, and so you

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.050
need to find ways of reducing the radiation
that astronauts are exposed to.

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:57.760
A base on the moon would look basically like
a very large hill from the outside.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.950
And the reason for that is there's quite a
bit of radiation on the surface of the moon...For

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.940
your radiation shielding you need about five
or six meters, about 15 to 20 feet.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.340
And you've got to pile that on top of your
modules, which are probably a good 10 feet.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.970
So you've got basically a hill 30 or 40 feet
tall.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.612
The inside, particularly for early bases,
is probably very much like the inside of the

00:05:18.612 --> 00:05:20.710
International Space Station.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:30.590
Lots of wires and laptops and metal and storage
units and stuff like that….

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.810
But of course this very large hill will need
to be top of the line, equipped and set up

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.030
with everything needed to maintain a lunar
crew.

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.800
The major thing you're going to need is, of
course, to be able to get there, to get back,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.270
to be able to enable astronauts to survive,
to be able to work in a comfortable environment

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.560
that is safe, but then also to have the facilities
that are needed for research and for transport

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.020
around the lunar surface.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.430
In particular, power is going to be a major
aspect of any infrastructure.

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.680
Well, the stuff you need before you build
a moon base is very similar to what you need

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.712
for anything else in space.

00:06:05.712 --> 00:06:08.311
The first, most important thing is you have
to be able to breathe.

00:06:08.311 --> 00:06:12.260
So that means you need a pressure vessel,
and it means you need an atmosphere that has

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.250
enough oxygen and enough other stuff so the
oxygen doesn't turn into an inferno.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.250
You need food.

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.400
Of course, the food needs a lot of water,
because you need water to grow crops

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.430
You're going to have to have massive resupply
from Earth or you're going to have to figure

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.740
out how to get water out of the lunar soil.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.810
Yes, a lunar base does seem futuristic and
sci-fi, but we’re already working on all

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.980
the things required down here on Earth.

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:41.770
We’re 3D printing building blocks using
materials that simulate lunar regolith.

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.030
Scientists are planning missions to further
study lunar ice in order to better prepare

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.440
for extraction.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.270
There are groundbreaking greenhouses around
the world proving agriculture can flourish

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.430
inside.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:55.550
And with the rise of private space companies,
the cost of sending supplies or people to

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.620
the moon might be on its way down, especially
if Elon Musk’s “Big Falcon Rocket” comes

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:01.880
to fruition.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.590
This is the rocket that is hoping to send
a Japanese billionaire to the moon and one

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.400
day carry some of the first Mars explorers.

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.540
So, then what is stopping us?

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.770
First of all, in my opinion more than a technical
aspect or a technical issue, more than that

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.840
is a political issue.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:23.210
What we need to solve is we need to get all
the political need and will to do a mission

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.910
of this proportion.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.700
We need to have not just Europe, not just
the United States, but certainly Europe, certainly

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:37.330
the United States, Russia, India, China, Japan,
Canada all working in a mission of this proportion.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:43.199
I think the fundamental reason there's not
a base on the moon today is there's not enough

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:46.300
interest to justify the right resources necessary.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.570
So, all we have to do is convince the governments
of the world to work together and put up billions

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:55.680
of dollars in order to advance our understanding
of our solar system and ensure that living

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.750
off Earth could be a viable option.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:05.330
Oh, and make sure the base is usable, safe,
has enough power, water, food, heat and oxygen.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.330
Seems easy enough.

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:13.610
So, how close are we to a moon base?

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:18.380
The way things are steady state, we're not
particularly close to a moon base.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:22.270
People have ideas, but there's no funded project
that says, "And when we're done, we're going

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:23.270
to have built a moon base."

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.710
It just doesn't exist at the moment.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:29.690
However, we've got these really incredible
vehicles coming online from SpaceX, or at

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.990
least we hope they're going to come online
within not too terribly long.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:39.289
If those vehicles become available, and they
meet something resembling what industry rumor

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:46.370
and SpaceX says they might meet, then you
could easily see serious progress on a lunar

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:48.910
base in five or ten years.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:55.830
So my hope is that within 10 or so years from
now, we would be having the first human missions

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.650
returning to the lunar surface.

00:08:57.650 --> 00:09:01.320
So once we've done that, we can start to build
up the capabilities that we would need, and

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:06.820
so my expectation is that a base at the lunar
surface, based on current planning, would

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.011
become possible during the mid to end point
of the 2030s.

00:09:10.011 --> 00:09:11.011
That's when I would expect it to happen.

00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:12.011
To state how close we are is very difficult
for me at the moment.

00:09:12.011 --> 00:09:13.011
What I can say is that what we need to have,
again, I'm saying this many times because

00:09:13.011 --> 00:09:14.011
this is really the missing bit at the moment.

00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:16.510
We need to have the will of many political
entities in the world to decide to go and

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.640
build a Moon base.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.130
In my opinion, we are certainly not talking
about hundreds of years, we are talking about

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:27.220
few decades to get a functioning Moon base
on the Moon surface.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.600
Great, where do I sign up?

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:33.560
If this episode piqued your interest on lunar travel, you should check out our Apollo series.
