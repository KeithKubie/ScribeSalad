00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.320
Alright, we've got VIP tickets sold 2, general admission, 4. Very cool.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:06.102
&gt;&gt; Got it.

00:00:06.102 --> 00:00:09.840
&gt;&gt; Okay But this is obviously wrong. Tickets sold should be 6, not 0.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.850
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.740
&gt;&gt; Should I do another roll-up summary?

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.670
&gt;&gt; Well, we could do another roll-up summary, but you

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.200
can only have ten roll-up summaries per object, and we might

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.230
want to calculate some other things, so. Instead of using a

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.670
roll up summary, we can do what's called a formula field.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.100
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.650
&gt;&gt; Very similar, but it's a little bit more dynamic and you have

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.020
more functionality you can add to it.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:27.490
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.900
&gt;&gt; But really, all we're obviously trying to

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.890
do here, is adding those two numbers together.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.010
&gt;&gt; 2 plus 4. So, how should I add this formula field?

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.910
&gt;&gt; Well why don't you try and figure it out?

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.
