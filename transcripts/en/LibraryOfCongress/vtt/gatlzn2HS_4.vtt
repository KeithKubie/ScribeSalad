00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.730
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.010
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Mark Horowitz from
the Music Division of the Library

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.750
of Congress and I'm here with the
master musician Jason Robert Brown

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.510
and we're here mostly
to discuss music.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.250
I don't know if you, we called
this sort of oral history

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.960 position:56%
but it's going to be fairly focused.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.000
&gt;&gt; Is there something else I
would be qualified to discuss?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.830
&gt;&gt; I wanted to start, there is an
aphorism attributed to Ned Rorem

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.080
and it goes something like
amateurs talk about meanings

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.580
and professionals talk about means.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.600
What I want to know first is
the physical how you work.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.620
Do you work at a piano, do you
have a computer next to you,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.510
do you record as you're
playing, do you make notes?

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.520
&gt;&gt; I feel like I'm
sort of in the middle

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.160
of changing how all of that works.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.950
It used to be that I would sit at
the piano and sort of bang things

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.630
out and you know, I would know,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.810
before I sat down at the
piano I would have a title,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.210
usually I'd have a precede of what
the song was going to be in my head

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.760
which I'd encapsulated in a couple
of words and so I would sing

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.930
that title and I'd have
an instinctive sense

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.390
of what is the tonality, is
it a major key, minor key,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.130
and what is the style of
it, is it sort of jazzy,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.060
is it sort of rocky, is
it sort of classical?

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.670
And you know, the basic parameters
around that so before I sit

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.970
down at the piano I've already
made a couple of decisions

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.790 position:56%
but then the piano is going to start
influencing a bunch of the decisions

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.560
that I make from there on out.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.970 position:56%
And so, I'll start singing along and
gradually sort of carve out a shape

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.010
of a melody or at the very
least a harmonic progression

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:11.840
and some rhythmic ideas in terms

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.140
of where the melody is
going to live within that.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.650
So, I'll do all of
that and sort of come

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.990
up with a basic structure
for how the song works.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.230
I usually will stop at the
bridge and just leave the bridge

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.810
for a minute but just get those
first chunks done you know,

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.910
what's the verse structure,
what's the chorus structure

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.220
and am I using a conventional
structure or am I going

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.510
to ski the powder and sort
of see where it leads me.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.400 position:56%
And you know, I'll sort of start
making those decisions as I carve it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.710
out and then gradually
fitting words to it and some

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.010
of the words will have come

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.390
up as I've started just singing
things randomly at the piano.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.160
Some words will sort of find
their way into my subconsciousness

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.540
because I mean, I know again
what the character is thinking

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.990
so there's certain phrases that
I'll start just sort of improvising

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.140
and those might suddenly I'll go,
oh and that actually fits nicely

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.320
over this and then that rhymes
nicely with that and then oh,

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.810
I see where I want to go.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.730 position:56%
So all of that stuff is going on and
it's all sort of very free formed

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.720
but it's directed you
know, it's not random.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.880
I always know sort of what
the end result should be,

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.670
it just takes me a lot of
synthesizing to get there.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.620
And then, once I've got
a basic verse structure

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.240 position:56%
and a basic chorus structure, I will
usually go away and just chip away

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.990
at lyrics for a while and just
sort of get all that to line up

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.760
and there are oftentimes where I
never get back to the piano again

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.000
until the first time I'm
showing the song to somebody,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.230
which may even include a
bridge that I've written

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.530
and I just know what
it is in my head

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.340
but I've never actually put my
fingers on the keys to do it,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.770
but you know they'll be someone
coming over to hear the song

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.730
and I'll be like oh, and I'll
just pull it out of the printer

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.030
and I'll say all right here it was.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.200
And I try to write lyrics by hand
because I sort of think better

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.370
through my pen then I do
when I'm typing but again,

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.670
it depends on the deadline.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.830
I can sort of do it however but
I don't notate score usually

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.940
until the very end of
the process because much

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.680
of what I'm doing is
chordally based as so as long

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.040
as I know what the general harmonic
progression is I'm not so caught

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.100
up in the specifics
of the accompaniment

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.050
or I know what they are so
specifically that I don't have

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.350
to write them down for a while,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.230
but I actually prefer the
organic letting it come

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.260
out of my hands first, let my
hands get used to what the feel

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.550
of the song is and then I
will start really shaping it

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.980
into the notated accompaniment.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.480
But when I say that I'm in
the middle of changing that,

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.990 position:56%
when I did Bridges of Madison County
I wrote most of that on guitar,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.160
which is not an instrument
that I really play but I wanted

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.400
to have tonalities that were not
what I usually hit with my fingers

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.820
and so because I was writing on
an instrument that I didn't know,

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.860
I couldn't just call up a bunch
of things that I knew how to do.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.630 position:56%
That was much more of an exploratory
process where I would just pick

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.150
up the guitar and sit with it and
just sort of make noises on it

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:12.580
and as I would come up with
shapes, accompaniment figures,

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.100
structural ideas, I would say does
this feel like this character,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.460
does that feel like what I
want this moment to feel like?

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.540 position:56%
And as I got a little more fluent on
the instrument, and I never got good

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:26.900
at it but as I got more fluent
on it, I eventually was able

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.280 position:56%
to anticipate some things and was
able to make certain decisions ahead

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.390
of time but I'd say the first three
or four things I wrote for Bridges

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.310
of Madison County on the
guitar were very sort of like,

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.720
I don't know what's going to happen
and I liked that sort of looseness

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.110
and craziness, but within
that looseness then the rest

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.120
of the process was very similar.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.930
Once I would sort of see a
light at the end of the tunnel,

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:51.980
then I knew how to sort
of push towards it.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:57.160
But lately, I've also been doing a
lot more of recording stuff as I'm

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.220 position:56%
in the middle of writing it and then
just letting it marinate for a while

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.640
or sometimes I'll layer
recordings on top of each other

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.120
and I'll use the garage bands
on my Mac and sort of let

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.350
that be a template for things.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.800
There was one project that I
had to write very, very quickly

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.020
and it all had to be
very idiomatic music,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.890
it all needed to be really
rock music and I found

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.620 position:56%
that I just used the drum loops from
garage band which are very generic

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.210
and I just used those, and I didn't
use any of the harmonic loops

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.160
that they have on there
because that felt like cheating

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.710
but I used the drum loops and just
played along with them and I felt

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:35.250 position:56%
like oh, now I feel like I'm in that
band and that's doing that thing

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.680
for me so I did that, but
I don't think I would do

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.630
that for a more legit project.

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:45.200
This was for a commercial
thing that I was doing.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.690
&gt;&gt; You've talked a lot about the
importance of structure in songs

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.680
so when you have this initial
idea, do you have a sense

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.410
that this is going to be, the A
section will be about this topic,

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.470
then it will go here
and the bridge will go

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.370
that direction or it's not that-

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.740
&gt;&gt; I sort of, I feel like
there are a lot of songs

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.730
where I may have outlined
that in advance.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:12.490
There are certainly, I
think the vast majority

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.310
of my songs you can diagram
them that way after the fact.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.480
&gt;&gt; But not going into it?

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.340
&gt;&gt; Well, I think going
in it's very clear

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.510
to me what I'm doing
with the first verse.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.880
I always know where the song is
starting and then I will need

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.570
to do something else
for the second verse

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.660
because I have a real
philosophy about the way

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.210
that theater songs have to function
and what justifies repetition

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.940
because to me, it feels
like if the music is going

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:40.660
to repeat itself them dramatically
you can't be repeating yourself.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.460
The lyrics have to be taking you
someplace else and when I teach,

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:50.540
I often have a think I talk about
how if you're going to be trying

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.650
to convince somebody of
something you might say it to them

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:55.320
and if they didn't get it
you might say it again,

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.440
but you're not just going to say
it a third time without trying

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.030
to find some other way around
it, some way to elaborate into it

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:01.330
and so I always think of that

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.550
as the B section is bridge
and then the final A.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.970
&gt;&gt; But dramatically, you
know where you're starting.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:08.290
Do you know where you want
that character to end?

00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:10.490
&gt;&gt; If you're lucky you do.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:15.970
If I'm honest with
who the character is,

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.540
then I should know before I start
the song what I hope for it to end

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.560
with but I say that and I
have been surprised often

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.340
by where the characters take me
over the course of writing the song

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.200
and sometimes it's something
as simple as a rhyme is going

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:33.280
to lead me over here and
because the rhyme led me there,

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.810
suddenly the character
feels something

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.320
and learns something that's
not untrue to the character

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.880
but it may not have been what
I intended the song to say.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.170
But having said it all of
a sudden, it lifts the song

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.590
and likewise I can have that

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:50.300
and then it sends the whole song
off the cliff and then I have

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.640
to go and rescue it back.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:57.150
But I think in terms of the
sort of [inaudible] structure

00:08:57.150 --> 00:09:01.980
over everything, there is always a
general sense that you're going to,

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.900
at some point over here if this is
the whole piece then at some point

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.410
over here there's going to be the
kind of ultimatum of the song,

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:08.990
there's going to be
some real turning point

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.840 position:56%
about what the piece is and then the
resolution which is either positive

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.200
or negative or even stasis,
however things resolve from here.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.430
But all of the thing
that gets you up to

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:24.830
that point is really asking the
questions and finding other ways

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.480 position:56%
to ask the questions and I feel
like that's what the song always is.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.610
The song is a series of
demands and questions trying

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.170
to lead up to a decision.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.860
I think there are some songs
of mine that are very clear how

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.340
that all works, I was thinking
You Don't Know This Man is a song

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:40.390
that you know exactly
sort of what it's doing

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:43.450
because dramatically it's meant
to be sort of the first A,

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:44.930
she won't look at him
when she's talking

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.650
and then the second A
she looks directly at him

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.470
and then the bridge you know,
she really pins it right on him

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.980
and the finals statement, the final
A she shuts him down and I feel

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:56.120
like you really see
sort of what that is

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.050
because she's actually just talking
to herself over the course of that.

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:02.640
But then you know, something like
The Schmuel Song, which is seven

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.600
and a half minutes long, there is
still the exact same [inaudible]

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.210
structure to it but what it takes
in order to get there you know,

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.890
I remember while writing
it I don't know

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:13.980
when I'm going to get out of this.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:16.510
You know, it was just sort of
taking me all of these places

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:20.260
and I was enjoying the ride and I
thought the song was benefitting

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.040
from the ride but I really thought
this song might be 20 minutes long,

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.740
it might be two minutes long,
I don't know because the path

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:29.520
over to here was so windy

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.930 position:56%
that I just couldn't tell how long
it was going to take me to get there

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:35.140 position:56%
and then when it did finally wrap up
it was like oh I see it, I see it,

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.180
I see it, I get it and then I
could sort of put a bow on it.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.790
But you know, so I think those are
the kind of two extremes you know,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:46.950
structurally of what my
songs are but you know,

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.880
I do always have a general sense
of what the song is supposed

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.030
to accomplish and then
there are tweaks

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.520
and specifics that I think get all-

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.770
&gt;&gt; And there's surprises
to you as it goes along.

00:10:56.770 --> 00:10:59.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean to me it's
the most fun when there are.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.910
You know, if it's exactly
what you thought it was going

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.220
to be then really you're just
being a secretary to your brain,

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.290
which is not as much fun.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:09.990
You know, what there really
is, is there's this thing

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:12.660
where your brain does,
it makes some leap

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:15.920 position:56%
that you didn't know it was going to
make and that's why you're a writer.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.220
I mean, that's why I'm a writer.

00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:19.660
It's just those moments
where you're like oh, oh,

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.870
I didn't know that was coming and
I didn't know that was going to be

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.050
that and that's perfect, that's
exactly what that's supposed to be

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.820
and I have such a sense of pride
in those moments and such a sense

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.460
of accomplishment in those moments.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.960
That's sort of what
I'm working towards.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.620
It's why I write slowly also
is I don't want to just sort

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.220
of all right, I know what
this song is and I write it.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.760
I think I always could, I
think I could do that now

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.430
if you said write it, I could
just go ahead and write it

00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:46.400
but the real joy is in
making all of it sort

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.110 position:56%
of click together exactly right in
some way that I can't see right now.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:55.150
&gt;&gt; Somewhere you wrote I think
in the intro to something,

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.870
to the libretto for
The Last Five Years,

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:00.940
that you remember writing
the opening number

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:03.350
on this particular day.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:09.670
Is there a typical time that it
takes to write a song, a range?

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.950
&gt;&gt; I think the reason I can
tell you I wrote that song

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:16.840 position:56%
on any particular day or anything
like that is there are those moments

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:21.570
where a song sort of
clicks, they're very powerful

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:26.090
and so a song can take three weeks
to write but there is a moment

00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:29.520
in which the song sort
of coalesces into a thing

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.090
and that can be you know, when
you're two weeks in to trying

00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.930
to figure it out or
it can be just sort

00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.230
of on the first minute
that you have it.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:38.620
I mean, there are certainly,

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:40.300
even recently there are
songs I've written very,

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.940
very quickly that just
sort of poured out of me

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.990
that were very satisfying.

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:50.200
Actually, the last two songs
that I wrote there's a song

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.970
that I'm writing for the
connector which is very,

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:59.160
very complicated long sort of
rap, punk, crazy thing that I did

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.690
and it took me the better part
of three months to write it

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.760
because it was just so dense and
the information had to be parsed

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.630
in exactly the right way so
the audience could hear it.

00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.330
And it just took me a long time to
figure out how to do all of that

00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.710
and then there was the song I
wrote the day after the election

00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:18.800 position:56%
which was Hope, which I wrote in I
think 18 or 19 minutes and you know,

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.740
both immensely satisfying
songs to me but you know,

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:27.440
the process by which they all
come is sort of a little crazy.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.060 position:56%
But I remember the day I finished up
the song for The Connector as well.

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:33.360
&gt;&gt; What is The Connector?

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.290
&gt;&gt; The Connector is one of the
new pieces that I'm working on.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:37.590
&gt;&gt; It's a show?

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:38.930
&gt;&gt; It's a show, yes.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:44.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; When you're writing a show song
versus a stand along song like Hope,

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:48.960
is it an entirely different thing,
you're writing for your voice,

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.820
not for a character in a situation?

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:54.860
&gt;&gt; It's not an entirely different
thing but it's a different thing.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:14:00.750
Knowing that I'm going to
sing it generally means also

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:05.700
that my band is going to play
it so there are different things

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.120
that I do musically when
I'm writing for myself

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.920
but without sounding pretentious
about it, there is myself

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:14.880
as a character, there
is myself as the person

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.220
on stage singing the
song which is a thing.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.060
You know, it's different than me
sitting at the dining room table.

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:26.300
I wouldn't be singing so
there is a certain distance.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:31.950 position:56%
It is an intangible and unmeasurable
distance between me and that guy

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.900
but there is still a
character involved in that

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.250
and when I'm writing a
character for a show,

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:42.210
then I'm definitely
inside a different person.

00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:44.740
There are even times when
I'm writing songs for shows

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.790
that I know I'm going to want to
do in my act, that I know I'm going

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.420
to want to do with my band and
I do approach those differently.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.190
I find that the songs I write for
the guys I tend to really think

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:59.040
about am I going to want to sing
this whereas the songs I write

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:03.130
for the girls I tend not to think
that because I'm not likely to

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.140 position:56%
and then sometimes I'll end up with
one where like, oh I have to do this

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.160
and I'll make accommodations
for that.

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:15.860
But it is in my head and I
don't think it's a bad thing.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.150
I think there's, because musical
theater is essentially meant to be

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:22.710
on a stage, it is meant
to be performed,

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:25.070
being able to anticipate
the performative aspects

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.960
of the material I think is part
of what makes my stuff what it is.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:34.620
I mean, I think part of why my
songs breathe in the particular way

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.360
that they do is that I
know that I will need to,

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:42.480
physically myself I will need
to defend them behind a piano.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:47.250
If I can't do it, then I can't
ask somebody else to do it.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.000
&gt;&gt; Back to the original
sort of question,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.060
when you sort of completed a
song, what do you physically do?

00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:57.360
Do you write out a lead sheet?

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.810
Do you write a complete-

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.120
&gt;&gt; Oh no, no, no, at this point

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.830
when I'm done writing
a song I'll record it

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:08.660
and I'll do a pretty elaborate, I
mean obviously I have good fingers

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:15.610 position:56%
so I can do a pretty elaborate piano
demo and if it needs musical means

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:18.930
that the piano does not
accurately represent,

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.510
if your imagination
would require a leap

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:23.680
that I can't expect your
imagination to take in order

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.320
to understand what the song is,
then I'll also put other things on.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.890
I'll put percussion instruments on,
or I'll put my guitar playing on,

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:32.950
none of which is very good but
it's just to give you an idea

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.570
that this is not supposed
to sound like me sitting

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.390
at the piano so I'll make the demo.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:42.280
I have one assistant who
transcribes just the vocal line

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.190
because that is really
just secretary work

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:48.080
and so they'll just transcribe the
vocal line for me and then sort

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.330
of any obvious piano figures,
anything that you can hear

00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:55.400
in the accompaniment that I
clearly do over and over again,

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.680
that's something that
must be in there

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.370
and then leave the rest
of the piano part blank.

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:05.180 position:56%
And so, they'll deliver to me a
finale file which has the vocal line

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.750
in it and sort of whatever of the
piano part was worth grabbing,

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.890
anything that will
save me a little time.

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:16.680 position:56%
And when the singers first get the
material in a reading in a workshop,

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.440
usually that's all they get.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.080
My Music Director Tom
Murray, will often sketch

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:25.560
in more complete accompaniments
but I deliberately keep those

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.270
out of my personal files because I
don't want to get sort of seduced

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:32.500 position:56%
by how easy it is to just use those.

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.650
So Tom will sort of feather
in some fake accompaniment

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.310 position:56%
so that he can play it at rehearsals

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:40.810
or so other rehearsal pianists
can do it and then eventually,

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:44.730
usually when it's time to
orchestrate I will first write

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.910
out a more fully realized
piano part even

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:52.050 position:56%
if that isn't what the piano part
is going to be in the orchestration.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:54.980
I just sort of like to reduce it
something that I can then work

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.250
from on a very concrete,
because orchestration

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.150
for me is still a very
concrete thing.

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.210
I know there's a lot of people that
just play things and the keyboards,

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:07.040
they work in a more abstract
way then that but for me I need

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.400
to see two stabs worth
of dots and I'm like,

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.310
okay now I know what I want to
do around it and I know enough

00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:19.160
to eviscerate all of the dots
but for me that's a useful guide.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.300
And again, if I have to work
really fast I don't need that,

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.270
I know what I have to do but in
the ideal world I'll realize an

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:27.830
accompaniment fairly fully
and that's the accompaniment

00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.210
that will get in the
vocal selections,

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:31.160
that will get in the published
scores, that will sort of be all

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.730
that and then I'll
orchestrate it from there

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.040
if I'm doing the orchestration.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.510
If someone else is
doing the orchestration,

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:40.220 position:56%
if I send it to Sebesky or if I send
it to Charlie Rosen, or if I send it

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.450
to Sam Davis or anybody else
you know, then they'll usually,

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:49.350 position:56%
Sebesky writes by hand and illegibly
so I'll get Sebesky's charts back

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:53.410
and I'll usually have to have the
copyist do that into a finale file

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:57.960
so that I can actually just read
what it is because it's just

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.480
like your doctor's prescription,

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:03.230
it's completely illegible
except to the copyist.

00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:05.630
And so once I get that,
then I will do a lot

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.820
of corrections to anybody's charts.

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:13.800
I fix a lot of orchestrations,
I fiddle and so I'll correct,

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.570
if I get it from Charlie or from
Sam they'll send me finale files

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:17.870
and I'll usually do
the corrections right

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.860 position:56%
into finale which I know how to use.

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.050
I'm not fast at it and I
don't like it very much.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.970
There's something I like about
the tactility of pencils.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:32.190
And so then that sort of goes off
into the world and I have a copyist

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:34.890
in Chicago who does the
vast majority of my work

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:38.020
and so then he'll get
all of it extracted

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.940 position:56%
and then there's usually generations
upon generations upon generations

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.390
of fixes and cleanups and things
like that until you get to a place

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:47.120
where it can finally get published.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.840 position:56%
But for early shows like Songs For a
New World, those materials are still

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:55.620
in fairly lousy shape and that is
largely because it just takes me

00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.040
so long to say what I
want the piano part to be.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:05.860 position:56%
And so everything that has to happen
thereafter goes really fast like,

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.910
I'm writing a piano part and here
are the orchestrations and go

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.960
and then everything is just fixes,
and fixes, and fixes, and fixes

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.450
and it costs money to fix all those
things, which I don't usually have

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.000
and nobody is generally
offering me so things can get

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.220
in pretty loosy goosy
shape for a while.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.730
I think Parade we finally
have perfectly corrected

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:25.530 position:56%
and fixed scores for full orchestra.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:31.940
The show premiered in 1998, I
think I got those done in 2015.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.810
&gt;&gt; Tunick uses a phrase
the eye that hears,

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:42.880
and as I understood him he sort
of visualizes the actual music

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.740
in his head as he's working, he
sort of sees the dots in his brain.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:54.490 position:56%
The fact that you're so, that you're
not writing things down initially

00:20:54.490 --> 00:21:00.360
and you're a musician, what
are you holding in your brain?

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.830
Are you actually seeing the
music when you're playing things?

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.130
Is it-

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:06.430
&gt;&gt; No, I mean, I have layer.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.210
I have layers that I sort of
am aware of layers of music

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.650
as I'm listening to
it, I hear in layers,

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.980
I sort of hear they compress
and then they expand.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:18.180
I mean, that would be a pretty cool
visual idea to try and explain it

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:23.040
so I wasn't literate first, I
was an illiterate musician first.

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:26.290
I didn't come from the
dots out, I had a very,

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:30.630
very rudimentary you know, I
started when I was eight years old

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:33.200
and so I had a very rudimentary,
this is what a middle C is

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.570
and so I could do it
but I was just too lazy

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.770
and I preferred playing things.

00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:40.670
You know there wasn't back
then any kind of school

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:45.140
of idiomatic piano playing other
than this is how you learn how

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:47.150
to play Liszt and this is how
you learn how to play Chopin,

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:50.880
which wasn't very interesting to
me and so I bailed out of that

00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:54.590 position:56%
and just became sort of a player
who played whatever I wanted to play

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:57.860
and it took me a long time
to get back to the dots.

00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:05.750 position:56%
And so, in the meantime I developed
a fairly extensive way of conceiving

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:12.660
of music and musical structures
that is not notation based.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:14.660
I go in the other direction.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:18.240
I think somebody like Tunick
started looking at paper and for me

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.220
by the time I looked at the paper,
by the time I knew really what

00:22:21.220 --> 00:22:24.300
that meant, I was making
music for a long time already

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.210
so I can again synthesize
both of those things

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:29.460
because I've had enough experience
with looking at the paper

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:34.460
that I know how to make it make
sense but I think if you asked me

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:40.040
to visualize what one of
my songs is, a lot of it is

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.620
about the placement of
my fingers on the keys.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:46.880
I know sort of what the cord
looks like under my hand

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.120
and because I also play without
really looking at my hands,

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.560
it's more that I just
know what it feels like.

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.480
I know what a song is supposed
to feel like under my fingers

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.320
and I don't even know that
that's a visual thing.

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.090
There's a muscular relationship to
my understanding of harmony and how

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:07.370
that drives through the song
so I think that's really,

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:10.060
I don't know that that makes
any sense when I say it

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:13.150
but no one has really asked me to
talk about it before but I think

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:22.890
if you asked me when I'm trying to
perform a song that I've written

00:23:22.890 --> 00:23:28.140
for example, there are a number
of different sort of cues that are

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.830
in my head so I'm not following
a core in the sense of one

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.330
of those scores over there.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.820
I'm not following a score but
there is a score in my head

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:40.690
and it's a bunch of sign posts and
some of those sign posts do consist

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:47.070 position:56%
of literal written notation and
some of them consist of typed lyrics

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.760
on a page, or hand written lyrics
on a page, some of them consist

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.390
of oh your hands are supposed
to go to this place and some

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:57.840
of them are just memories about
where I was when I wrote the song.

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.160
There's something about that
that I go oh there's the thing

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:02.910
and it leads me to that's what
I'm supposed to do at that moment

00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:06.480
because oh, I wrote this when
I was in London or I wrote this

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.850
when I was sitting and the kitchen
was over here and so I know that

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:12.230
and that's what gets me to there.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.770
So, there's a whole
crazy thing of memory.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:18.720 position:56%
I remember I read a great story in
The New Yorker a couple of years ago

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:24.650
and it talked about storytellers
in India who they have a story

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:27.640
that lasts for an entire year
and it's an oral tradition

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.580
so that they are taught as
children, and if they are going

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.910
to become the storyteller
they are taught

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:34.290
as children how the
story goes and it lasts,

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:39.130
every night there is a chunk that
could be 20 minutes, an hour long,

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:43.580
whatever it is but every single
night of the year all 365

00:24:43.580 --> 00:24:47.710
or however many, there is a part
of the story that they have to do

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.350
and they have these
memorized in their heads.

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:55.600
But they found that once these
people learned to read and write,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.800
they actually become infinitely
less capable of holding all of that

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:05.140
in their memory, that you've
developed this incredible memory

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:08.010
because there's no way
to put it down on paper

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:11.750
but once you can put it on
paper, once you can do that,

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:13.900
once you can store
it somewhere else,

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:18.140
your brain says oh thank goodness
we don't have to do that anymore,

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:21.540
and it sheds some of it and
so I think part of my ability

00:25:21.540 --> 00:25:25.140
to remember my scores
is because it comes

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.460
from not having notated
them in the first place.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:32.000 position:56%
It comes from having a series of
sort of things in my head and I find

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.470
that the songs that I do notate
first are the more kind of,

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:40.830
for lack of a better word, the
more serious classically kind

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.130
of things that I do.

00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:45.330 position:56%
When I have to notate them first, I
find that I have very little ability

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:48.960 position:56%
to memorize them, it's very hard
for me to reproduce them accurately.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:54.660
There's a chunk of Still Hurting
that is a fairly strict invention

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:59.330
in three parts and it's not just
that I can't really play it all

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:05.040
that well but after what's now been
15 years, I just know harmonically

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.820
where it's supposed to be but the
specific notes that are supposed

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.800
to happen in there, I'm always
like uh, and I've looked

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.130
at it a thousand times so that
I can do it in performances

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.450
and it just does not penetrate.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:18.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Every time you perform something,

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.460
this song will always
be in this key?

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I can change the keys because I
know what the harmonic relationships

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.160
are but-

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:27.950
&gt;&gt; So the muscle memory can still-

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I may not play it
as accurately in the key but I mean,

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:35.480
I know how to, on a technical level
I know how to transpose my stuff.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:39.700
There are some things I wouldn't
dare to do but I can make my way

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.150
through it but most
songs belong in the keys,

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:45.920
in my head most songs believe in
the specific key that I wrote them

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.990
in and I can monkey around.

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:50.600
I Love Betsy, I wrote
in D, I play it in C

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.830
because I can't really sing
all the high notes if I do it

00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:57.570 position:56%
but it just doesn't belong in C all
that well but I can do it, it's fine

00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.670
but it's supposed to be in D.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.180
&gt;&gt; When you're playing
accompanying yourself,

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.560
is there much improvisation

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.830
or it's pretty much this is
the accompaniment, this is-

00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:08.240
&gt;&gt; No, no, there's a
lot of improvisation.

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.910
I mean some songs, You Don't Know
This Man, there's no improvising

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.810
in that, that is specifically
what it is and a song

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:18.750
like The Flagmaker is going to be
largely what it is but for a lot

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:22.740
of my songs there's room
to interpret around it.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.970
I mean, I am an improvising
pianist, that is part of what I do

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:29.160
so for me it's more fun if it
doesn't always sort of have to lock

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:34.080
in exactly like this all the
way and especially for the shows

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.380
that are kind of loose and groovy.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.810
For a show like Honeymoon in
Vegas you want some of the songs

00:27:37.810 --> 00:27:40.670
to be able to stretch
out and open up.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:45.390
It's all within very
specific boundaries.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:49.150
I don't reinvent the
songs when I play them,

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:52.500 position:56%
it's just these two bars it could be
this thing or it could be this thing

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.170
but the basic feel
and harmonic structure

00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:56.470
of it is going to be the same.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:00.040
There's just filigree that
can change from time to time.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:03.130
And again, I think that's
more a pop music thing.

00:28:03.130 --> 00:28:05.030
It's basically just riffing.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:08.810
I feel free to make those
changes within some of the songs

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.110
because it's part of the fun

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.840
of performing them is
to let them breathe.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:18.110
&gt;&gt; Will you sit in your living room
and just play Isn't it Romantic or-

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.960
&gt;&gt; Sure, all the time.

00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.100
Yeah, especially with, it was part
of the courting ritual with Georgia

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:29.970
to play Gershwin and sit there and
do all that but now with the girls,

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:33.440
the girls love to, I have two
daughters, I have a seven year old

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.540
and an eleven year old, so
the seven year old loves

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:38.090 position:56%
to dance whenever I play the piano
so sometimes I'll just start playing

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:40.530
so that she'll come wandering into
my studio and start dancing around

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:42.630
and then wander out
again and then I'll stop.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:45.210
But yeah, I play all the time.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:47.110
You know, I wish I played more.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:50.010
I don't get to the piano
as often as I would like to

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.910
but I think pretty much anybody
with kids would say that.

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.370
&gt;&gt; Does your wife also?

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.460
Do you ever fight to
get to the piano?

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:57.760
&gt;&gt; We have two pianos [laughter].

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.230
We have one in the
basement and one upstairs

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.810
so we don't have to fight to often.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:04.590
&gt;&gt; You don't do four hand?

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.580
&gt;&gt; Again, the courting ritual
was a lot of four hands

00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:08.130
which it turns out was a big thing.

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:09.430
Did you read that article?

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:12.000
There was something in The Times
I think that talked about sort

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.950
of the origin of four hand piano
was that it was back in the 1800s,

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:19.570
it was a way to sit in a salon, a
man and a woman would sit together

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.690
and play four hands and that the
really craft four hand arrangements

00:29:22.690 --> 00:29:25.630
involved a lot of reaching hands
over each other and doing things

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:31.040
like that, and that part of it
was to allow husbands and wives

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.790
but also not husbands
and wives to interact

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:36.800
with each other very closely in
that way, so we did a lot of that.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:40.590 position:56%
We don't do an awful lot of four
hands now but again, whenever we get

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:44.440
to the piano now it's
usually for work so it's not

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.690
as much of that as I would like.

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:49.110
&gt;&gt; Well we got through
my first question.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.610
&gt;&gt; All right good.

00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:55.340
&gt;&gt; In a master class you gave,
you talked about the importance

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.550
of staging what you write
as you're writing it.

00:29:58.550 --> 00:30:02.940
At what point in the process

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:07.670
as you're writing are you picturing
what the performers might be doing

00:30:07.670 --> 00:30:08.970
on the stage?

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:10.270
Does that come afterwards?

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I don't know if it's as
specific as sort of saying you have

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:16.030
to walk four steps left here you
know, that I'm going to leave

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.520
to someone else to
stage it but it is

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.510 position:56%
about knowing what the actors are
doing you know, what are they trying

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:26.760
to do and so I think I
would say to an actor know

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.700
in your head what your
staging is going to be

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.300
so that you know how
the song sort of works

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.290
because this first A section
is going to be one thing

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.980
and the second A section
is going to be another

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.020
so is there something
physical you can do to explain

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.560
to yourself why you're changing
track, what all that is.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.760
There are times where I will
write a song where it is not clear

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:50.470
to me how the song is
supposed to work on stage.

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:52.700
I'll have just gone off
someplace and really been excited

00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.940
about a certain idea musically or
a certain idea lyrically and so

00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:00.110
for me, at that point I usually am
going to sit and say what do I want

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:03.900
to say to the director about
how this could be staged

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:05.200
so that they don't say to me well,

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.770
this doesn't make any
sense, let's just cut it.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:09.710
Because if I can defend
it then I can keep it.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.240
If I really love it then
what I want to be able to say

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.240
to the director is you don't
have to use this but it could be

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.520
that this section takes place,
here it is there's a section

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:22.470
of Shiksa Goddess even when it was
the song before Shiksa Goddess,

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:24.520
I Could be in Love With Someone
Like You but that section

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.070
of the song the state direction
always is maybe they're walking

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.710
in the park and that's
printed I think in the libretto

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.440 position:56%
because it doesn't matter to me what
they're doing but if that's the way

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.740
that gets you to this
chunk of the song great,

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:37.040
maybe they're walking
through the park here.

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.940
Maybe that's the thing that
they're doing but what you need

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.650
to know is this isn't the same
place as where they just were.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.710
Something different is
happening now and so you

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:45.490
as the director are
obliged to deal with that,

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.410
you as the actor are
obliged to deal with that

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.150
or the song is going
to feel sort of static.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.450
You're going to feel stuck there.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:54.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Do you remember when you wrote
The Schmuel Song, how you visualized

00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:56.680
in your head how it
would be performed?

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:59.230
&gt;&gt; Well Schmuel no, I think
Schmuel because it was

00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:01.570
so clearly performative
because Schmuel is clearly

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:05.370
about a guy showing off this
thing, I figured they'd figure it

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:07.900
out one way or the other
so that was really,

00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:10.640
I thought that was just going
to be a buffet, which it was,

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.430
just something for Daisy and
Norbert to feast all over it.

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:21.280
When we did the revival I added
the video elements into it just

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.310
because I didn't have, Daisy
kept Lauren or Sherry on stage

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:31.250
for that number so it gave Norbert
something to play to but because

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:37.470
in my version the other actor
wasn't on stage with Jeremy or Adam

00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:39.560
when we first did it,
I felt the need to sort

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.460
of give a little bit more
visual life to the way

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:46.640
that he was telling the
story but anything goes.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.840
&gt;&gt; When you see different
performers perform your numbers

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:53.910
in different productions, are you
surprised at the things they find

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.950
in it or how they physically
perform it?

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:57.760
Is that a-

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.480
&gt;&gt; Sometimes I mean
yeah, you know surprised,

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:04.660
I'm only usually surprised if
a really bad idea has shown up

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:07.630
and then I'm oh, oh, oh,
I didn't see that coming.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:11.230
But if it's a good idea I mean,
I guess I could be surprised

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:13.060
but generally I'm just
sort of in the work.

00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:17.080
If the actor is taking me along on
the journey then I just go with it

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:20.820
but I also don't watch a lot
of productions of my stuff.

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.490
I sort of got that out of
my system early and realized

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:26.870
that I wasn't generally going to be
happily surprised most of the time

00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:29.420
and so it's probably better
that I get back to writing.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.140
&gt;&gt; Do you enjoy working
with performers

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.440
in the original production?

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah, oh very much.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:38.780
I always feel like I don't assert
myself enough in those situations

00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:40.760
because I don't want to
step on the director.

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.050
You know, you hire a great
director you want to let

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:47.100
that person do their job and then
there will always be some point

00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.740
around the recording of the
cast album where I'll say

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.420
to the actor oh well, what this
has to be is this and they'll say

00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.860
to me why didn't you tell
me that three weeks ago?

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:55.370
I've been performing this
differently and I'm always like,

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:58.690
I guess I should get in there
a little bit more but yeah,

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:00.490
I do enjoy working with them.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:03.800
I don't, there's the
specifics of like,

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.910
figuring out what note
you're supposed to sing,

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:09.810
working with people who are not
musically literate is exhausting

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:13.470
for me so there are people who love
to do that and I'm not one of them

00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:15.570
so that's why I have
music directors.

00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:21.740
And you know, the joys
of working with musicians

00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.720
who really can just read the
material down that's like oh great,

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:26.750 position:56%
we get to go past the sort of basics

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:30.010
of no it's an A natural not an A
flat and so I love that but the

00:34:30.010 --> 00:34:33.690
on the other end of that, a lot of
those people frequently you need

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:36.330
to guide them through the acting
sort of bit, by bit, by bit,

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:40.920
by bit and they don't come up with
sort of these grand organic ways

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:44.790
of approaching text that you
know, more natural actors do

00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:47.180
so you know, it's always a balance.

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:51.300
I like working with them because
I think I know what I want the

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.600
material to be.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.190
&gt;&gt; You do so many performances
yourself where you bring

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.400
in a singer to perform with you.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.610
Do you sort of stage direct
those individual performances?

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:04.910
Do you-

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:06.870
&gt;&gt; I really don't, a lot of the
times when I'm doing those concerts

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:11.080 position:56%
and Shoshanna [phonetic] for example
who's performing with me tonight

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:14.320
or Eden Espinosa [phonetic] or
Megan or something like that,

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:18.840
usually we only have a couple of
hours that we get to work together

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:21.960
if that you know, so I'm trusting

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.880
that I'm hiring these
unbelievably gifted people to come

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:28.460
and interpret the material so
it's not where I want to go there

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.760
and say oh no, don't do this.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:35.300
If they are going way afield I
will pull them back into the-

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:37.480
&gt;&gt; You decide what numbers
they're going to sing

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.930
and what the order will be?

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that I generally
do and you know,

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:43.500
sometimes they will say I'm
dying to sing Still Hurting

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.670
and I will usually say
oh great that's fantastic

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:47.940
and then there have also
been times where I'm like,

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:51.160
that's not great either because
I think it's not great for them

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:54.710
or because it's not a number I want
to do at that particular moment

00:35:54.710 --> 00:36:02.280 position:56%
but the concert stuff is very
separate from the process of putting

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.660
on a production of a show.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:07.860 position:56%
I'm much more casual about the
concert things, I sort of feel like.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.480
&gt;&gt; Do you enjoy the concerts?

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:13.380 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Oh I love them yeah, I mean I
think that was always what I planned

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:20.060
on doing and then I ended up doing,
I ended up becoming a theater guy

00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:24.520
which I love and which is
great but the immediacy

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:29.510
of performance is I think the thing
that I get most excited about,

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:32.240
which is weird for a writer to
say but I think I'm a writer

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:35.900 position:56%
who most enjoys sort of interpreting
the work as it goes which isn't

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.420
to say I want to be a
performer every night of my life

00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:46.440
because I just don't much like
that but something like that.

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.910
You will hear probably
my stomach rumbling.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:53.830
That's what I get for not eating
breakfast before my interview.

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:55.710
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, sorry.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:37:02.500
When I read through your music,
I'm just constantly sort of in awe

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:11.460
of your vamps and accompaniments
and the inventiveness of them

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:15.450
and partly also the
frequency of them.

00:37:15.450 --> 00:37:19.320
Not every song from
other songwriters seem

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:24.110
to so frequently sort of
use those kinds of vamps.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:27.920
They tend to seem more
chordal to me and yours,

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.860
there's always something
interesting going on underneath

00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.160
and I don't know what you
can comment on about that.

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.910
&gt;&gt; I'm a groove guy
ultimately and so groove is sort

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:41.870
of how the songs are
built and groove you know,

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:44.680
I wouldn't use the same groove
for two different songs so even

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.210
if the tempos are pretty much
exactly the same and even

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:49.100
if the fields are pretty
much exactly the same,

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:52.900
something in that groove has to
change in order for me to write.

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.980
I really do write rhythmically
I think,

00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:02.430
even the melodies I write are
built on a rhythmic basis.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.930
There is an idea that a thing
goes for a certain period of time

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:09.820
and that the, I think it's why
I'm a lyricist is because I think

00:38:09.820 --> 00:38:16.740
of speech in a very rhythmic
way and so once there's groove,

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.750
sort of anything can happen over it
but until I find that groove I sort

00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:22.780
of don't know what the
song is supposed to be

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.030 position:56%
and I have written a couple of songs
where I just did have sort of chords

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:27.820
in advance and didn't
have a real groove

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:34.940
and those songs always feel kind
of uncomfortable fungible to me.

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:39.200 position:56%
Well, if it could be anything then
I guess it's just anything you know,

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.010
Stars in The Moon, when
Betty Buckley does it

00:38:42.010 --> 00:38:44.640 position:56%
with her band it's a whole different
groove that she has but Stars

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:49.370
in the Moon itself is specifically
that groove that I wrote into it

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:52.870 position:56%
and I wouldn't have known how to
write the song without that pattern.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:55.540
That is sort of what
drives the rest of it.

00:38:55.540 --> 00:39:01.840 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It may interest you, we have
several collections where it's clear

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.660
that the rhythm sort
of does come first.

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.560
In the Rodgers collection, he
has the typed lyric sheet for one

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:13.470
of the songs from Cinderella
and he puts in bar marks

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:17.630
and then writes the rhythms
and then finds the melody.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:21.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah because with Hammerstein,
he always wrote the lyrics first

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.430
and then put the melodies
afterwards so yeah,

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:27.170
you can see where that would
make exactly sense there

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:35.600 position:56%
and I think I do things like that
up here a lot all the time but yeah,

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:40.100
especially with popular based music
there is always a sense of meter,

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.930
that meter is kind of
what drives the thing.

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:45.340
I have occasionally tried to
figure out how I can write things

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:48.670
that are meter-less, what does
that mean and just what is it,

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:51.800
that would be an interesting
idea for me to try,

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.260
what is something that's
non-metered, entirely non-metered?

00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:00.730
I find it really kind of,
even when I hear it back even

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:03.150
when I've written this thing
that the audience is not supposed

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.200
to perceive any kind of meter
in, I still sort of feel like no,

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.870
I still hear it, I
still know exactly sort

00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:09.840
of where events are
supposed to happen

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.100
in a real metric sense of the word.

00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.750
&gt;&gt; It's funny, in Bridges
of Madison County,

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:19.740
I was sort of following the
recording with vocal selections

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:24.330
and all of a sudden I
realized I think seven or eight

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:28.140
of the songs were either in three
four or in some triple meter.

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.440
Was that intentional?

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.740
Was that more romantic?

00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.030
&gt;&gt; It wasn't no, I think that's
just how I played the guitar.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.160 position:56%
There was a certain strumming rhythm

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.410
that just sort of led
me to that thing.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:41.560
No, not just, I mean they're all
in twelve eight or some version

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.920
of twelve eight but I mean
essentially it's the same

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.220
metronome marking.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.110
It was really clear this
is how I play the guitar.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:48.430
&gt;&gt; Did that surprise
you or were you-

00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:50.150
&gt;&gt; It did, I really
thought I wasn't doing that.

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:51.620
I really thought oh
this is so clever,

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.060
I'm coming up with all
these different things

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:55.650
and then I just overheard
the music director saying

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:58.840 position:56%
to the guitarist one day oh no, it's
the exact same metronome marking,

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.780 position:56%
it's the same feel as the song
right before it and I was like what?

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:06.410
And he said no, no,
they're exactly the same.

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:08.380
But you know, and then when
I conducted the show I was

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:09.680
like no, he's absolutely right.

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.550
It was Look At Me goes
into World Inside a Frame

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:19.300 position:56%
and they are exactly da, da, da
just exactly right in the same place

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:21.480
but it works, it's
what I wanted to say.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:25.930
&gt;&gt; When you're sort of planning a
score, do you think of here's an

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:29.890
up tempo, it needs to be
followed by a ballad, here's-

00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:33.730
&gt;&gt; Well yeah, you know,
because you're

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:36.620
on that particular ride you can
feel when you're just sort of stuck

00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.420
at the traffic light for
too long and you can feel

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:41.700
when you've been going too fast
and you've got to pull it back.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:45.460
You know, the energy of
storytelling I think is a big part

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:46.930
of what composers do.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.590
I think if you're going
to write a musical,

00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:50.600
mostly what you're doing
is controlling the energy

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.880
of the storytelling,
controlling the pace of it and so

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.210
to me it's very important
to stay on top

00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:00.210
of are we going at the right speed?

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:04.010
Is the information being
given out at the right speed

00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:07.060
and is the energy sort of the right
energy that we need at this moment

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:08.820
or have we been up for too long?

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.030
Most musicals, you hit the second
act and it's just an endless pile

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:16.400
of ballads which drives me bananas
and so I try never to get caught

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:21.170
in that trap but there's a reason
why, because as all the sort of,

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:23.900 position:56%
as you're getting to the [inaudible]
all of the complications are sort

00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:26.750 position:56%
of coming and so everybody is
getting very reflective and very sad

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:30.340
and so that's why the second act
tends to be burdened by reprises

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:33.060
and ballads but I try to
keep that from happening.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:37.920
&gt;&gt; Do you find the audience tells
you things when you're out of town

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:41.900
or in previews, you get the
sense that how they are?

00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.870
&gt;&gt; They do but it's not so
much about that as it really is

00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:46.810
about me sitting in
the audience being able

00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:48.870 position:56%
to experience it through their eyes.

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:52.400
It's not like I have some psychic
ability to feel that an audience,

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.330
you can feel when they're
really with you and you can feel

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:57.550
when they're not but that
changes from day to day honestly.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.780
Even if a show works
perfectly there's some days

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.050
where the audience is really with
it and some days when they're not

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.880 position:56%
so I try not to go too much on like,

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.820
oh they didn't applaud too much
tonight because you can go crazy.

00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:16.380
But there is a sense of there is
a certain kind of state you have

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:20.460
to get into, a state of total
focus when you're watching a show

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:23.800
which is hard to do if you're the
writer because you can get trapped

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.410
by oh, I just heard the bassoon
play an E flat or you know,

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:30.420
why is that light going
or even just why is

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.850
that person unwrapping
a candy over here?

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:36.700
But that state of total focus of
I am the ideal audience member

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.310
for this piece right now, how am
I receiving it, how is it coming

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:46.320
at me, and so it takes a
lot and I think with all

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:51.180 position:56%
of our endless distractions these
days it's harder for me than it used

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:56.010
to be to get into that state of
total focus but when you're in it,

00:43:56.010 --> 00:44:00.090
that really is what tells
me the most about a show.

00:44:00.090 --> 00:44:02.470
There are always some little
niggling thing in the back

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:05.580
of your head that says boy, this
is going on a little too long

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:09.340
and you can have that feeling
for like, four performances

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.710
and never really articulate it.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:13.930
It just sort of comes
and then you know,

00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:16.100
the director will say something
like something's just not right

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:19.610
about the top and you'll find
yourself saying actually,

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:20.910
it's too long.

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:23.340
The number is too long,
let me cut this chunk of it

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:27.830
but it will have taken that many
times through it for that thought

00:44:27.830 --> 00:44:31.730
to make its way all the way from
the back of my brain into my mouth

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:33.620
and I find that happens a lot.

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:34.930
I find there are a lot of places

00:44:34.930 --> 00:44:39.760 position:56%
where the pacing just takes me a
couple of days to say you know what,

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:46.950
I resist cuts for a long time
not because I'm so precious

00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:49.170
about the work but
because I generally feel

00:44:49.170 --> 00:44:54.110
like if I've conceived it right,
it shouldn't be about cutting it.

00:44:54.110 --> 00:44:56.170
There's something that
I did right about this

00:44:56.170 --> 00:44:57.940
so let's not make the wrong choice.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.200
Cutting is easy, cutting
is an easy fix.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:06.620
Oh, we'll just take this out but
there is a fix that we can find.

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:09.440
Let's make sure it's the right one
and often it is about cutting it

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.320
but it may not be about
cutting what everyone things,

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:15.000
it's about cutting what happened
two minutes earlier it's that.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.960
So I try to stay very
present and alert for it.

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.220
It's hard, it's hard, it's a
hard thing to do but I find

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:23.920
that I can't do it unless there's
a whole audience around me.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:29.310
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about the
arranging and orchestrating.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:33.500 position:56%
Were you trained in that or was that
something from Eastman or you just-

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:37.550
&gt;&gt; When I was in high school and
we would do talent shows and things

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:39.900
like that, and if I wanted horn
sections because I always did

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:45.850
because I was a kid who wanted big
bands around me, I had to you know,

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:50.380
you can read about it in books but
mainly you're just doing it by ear.

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.630
Stuff like horn charts,
jazz band kind of things,

00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:57.130
you know I would play in jazz
bands and stuff like that

00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:03.180 position:56%
so I had a certain amount of fluency
with that already but so I did some

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.830 position:56%
of it in high school and knew enough
to sort of get through a chart.

00:46:05.830 --> 00:46:08.090
They weren't particularly good
charts but I could do that.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:09.390
I did study it at Eastman.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.110
I was only at Eastman for two
years but I studied orchestration

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:16.100
as you do as a composition major
so I studied that and I played

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.450
in the orchestras and I got all
of that but I would really say

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:23.740
that the most education I got was

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:26.570
from watching Sebesky
orchestrate Parade.

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:31.220
Those charts would come in and I
would see how he was taking my work

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.530
and orchestrating it,
that the trust that he had

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:36.700
in some things I would
do as a pianist

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:40.780
and then the way he would ignore
certain things I did as a pianist

00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:42.480
in terms of how he blew that up

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:47.710
so I think I really became a
vastly better orchestrator the day

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:50.470
that Sebesky started orchestrating
my work for me and some

00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:53.610
of that had started earlier because
Tunick had done Petrified Prince,

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:54.910
which I was musical director for.

00:46:54.910 --> 00:46:57.730
It was the Michael John LaChiusa
show and again, I had played it

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:00.390
and a lot of the piano arrangements
were my piano arrangements

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:03.570
and then watching Tunick sort of
take those on but we were working

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:05.760
with a very small orchestra
in that show.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:10.290
It was only I think seven pieces
and so there were some lessons

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:14.080
that Jonathan taught me there
that I didn't really put together

00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:18.560 position:56%
for 15 years when I finally was able
to say oh, I see now why he did it

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:20.830
that way, I see what
he was doing back them.

00:47:20.830 --> 00:47:26.720
But in terms of the immediate like,
I can tell you the immediate impact

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.650
that it had watching Sebesky's
charts come in for Parade.

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:34.360
&gt;&gt; I did an interview with Tunick
and I am naïve when it comes

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:37.230
to orchestration so although
I find it fascinating,

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.770
and one of the things
that he sort of expounded

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:45.310
on that sparked me was the
importance of part writing

00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:52.170
and as I understood him, he thinks
it's important as much as possible

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:55.370
that every instrument is playing a
piece of music, they're not filling

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:57.320
in a chord or something like that

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.580
because then they'll
play more musically and-

00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah and I think I got that.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:04.580
I think that I got intuitively
because I was a chorale singer

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.770
and I did a lot of
chorale arranging.

00:48:06.770 --> 00:48:09.050
Vocal arranging was the thing I did
most of when I was in high school

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:11.620
because we had a jazz
vocal group that I was part

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:14.540
of that I had one teacher who was
just, she was nuts for Lambert,

00:48:14.540 --> 00:48:16.800
Hendricks &amp; Ross and she was
nuts for the Manhattan Transfer,

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.950
and so we would try and do all
of that stuff so I spent a lot

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:23.230
of time doing vocal arranging
and so because of that,

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:26.050
I think I intuitively knew
what Tunick was saying

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:29.040
which was you don't want to
just tell the altos to just sort

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.320
of hit an A in the middle of this
and then be tacit for the rest.

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.660
You want to figure out how
to get them to it musically

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.810
and so I think I try and do that as
an orchestrator also but you know,

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:44.320
I have a, I don't posit myself as
the world's greatest orchestrator.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.890
I mean, I'm not a master
of it, I really do it

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.230
and I think I do it
well for my own stuff

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:53.610
and I have a very specific sound
as an orchestrator but I don't feel

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:59.320
like I really even now got an
entire handle on all of the tools

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.620
of an orchestrators trade.

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:03.130
I feel like I'm still sort of
masquerading as an orchestrator.

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:06.700 position:56%
You know, there are people who spend
their lives doing it and know a lot

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.210
about color and a lot about texture

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:12.390
that I am really feeling
my way in the dark for.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:14.850
&gt;&gt; When you're composing it
from the beginning do you ever

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:16.150
think instrumentally?

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:18.190
&gt;&gt; Oh always I mean, you know,

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:19.950
and sometimes instrumentally
means I'm thinking

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:23.270
about how the piano functions
in the piece but yeah no, no,

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:25.680
I've always got a pretty
clear sense but again,

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.400
because a lot of my stuff is kind
of rock based and groove based,

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:31.860
I'm mainly thinking about how
the rhythm section functions

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.590
and what the drums are
doing and what the,

00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:35.650
I've got that for any
song I've written.

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:38.900
I know what that is supposed
to be and then you know,

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:41.730
for things like Parade or
Bridges of Madison County

00:49:41.730 --> 00:49:45.800 position:56%
which have a wider palate of colors,
I've generally got that in my head

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:50.750
as I'm writing as well but then
until you get out the paper

00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:52.050
and start filling it out-

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:53.520
&gt;&gt; How different was
it doing Trumpet

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:57.040
of the Swan or something that's-

00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:58.340
&gt;&gt; Trumpet of the Swan you know,

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:04.420 position:56%
I had a very specific orchestral
template in mind and when Sam Davis,

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.670 position:56%
who did the orchestrations, I just
thought there was no way I was going

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:08.480
to have time to do them, but so

00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:11.210
when Sam did them I sent
him before he started,

00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:15.610
I said these are the three pieces
that you need to know about

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:18.900
and I think one of
them was Petrushka,

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:22.480
one of them was Randall
Thompson's Second Symphony,

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.730
which is maybe the most obscure
reference I could possibly throw

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.560
out but I always loved it.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:30.710 position:56%
Randall Thompson I knew as a chorale
writer which is the way most kids

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:33.450 position:56%
in high school know him because they
sing the Alleluia or whatever it was

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:35.890 position:56%
and so I remember going to
Finkelstein Library when I was a kid

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:38.130
and saying what else do you
have of Randall Thompson

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:40.990
and there was a recording Bernstein
did of this Second Symphony,

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:45.610
which was sort of as close as he
ever got to a hit symphonically

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:48.480
and so I just remember
hearing it in high school

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.110
and just thinking it was the
greatest piece in the world.

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:54.300
And so, I think it was Petrushka,
the Thompson Second Symphony,

00:50:54.300 --> 00:50:59.780
and Korngold's score for Robin Hood
and so I sent those three things

00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:02.710
to Sam and I said these are the
basic colors we're dealing with

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:06.520
and there are really specific
things in Trumpet of the Swan

00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.290
where clearly I'm just stealing
from one of those three pieces

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:12.850
and that's just sort
of what's on the table.

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:17.200
But you know, what I sent
to Sam was a short score,

00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:21.950
it was largely piano part with
probably one or two other stabs

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:25.150
of things and then he would send
me an orchestration which I would

00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:30.950
as often as not sort of completely
throw up in the air and re-do

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:34.210
but the gestures were pretty clear

00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:35.730
and you could see them
in my short score.

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:39.230
I'd write woodwinds play this
chord and this thing is supposed

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:43.270 position:56%
to be French horns playing it, it's
all pretty well delineated in there.

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:48.640
&gt;&gt; A friend of mine played bass
in Last Five Years in a production

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.980
and he said it was
the most satisfying-

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:55.310
&gt;&gt; For a bass player especially
yeah, I should hope so.

00:51:55.310 --> 00:51:58.460
You know, that was really again,

00:51:58.460 --> 00:52:02.240
each of the shows has a really
distinct sound by design.

00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:07.140
I want the shows to sort of
build a world within themselves

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:12.600
so that any show, you can't put any
of those songs into any other show.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:16.100
They sort of belong where they are
but more specifically than that,

00:52:16.100 --> 00:52:19.190
the instrumentation that
surrounds them is very specific

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:20.580
to how I'm writing them so I knew

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:23.270
with the Last Five Years not only
was it not going to have a drummer

00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:29.370
in it but I also knew that what I
wanted was specifically there's a

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:31.930
Joni Mitchell album, there's Hejira

00:52:31.930 --> 00:52:33.860
and there's Don Juan's
Reckless Daughter,

00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:37.350
both of which she explores the
idea of not using a drummer

00:52:37.350 --> 00:52:40.200
but letting the fretless
bass was Jaco Pastorius,

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:46.250
letting that be the kind of
melodic glue that holds it together

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.190
and the guitars are
really just hard rhythm,

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:51.110
there's almost no guitars
soloing at all.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:53.980
There's really hard rhythm
and then the melodic gestures

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:58.090
of the groove are all coming
from the bass and I happened to,

00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:00.450
on Songs For a New World,
I had met Randy Landau.

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:02.650
We had actually met on a
benefit about a year before that

00:53:02.650 --> 00:53:07.800
but Randy was my bass player
and he was a very fluid,

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.100
fretless bass player which
is not something that a lot

00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:12.280
of bass players have
under their arms

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.090
and he was a great improvising
player and clearly a sort

00:53:15.090 --> 00:53:18.790
of Jaco acolyte and so when I
was writing The Last Five Years,

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:23.900
I was writing it specifically
with Randy's musicianship in mind.

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:26.040 position:56%
I actually didn't think he was going
to be able to play it at first,

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:28.960
because he was on the road and so
I had someone else who was going

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.470
to be learning how to play it and
I was always a little like eh,

00:53:31.470 --> 00:53:33.980
but then Randy finally
said he was available.

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.540
&gt;&gt; Why was there no percussion?

00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:40.810
&gt;&gt; There was no drums and the
reason there's no drums is

00:53:40.810 --> 00:53:43.340
because I was afraid it
was going to turn the show

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.320
into a much less intimate
experience.

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:48.520
It would have turned the show
into a less intimate experience

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.530
because there's something
about when you have a song

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:52.720
like Moving Too Fast, what
you would want is the drums

00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.020
to really be hitting.

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:57.350 position:56%
You'd want a lot of volume coming
at you and what it was going to have

00:53:57.350 --> 00:54:00.240
to do to the sound design of the
show was everything was going

00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:03.100
to have to rise to meet
the level of the drums,

00:54:03.100 --> 00:54:04.570
the sort of minimum
level of the drums.

00:54:04.570 --> 00:54:07.160
Everything else was going to have
to come up far beyond the sort

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.860
of natural level and I wanted
it to feel like a chamber piece.

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:13.010
I mean, even in the literal sense
of the word I wanted everyone

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:14.900
to be able to be in the
same room at the same time

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:17.780
and just play the piece
and I didn't want to feel

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:19.670
like the minute the drummer
showed up we were all like oh,

00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:21.570
wait let me turn up my amp
and oh wait, I've got to put

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:24.080
on headphones or any of that stuff.

00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:25.970
And you know, it's
been able to be that.

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:29.130
It's enormously satisfying
to just sit down

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:31.430
and play The Last Five Years
acoustically with a bunch

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:33.810
of other musicians and just feel
like we can all be in the same room

00:54:33.810 --> 00:54:38.460
and make music at the same time
and not be fighting the drummer

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:40.940
and the drummer does a lot
also obviously in terms

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:46.540
of where the tempo is, and where
the groove is and I wanted to that

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:50.930 position:56%
to come from the section organically
so that was really the point.

00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:53.230
But with something like Thirteen,
I wanted to sound like a bunch

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:54.530
of kids playing in a garage band.

00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:57.700
I wanted it to sound sort of
noisy, and sloppy, and big and so

00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:01.370
of course there's got to be
guitars and drums and all of that.

00:55:01.370 --> 00:55:04.780
And Bridges of Madison County is
again, you don't want something

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:10.890
that is so insistent that it
pulls you out of the drama.

00:55:10.890 --> 00:55:13.790
You don't want anything that
comes with that kind of volume

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:16.390
or that kind of aggression to
it so there are drums in Bridges

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:19.410
of Madison County but they're
feathered in very subtly

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:25.110
and very cleanly and it's
mainly a chamber orchestration.

00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:27.970
And again, Honeymoon in Vegas, you
want it to sound like big bands.

00:55:27.970 --> 00:55:30.140
What is Las Vegas supposed
to sound like?

00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:33.370
I mean now I think Vegas sounds
like electronic dance music

00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:36.870 position:56%
but what it was supposed to sound
like in my head is Frankie and Sammy

00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:41.190 position:56%
and Dean, so you want drums, and
brass, and all of that and you know,

00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:44.400
the stuff that's in Honeymoon in
Vegas doesn't fit anywhere else

00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.820
in my cannon but it's very much me.

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:48.910
I think the people that know
me well think that Honeymoon

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:51.130
in Vegas is the most
me of all of my shows.

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:54.040
I live and breathe that stuff

00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:57.860
and Parade likewise has very
orchestral textures and is meant

00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:02.250
to sort of seem very operatic
and very big and grand.

00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:06.650
It is an interesting place to look
as the distinction between Parade

00:56:06.650 --> 00:56:09.190
and Bridges of Madison County,
both meant for large stages,

00:56:09.190 --> 00:56:13.570
both meant to be big pieces but
Parade has really grand gestures

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:15.860
and Bridges of Madison County
has very small gestures

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:20.480
and those are deliberate and the
instrumentation reflects that.

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.450
&gt;&gt; When you say a gesture-

00:56:23.450 --> 00:56:27.070
&gt;&gt; I think a gesture, you can
mean it theatrically and musically

00:56:27.070 --> 00:56:31.800 position:56%
and they both sort of mean the same
thing but a big gesture is something

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.100
that takes up a lot of room.

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:37.170
A big gesture can be very bold,
there's a real boldness to it.

00:56:37.170 --> 00:56:38.560
&gt;&gt; Musically or-

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah well, a musical
gesture in Parade

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:46.780
for example is having the first
chime of the show you know,

00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:49.830
you hear that snare
drum for eight measures

00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:51.820
and then you hear this
enormous chime

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:54.500
and 12 brass instruments all
playing at the same time.

00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:57.120
Clang, like that, that's a
big gesture, that's huge.

00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.190
There's nothing like that
in the entirety of Bridges

00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:03.070 position:56%
of Madison County because it's not
a show that wants gestures that big.

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:06.700
It's not just about volume
but that's why not just talk

00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:10.590
about volume as a way
to describe it?

00:57:10.590 --> 00:57:12.740
&gt;&gt; You reminded, in
The Last Five Years,

00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.760
this is perhaps a naïve question,

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:19.250
you've talked about
how the larger idea

00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:21.550
for it came to you rather suddenly.

00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:24.880
Was there a reason
dramatically why it had

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:30.990
to be her going backwards
and he going forward?

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:32.860
Could it have been reversed?

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:35.510
&gt;&gt; I don't know when
the chicken and the egg,

00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:39.570
whatever you say about
a chicken and egg.

00:57:39.570 --> 00:57:41.920
I don't know however
that played out.

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:45.830
Once I determined that,
whether it was arbitrary or not

00:57:45.830 --> 00:57:47.900
that she goes backwards
and he goes forwards,

00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:51.670
it is true that emotionally
she is always looking backwards

00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:53.780
and that emotionally he is
always looking forwards.

00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:57.480
There is a truth to the
fact that that makes sense.

00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:59.350
Had I decided that it should go

00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:02.980
in the other direction then
maybe I would have justified

00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:04.280
that in a different way.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.580
&gt;&gt; They would have been
different characters.

00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:06.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think maybe that's true

00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:09.270
and I think that's probably
why it just made sense to me

00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:10.570
that she would be going backwards.

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:13.490
You know, what I know is that
I needed her at the beginning

00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:16.150
of the piece to be looking
backwards on the relationship

00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:19.130
and I think she's always
just a little behind

00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:21.090
where he's always ahead,
ahead, ahead.

00:58:21.090 --> 00:58:23.980 position:56%
He's moving too fast and she's still
hurting you know, and so I think

00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:27.780
that there's, that is the best
explication I can give of it.

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:33.840
It was, I don't think I
planned it out that way

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.210 position:56%
but I can justify it after the fact.

00:58:36.210 --> 00:58:39.970
&gt;&gt; I think we're running long
but I wanted to sort of close

00:58:39.970 --> 00:58:41.990
with a couple of quotes that I sort

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:44.920
of found moving and
thought provoking.

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.040
&gt;&gt; We don't get to any of that?

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:49.340
&gt;&gt; I'm happy to do it.

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:51.430
I don't know how long
we're willing to stay here.

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:53.340
You can come back and we'll do it.

00:58:53.340 --> 00:59:00.870
This is from an article you
wrote for The Sondheim Review.

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:04.950
"We want the approval
of our peers yes,

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:08.090
but the generations coming
next, these children,

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:11.440
those are the people whose approval
we truly need if our lives are

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:14.970
to mean anything, if our art
is not to have been in vain."

00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:24.410
I don't know if you
remember even writing that.

00:59:24.410 --> 00:59:25.710
&gt;&gt; I mean-

00:59:25.710 --> 00:59:29.460
&gt;&gt; Do you have a larger sense
of yourself in the world

00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:31.760
of musical theater
in what you're doing

00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:34.830
in your life and how it's going?

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:40.630
&gt;&gt; I mean, I'll say really
specifically just part of what

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:44.270
that article is about was how
Steve had been sort of vastly upset

00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:48.470
about when I was 22 years old,
me not responding positively

00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:52.100
to something and I
didn't understand why

00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:55.590
at the time he wouldn't
want me to just be honest.

00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:57.160
Why don't you just
want me to tell you?

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:02.950
But what was missing in the
honesty of it was this real fear

01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:08.250
that I have begun to have at 46,
that the work will disappear.

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:10.880
You know, that I will have
spent my life doing this

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.190 position:56%
and that it won't be sitting here at
the Library of Congress with a lot

01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:16.260
of people talking about it, but
that it will just have disappeared

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:19.310 position:56%
and it will be some cute thing that
I did and that's how I spent my time

01:00:19.310 --> 01:00:22.210
on the earth which is oh, I wrote
some songs and then they're gone.

01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:26.500
And what is vastly
important to me in ways

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:31.300
that I guess it is just the ego,
but what is vastly important

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.390
to me is hearing that the
kids who come up under me,

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:38.420 position:56%
you know the people who are starting
doing it now, when Lin-Manuel

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.060
or when Pasek and Paul, Joe Iconis,

01:00:42.060 --> 01:00:45.540
when those people clearly
reference my work in their work

01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:49.430
and when they will say to me how
much it means to me if I approve

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:52.680
of their stuff, when it's clear
that they have taken my work

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:57.430
and incorporated it into theirs
and are the next generation,

01:00:57.430 --> 01:01:02.580
then I feel a little less
afraid of becoming irrelevant

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.700
but then I also have
a whole different fear

01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:09.300
that all I will be is sort of
subsumed by these other people

01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:12.370
who will be more successful at it.

01:01:12.370 --> 01:01:16.580
There's no way around the sort

01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:18.610
of perpetually fragile
ego of the artist.

01:01:18.610 --> 01:01:21.740
You know, it is, maybe
I'm even more sensitive

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.610 position:56%
than some other people are about it.

01:01:23.610 --> 01:01:30.730 position:56%
It's hard but part of the reason why
that story about Steve always was

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:35.490
so painful to me was not
just that I was in idiot

01:01:35.490 --> 01:01:38.940
to not be more sensitive to
him, but that I really feel

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:41.810
as I get older I know
exactly where his head was.

01:01:41.810 --> 01:01:49.490
I hope that I'm a little more
even but I can't guarantee that.

01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:54.720
It's tricky, it's tricky being a
writer in this particular business.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.110
It's a little weird.

01:01:56.110 --> 01:01:57.460
&gt;&gt; Before we started here,

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.680
we were talking a little
bit about your daughters.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:05.480 position:56%
Does the sense of posterity there,
does that play into how you feel now

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:11.970
in terms of the significance of
your life, for lack of a better-

01:02:11.970 --> 01:02:18.690 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah look, the thing about having
kids is they become more important

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:20.270
than any of the other things.

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.570
If you're doing it
for the right reason,

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:26.480
the kids become the whole
point and so now the writing,

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:29.480
I'm trying to sort of write stuff
that I care about and write stuff

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.700
that matters to me but largely
I've got to keep my family together

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.950
and it will be that way for another
10 or 15 years until they are both

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:38.500
out of college, and on
their way, and grown-ups

01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:42.260
but there will be a whole span
of time that a major chunk

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.780
of my brain was devoted to making
sure the bills got paid so that

01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.500
that the kids could eat [laughter].

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.650
That's where my head is these days.

01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:54.210 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You've talked about after
Parade, wanting to do a smaller show

01:02:54.210 --> 01:03:00.350
or the different projects
that you've worked on,

01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:04.140
there are different aspects working
with young kids doing Thirteen

01:03:04.140 --> 01:03:08.210
and all that but in terms of the
subjects of the shows, and like,

01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:12.990
the contents and what they're about
are there things that are important

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:15.760
to you to talk about
and that you don't want

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:19.850 position:56%
to do a project that's just this or-

01:03:19.850 --> 01:03:23.150
&gt;&gt; As I get older there are
certainly things that don't matter

01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:25.740
to me to write about
anymore and you know,

01:03:25.740 --> 01:03:31.280
there was specifically a period
when I had written Thirteen,

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:33.870
and then Honeymoon in Vegas,
and Bridges of Madison County,

01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:38.940
and all three of those were real
attempts to roll the ball straight

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.240
down the middle of the alley.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.870
You know, it was really I wanted
to write commercial projects,

01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:44.170
that was what I was doing

01:03:44.170 --> 01:03:47.460
and adapting movies is a very
specific sort of you know,

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:52.610 position:56%
I'm taking a property and there are
people who are sort of the executors

01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:56.920
of that property and they want
to extend the brand and I am part

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.850
of the extension of that brand
and I was in the middle of that,

01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:02.680
and that was a 10 year
period of my life or more

01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:05.530
and it brought me those
pieces which,

01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:08.570
I mean Thirteen was an original
idea but certainly with Bridge

01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:13.030
and with Honeymoon, I was very
proud of the work and very proud

01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:20.170
of those shows but the compromises
and the negotiations involved

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:25.430
in having to serve the brand of
a piece, to serve the history

01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:29.810
of a piece, of a property, the
sort of corporate nature of all

01:04:29.810 --> 01:04:34.150
that really grated on me after
a while and so I had signed

01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:38.030
on to write a musical based on
A League of Their Own directly

01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:42.480
after that, and I was working on
it and I finished the first act

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:46.120
and I got to the end of the first
act and I looked at the show,

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:49.120
and I looked at the path ahead
of the show and it was good.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:51.770
I thought I had done a pretty
good job and I just said,

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:54.010
I don't want to spend the next
four years of my life doing this

01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:56.430
and I wrote a check to the producer

01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:59.780 position:56%
and I said sorry this didn't work
out, I don't want to do this anymore

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:02.850
and I did, and I haven't
regretted it for a second

01:05:02.850 --> 01:05:07.240
because I really feel like I just
was out of the phase of my life

01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:10.550 position:56%
where I wanted to just bring other
people's ideas in that way and I had

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:13.320
so many things that
I wanted to write

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.410
and I think The Connector
is something I want to write

01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:18.820
and The Matewan Project which
is about a miner's strike

01:05:18.820 --> 01:05:23.040
in West Virginia, that's
something I very much want to do

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.870
and that Richard LaGravenese
and I are working

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:26.820
on a piece that's an
original idea of mine

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.730
and that those three things were
all things that I didn't want

01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:32.530
to keep saying I'll get to them,
I'll get to them, I'll get to them.

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:34.410
I really wanted to write them.

01:05:34.410 --> 01:05:38.780 position:56%
And so, finding a way to do that
was important and not getting caught

01:05:38.780 --> 01:05:42.400
up in the sort of vagaries

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.570
of entertainment for
entertainment sake.

01:05:44.570 --> 01:05:47.230 position:56%
Which again, Honeymoon in Vegas is
entertainment for entertainment sake

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:48.530
and I'm thrilled with it.

01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:49.980 position:56%
It's exactly what I wanted it to be.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.690
I also don't need to spend the
rest of my career doing more of it.

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:56.500
&gt;&gt; And things that you
do personally like Hope?

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:59.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well you know, a song like Hope
or a song like A Song About Your Gun

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:01.560
and things like that,
they just come out.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:04.840
I mean, I'm a writer, I
express myself that way

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.660
and even putting those songs

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:09.760
out in the world is a little
bit complicated for me

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.050
because I'm a little bit who am I
but I have learned that people want

01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:17.490
to hear them and that they matter
to people and so I do say them

01:06:17.490 --> 01:06:20.260
but I didn't sit down and write
Hope with the idea that I'm going

01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:22.540
to put this out on my website today

01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.960
and people are going
to go listen to it.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.260
I mean you can't buy it.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.230
It's not like I make
any money from it.

01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:31.070
I just had to say it and
people were comforted by it

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:34.660
or people were something by
it, people were moved by it

01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.020
and I feel like we'll write this.

01:06:36.020 --> 01:06:37.320
That's why you're a writer.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.760
You're a writer so you can put
your things out in the world

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:44.180
and they can affect people.

01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:50.410
&gt;&gt; The last quote from you, I think
again you were talking about Steve

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:53.770 position:56%
and you say, "I could have spent an
entire life worshipping at his alter

01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:56.160
and never understanding
that such great art

01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:59.470
as he creates can only be
born of deep vulnerability.

01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:00.770
I have allowed myself to feel

01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:05.560
and embrace my own
vulnerability ever since."

01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:11.900
&gt;&gt; Um, I think there's a
little bit of bullshit in that.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.800
I mean I think certainly the work
I was doing was vulnerable anyway

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.200
and I think that I got.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.170
I was doing vulnerable
work because of again,

01:07:20.170 --> 01:07:23.530
I grew up on Joni Mitchell,
that's a vulnerable songwriter.

01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:25.640
That's someone that's just
putting herself out there entirely

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:27.900
and certainly I knew that Steve
put himself out there entirely.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:31.080
There's something about being
willing to just say things

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.180
that hurt, that really
sort of feels like part

01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.580 position:56%
of what I want to be a writer to do.

01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:39.870
That feels very painful
and satisfying.

01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:42.510
I can say this is a thing that
hurts and put that out there

01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:48.040
so I think I understood the
vulnerability of it but it's the,

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:52.440
if there's a question about
what I learned about my writing

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.250
from that experience with Steve,
I'm not sure that that's true.

01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:57.430
I think that's why I wrote
that sentence but I'm not sure

01:07:57.430 --> 01:08:02.510
that I buy it but I
think that ultimately,

01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:08.090
what do I want to say about it?

01:08:08.090 --> 01:08:11.750
You look forward when you're
23 years old, you're 24,

01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:13.150
you're 30 years old,
you look forward

01:08:13.150 --> 01:08:18.150
to what your career is supposed
to be and you're going to do it,

01:08:18.150 --> 01:08:21.540
you're climbing up the
ladder and you look backwards

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:26.190
at I think Steve then would
have been late 60s, early 70s,

01:08:26.190 --> 01:08:29.510
you look backwards at what your
career was and you can either look

01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:32.270
at it as what it was or you can
look at it as what it wasn't

01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:38.070
and I think I was acknowledging to
myself that there will be a point

01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:40.800
where you look back and you can
either see only what it wasn't

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:42.720
or you have to look back
and see what it was.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.950
And I still battle
with those things.

01:08:44.950 --> 01:08:46.480
I think Steve still
battles with those things.

01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:50.120
I think that's part of the battle,
especially if you're doing work

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:54.090
that is not massively commercially
successful which that is,

01:08:54.090 --> 01:08:56.460
my work is not massively
commercially successful

01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.570
so I think I do a lot of looking
back and saying what it wasn't.

01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:04.360
But it is very important
as I am getting older

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:06.570
to make sure I keep looking
back and seeing what it was-

01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:09.070
&gt;&gt; But do you force
yourself to continue

01:09:09.070 --> 01:09:11.380
to be vulnerable in your work?

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:14.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah but again, that's inevitable
because the work is the work.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:16.100
The work has to be honest.

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:19.890
You have to be honest as a
writer and you can't get hard.

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:22.370
An interesting way, Joni Mitchell
is someone who got very hard

01:09:22.370 --> 01:09:25.040
as a writer that the last
two albums that she put

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.850
out were very not vulnerable.

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:29.160
They were very angry
records and you could sense

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.290
that that was I can't
keep opening myself

01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:34.170
up like this you know,
at 65, at 70 years old.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:37.550
I don't want to keep ripping
myself open but to me the work is

01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:38.850
to keep ripping myself open.

01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:42.290
I think that vulnerability is part
of what makes the work resonate

01:09:42.290 --> 01:09:44.690
and again, in some
ways I think the degree

01:09:44.690 --> 01:09:47.230
to which I rip myself open
is why the work is not

01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:49.930
as commercially massively
successful as I might want it

01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:53.560
to be but it is what's in me.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:57.230
&gt;&gt; I'm going to close
with thanking you

01:09:57.230 --> 01:09:59.610
but also sort of putting a plug in.

01:09:59.610 --> 01:10:03.500
You talked about the posterity
of the manuscripts there

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:07.190
so I hope you're saving
everything and-

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:12.430
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm saving an
alarming amount of work.

01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:15.190
There's a pile of faxes
from Hal about Parade

01:10:15.190 --> 01:10:16.780
that might not be readable
anymore but other

01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.110
than that I think everything
is in pretty good shape.

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:20.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

01:10:20.410 --> 01:10:22.190
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, thank you.

01:10:22.190 --> 01:10:25.830
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
