00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.860
We've learned a little
bit about gravity.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.120
We've learned a little bit
about electrostatic.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.280
So, time to learn about
a new fundamental

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.300
force of the universe.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.180
And this one is probably second
most familiar to us,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.890
next to gravity.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.140
And that's magnetism.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.240
Where does the word come from?

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.810
Well, I think several
civilizations-- I'm no

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.810
historian-- found these
lodestones, these objects that

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.260
would attract other objects
like it, other magnets.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.720
Or would even attract metallic
objects like iron.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.260
Ferrous objects.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.320
And they're called lodestones.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.150
That's, I guess, the Western
term for it.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.800
And the reason why they're
called magnets is because

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.590
they're named after lodestones
that were found near the Greek

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:51.840
province of Magnesia.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.330
And I actually think the people
who lived there were

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.160
called Magnetes.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.790
But anyway, you could Wikipedia
that and learn more

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.459
about it than I know.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.090
But anyway let's focus
on what magnetism is.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.010
And I think most of us have at
least a working knowledge of

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.490
what it is; we've all played
with magnets and we've dealt

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:16.470
with compasses.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.910
But I'll tell you this right
now, what it really is, is

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.250
pretty deep.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.740
And I think it's fairly-- I
don't think anyone has-- we

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.940
can mathematically understand
it and manipulate it and see

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.410
how it relates to electricity.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.890
We actually will show you the
electrostatic force and the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.480
magnetic force are actually the
same thing, just viewed

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.090
from different frames
of reference.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.420
I know that all of
that sounds very

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.560
complicated and all of that.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.370
But in our classical Newtonian
world we treat them as two

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.040
different forces.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.830
But what I'm saying is although
we're kind of used to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.480
a magnet just like we're used to
gravity, just like gravity

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.620
is also fairly mysterious when
you really think about what it

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.530
is, so is magnetism.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.290
So with that said, let's at
least try to get some working

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.550
knowledge of how we can
deal with magnetism.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.650
So we're all familiar
with a magnet.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.610
I didn't want it to be yellow.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.060
I could make the boundary
yellow.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.100
No, I didn't want it to
be like that either.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.360
So if this is a magnet,
we know that a magnet

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.120
always has two poles.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.330
It has a north pole
and a south pole.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.450
And these were just labeled
by convention.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.630
Because when people first
discovered these lodestones,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.300
or they took a lodestone and
they magnetized a needle with

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.190
that lodestone, and then that
needle they put on a cork in a

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.840
bucket of water, and that needle
would point to the

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.000
Earth's north pole.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.250
They said, oh, well the side of
the needle that is pointing

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.820
to the Earth's north, let's
call that the north pole.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.860
And the point of the needle
that's pointing to the south

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.300
pole-- sorry, the point of the
needle that's pointing to the

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.210
Earth's geographic
south, we'll call

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.230
that the south pole.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.050
Or another way to put it,
if we have a magnet, the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.790
direction of the magnet or the
side of the magnet that

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.980
orients itself-- if it's allowed
to orient freely

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.330
without friction-- towards our
geographic north, we call that

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.280
the north pole.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.820
And the other side is
the south pole.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:23.710
And this is actually a little
bit-- obviously we call the

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.930
top of the Earth
the north pole.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.600
You know, this is
the north pole.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.530
And we call this
the south pole.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.840
And there's another notion
of magnetic north.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.380
And that's where-- I guess, you
could kind of say-- that

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.270
is where a compass, the
north point of a

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:48.690
compass, will point to.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.730
And actually, magnetic north
moves around because we have

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.150
all of this moving fluid
inside of the earth.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.215
And a bunch of other
interactions.

00:03:55.215 --> 00:03:56.690
It's a very complex
interaction.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.130
But magnetic north is actually
roughly in northern Canada.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.240
So magnetic north
might be here.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.510
So that might be
magnetic north.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.420
And magnetic south, I don't know
exactly where that is.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.340
But it can kind of move
around a little bit.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.360
It's not in the same place.

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.860
So it's a little bit off the
axis of the geographic north

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.180
pole and the south pole.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.540
And this is another slightly
confusing thing.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.720
Magnetic north is the geographic
location, where the

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.970
north pole of a magnet
will point to.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.730
But that would actually be the
south pole, if you viewed the

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:32.980
Earth as a magnet.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.800
So if the Earth was a big
magnet, you would actually

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.820
view that as a south
pole of the magnet.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.780
And the geographic
south pole is the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.640
north pole of the magnet.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.390
You could read more about that
on Wikipedia, I know it's a

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.390
little bit confusing.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.520
But in general, when most
people refer to magnetic

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.920
north, or the north pole,
they're talking about the

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.930
geographic north area.

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.940
And the south pole is the
geographic south area.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.170
But the reason why I make this
distinction is because we know

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.520
when we deal with magnets,
just like electricity, or

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.590
electrostatics-- but I'll show
a key difference very

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.760
shortly-- is that opposite
poles attract.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.770
So if this side of my magnet is
attracted to Earth's north

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.730
pole then Earth's north pole--
or Earth's magnetic north--

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.690
actually must be the south
pole of that magnet.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.370
And vice versa.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.110
The south pole of my magnet here
is going to be attracted

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.090
to Earth's magnetic south.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.770
Which is actually the
north pole of the

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.660
magnet we call Earth.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.220
Anyway, I'll take Earth out of
the equation because it gets a

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.070
little bit confusing.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.650
And we'll just stick to bars
because that tends to be a

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.930
little bit more consistent.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.220
Let me erase this.

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.500
There you go.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.750
I'll erase my Magnesia.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.200
I wonder if the element
magnesium was first discovered

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.370
in Magnesia, as well.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.870
Probably.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.200
And I actually looked
up Milk of

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.920
Magnesia, which is a laxative.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.780
And it was not discovered
in Magnesia, but it has

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.780
magnesium in it.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.060
So I guess its roots could be
in Magnesia if magnesium was

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.410
discovered in Magnesia.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.530
Anyway, enough about Magnesia.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.870
Back to the magnets.

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.350
So if this is a magnet, and let
me draw another magnet.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:20.700
Actually, let me erase
all of this.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.935
All right.

00:06:24.935 --> 00:06:26.730
So let me draw two
more magnets.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.700
We know from experimentation
when we were all kids, this is

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.810
the north pole, this
is the south pole.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.210
That the north pole is going to
be attracted to the south

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.700
pole of another magnet.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.490
And that if I were to flip this
magnet around, it would

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:52.480
actually repel north-- two north
facing magnets would

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.330
repel each other.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.930
And so we have this notion,
just like we had in

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.120
electrostatics, that a magnet
generates a field.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.520
It generates these vectors
around it, that if you put

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.840
something in that field that can
be affected by it, it'll

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.630
be some net force
acting on it.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.850
So actually, before I go into
magnetic field, I actually

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:24.030
want to make one huge
distinction between magnetism

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.360
and electrostatics.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.140
Magnetism always comes in
the form of a dipole.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:30.910
What does a dipole mean?

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.700
It means that we
have two poles.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.520
A north and a south.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.430
In electrostatics, you
do have two charges.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.480
You have a positive charge
and a negative charge.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.630
So you do have two charges.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.530
But they could be
by themselves.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.230
You could just have a proton.

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:49.600
You don't have to have
an electron there

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.490
right next to it.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.620
You could just have a proton and
it would create a positive

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.140
electrostatic field.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.950
And our field lines are
what a positive point

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.000
charge would do.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.260
And it would be repelled.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:05.340
So you don't always have to have
a negative charge there.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:07.250
Similarly you could just
have an electron.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.690
And you don't have to
have a proton there.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.460
So you could have monopoles.

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:12.740
These are called monopoles, when
you just have one charge

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.770
when you're talking about
electrostatics.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.420
But with magnetism you
always have a dipole.

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.200
If I were to take this magnet,
this one right here, and if I

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:28.510
were to cut it in half, somehow
miraculously each of

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.150
those halves of that
magnet will turn

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.560
into two more magnets.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.260
Where this will be the south,
this'll be the north, this'll

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.679
be the south, this will
be the north.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:41.200
And actually, theoretically,
I've read-- my own abilities

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.110
don't go this far-- there could
be such a thing as a

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.200
magnetic monopole, although
it has not been

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.320
observed yet in nature.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.130
So everything we've seen in
nature has been a dipole.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.260
So you could just keep cutting
this up, all the way down to

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.000
if it's just one
electron left.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.230
And it actually turns out that
even one electron is still a

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:00.400
magnetic dipole.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.400
It still is generating, it still
has a north pole and a

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.310
south pole.

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:08.830
And actually it turns out, all
magnets, the magnetic field is

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.380
actually generated by the
electrons within it.

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.710
By the spin of electrons and
that-- you know, when we talk

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.970
about electron spin we
imagine some little

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:18.430
ball of charge spinning.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:20.910
But electrons are-- you
know, it's hard to--

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:21.900
they do have mass.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.590
But it starts to get
fuzzy whether they

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:24.720
are energy or mass.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.990
And then how does a ball
of energy spin?

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.510
Et cetera, et cetera.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.900
So it gets very almost
metaphysical.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.220
So I don't want to go
too far into it.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.710
And frankly, I don't think you
really can get an intuition.

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.080
It is almost-- it is a
realm that we don't

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.790
normally operate in.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:43.340
But even these large magnets
you deal with, the magnetic

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:47.120
field is generated by the
electron spins inside of it

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.040
and by the actual magnetic
fields generated by the

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:53.620
electron motion around
the protons.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.350
Well, I hope I'm not
overwhelming you.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:09:58.370
And you might say, well, how
come sometimes a metal bar can

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.700
be magnetized and sometimes
it won't be?

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.940
Well, when all of the electrons
are doing random

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.220
different things in a metal bar,
then it's not magnetized.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.590
Because the magnetic spins, or
the magnetism created by the

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:11.920
electrons are all canceling
each other out,

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.790
because it's random.

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.100
But if you align the spins of
the electrons, and if you

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.130
align their rotations, then you
will have a magnetically

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.060
charged bar.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.620
But anyway, I'm past the
ten-minute mark, but hopefully

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:26.140
that gives you a little bit
of a working knowledge of

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.190
what a magnet is.

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:31.170
And in the next video, I will
show what the effect is.

00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:34.490
Well, one, I'll explain how we
think about a magnetic field.

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:36.100
And then what the effect
of a magnetic

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:38.870
field is on an electron.

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:41.140
Or not an electron, on
a moving charge.

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:43.010
See you in the next video.
