00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.900
 look at the developed marine sonnet 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.490
 blocking the android team and today we are 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.250
 design byte let's talk a little bit 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.800
 responsive or responsible design and 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.529
 design is because this is very important 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.150
 to ours that has several types of screen 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.650
 for the platform screen sizes 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.769
 android it is important that your app 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.929
 be prepared to function for 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.239
 perform well on any type of screen 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.040
 no you do not want to lose the user 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.610
 because then the expectation began 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.710
 it was ugly or it was difficult to use, right? 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.180
 finally, it's very complicated you have to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.550
 preparing for this is good 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.829
 he is seeing there an example of a screen 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.170
 that has a small first problem 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.809
 excessive line length thing 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.370
 look there is a tablet of 7 of 10 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.100
 inches and I'm leaving a line 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.899
 taking all the width is this is a 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.690
 little that's necessary and then it's over 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.090
 creating a visual discomfort when the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.519
 user is looking at this application and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.710
 even when he turns to the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.270
 vertical or portrait mode ends 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.760
 happening and ground of content 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.200
 unbalanced where I have there 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.330
 content that is not taking advantage of 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.460
 correctly the space 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.590
 so you have no idea of 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.439
 uniformity in content do not stay here 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.170
 is something that pleases the view of the user of 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.060
 person using the good age 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.320
 The thing we have to think about is to use the 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.110
 available space 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.490
 but it's not just going out by putting a 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.259
 lots of stuff 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.360
 in the space available is 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.610
 simply quit filling you can 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.829
 even polluting the screen if you 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.159
 to think about doing this a 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.320
 tip then we start doing 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.990
 reorganizations on the application screen 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.850
 the first thing combination so I have there 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.159
 is to follow the most basic example 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.140
 those who already move the movement must 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.079
 since this is an example fragment 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.210
 it's ok, it's where I have two screens that 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.579
 I have one after another and it ends 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.640
 being unbalanced are content 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.409
 it's too much, one person can combine 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.479
 these two screens and this is the most 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.280
 classic already has a list that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.410
 or select the item or update a 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.720
 another panel on the right 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.430
 not only because it is a list it can 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.590
 for example a map on the side 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.630
 left has some landmarks 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.450
 I want to do a stretch of the way. 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.130
 only a list of items 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.080
 specifically in detail may be a 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.210
 interaction between these two screens in which 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.910
 Gotta keep coming back for an hymn to stay. 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.180
 altering this content also filled with 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.220
 macro reorganization where I have there in 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.590
 I show a certain combination a 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.640
 on top of each other and then when I go with 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.020
 a larger screen 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.610
 I do not have to go even space anymore 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.620
 vertical but I have more space 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.440
 horizontal I can also move to 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.090
 divide the screen better between two panels 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.340
 so why an organization that I am 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.560
 using the two two screens in a way 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.260
 higher for each and even then 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.610
 combining well is these two these two 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.620
 layouts nÃ© 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.680
 and also has an example here is the 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.270
 micro-redevelopment where I have one 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.030
 conduit in the minor layout 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.260
 I have little information, and when 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.790
 I'm back to the bigger team. 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.190
 I'll use a new way of 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.010
 to organize in the case of 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.959
 left, we have the type of 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.820
 layout for example is very cool you 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.980
 have some cards as information 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.870
 underneath gives a dynamic gets more beautiful 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.100
 the application is the images become more 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.810
 pleasant 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.630
 another tax than we have the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.970
 example on the side where I kept this 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.760
 same line so same content I 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.590
 centralized it emotive white space 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.780
 on the side you see nothing has said to 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.239
 fifa filling the space use the 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.310
 space not always fill is sometimes 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.470
 to balance I took this was 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.260
 I waved it off a little 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.670
 but I did not just have a screen with the 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.350
 available space of the year 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.350
 so you've reorganized it in a way 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.180
 but also did not 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.820
 all spaces 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.530
 ok good folks these were some tips 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.890
 how to make the application more 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.110
 responsive to different types of screen and 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.770
 species sizes have liked 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.770
 in the years to come
