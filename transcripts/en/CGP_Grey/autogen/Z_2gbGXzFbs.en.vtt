00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.230
 Pluto: Planet or not? Before we answer this question to us 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.910
 To know what the word planet means and this brings us back to the ancient Greeks who were called on 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.889
 Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn Moon and Sun Planet Name. If the body moves 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.960
 In the sky and shines, it is a planet. This is not a good meaning of the word 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.680
 First, because it does not include the Earth and secondly, this description combines quite different objects. 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.699
 But the Greeks could not understand the difference between the sun and Saturn, because 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.600
 The technology they relied upon to observe the universe was unfortunately limited. 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.430
 It took thousands of years for the Dutch to make the first telescope 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.530
 Astronomy became interesting. Astronomers can rearrange 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.179
 The solar system with complete confidence - a scientific breakthrough that no one can object to 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:44.969
 It - and re-classification of its components, exclude the sun and moon from the list of planets 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.729
 Hosts the planet. Now, what is going on around the sun, it is a planet. 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.010
 As time passed, the telescopes improved and each century came 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.799
 To discover a new planet. Which brought us to our solar system as we know it today: 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:59.440
 Nine planets revolve around one star. Looking at this model makes people wonder 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.979
 Why astronomers want to exclude Pluto? The problem is that such images are in textbooks 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:07.509
 liar. Well, not false but unrealistic. It gives us the illusion that the planets 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.920
 They are of equal size and distance to some extent, but in fact, it is very different. 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.270
 This, dear planet, our planet and this planet Jupiter is next to it in size 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.509
 Correct - looks bigger than I expected. If we take this fee and adjust it by 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.100
 The correct sizes for all the planets will look like this. Unless you see this offer 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.329
 Clearly and on a full screen, you may not even be able to see Pluto. 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.920
 If the difference in the planetary sizes is vast, Pluto is the youngest. But it is not only the smallest planet 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.249
 But smaller than seven satellites: Triton, Europe, Comarna, Ayo, Calisto 

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:39.670
 Titan, and Ganemide. Even if you will display the correct sizes 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.240
 The distance is still a problem. Think about it, if Jupiter is near this earth 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.979
 It will not appear as a point in the night sky but it will be much larger - if 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.450
 It has to be far, which is a challenge if we want to draw it in the right size. if you want 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.119
 To use white paper to represent the distance starting with Mercury and ending with Pluto, the buyer 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.579
 The giant may appear as large as dust mites on this paper, but Pluto, the size of bacteria. 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.560
 But excluding Pluto from the constellation of planets being far and small is not a sufficient reason 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.609
 And soon the fury of Pluto's defenders is aroused. In order for us to truly understand Pluto, 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:11.060
 We have to talk about a planet you've never heard of: Ceres. 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.120
 In 1801, astronomers discovered a new planet in the vast space between Mars and Jupiter 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.590
 - He was a small planet, but they loved him and called him Ceres. 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.530
 The following year, scientists discovered another small planet in the same area called Palas. 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.239
 A few years later, they discovered third planet Juno, then, fourthly, 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.030
 Vista. For several years, schoolchildren have studied eleven planets in the solar system. 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.299
 But astronomers have discovered more and more of these objects and become uncomfortable 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.450
 Launching the name of a planet on them because they were more like each other than they were like planets 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.760
 Other, a new category was added: asteroids in the asteroid belt - and the small planets were subjected 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.689
 To renaming, and for this reason you did not hear them. This was a correct decision 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.379
 Astronomers have discovered hundreds of thousands of asteroids that could have made a child difficult 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.269
 If they are all classified as planets. Back to Pluto. It was discovered in 1930 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.040
 It became the ninth planet. Preliminary estimates show the size of Pluto as the size of Neptune, but after many observations 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.329
 His size began to diminish. As Pluto dwindled, astronomers began 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.129
 Searching for other objects in the same area. 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:12.650
 Does it seem familiar? While school children kept the names of the planets 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.560
 Nine, some astronomers felt uncomfortable about adding Pluto to the planets because of its size 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.470
 They continued to fade, because they learned that Pluto was made up of ice, and they continued to 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:25.299
 Find lots and lots of glaciers at the edge of the Pluto-like solar system. 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.390
 This problem could have been ignored as long as no one found a glacier than Pluto 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.959
 What exactly happened in 2006 with the discovery of Iris. Again, the astronomers returned 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.709
 The arrangement of the solar system and the collection of these objects distant, in addition to Pluto, in 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.060
 A new area called the Kapper Belt. This is the story of Pluto - the lost planet 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.099
 Who returned to where he finally belonged - like Siris. But this story does not talk about 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.909
 Pluto only, but she talks about why the word 'planet' is inaccurate. 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.019
 The first four planets in the solar system are very different from the four planets that follow 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.739
 The classification of these eight under one group is a bit strange and that is why they are separated from and divided 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.180
 To the rocky planets and gaseous giants. And now we have telescopes 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.250
 Through which we can see planets revolving around other stars, and we have discovered rogue planets roaming the space 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.489
 And pygmy brown - the blurring of the difference between the planet and the star - word 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.549
 The planet becomes less clear. So, the more you know the universe 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.150
 The 'planets' species may continue to evolve, or may fall and disappear 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.920
 Completely. But, for now, the best way to classify 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.360
 The objects in our solar system are to one star, eight planets, four rocky, four 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.480
 Gas giants, the asteroid belt, and the distant Kiper belt, to which Pluto belongs.
