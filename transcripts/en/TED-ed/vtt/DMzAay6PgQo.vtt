I'm inspired by a lot of people that are go-getters,

00:00:07.293 --> 00:00:09.841
so people that kind of make things happen inspire me.

00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:10.687
They're everyday people,

00:00:10.687 --> 00:00:12.015
to be totally honest with you.

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:13.172
Ah, I'm inspired,

00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:17.020
one of my mentors is the owner of &lt;em&gt;Time Out&lt;/em&gt; magazine.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.508
And he inspires me because he did,

00:00:19.508 --> 00:00:21.997
he set it up himself when he was,

00:00:21.997 --> 00:00:24.163
ah, he got a grant from his grandmother

00:00:24.163 --> 00:00:25.759
of like 500 pounds,

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.177
and thirty years later

00:00:27.177 --> 00:00:30.876
he's still a well-known, global brand.

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:33.103
So, people like that inspire me,

00:00:33.103 --> 00:00:34.893
people that make things happen.
