00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.887
Let's see, this one works.

00:00:01.887 --> 00:00:05.103
Does five minus three
over two minus ten.

00:00:05.103 --> 00:00:06.023
What about this one?

00:00:06.023 --> 00:00:08.440
Well this one looks like it's
comparing x values first.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.210
That would be something like run
over rise, and that's not right.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.280
What about this one?

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.919
Three minus five over ten minus two,
that one looks good.

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:16.951
And what about this one?

00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:19.795
Three minus five over two minus ten,

00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:24.842
this one actually doesn't work
because if we call this X1 Y1 and

00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:29.460
this X2 and Y2,
this equation would be taking Y2- Y1.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.215
And so far,
there's nothing wrong with that.

00:00:32.215 --> 00:00:38.382
But it divides it by X1- X2,
we've switched the orders.

00:00:38.382 --> 00:00:41.278
If we're going to do two minus one,
we have to stick with two minus one,

00:00:41.278 --> 00:00:42.160
we can't flip them.
