00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.500
We have the absolute value of
2r minus 3 and 1/4 is less

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.990
than 2 and 1/2, and we
want to solve for r.

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.940
So right from the get go we
have to deal with this

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.850
absolute value.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.290
And just as a bit of a review,
if I were to say that the

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.220
absolute value of x is less
than, well let's just say,

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.500
less than 2 and 1/2, that means
that the distance from x

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.750
to 0 is less than 2 and 1/2.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:32.566
That means that x would have to
be less than 2 and 1/2, and

00:00:32.566 --> 00:00:36.850
x would have to be greater
than negative 2 and 1/2.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.620
And just think about
it for a second.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.250
If I were to draw it on a number
line right here, that

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.030
is 0, that is 2 and 1/2, and
that is negative 2 and 1/2.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.600
These two numbers are exactly 2
and 1/2 away from 0, because

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.470
both of their absolute
values is 2 and 1/2.

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.940
Now, if we want all of the
numbers whose absolute value

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.450
is less than 2 and 1/2, or that
are less than 2 and 1/2

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.420
away from 0, it would be all
of the numbers in between.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.380
And that's exactly what these
two statements are saying. x

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.410
has to be less than 2 and 1/2,
and it has to be greater than

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.080
negative 2 and 1/2.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.140
If this absolute value were
the other way, that the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.313
absolute value of x has to be
greater than 2 and 1/2, then

00:01:21.313 --> 00:01:23.200
it would be the numbers
outside of this, and

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.270
it would be an or.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.590
But we're dealing with the
less than situation right

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.820
there, so let's just do what
we were able to figure out

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.990
when it was just an x.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.930
The distance from this thing to
0 has to be less than 2 and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.990
1/2, so we can write that 2r
minus 3 and 1/4 has to be less

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:55.610
than 2 and 1/2 and 2r minus 3
and 1/4 has to be greater than

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.090
negative 2 and 1/2.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.540
Same exact reasoning here.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.460
Let me draw a line so we
don't get confused.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.050
Same exact reasoning here.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.940
This quantity right here
has to be between

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.180
negative 2 and 1/2.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.820
It has to be greater
than negative 2

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.470
and 1/2 right there.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.060
And it has to be less
than 2 and 1/2, so

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.320
that's all I wrote there.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.450
So let's solve each of
these independently.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.340
Well, this first went over here,
you've learned before

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.370
that I don't like improper
fractions, and I don't like

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.300
fractions in general.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.710
So let's make all of
these fractions.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.010
Sorry, I don't like
mixed numbers.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.490
I want them to be improper
fractions.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.780
So let's turn all of these
into improper fractions.

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.940
So if I were to rewrite it, we
get 2r minus 3 and 1/4 is the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.680
same thing as 3 times 4
is 12, plus 1 is 13.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:50.420
2r minus 13/4 is less than-- 2
times 2 is 4, plus 1 is five--

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.600
is less than 5/2.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.280
So that's the first equation.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.320
And then the second question--
and do the same thing here--

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.130
we have 2r minus 13 over
4 has to be a greater

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.870
than negative 5/2.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.040
All right, now let's solve each
of these independently.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.640
To get rid of the fractions, the
easiest thing to do is to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.080
multiply both sides of
this equation by 4.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.730
That'll eliminate all of the
fractions, so let's do that.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.800
Let's multiply-- let me scroll
to the left a little bit--

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.190
let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 4.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.760
And what do we get?

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.840
4 times 2r is 8r, 4 times
negative 13 over 4 is negative

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.010
13, is less than-- and I
multiplied by a positive

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.270
number so I didn't have to
worry about swapping the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:40.620
inequality-- is less than 5/2
times 4 is 10, right?

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.980
You get a 2 and a 1, it's 10.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.430
So you get 8r minus 13
is less than 10.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.090
Now we can add 13 to both sides
of this equation so that

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.710
we get rid of it on the
left-hand side.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.460
Add 13 to both sides and we
get 8r-- these guys cancel

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.010
out-- is less than 23,
and then we divide

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.290
both sides by 8.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.790
And once again, we didn't have
to worry about the inequality

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.380
because we're dividing
by a positive number.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.100
And we get r is less
than 23 over 8.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.160
Or, if you want to write that
as a mixed number, r is less

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.070
than-- what is that--
2 and 7/8.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.390
So that's one condition, but we
still have to worry about

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.230
this other condition.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.410
There was an and right here.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:31.820
Let's worry about it.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.120
So our other condition tells us
2r minus 13 over 4 has to

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.540
be greater than negative 5/2.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.600
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation by 4.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.790
So 4 times 2r is 8r.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.080
4 times negative 13 over 4 is
negative 13, is greater than

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.680
negative 5/2 times
4 is negative 10.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.013
Now we add 13 to both sides
of this equation.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.040
The left-hand side-- these guys
cancel out, you're just

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.400
left with 8r-- is greater than
negative 10 plus 13 is 3.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.750
Or divide both sides of this by
8, and you're left with r

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.450
has to be greater than 3/8.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.100
So our two conditions, r has to
be less than 2 and 7/8 and

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.380
greater than 3/8.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.420
Or we can just write it like
this: r is greater than 3/8,

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.980
so it's greater than-- maybe I
should say 3/8 is less than r,

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.860
which is less than 2 and 7/8.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.045
So if we were to plot the
solution on the number line--

00:05:39.045 --> 00:05:44.490
which I'm about to do, so that's
my number line-- this

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:51.990
is 0 right here, maybe
this is 1, 2, and 3.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.450
We have 2 and 7/8.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:55.980
We have to be less
than 2 and 7/8.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.000
Let's say that this is 2
and 7/8 right there.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.760
And we have to be greater
than 3/8.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.490
Say that is 3/8, so 3/8
will be some place

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.790
right around there.

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.415
And everything in between
is a valid solution.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.590
And we could try it out.

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:15.970
Let's try out something that,
based on what I just drew,

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.110
should be a valid solution.

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.990
1 should be a valid solution.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.830
Let's try it out here.

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:26.070
2 times 1 minus 3 and
1/4, what is that?

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:29.570
That's 2 minus 3 and 1/4.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.890
And so what is that?

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:36.690
2 minus 3 and 1/4 is-- well, 3
and 1/4 minus 2 is 1 and 1/4,

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.790
so this will be negative
1 and 1/4.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:42.580
But we're taking the absolute
value of it, so we take the

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.620
absolute value of it, which is
equal to 1 and 1/4, which is

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.890
indeed less than 2 and 1/2.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:50.200
Now let's try another number.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.020
Let's try 0.

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.590
Based on this, 0 should
not work.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.580
So what happens if
we put 0 here?

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.930
You get 2 times 0, which
is 0, minus 3 and 1/4.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.420
If you take the absolute value
of negative 3 and 1/4, you'll

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.580
get positive 3 and 1/4,
which won't work.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:08.250
3 and 1/4 is greater than
2 and 1/2, so that's

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.850
true, that works out.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.480
And same thing for 3.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:18.870
2 times 3 is 6, minus 3
and 1/4 is 2 and 3/4.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.020
Take the absolute value, it's 2
and 3/4, still bigger than 2

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.460
and 1/2, so it won't work.

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.770
So at least the points that we
tried out seem to validate

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.160
this solution that we got.
