&gt;&gt;Josh: Good evening everybody. Thank you
for coming to Google. This is the third in

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:27.529
our series of artist's lectures at DigitalArts@Google.
I recognize some of you of having had been

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.320
here before. Thank you for coming back. I'll
take that as an endorsement. DigitalArts@Google

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:36.920
is a new program trying to investigate how
we can use the tool, the tools of art and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.629
aesthetics to enhance people's understanding
of information. The art we selected for our

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:51.570
first exhibit was all balanced around the
sort of interface between data visualization

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.320
and databased art and the artists we have
this evening to, to speak to you epitomize

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:09.609
that balance; that there is data visualization
on one side and there is art art derived from

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:15.259
data on the other side and in-between there
is a magic space where you can create representations

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.390
of information that are both beautiful and
surprisingly informative in unexpected ways.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.979
And with that introduction, I'd like to introduce
Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas, who

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:25.979
are--

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.719
&gt;&gt;other person: Viegas, is that the way you
pronounce it?

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:34.390
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: Yes, yes.

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.740
&gt;&gt;Josh: who have for many years been, been
among the forefront of scientists in data

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:51.069
visualization and who are artists in this
area as well and who I have been delighted

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:54.540
to discover a couple of weeks ago, have joined
me as colleagues at Google.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.540
[Fernanda laughs]

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.679
Which means I get to work with them. And they're
here to talk to you about their work and their

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:59.679
ideas and I won't say anything more.

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:00.679
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: Great.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:01.679
&gt;&gt;Martin: Great.

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.200
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: Thanks, Josh. So, we thought we'd
give you a sense of a lot of different projects.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:14.540
We're gonna end up today, tonight talking
about the project that we have on the side,

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.030
Winterflow. But we thought we would regale
you with some of our other visualization projects.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.870
And to start with we're gonna ta-, we're gonna
show something that you're all probably very

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:38.390
familiar with and here, lemme just. Oh. There,
ok. So, it's a project based on Google Suggest;

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.120
it's called the Web seer. And lemme see if
I can find out where we put it. Yes. So, if

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:54.390
you go to Google these days and you start
typing something. So let's say: "art". You

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.560
can see what Google is doing is it's suggesting
to you a bunch of possible continuations to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:07.070
the term you have just typed, right? And so
this is called Google Suggest. And basically,

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:15.760
these are some of the most popular queries
that people have entered into Google based

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.960
on the, on the sent-, or on the word or phrase
that you just typed yourself. But it gets

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.810
more interesting when you realize that people
are not just looking for key words. They are

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:37.540
actually asking questions, right? So, you
get a sense of some of the most important

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.660
questions in people's lives these days. So,
what we decided to do is to actually go ahead

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.881
and visualize some of this information. So,
let me see--

00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:47.000
&gt;&gt;Martin: It's a pretty important question.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.980
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: Here. Ok.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:49.980
&gt;&gt;Josh: [ ].

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.930
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: So, let's say I type "Why doesn't
he," right? And basically, what I'm doing

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.120
there is I'm visualizing exactly the same
information that Google was showing me before,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.720
except that now, dealing with size and thicknesses
of arrows. So, the bigger the font the more

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.330
people are asking, the more popular that query
is. But then the other fun thing I can do

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.389
is compare that query against another one.
So, I'm gonna say, "Why doesn't he" versus

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.539
"why doesn't she."

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:22.979
[audience sigh]

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:28.699
And I can see what they share in common and
I can also get a sense of how the two genders

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:34.389
are different, right? "Why doesn't he call
me? Why doesn't he kiss me?" versus "Why doesn't

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:35.590
she leave?" Or--

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.590
&gt;&gt;Martin: Just--

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.590
[laughter]

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:38.590
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: Be quiet. "Why doesn't she just
leave?" Right?

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.180
&gt;&gt;Martin: Do I need the microphone or if I
talk like this am I?

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.180
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: I think they're being--

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.210
&gt;&gt;Martin: We're being recorded. All right.
I'll just do something like, ok. So, let's

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:57.590
look at the post dating phase and let's see.
Let's think about husbands and wives, say,

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.520
and "Why." What other phrase should we do?
"Why is--

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.969
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: Or, "is my."

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:08.409
&gt;&gt;Martin: Yeah. Let's do that, let's, let's
look at what people are asking about sort

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:15.479
of, "Is my husband" versus "Is my wife"--

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:16.479
[laughter]

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.050
and you sort of see the kind of interesting--

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.220
[laughter]

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.901
I dunno, end of the honeymoon, I guess you
might put it. It's, it's actually, the longer

00:05:24.901 --> 00:05:26.320
you look at it, the less funny it becomes.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320
[laughter]

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.379
But it also becomes a pretty interesting window
into what's going on in the world.

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:38.580
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: So, continuing on with the family
life theme, how about turning to kids? "Is

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.460
my son" versus "Is my daughter."

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.460
[laughter]

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:50.319
And you can get a sense of the difference,
different anxieties that parents have depending

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:53.919
on the gender of their kids.

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:00.930
&gt;&gt;Martin: I will say that we have shown this
at various, different places in the country.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.689
I don't know what Google is doing with this
cause I have no inside information on that,

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:09.300
but I will say that in different areas of
the country you get different results for

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.949
this. Here, it seems like New Yorkers are
worried about their daughters being overweight

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:19.490
and whether their sons are gifted. We did
a demo in the South where, "Is my son homosexual?"

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.169
was by far the largest worry.

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.150
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: And "Is my daughter pregnant?"--

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.150
&gt;&gt;Martin: Yeah.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.150
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: was the other--

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.150
&gt;&gt;Martin: I think there's--

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.150
[laughter]

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.439
there's definitely, I think there's something
going on. You can also ask sort of more meta

00:06:31.439 --> 00:06:43.069
questions. Let's take a look at, "How to be"
and we can see the things that people want

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:49.569
to be may be what you'd expect, "ninjaemo,"
I dunno. But then, just to get a little bit

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:56.150
philosophical, let's look at "How to pretend
to be" and interestingly the intersection

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:57.150
there is happiness.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:58.150
[chuckling]

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.340
&gt;&gt;Josh: Pretend to be pregnant.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.780
&gt;&gt;Martin: Makes you wonder.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:10.419
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: Right, yeah. Absolutely. So, because
no demo is complete without politics, we can

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:22.270
now ask, "Are democrats" versus "Are republicans."
And you get a sense of the confusion around--

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:28.949
&gt;&gt;Martin: But there are things that we could
look for points of dif-, disagreement or agreement.

00:07:28.949 --> 00:07:39.150
Here, we can say, "Democrats are" and "Republicans
are" and--

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.150
[laughter]

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.729
there's where their paths cross.

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:45.729
&gt;&gt;Josh: [ ]

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:47.509
&gt;&gt;Martin: Yeah.

00:07:47.509 --> 00:07:51.229
[Martin and Fernanda laugh]

00:07:51.229 --> 00:07:58.050
So, this, this is sort of an interesting thing.
I think you can start to see that by visualizing

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:03.020
what people are saying, you, you actually
get an interesting window into what's going

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:08.349
on and we wanna sort of step back for a moment
and say, "How did we get here?" And, actually,

00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:13.860
one of the first projects that Fernanda and
I worked on was a visualization of Wikipedia,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:22.259
which I'm sure I can get back for our slides
if I, let's see. Whoops, not that. Help, help

00:08:22.259 --> 00:08:23.300
Powerpoint. Where are you?

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.500
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: Is it doing [ ] thing?

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:35.070
&gt;&gt;Martin: There. There we go. All right. So,
our first project together was, was visualizing

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:41.430
Wikipedia. And this was back in 2003 when
Wikipedia was fresh and new. No one quite

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:47.600
knew how it worked and we decided we would
try to figure that out the best that we could.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:52.519
We looked at Wikipedia articles like this
one on chocolate--one of our favorite subjects--and

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:57.330
we realized anyone can edit it and when they
do they leave a trace. It's actually, it's

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:01.800
sort of a boon for data scientists, but Wikipedia
keeps track of everything that happens to

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:06.279
every page. And we realized, "Ok, this is
a lot of data to sort through. We need to

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:10.920
visualize it." And we came up with a method
we call "history flow" to show what's going

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.899
on. And the idea is if you've got multiple
versions of a Wikipedia page or, or really

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:19.860
any document, but we'll focus on Wikipedia,
you can visualize as follows. You can draw

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.820
every version as a vertical line, so that's
what you see here. And if they're multiple

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:30.790
authors, you can color parts of the line according
to who wrote what. So, here the lines length

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:36.310
tells you the length of the document and initially
Mary wrote the first part then Suzanne added

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:42.060
a little blue area at the end and, and so
forth. To make it easier to understand we

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.810
can connect the passages from one version
to the next that remain the same. So, here

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:51.630
we can see that it's very clear, for example,
between version 3 and version 4 that Suzanne

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:57.490
inserted a little bit of text. And we can
play other games as well where we can say,

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.860
"All right. Instead of giving every version
equal space, we'll space it according to time

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:05.440
between versions." That will give you a way
of really drilling down and showing the actual

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:12.209
texts behind each versions. The question is
what does that look like when you actually

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:13.209
apply that to real data?

00:10:13.209 --> 00:10:15.380
[pause]

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:32.430
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: Ok. So, so this is history flow
and what we're looking at right now is the

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:41.560
evolution of the article on design on Wikipedia.
And I have this little wand here that I can

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.149
bring back in time and you can see how the
texts of the article, oh.

00:10:44.149 --> 00:10:45.149
&gt;&gt;Martin: [ ] to speak to people.

00:10:45.149 --> 00:10:46.149
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: Can you hear me?

00:10:46.149 --> 00:10:47.149
&gt;&gt;Josh: Yes.

00:10:47.149 --> 00:10:51.319
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: Ok. Oh, this is better. I can
hear myself. So, if I move my little wand

00:10:51.319 --> 00:10:57.970
I can see how the text of the article here
changes. And I can just follow the evolution

00:10:57.970 --> 00:11:07.720
of the article this way. So, what I can do
is look at slightly more controversial topics,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:15.529
such as abortion. So, I can see that, for
instance, this is--let me bring my wand here--

00:11:15.529 --> 00:11:22.020
this is a really, really long article that
goes on forever, but the interesting thing

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:27.950
here is that I have these black gashes, right,
on the visualization. And what this means

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:34.070
is that, at some point, the entire article
was deleted, basically. Someone just vandalized

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:41.220
the page and just deleted the entire article,
ok? And then eventually it gets reverted to

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:48.149
what it is was back. Over here someone, on
top of deleting the whole thing, said, "Abortion

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:55.550
is great." And then, "Abortion is good." And
then it got reverted. And what we saw by looking

00:11:55.550 --> 00:12:00.120
at the visualization is when these things
were taking place. So, if I go back to the

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:06.709
first vandalism act here, I can see at the
very bottom this tells me when this happened,

00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:14.750
so it was on the 17th of December at 4:06.
It got fixed on the same day at 4:07. So,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:20.510
it took them a mon-, a minute to revert it
back. So, when we start, and, and, and we

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.379
started seeing this in many, many pages so
we, we got in touch with Wikipedians and we

00:12:23.379 --> 00:12:28.029
were like, "How are you doing this? How are
you fixing it so fast?" So, it turns out that

00:12:28.029 --> 00:12:33.980
Wikipedians have this thing called a "watch
list" and you can sign up to watch different

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:39.250
articles and then you get notified when people
make changes. And this is how they were making

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:46.480
the changes. They were reverting back the
vandalism. Now, let's look at our last example

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:52.040
here, which is one of our favorite, as Martin
said, our favorite pages, which is chocolate.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.269
So, you immediately you get an interesting
pattern, right? I saw this and I was like,

00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:58.709
"I need to have a scarf that looks like this
something."

00:12:58.709 --> 00:12:59.709
[Martin laughs]

00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:09.779
Any ideas, anyone, about what the zigzag?
About what the zigzag might be? It's a, it's

00:13:09.779 --> 00:13:15.560
a net at war, ok? Two parties are going back
and forth about whether something belongs

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:22.500
on this page or not. So, someone has put something
here and then it's being, it's kept being

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:28.120
taken out and I can show you what that is.
So, back here this person inserted this little

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:33.940
piece of wide text, which is this paragraph
here that says, "Extremely rarely, melted

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:39.259
chocolate has been used to make a kind of
surrealist sculpture called collage." And

00:13:39.259 --> 00:13:47.649
it survived for a while, right, until someone
said, "removing Boyer invention." That user

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:53.660
who had put it up was, his name is Daniel
Boyer. So, Daniel Boyer comes back and says,

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:58.850
"reverting chocolate collage is not a Boyer
invention." Person goes back, "Well, Google

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:04.810
search for chocolate collage finds only Boyer.
Reverting." "Leave your hum-bug out. Reverting."

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:13.290
And so forth. Until Daniel Boyer just gives
up and lets it go, which is unfortunate because

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:18.920
it turns out that chocolate collage does exist.
But basically, what this visualization did

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:25.810
is that it showed us so much data at once,
that we could very quickly get a sense of

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:32.290
what was sort of normal behavior on Wikipedia
and what was sort of a problem or was vandalism

00:14:32.290 --> 00:14:37.339
because it does look different. Because you
just get a sense of what is abnormal when

00:14:37.339 --> 00:14:40.339
you have so much data that you're looking
at.

00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:44.480
&gt;&gt;Martin: So, what else can you look at when
you have a lot of data at your disposal? It

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.620
turns out there's a bunch of ways at getting
at things that, that might surprise you. I

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:56.430
mean, the Wiki-, Wikipedia is very Internet-based,
but you might ask, "What about, what about

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:02.110
the body?" And so, Fernanda and I started
a project, the Fleshmap project, to look at

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:07.639
how the body is treated in various ways and
one of the first things we did is we were

00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:13.009
wondering how did people sing about the body?
How does it come up in song? And you can get

00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:18.000
data on this. You can find lyrics all over
the Internet and before we knew it we had

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.750
a little database of ten thousand songs and
their lyrics. They were divided into eleven

00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:31.370
genres and in a long session of brainstorming
we came up with 83 names for body parts. And

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:36.709
we thought, "Ok, we're gonna look genre by
genre and see how often each of these body

00:15:36.709 --> 00:15:41.050
parts is mentioned." And it's no trouble at
all. To make a little computer script that

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:46.480
does this and you can quickly compile lists
like this, for example. So, in folk songs

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:53.339
in our sample, the word "foot" was used in
1.09 percent of our songs. Ok, not super compelling.

00:15:53.339 --> 00:15:59.390
You can make a bar graph; it's not very compelling,
either. But what's interesting is that when

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:05.199
you start to graph it using imagery--and we
found a great place to get some sort of stock

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:11.889
photography that we could use for this-- suddenly
you start to see what's going on. So, here

00:16:11.889 --> 00:16:16.470
you're looking at a bubble chart so each body
part is sized; the area is proportional to

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:20.910
how often it comes up. So, you can see that
in folk music it's sort of eye and hand and

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:26.300
face music with a little bit of lips and some
knees and ears. And it makes you wonder, "What

00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:32.449
about other genres?" Well, let's take a look
at blues. It's also very simple, like a lot

00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:37.449
of eyes, face, but you see arms, you see knees,
maybe wonder why so many knees? I dunno. People

00:16:37.449 --> 00:16:43.420
could be down on their knees a lot in the
blues. What about other genres? What about

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:49.010
heavy metal, for example? Well, here you suddenly
see a greater diversity of body parts for

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.010
sure.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.010
[laughter]

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:55.740
But it's still largely eye and hand and face
and it turns out that that's basically the

00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.560
story across genres with one exception, which
is hip hop.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.560
[Martin laughs]

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.510
And there we can see some of the most prominent
body parts in a single glance and also just

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:10.770
again, the great diversity; the body the figure's
more, more prominently here. We can actually

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:15.730
line these up instead of doing these one at
a time and get a kind of matrix and just see

00:17:15.730 --> 00:17:21.079
sort of at a glance the eyes, the hands and
other parts that sort of are highly prominent.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:22.620
Yes, we have a question.

00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:27.309
&gt;&gt;audience member #1: Were you able to decide
if your [ ].

00:17:27.309 --> 00:17:33.781
&gt;&gt;Martin: No. We, we did not do disambiguation,
so in a way, I think, this seriously under

00:17:33.781 --> 00:17:39.940
counts certain words where there's slang that
is not, yeah. So. Yes. Yeah, we we do not

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.179
have a euphemism detector. That would be a
subject of future research though.

00:17:42.179 --> 00:17:43.179
[laughter]

00:17:43.179 --> 00:17:44.179
This, this is all, yes.

00:17:44.179 --> 00:17:45.179
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: You actually did like
a one to one [ ].

00:17:45.179 --> 00:17:46.830
&gt;&gt;Martin: Yeah.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:51.570
&gt;&gt;audience member #2: Ok.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.930
&gt;&gt;Martin: Exactly.

00:17:53.930 --> 00:18:00.870
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: So, this is part of a series that
we had, that we did trying to visualize aspects

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:06.070
of how we relate to the body. So, another
aspect that we were interested in is how do

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:12.059
people think about desire when it comes to
the body? And more specifically, touching.

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:15.700
And how could you, you might wonder, how could
you visualize something like that? It's so

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:21.620
subjective, how you're even gonna get that
data? So, basically, what we did is we decided

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:30.570
to map hundreds of points in, on the human
body, both female bodies and, and male, male

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:36.659
bodies. And this is what sort of the map looks
like. And then, to gather the data, we actually

00:18:36.659 --> 00:18:42.670
decided to turn to the Web and we used something
called The Mechanical Turk by Amazon, which

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:49.010
is a marketplace for very, very easy tasks
that people get paid to do. So, what we did

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:55.510
is we created an interface where people could
actually rate how much they wanted to touch

00:18:55.510 --> 00:19:02.250
or be touched on different parts of the body
and we pay them money to do this. And actually,

00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:09.490
within a couple of days we had hundreds of
people who had given us answers to that. So,

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:14.450
just to give you a sense of how much you get
paid, very, very simple tasks like "Are these

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:19.750
items different?"--these are some of the tasks
that get posted on Mechanical Turk. You might

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:27.080
get like a penny for that. If you are doing,
if you are identifying things on an image,

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:33.450
you, that's more expensive cause that takes
more cognitive power, so you get like five

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:41.110
cents and so forth. And so, basically, what
we did is we teamed up with Dolores Labs who

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:49.740
basically is a start-up that does all of the
sort of form creation to Mechanical Turk.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.659
&gt;&gt;Martin: I think they're called CrowdFlower
now.

00:19:51.659 --> 00:19:57.220
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: They changed. And this is what
our interface looked like. So, basically what

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:03.500
we would do is we would show you the person
and then we would highlight different parts

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:09.120
of the body of the person and you would tell
us, "Oh, that would be really great to touch."

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:15.480
Or, "That would, that would be a really great
place to be touched on." And then we got that

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:16.480
data in--

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:19.669
&gt;&gt;Martin: The scale was one apple to seven
apples.

00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:21.740
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: That's right.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:22.740
[laughter]

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:35.140
And so, oh, lemme go back and lemme show you
how that actually works. Ok. So, we decided

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:41.200
to visualize the data in a couple of ways.
So, this is a place where we do sort of heat

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:48.450
maps and this is all available on fleshmap.com.
You can go here and click on compare and these

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:58.580
are the results. Oh, actually, this is not
showing up. There, ok. That's better. Basically,

00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:06.370
what we're showing here is a heat map of the
frontal male and female and obviously, the

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:12.490
closer to yellow the color is the more intense,
the more desirable those parts were. And you

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:16.980
can see that, obviously, there are results
that are very obvious here, right? We were

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:22.260
expecting these results, but there were some
results that might not have been so obvious.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:28.330
So, for instance, if I start showing--this
is the back of the female and on the left

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:35.880
I have how much females desired to be touched
on these different parts of their bodies versus

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:41.691
on the right, how much their lovers wanted
to touch them. So you can see that you have

00:21:41.691 --> 00:21:47.850
area of difference there. The main area that's
different is the nape; the back of the neck,

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:53.040
right? And it turns out that women are much
more interested in being touched there than

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.460
their lovers seemed to realize. So, keep that
in mind.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.460
[laughter]

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:04.520
For some reason we were expecting a lot of
interest on the feet; not so much. And you

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:10.149
can start playing these games with all different
kinds of combinations. So, here's the map

00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:17.130
for the male back and again, you see that
there is quite some difference in terms of

00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:20.950
how the points of interest are distributed.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:25.980
&gt;&gt;Martin: We can also visualize this in a
sort of more photographic matter. This is,

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:36.169
is everything showing up here? Let's scroll
a little bit. [pause] Like that.

00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:40.669
So, we can say, "All right. Let's take a look
at this and to create a kind of cartogram,

00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:48.460
where we've piled the body and then we can
see which places are -- sort of recede into

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:53.770
the distance or increase, depending on how
much they wanna touch or be touched." We also

00:22:53.770 --> 00:23:00.141
can sort this out, so in fact, we can now
just rank order all the points of the body

00:23:00.141 --> 00:23:05.000
according to our survey of where this woman
wants to be touched or, or people want to

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.789
touch her and in fact, women were saying the
nape was actually number one in this particular

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:18.600
survey. You can do the same thing with the
front of the body with men as well as women.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:26.670
You can then collapse it back and put all
the pieces back together again. So, it becomes

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:34.090
a very interesting way to kind of get a sense
of both the body overall, but just the collective

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:37.440
view of the body. In some ways, I think one
of the most interesting things about this

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:43.429
was looking at blog comments where some people
were saying, "Oh. This is exactly what I've

00:23:43.429 --> 00:23:46.870
expected. There's nothing new." And other
people were like, "This can't be right. Look

00:23:46.870 --> 00:23:51.799
at the feet." And you felt like the blog commenters
themselves were telling us a lot about their

00:23:51.799 --> 00:23:54.669
own sensations that maybe they didn't realize.

00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:55.669
[laughter]

00:23:55.669 --> 00:24:01.210
It was very, very interesting. So, from this
we want to segue into our current piece, which

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:13.480
is a fascination not with the body, but, but
with color. And let's see once I get back

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:18.880
to the PowerPoint here and this, the sort
of first round of our, our interest in this

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:23.850
particular series of colors began when we
were contacted by Wired Magazine to do a piece

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:27.640
for their anniversary and we were trying to
think, "Well, ok. What characterizes Wired?"

00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.429
Well, among other things, the colors that
they use for the cover and we thought, "Is

00:24:31.429 --> 00:24:35.799
there a good way that we could extract the
key colors?" We came up with a relatively

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:40.769
simple algorithm that basically says, "All
right. We're going to take the color cube,

00:24:40.769 --> 00:24:46.360
divide it into little buckets and so we get
six by six by six little cubes, count the

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:52.390
number of pixels that fall within each bucket
and then look for buckets that are particularly

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.800
large that have a lot of pixels in them; ones
that stand out from their neighbors, there's

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.769
one called maxima and then average the values
within those buckets to kind of recover the

00:25:00.769 --> 00:25:04.559
original colors." So, scientifically, you
can think of this geeky image up here as a

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:10.059
way of describing what we do, but the results
are actually kind of neat. That we can take

00:25:10.059 --> 00:25:15.230
these covers and then get these sort of pure,
common colors that they use, arrange them

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:19.480
in concentric circles so that these covers
that you see would sort of be reduced to these

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:24.960
bulls eye patterns that characterize them.
And then you can sort of take an entire matrix

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:30.529
of colors, in this case they're arranged by
time. So from top to bottom are years--you

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:35.590
can see the first year it was just a bi-monthly
magazine. Left to right are months, so December

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:41.169
is at the left and, and January are, January
is at the left and December is at the right.

00:25:41.169 --> 00:25:42.169
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: And--

00:25:42.169 --> 00:25:43.169
&gt;&gt;Martin: Oh.

00:25:43.169 --> 00:25:46.610
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: I was just gonna say these are,
this is 15 years worth of Wired Magazine covers.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:53.190
&gt;&gt;Martin: And then when you can kind of reduce
them into this poster and you can start to

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:57.370
see sort of interesting patterns. I mean,
besides the fact that it's, it can be kind

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.380
of fun to look at these. They're almost like
little insects or something you're collecting.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:05.980
You can immediately see from this how aha
boy in January they like to start the year

00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:11.179
out with very clean, simple colors and they
get more complicated over time. You also get

00:26:11.179 --> 00:26:14.899
a sense that maybe the art director changed
and they started like, liking darker colors

00:26:14.899 --> 00:26:19.730
towards the end of their tenure. So, this
was sort of our first salvo in visualizing

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:20.730
color.

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:21.980
&gt;&gt;audience member #3: What [ ]?

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:27.180
&gt;&gt;Martin: That actually reflects a circulation
at the time so that this was another sort

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:31.299
of layer to the piece that they wanted.

00:26:31.299 --> 00:26:36.320
&gt;&gt;Fernanda: So, to continue on with our fascination
with color, we got very interested in this

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:42.840
notion of extracting the peaks of colors from
images. Now, one of the things that happens

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:49.110
here on the Wired Magazine covers is that
we are aggregating so much that we are reducing

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:55.039
an entire cover, an entire image to a single
circle, right? To a single series of concentric

00:26:55.039 --> 00:27:00.929
circles, which is interesting, but it's not
the only thing you could think of doing. So,

00:27:00.929 --> 00:27:06.500
the next piece we created is called "luscious."
And there, what we were interested in is to

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:16.299
work within the composition of a single image,
ok. To work with the composition of a single

00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:22.779
image and start abstracting away from the
content of the image and just looking at color.

00:27:22.779 --> 00:27:28.460
So, basically, this is what luscious looks
like. We were interested in ads from magazines

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:35.051
and it was very glossy, beautiful fashion
magazines. So, this is an example where we

00:27:35.051 --> 00:27:42.500
took an ad and created a luscious piece. And
one of the things that's interesting here

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:47.730
is that you start to realize how sophisticated
these color palettes are, right, from photographs.

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:55.760
And then you start to realize some tricks
that our eyes play on us. So, for instance,

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:59.710
when you look at the image on the left, you
might realize, "Ok, so this is a yellow pear

00:27:59.710 --> 00:28:04.990
on a brownish sort of dish." Right? One of
the things that might get lost is that the

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:11.570
highlights on this brown dish are very, very
blue. And you can immediately see that on

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:16.289
the luscious, on the circles, the way the
circles, sort of the blue circles pop out

00:28:16.289 --> 00:28:24.789
on the left there. You can also see how beautiful
the play is with darker and lighter shades

00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:31.549
of green at the very top. So, these are all
very, very careful choices that the photographer

00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:38.409
made and that, because we're looking at the
content, sometimes there, they get lost. So,

00:28:38.409 --> 00:28:45.220
we decided to start doing that; pointing the
luscious algorithm to a lot of different kinds

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:53.639
of ads. So, this, for instance, is a Valentino
piece. And it's interesting how you get--you

00:28:53.639 --> 00:29:00.620
definitely get--that splash of red that Valentino
is known for. It's also interesting how much

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:11.470
skin you see on the left versus how little
skin tone you see on the right. And then we

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:18.340
just keep running with it. So, this is an
Absolut Vodka ad, which tends to be very,

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:26.060
very heavy on the color. This is a Camel ad
and we actually like our version better than

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:34.750
the original. [pause] Very different color
palette, very light. Fendi, a double spread

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:43.669
ad by Fendi. And even Oil of Olay displaying
this really amazing palette of yellows.

00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:49.200
&gt;&gt;Martin: So, once you have sort of a machine
like this for extracting colors, you wanna

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:55.260
run with it and our final piece, which is
showing up there, is work where we took photos

00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:00.650
of Boston, of the Boston Common, over the
course of a year. So, we took thousands of

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:05.740
photos and extracted these colors taking the
time stamps into account so that we had the

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.899
characteristic colors for every month of the
year. We then arranged them on a circle. Let's

00:30:10.899 --> 00:30:18.520
actually see if I can get that. So here are
the colors and created a kind of graph of

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.680
the waxing and waning colors of Boston. In
fact, we can go to our interactive version

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:31.350
here. And you can see on this graph we go
from December and we have like the cold, cold

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:38.880
photos of the snow and the icy sky. And then
gradually, spring comes. You can see flowers

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:45.590
and the colors there. Then a bulge of green
in the spring and the summer. You get a little

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:49.860
bit of raininess in August and then by fall
again, you can start to see the leaves, the

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:55.019
fall foliage. So, as we go through this we
use creative common photos, so we have the

00:30:55.019 --> 00:30:59.039
credits here on the right, which creates a
nice element in and of themselves as I move.

00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:04.870
This, this sort of gives a view of Massachusetts
that certainly to those of us in Boston, kind

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:10.409
of rings true where we feel like the time
has been revealed. So, with that I think we'll

00:31:10.409 --> 00:31:17.559
finish up and thank you very much.

00:31:17.559 --> 00:31:19.029
[applause]

00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:28.200
&gt;&gt;Josh: Can you take a couple of questions?

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.250
&gt;&gt;man: They'll be here later. We, we can talk.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:35.460
&gt;&gt;Josh: Our second speaker this evening is
Brad Paley. Brad and I met at a visualization

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:41.470
conference a couple years ago?

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:46.090
&gt;&gt;Brad: Something like that.

00:31:46.090 --> 00:31:53.400
&gt;&gt;Josh: Yeah - when he was, he was proselytizing
one of his works; one of the four, four works

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:59.960
he has out in the exhibit. And I was looking
for interesting new things to think about

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:07.720
and we found--at least from my point of view--we
discovered that we, that, although Brad had

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:14.269
come into the world of data visualization
design background by now, that was my impression.

00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:18.440
&gt;&gt;Brad: Ok, good. Then I've reformed because
I came into it from a coding and fine arts

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.440
background.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:20.440
[Brad laughs]

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:27.740
&gt;&gt;Josh: I had come from a very, very scientific
background. We had come to a place where--

00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:28.740
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah, that's fine.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:29.740
&gt;&gt;Josh: where, we had very similar ideas about
how to design computer software interfaces,

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:30.740
but completely different arguments about why
those were the right answers, which made sitting

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:39.940
and having a conversation over a beer fascinating.
Since then, Brad, I guess, has roughly split

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:50.419
his time between designing highly usable computer
applications for, for a living and creating

00:32:50.419 --> 00:32:58.370
really cutting edge database art, data based
art works, which have been shown in most of

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:04.620
the major museums in New York and around the
country and the world. As I said, there are

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:09.840
four of Brad's pieces out in the, out in the
lobby, which I think give an interesting cross

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.210
section of his work and he will give us a
different cross section of his work.

00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:19.040
&gt;&gt;Brad: Thank you. I'm gonna start with the
four pieces out there because that's the things

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.210
you're familiar with. They're all medium old
TextArc, which should be coming up in a moment

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:29.039
here cause I double clicked it. These are
relatively large files. And--

00:33:29.039 --> 00:33:30.049
[laughter]

00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:40.880
Ah, yes. Switching computer, this is my new
lap-, tower replacement. I replaced some big

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.375
noisy energy sucker by the side of my desk.
By def it's way faster, so I suggest doing

00:33:43.375 --> 00:33:53.160
that if you have something more than two years
old. So, this you saw out front. I'm gonna

00:33:53.160 --> 00:34:00.679
show you an interactive version of it. I wanted
to show this first because in a very funny

00:34:00.679 --> 00:34:07.740
way this version out front is more interactive
than the live one. And I'll point that out,

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:11.320
mainly, the main reason I want to do that--I'm
used to using one, I'm used to seeing one

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.429
screen so if anybody wants to move over here,
I'm gonna point at this one cause it's the

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:21.270
brighter of the two screens. I should've counted
people, but, but I'm too much of a projector

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:27.940
geek to, to follow people. I wanna follow
the brightness. The main reason that I think

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:33.109
this is more interactive is one of the things
that TextArc was built. It was built as a

00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:39.110
tool for structuralist literary analysts;
people who can make some kind of hypothesis

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:45.720
or deduction, mostly hypothesis, from the
structure of a book, which then they can go

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.700
and read the book to find out if it's true,
but it's a different way of looking at a book.

00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:57.750
So, if you'll notice this dormouse, hatter,
duchess, and march hare, they're all in roughly

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:14.050
the same place. [pause] Hello, we need a hand.
[pause] They're all in roughly the same place

00:35:14.050 --> 00:35:19.700
in the TextArc--the lower left hand corner.
These have a very similar shape, this kind

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:25.260
of broken witch's broom. This has a similar
shape. This has a very different shape. I

00:35:25.260 --> 00:35:32.369
put those things in. I call them distribution
glyphs because they show where each word is

00:35:32.369 --> 00:35:37.660
distributed throughout the entire text. So,
I'm gonna take a step back and show you the

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:44.431
live version, but I wanted to point out that
the print has enough resolution that I can

00:35:44.431 --> 00:35:48.300
actually draw the distribution glyph for every
one of them. There's no way you can do that

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.980
on a screen. And if you think about human
visual acuity, one of the things that we're

00:35:51.980 --> 00:36:00.220
trying to play to is, is as visualization
geeks, you, you can make, you can take the

00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:06.550
entire contents of this 1024 by 768 screen
and your eye would be able to resolve all

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:10.290
of that on a piece of paper about his big.
You could take any of the slides that we're

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:15.680
showing on the screen and see all the detail
about 18 inches away and about this big, which

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.839
means that if you're truly trying to get across
a lot of information and changes of information

00:36:19.839 --> 00:36:25.829
aren't that big a deal, you're better off
not necessarily using, having such a paucity

00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:30.210
of information spread out over such a big
thing, put it onto this big and if you do

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:36.070
have space this much then you can have roughly
what would that be? Say, 50 times 50. Who

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:40.800
knows what 50 squared is? You can have a hundred
thousand, a couple hundred thousand times

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:46.440
as much information and instant access to
it. In the case, in this case, the high resolution

00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:52.060
allowed me to draw those and you can instantaneously
say, "Ah, these are of a family because they

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.500
seem to be mentioned in the same places."
And I'll show how a distribution glyph works

00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:01.119
in a minute, but it was tuned so that its
shape would allow you to group things that

00:37:01.119 --> 00:37:05.359
were used in similar, words that were used
in similar places on the book. And this one

00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:12.150
has a very different shape. So, if I'm thinking
about these three as kind of a one, as three-

00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:21.480
or four-headed character, I can see that instantaneously
scanning around, human brain is not very good

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:26.310
contrary to what we all feel at remembering
images. Very few of us have ediatic? Edietic?

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:30.730
How do you pronounce that word, have memory,
have that photographic memory or, or raise

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:37.960
your hand up? Mostly there was no evolutionary
pressure to develop a good visual memory because

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:42.060
the world was always there. And if you looked
away and looked back it was there again, so

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:47.569
there's no reason to for me to keep a whole
visual model of it there. So no selective

00:37:47.569 --> 00:37:53.650
pressure means why waste your amino acids
and, and sugar on it. And therefore, if you

00:37:53.650 --> 00:38:03.370
had to do something like this, an interactive
version, to see what things were--where is,

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:13.010
that's the code, part of the code to it—[pause]
other way. Now, the structure. Every line

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:17.940
of the book, "Alice in Wonderland", every
word of the book "Alice in Wonderland" scattered

00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:22.099
around in the middle. I'll tell you how in
a minute. It's thinking about what color to

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:31.089
make them. There, it redrew. So, I'll tell
you what the structure is of a TextArc and

00:38:31.089 --> 00:38:37.080
then I'll tell you about the analytic, the
visual analytic processes that people layered

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:42.570
on top of the structure afterwards, myself
and a few universities who are using it for

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:47.369
its intended purposes, and I wanna really
strongly distinguish in this early, ten year

00:38:47.369 --> 00:38:53.260
old work the difference between the structure
of the visualization, which is a geeky color

00:38:53.260 --> 00:39:00.370
in space trick, from the use of it in the
pursuit of humanities issues. And I wanna

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:04.770
suggest, I'm gonna show you some of my most
recent work just from a couple of years ago.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:09.560
Ironically, for the New York Stock Exchange,
which embodies some of my most humanist work.

00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:16.910
That's very ironic, right? But it's, it, it,
it, it, the, the, the structure and the task

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:22.460
and the meaning are much better integrated
in my more recent work. And so I wanna call

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:27.340
out the fact that the structure here is very
clearly a geeky mathematical trick. What did

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:31.291
I do? I took every line--like I said--and
drew it around on the outside and every word

00:39:31.291 --> 00:39:35.690
and drew it around on the outside 'cause I
wanted to get the entire book on one page.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:40.370
Second rule, there are only three rules here.
If you have to make up rules, it's good to

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:43.810
have few of them. Because if you have to force
somebody to learn your rules, to read your

00:39:43.810 --> 00:39:47.000
visualization, it's nice to be able to do
it in a couple of sentences like you guys

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.460
did as opposed to have to train them for 15
minutes before they can start to understand

00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:56.690
what the heck, how the heck you're organizing
the information. So, rule one: put all the

00:39:56.690 --> 00:40:02.589
information up and put it in an arc. Rule
two: if a word's used a lot make it bigger;

00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:08.860
maybe it's important. It should draw your
eye. And rule three: scatters them around,

00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:17.240
it's kind of a spatial hashing function for
those-- who codes here? Ok [ ]. It's a useful

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.450
jargon and if, if most of you put your hands
up then, then, then, then I could get into

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:25.050
all kinds of questionable mappings between
how the brain works and how, how computers

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:27.619
work, but you've saved me from all that. You
don't have to.

00:40:27.619 --> 00:40:28.619
[laughter]

00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:30.960
It's pretty much bogus analogies across the
line anyway, but still.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:31.960
[laughter]

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:35.560
We don't, we don't have cycles you don't have
bandwidth in your head. You use sugar, which

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:39.550
is related, but sugar takes longer to get
to places than, than bandwidth does to reallocate

00:40:39.550 --> 00:40:42.250
itself. So, be careful with those analogies.
All right. "Alice" is used everywhere. Notice

00:40:42.250 --> 00:40:51.510
by the way, because this is on a screen I
couldn't draw the distribution, distribution

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:54.270
glyphs. I just--oh, the pixels aren't small
enough. It would have been a terrible mess.

00:40:54.270 --> 00:41:00.430
Not that it isn't now, but it's a little bit
of a structured mess. "Rabbit" is here. "Mouse"

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:05.700
is over here. Why is mouse over there? Well,
the rubber bands pulled it over there. "Rabbit"

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:11.119
is kind of here because the rubber bands pulled
it to the centrite, or tut embedding if you're

00:41:11.119 --> 00:41:17.160
a mathematician or a force directed placement
with uniform leaning. How about that? Rubber

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:21.650
bands are better not just because I'm trying
to play down to you. I never play down to

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.369
an audience. I've always noticed that I've
never had to dumb anything down even for people

00:41:25.369 --> 00:41:26.370
on Wall Street.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:27.370
[laughter]

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:31.990
I've noticed that you can put, you can put,
here's an irony. You can put four, five, seven

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:37.470
times as much information on a page as people
think they can absorb. So, in other words,

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:42.260
when they cry, "Information overload!" and
say, "Back off," I usually go in and say,

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:47.020
"No, no, no, get me, let me triple that. Lemme
quadruple the information." And the more information--if

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:51.140
it's properly presented--actually makes it
easier to read, more comfortable to read and

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:55.900
that's something that is not work inherent.
I was working against how human beings evolved

00:41:55.900 --> 00:42:00.480
and how our eyes and cognitive, cognitive
processes work here, but I'm working with

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:06.619
those processes in a later work. So, I'm gonna
talk just for two more minutes here because

00:42:06.619 --> 00:42:12.839
I wanna show, I've shown you the three rules
of the structure--this averaging trick--which

00:42:12.839 --> 00:42:17.599
scatters the words around, show all the words
in an arc and make something bigger. Here's

00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:26.329
an example of a visual analytical technique
layered on top of that structure. You remember

00:42:26.329 --> 00:42:30.730
"Duchess" was used in very different places
from "dormouse." Now here. Imagine you had

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:35.130
scan over every one of these words, right?
And remember the shapes and try to compare

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:40.740
those shapes in your head to see whether "hatter"
and "dormouse" and "march hare" were all mentioned

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:44.680
in the same place. This is just, it's a non-,
it's an impossible task. It's just not possible

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:50.670
no matter how good a memory you have. I would
suggest, so, depending on the nature of the

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:55.940
data, strangely enough, prints are better.
Hatter, dormouse and march hare all appear

00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:02.740
here and here. They appear nowhere else. I'm
coining the term "ensemble character" because

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:05.990
as far as Lewis Carroll is concerned and as
far as the dramatic development of the book

00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:10.059
is concerned, they aren't separate characters.
They're really, they're less than one-dimensional.

00:43:10.059 --> 00:43:14.240
They're one-third dimensional because all
together they're just one-dimensional. So,

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.930
so they're really, they're really kind of
trivial characters, but they play well off

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:25.930
of each other. And the fact that they play,
that fact is elicited by in this representation

00:43:25.930 --> 00:43:33.559
just by the, the shapes here. Again, "dormouse"
is something else. I used to say that "King"

00:43:33.559 --> 00:43:40.809
and "Queen" were another ensemble character,
but somebody in a lecture once said, "No,

00:43:40.809 --> 00:43:46.950
Brad, by your own rules they are mostly appearing
together." But they're not. Why is "Queen"

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:53.210
appearing out here? That's what foreshadowing
looks like to Lewis Carroll. Lewis Carroll

00:43:53.210 --> 00:44:00.369
knew that the Queen was gonna be such an important
character here and, and less vociferous, but

00:44:00.369 --> 00:44:08.450
no less important in the ultimate chapter.
He wanted to make her really, really have

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:15.020
a lot of impact when she first came on the
stage. So, in one of the few cases when I

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:19.890
was actually lecturing and thinking at the
same time, that person, what I did was say,

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:27.079
"Oh-oh. Let's, let's take a look at the text
and see what you, what those early references

00:44:27.079 --> 00:44:32.240
are like." Here they are by the way. Just
like, they're pointing to places here. If

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:36.350
you've got a scroll bar, a scroll bar is a
map of your data, and if you've gotta highlight

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:40.470
you might as well play it out in the scroll
bar so you know where to get to them. So what

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:46.680
we wanna do is--and I also rigged the scroll
bar so that when I click it it just takes

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:52.160
me to each of these references--so, these
are the, him saying, "An invitation from the

00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:58.109
Queen. From the Queen an invitation for the
Duchess." Invitation and Queen. First of all,

00:44:58.109 --> 00:45:02.160
the Queen hasn't appeared. She's just being
referred to and she's, she's gonna come in

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:07.250
the future. Secondly, Lewis Carroll said it
and said it again. Good way to get something

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:13.270
into memory. Third, he's playing to what we
understand as human animals, more animals

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:20.580
than human. By the way, your eye evolved over
half a billion years since the Cambrian explosion.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:26.559
There was an argument that, a very good argument,
that it was the eyes that drove these species

00:45:26.559 --> 00:45:30.270
explosion around 500 billion years ago when
we only had 5 kinds of fuzzy worms underwater

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:34.809
and then within 30 million year we had almost
as much--maybe more--diversity as we have

00:45:34.809 --> 00:45:41.860
right now in terms of forms. Eyes drove that
and are 500 million years old. To give you

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:46.960
some context, your forebrain, the symbolic
way that you read information, right, is only

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.250
four and a half million years old. I suppose
I can't even stretch that far if I make this

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:54.369
four and a half billion years old, right?
Million. So, -- it. Half a billion years old,

00:45:54.369 --> 00:45:58.740
four and a half million years old for your
forebrain. Human beings have only existed

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:03.080
for a hundred thousand years, which is pretty
neat when you realize that civilization is

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:07.020
two or three thousand years old. Two or three
percent of the time that we've existed in

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:14.270
this form, but we had civilization in China
that long ago. And languages are able to,

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:20.250
symbolic; use of symbols is like 40 thousand
years old. So, it's, it's an absurd waste

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:26.920
of human processing. We are mostly animals.
To try to feed information to us symbolically

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:32.099
with words except -- when you can rely, and
you can't with all kinds of information, but

00:46:32.099 --> 00:46:39.010
when you can rely on the, on the earlier parts
of your brain, visual processing and cognitive

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:43.609
recognition and categorization and things
like that you can get amazing speed ups and

00:46:43.609 --> 00:46:47.960
benefits, which is exactly what, what we try
to do, right? We just try to push things earlier

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:53.400
and earlier into a visual pipeline. So, the
reason I brought it up in this context -- another

00:46:53.400 --> 00:47:00.780
thing that human beings do very well is understand
social relationships, like alpha female. And

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:05.599
Queen is an alpha female, so Lewis Carroll
picked that person. He didn't say "mock turtle,"

00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:10.210
he said, "Queen" because he wanted you to
remember arguably, this is, this is, I haven't

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:14.150
had a chance to talk to him about this. Hope
I never do.

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:15.150
[laughter]

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:21.140
But it's, so, so and then finally "game" if
you've read Lichtenstein, "game" is structured.

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:26.690
He uses that term a lot in his examples cause
it's a really hard thing to nail down, but

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:33.010
it's basically structured human interaction
and as animals, we're incredibly good at understanding

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:37.890
other animals and, and social, how we come
together and apart and things like that. So,

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:42.770
he did that and he basically did that for
all of those references. Here's another one,

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:48.020
another one and then finally, so he went one,
two--

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:49.020
[snaps fingers]

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:53.480
just when you're about to forget, three. Just
when you're about to forget, four.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.480
[snaps fingers]

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.480
Just when you're about to forget, five, six.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.480
[snaps fingers]

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:01.880
And then she comes on, on the screen. Musical
structure. Beautiful, amazing word. This is

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:06.900
why I, and I'm sure you, do visualization
because we get to look at the geniuses of

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:13.110
the ages and really understand them on a different
level. Or the genius in the world as a whole

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:17.059
as opposed to individual people like which
is what you were just showing. So, that's

00:48:17.059 --> 00:48:25.290
an analytical tool that was, that was discovered
after the fact because before the fact all

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:29.410
I was doing was trying to spread the words
out hoping that as, that my colleagues and

00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:36.260
I could figure out ways to use this spread
out stuff. So, that's ten year ago. We'll

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:48.980
jump to code profiles; another piece out there,
which is about nine years old. Why are you

00:48:48.980 --> 00:49:00.829
not zooming? Oh please. Oh, it's still, it's
a very big file and it's still reading in.

00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:08.329
So, I'll tell you how, where it came from.
Christiane Paul, a curator of digital artwork,

00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:15.740
saw me talk about TextArc and invited us independently
to participate in something that you put at,

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:23.780
on the Whitney's online site. She is a good
post-modernist on, I'm not sure if she would

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:25.590
like to be called a post-modern curator but
she understood those issues. She wanted to

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:30.099
review, she wanted to show off computer art,
but she wanted to show off how it was made.

00:49:30.099 --> 00:49:33.770
We all know where a painting comes from cause
we did painting in, finger-painting or whatever,

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:39.730
in kindergarten at least. But she wanted,
she said to us, she picked ten computer artists,

00:49:39.730 --> 00:49:45.991
"Show me, make some work for me, but also
show me the code. I want to show the world

00:49:45.991 --> 00:49:51.160
the code so that people know what's underneath
computer art, not just the pretty face of

00:49:51.160 --> 00:50:00.099
it." So, I was kind of at a loss because I
like, I like to deal with tens of thousands

00:50:00.099 --> 00:50:07.200
or hundreds of thousands or millions of points
and her, her aesthetic agenda to us was, "Oh

00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.589
move three points in space. You're an artist;
you know what to do with that." And, in fact,

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:15.240
I didn't. And this is maybe why I never, I
don't really self-identify as an artist because

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:19.549
three points, I could never, I can't say anything
with three points. It barely makes a triangle.

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:23.850
You did great work with triangle by layering
other observations on top of it, Martin. But

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:28.010
so, so later I finally, I realized fortunately
she asked four months in advance and like

00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:32.940
three weeks before the deadline I said, "So,
any space I want, right? Is code space? Yes,

00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:38.859
code can be space. Ok, so I'm gonna write
a bunch of code and now I can move three points

00:50:38.859 --> 00:50:43.000
through space because I have a whole bunch
of code. What points? Well, I'm gonna move

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.710
an approximation of your fixation point, so
how you would read it?" Following her curatorial

00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:59.950
agenda of, of expecting people to read the
code. So, by the way, this, the aesthetic

00:50:59.950 --> 00:51:05.790
breakthrough, the break from my writers block,
as it were, or drawer's block was when I gave

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:09.640
up trying to be an artist and I said, "Well,
what's her agenda? What's she trying to do?

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:13.339
Lemme just interpret that onto the page."
And then it all became really simple. So,

00:51:13.339 --> 00:51:18.890
the space was code. People were gonna read
it so I traced the fixation point through--that's

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:25.470
the amber line. You can see this running live
outside, by the way. I finally hooked up the

00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:30.100
projector again. The amber line just reads
simply through. The green line, which is just

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:35.339
kind of ghosted here, this is actually probably
ten thousand calls from a routine into here,

00:51:35.339 --> 00:51:42.109
so that's the execution point and the white
line is my insertion point of how I, how I

00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:52.040
wrote the code. So, this, I got beat up by
a colleague, another friend in, who is in

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:57.369
the same exhibition. And he said, "Well, gosh
it's really baroque. There's all these curves,"

00:51:57.369 --> 00:52:03.579
and I'm extrapolating a little bit now, but
it is a mess. It's, and baroque is fair, it's

00:52:03.579 --> 00:52:09.210
got a lot of curves there. And he said, "I
would have much." He said, "I would be much

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:14.590
more interested in this work if it was like
the minimum thing that would draw itself on

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:21.260
a screen." Which is a neat trick if you go
to MIT and you're focused on that kind of

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:27.150
elegant computer problem, but I was focused
on human communication. And the baroqueness,

00:52:27.150 --> 00:52:35.930
this stuff, notice that these lines are perfectly
straight. That's the following of the execution

00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:39.900
point around here. There's no reason to think
there's any flow. The computer just kinda

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:44.990
jumps from one place to another. When I was
writing the code, though, I was in a flow

00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:49.740
state. What Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls
a flow state; it's, he's a person who studies

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:56.589
optimal human performance, intellectual and
even emotional states while you're doing your

00:52:56.589 --> 00:53:01.191
absolute best. And I was in a flow state when
I, I was just rippin'. Every bit of information

00:53:01.191 --> 00:53:04.369
was just right there at my fingertips. Wait
a second. I wish I could do this in my life

00:53:04.369 --> 00:53:07.460
more than two percent of the time, but--

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:08.460
[Brad laughs]

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:14.460
so, so I was, though, at this point. Thank
you, Christiane, for inviting me to do this.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:20.170
And so it was completely, absolutely inappropriate
and wrong to draw that as a straight line.

00:53:20.170 --> 00:53:24.829
It should flow. In fact, I used a natural
cubic because that had an even more flowing

00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:28.609
feel to it than a B-Spline would. I mean,
there are various ways you can draw curves

00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:39.559
on a computer. So, this is, this is a bit
of a direction away from just the raw presentation

00:53:39.559 --> 00:53:44.970
of data on the screen, trying to interpret
it in a way that's more associated with how

00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:55.890
people are gonna read it; what task they're
gonna use it for. So, now I'll do very quick

00:53:55.890 --> 00:54:08.330
discussions of these two. This is my most
successful failure. I, now I don't care. I

00:54:08.330 --> 00:54:18.609
say it's successful because it was published
in Science and Geo and Discover and I can't

00:54:18.609 --> 00:54:23.040
remember, many, many magazines and I still,
to this day, even though it's many years old

00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:27.240
get requests for people to use it in their
thesis on their wall in the science department

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:32.869
or something. Every spot is a different area
of science, the lines are kind of like those

00:54:32.869 --> 00:54:39.450
rubber bands from TextArc, say, we told every
spot to push away from all the other spots.

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:44.000
However, we held the bits, the areas of science
that were related to each other together with

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.850
similar rubber bands to the ones that I used
in TextArc and that's what created this shape.

00:54:47.850 --> 00:54:51.790
So, all the organic chemistry stuff was over
here and it's kind of related to physical

00:54:51.790 --> 00:54:57.170
chemistry, which is kind of related to applied
science and physics and astrophysics; so these

00:54:57.170 --> 00:55:01.250
things are all related to each other. I invite
you to look at that if you want. I added this

00:55:01.250 --> 00:55:07.420
because this is actually just kind of a curiosity,
not really a tool and I pride myself on being

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:13.829
a toolmaker of late--try to anyway. And so,
this does become a tool though when you take

00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:22.420
that map and say, "Oh, well the United States
is heavy in medicine and social sciences and

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:31.910
doesn't do much of the mathematical stuff.
Canada and, Canada and United Kingdom are

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:36.900
pretty similar. Australia's similar. France
and Germany and Spain are very well rounded."

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:43.890
See how their spots are pretty evenly distributed
around the whole space. China and Taiwan are

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:47.740
pretty much very complementary to us so if
you're doing a startup, you might want to,

00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:52.980
and you need tech and humanities and medicine,
you may want to involve people on a couple

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:59.170
of different continents, this is what it's
saying. So, this, I was calling it a failure

00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:07.080
because the very thing I think that made people
really wanna, really want to use it in these

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:14.410
various settings is completely an artifact
of a bad algorithm that I designed to lay

00:56:14.410 --> 00:56:22.390
out the text. So, this, all of those, those
hairs, was called the Flying Spaghetti Monster

00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:23.390
or, or--

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:24.390
[laughter]

00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:31.109
I can't remember what other things I thought
it was a feather ball, it's a, I was just

00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:36.450
trying to instead of just put, putting spots
on the screen, or spots rather on the print--no

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:41.099
way you could do this on a screen--spots on
the print, I wanted to label each one with

00:56:41.099 --> 00:56:45.980
the words that were most commonly used in
that area because then it becomes fun to read

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:50.349
through the whole thing and see how the concepts
are related to one another. The reason I call

00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:54.950
it a failure is because, because it looks
hairy. Because you're, it's drawing much more

00:56:54.950 --> 00:57:02.650
attention to itself and there's no information
driving this shape. I mean, if they all were

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:10.490
slightly curved like this, then it would elicit
the kind of humanist understanding of science,

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:18.940
not as a dry, technical discipline, but as
a, as a humanist discipline as aspiring to

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:24.640
understanding the human or the physical condition
as novel writing or painting is. But science

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.970
is like that. We outside of science don't
necessarily know that, so I was trying to

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:34.710
give it a little bit more of a human face
and I think that would be enough, but this,

00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:39.880
all this nasty stuff is just grrrr! It's drawing
your eye and it's drawing your eye to faults

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.819
in my algorithm. Seriously.

00:57:41.819 --> 00:57:42.819
[laughter]

00:57:42.819 --> 00:57:48.150
I would mark somebody 'C' on that. Fortunately
I didn't have anybody I was deploying to that

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:55.670
was quite so mean about this. Now, the last
thing in the show, so you see, I hope you're

00:57:55.670 --> 00:58:05.140
seeing there's kind of an arc here where I'm
trying to make tools that are more understandable

00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:11.680
by human beings because of things they already
know, or because of things they're already

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:15.270
prewired for. This is the last thing out there.
It's a calendar. I think I'm proudest of this.

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:22.819
I'm certainly proudest of this of any of the
things out there even though it's sparse it's

00:58:22.819 --> 00:58:29.770
very regular because the data I was showing
is very regular. It's hours in the day. It's

00:58:29.770 --> 00:58:41.920
not you. There. [pause] Hours in the day and
it's a pretty much, it's pretty similar from

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:50.320
day to day. I mean, there are, there are a
couple of days that are a little bit funny

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:58.349
like, like this one. 12, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6 and that's daylight savings time. You roll

00:58:58.349 --> 00:59:02.480
back in fall. There's a double line just because
that's the beginning. It so happened that

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:10.230
the, that Friday both started and ended this
year, or started and will end this year. Ok,

00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:17.039
so this thing though I'm proudest of because,
I'll go, if you're interested later I can

00:59:17.039 --> 00:59:22.000
talk about the agenda. It has an insidious
existential agenda. I'm a child of the 70s

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:27.099
before semiotics and, and we were interested
in existentialism and the point of this was

00:59:27.099 --> 00:59:32.490
if you mark something on here and then do
your email for a minute and you look up and

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:39.640
you say, "Oh, I marked that, but it's already
two hours have elapsed." I'm tying a recognizable

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:48.220
flow rate of your minute to minute, or at
least hour to hour experience to the entire

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:54.050
year and I was trying to scare us all, letting
us realize we almost never, there's very little,

00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:58.619
there's, it's very hard to tie big numbers
and small numbers together. Remember my half

00:59:58.619 --> 01:00:03.569
billion years of eye evolution? And forty
thousand or twenty thousand years of linguistic

01:00:03.569 --> 01:00:07.640
evolution? It's really hard to think of those
in the same mental breath and this was me

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:12.869
trying to span a couple of orders of magnitude.
I actually did an even scarier one that turned

01:00:12.869 --> 01:00:16.080
out to just be design gesture. It wasn't very
useful. This thing could be useful if you

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.990
mark things on it. Actually, we have somebody
who's used it more virtuostically than anybody

01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:25.280
in the world and he's in the audience here,
too. You've sent me pictures of using this

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.650
to really plot out things and the idea is
you, you might see some patterns in your life.

01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:33.869
This is about, about, this is graph paper
on which to plot your life, basically. But

01:00:33.869 --> 01:00:37.750
the scarier one that I did, I was almost gonna
do for 2010. It wasn't gonna be useful as

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:43.309
a tool, but I could collapse all these together
and spiral in and it would have had to have

01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:49.490
been a little bit bigger, but I could've put
an entire decade on a page and still show

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:55.900
you hour to hour changes. And I really liked
the idea that for the rest of my life I've

01:00:55.900 --> 01:00:58.340
got like two productive pages, maybe three.

01:00:58.340 --> 01:00:59.340
[laughter]

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:03.891
And once I turn those pages I'm into senility
and I might have another extra page and a

01:01:03.891 --> 01:01:11.430
half. And I like to threaten myself, and I
suggest that it's a valuable thing to do if

01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:19.960
you want to, and get up out of bed some morning
when you don't have to and get something accomplished.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.250
This thing, the main reason I'm proud of it,
though, was not necessarily that agenda, some

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:27.640
of which I admit was formed after I made it
and looked at it and thought about what it

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:32.059
would be used for, I don't have to explain
this to anybody. I just hand it to them. They

01:01:32.059 --> 01:01:38.849
figure it out themselves. Why? Because red
for weekends and out here is a standard type

01:01:38.849 --> 01:01:48.280
of graphic structure, ok, is a standard typographic
way of showing, of showing things. Certainly,

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:52.800
the features of January, February, ziiiiiiip!
December are things that people recognize.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:02:00.781
They eventually recognize that, "Oh, this
is hump day." The low part of the week and

01:02:00.781 --> 01:02:04.760
this is the high part of the week, the weekend,
at least at the top part of the, that's so

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:10.290
the little, the frills are on the outside
are showing weeks. There are something, somewhere

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:16.740
between nine and twelve "aha" reactions that
I've intentionally engineered into this because

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:22.579
when I give it to you; I wanna make you feel
smart. I wanna give ya that ex-, that ability

01:02:22.579 --> 01:02:28.200
to look at it and figure stuff out yourself
because we all love that, right? And the only

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:31.070
reason that that's possible is because you're
so smart to begin with and I'm just giving

01:02:31.070 --> 01:02:38.029
you something that has features that if you
trust me enough, as a visualization person,

01:02:38.029 --> 01:02:43.210
you will look at and say, "Brad must have
done this for a reason. He's not somebody

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:49.599
who reads in random numbers and vomits colors
onto the screens because they give you two

01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:56.109
seconds worth of visual retinal titillation.
He's not one of those guys." There are many

01:02:56.109 --> 01:03:00.339
of those guys. Mostly guys. "When he puts
a Martin on the page it means something."

01:03:00.339 --> 01:03:05.670
And so then, then you have an excuse to look
into it more deeply and those excuses all

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:12.829
come around, the intention of an author trying
to get meaning across and leaving a breadcrumb

01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:20.829
trail of breadcrumbs--recognizable features--that
you'll be able to tap into. So, now I wanna

01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:27.470
show something that I didn't do and then I'll
give you just quick, quick glances of more

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:36.039
recent work. So, I was going from ten to eight
to six to four years old. This is not my work.

01:03:36.039 --> 01:03:44.750
God, I wish it were. It is about 150 or 170
years old. It does, I wanna suggest far better

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:49.869
information visualization than I may ever
get to and that I think almost anybody in

01:03:49.869 --> 01:03:57.390
the world is able to do it. It's a page from
the 19, or sorry, 1810 Encyclopedia Britannica.

01:03:57.390 --> 01:04:01.779
And why do I call it, why am I so enthralled
with this? It's just an engraving, right?

01:04:01.779 --> 01:04:07.860
Here's why: Trying to get across a message.
You wanna give people "aha" reactions; you

01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:12.200
wanna tap into things that they already recognize.
You wanna give them features to allow them

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:18.079
to understand and discover it. I don't have
to tell you for a second, I don't have to

01:04:18.079 --> 01:04:24.410
say things, but I will just to show you this
approach to understanding a work like this.

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:37.960
No, thank you. What a shot. Go away. Oh. Thank
you. Ok, elevation, plan. You knew that. Why?

01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:44.049
Because the elevation is drawn like mountains
and the plan is drawn relatively flat. This

01:04:44.049 --> 01:04:49.660
is swampland, this is farmland and this is
a structure. I didn't have to tell you any

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:50.660
of that. You--

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.660
[snaps fingers]

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:54.369
Instantaneously, preattentively, before the
third of a second that it takes for a stimulus

01:04:54.369 --> 01:05:00.420
to get to your forebrain, this thing was already
parsed. It was already recognized to you before

01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:05.110
you even saw it in a sense. There are really
cool magical tricks you can play with your

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:10.270
mind when you realize that people live a third
of a second in the past. There are ways to

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:14.119
get information into their heads in a tenth
of a second or two-tenths of a second, so

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:17.640
that it's already there when they come aware
of it and that's the essence of making a good

01:05:17.640 --> 01:05:22.569
tool. And that's what this person did. This
is a, this is a phenomenal tool and just one

01:05:22.569 --> 01:05:27.099
other thing. This top, so, the features that
I was talking about that are breadcrumbs that

01:05:27.099 --> 01:05:31.550
allow you to instantaneously recognize things
and distinguish things, I wanna suggest that

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:38.770
when you draw something, every distinct intellectual
category should have a distinct visual vocabulary

01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:44.880
that you draw it with because there is instantaneously
distinguishable as this and this and you people

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:50.619
here. We are built, we are evolved to make
instantaneous preattentive distinctions between

01:05:50.619 --> 01:05:53.849
things that look different and so I can look
at the people and ignore the chairs or look

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:57.690
at chairs and ignore the people. He allowed
us to do that and then, even more virtuously,

01:05:57.690 --> 01:06:03.789
he tied the plan and the elevation together
with this dotted line overlay. Dotted lines

01:06:03.789 --> 01:06:09.400
indicate virtual or intellectual things and
it's just, it's just gorgeous stuff. I wanna

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:19.200
zoom into this--I know I'm over the five minutes,
but I just, I am excited to share this with

01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:26.279
you. So, I just wanna show the amazing detail
in this and the beautiful resonances, visual

01:06:26.279 --> 01:06:31.520
poetry that, the waves aren't really that
big. But we know it's water because he's referring

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:36.200
to waves, right? It's not a slavish translation
of the real world. It's not a photograph;

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:40.109
it's a reinterpretation that allows us to
parse it and understand it as information

01:06:40.109 --> 01:06:49.140
much more easily. The punch line for this,
by the way, is that that's the real size.

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.140
[Brad laughs]

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:55.920
It's this big. And anybody who wants one I
printed up a bunch. I'd be happy to send you.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:07:00.160
Finally, in the negative four minutes I have
left I'll--

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.160
[laughter]

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:08.060
show you. Leave if you want to. I really apologize.
But there are ways that you can turn this

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:12.890
into more quotidian things. This is work that
I did for the New York Stock Exchange. And

01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:19.579
I'm trying to learn how to distinguish things
that are really important to look at, things

01:07:19.579 --> 01:07:27.520
that are temporary post-it like overlays on
information, things that are paper like because

01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:33.319
they're forms with the square corners versus
screen like because there are round corners,

01:07:33.319 --> 01:07:40.320
things that are basic information and interpretations
of the information and this is how you can

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:46.551
start to put in two, three, four, seven times
as much information that people are asking

01:07:46.551 --> 01:07:51.829
for. And the information, if it's related,
and if you visually layer it properly and

01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:56.660
draw it so that it's instantaneously recognizable
in this preattentive way, so it's recognized

01:07:56.660 --> 01:08:01.299
before you see it, in a sense, before you're
conscious of it, it becomes paradoxically

01:08:01.299 --> 01:08:06.840
more comfortable. Why? Because it's feeding
our visual and cognitive processes in the

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:14.779
way that, in the way that the real world does.
And all of a sudden, it becomes as effortless

01:08:14.779 --> 01:08:19.230
as looking around in a room like this. Reduce
this room to a spreadsheet, right? It's gonna

01:08:19.230 --> 01:08:23.970
be a 150 thousand line spreadsheet if we ignore
most of the interesting stuff and that's gonna

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:28.780
be a useless spreadsheet. The only reason
you can look around this room and do this--I'm

01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:36.860
hoping that I'm doing for some of my clients
and I promise I'll come back to, after, after

01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:40.430
I retire from Wall Street. I mean, why am
I doing this on Wall Street? Because they

01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:43.910
happen to be able to make money out of this
stuff and they're, they're willing to fund

01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:49.660
it. But I'm gonna bring this stuff back into
probably nanotechnology or some, some positive

01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:55.720
technical humanist thing. Different layers
from different kinds of information and you

01:08:55.720 --> 01:09:02.050
can see I'm nowhere near as virtuosic as that
anonymous person from 150 years ago. We all

01:09:02.050 --> 01:09:05.780
have a lot to learn. I invite you guys to
join me and surpass me on this stuff. Thanks

01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:06.780
for listening.

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:07.780
[applause]

01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:08.780
&gt;&gt;Josh: That was, that was an hour and a half
 [ ].

01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:09.920
&gt;&gt;Brad: Ok.

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:12.600
[Brad and Fernanda laugh]

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:20.560
&gt;&gt;Josh: Are there any questions? Please don't
wait on me.

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:41.440
&gt;&gt;audience member #4: That needs some discussion.
I [ ]

01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:44.310
&gt;&gt;Brad: Great stuff.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:52.950
&gt;&gt;audience member #4: [ ]

01:09:52.950 --> 01:10:14.120
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah. Yeah, so the question was that
there's been discussion about Apple using

01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:18.570
very physical or physics based bits of the
interface. Like, for instance, on the OFM

01:10:18.570 --> 01:10:22.640
when you scroll past the end of a list it
lets you and then it generally pops you back.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:28.750
All sorts of things like that. And the debate
evidently is should we hearken back to this

01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:33.610
plain old physics fake stuff or should we
be inventing new paradigms? And my somewhat

01:10:33.610 --> 01:10:41.100
glib, but mostly heartfelt answer is absolutely.
Invent completely new paradigms for demonstrating

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:49.530
data as soon as our wiring has changed. That's
gonna be another 500 million years, so I think

01:10:49.530 --> 01:10:55.770
that those people who are on that side of
the argument, actually it may not be 500 million

01:10:55.770 --> 01:10:57.890
years. There are gimmen-, there are gimments
if you survive the next hundred years, and

01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:02.810
most of you under twenty probably will, are
most of you under thirty probably will, then

01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:08.161
you'll be uploaded and then it might be much
quicker to change some of the hardwiring that

01:11:08.161 --> 01:11:11.700
I have to take for granted cause I'm 52 and
I'm gonna die in 50 years--

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.700
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: [ ]

01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:13.700
&gt;&gt;Brad: But--

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:14.700
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: [ ]

01:11:14.700 --> 01:11:18.440
&gt;&gt;Brad: Well, it's, I mean, you can, you can
turn it into the behavioral version of chart

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:24.810
chunk, right? You can, where, "Oh is it really
enhancing my ability to deal with this? To

01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:30.000
turn the page." I think it's a, I said I was
being somewhat glib, but mostly heartfelt.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:36.630
If you're, to really address that there is
a simple, simple thing that you wanna do.

01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:46.600
You wanna say, "Given the hardware of human
perception and the software, as it were, of--"

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:52.470
I just lapsed into those nasty analogies anyway,
didn't I? Excuse me. "And the software of

01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:59.060
human cognition and categorization and things
like this." Given that, set that aside, that's

01:11:59.060 --> 01:12:05.720
what we're feeding, understand what the task
is, if you can, if you can be true to the

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:10.990
task and tie into some physics stuff like
that scrolling past the end of the list, is

01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:16.240
beautiful because it lets my gut know that
I'm scrolled past the end of the list and

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:19.910
I'm tapping into the hardware and the learning
that I've done about physics in the real world.

01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:24.200
If you can align all of those interests then
absolutely do it because what it does is it

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:29.410
offloads that information from your forebrain
to your body. And the key thing about that

01:12:29.410 --> 01:12:34.220
is it lets your foregrain-, forebrain go on
and do what it was supposed to do. I do not

01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:39.390
go to my phone to use a scrollbar to find
the end of the list. I go to my phone to find

01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:44.740
a human being and if my fingers can take care
of going through the list, then my mind can

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:48.490
think about that human being and it's freed
up to think about other human beings. So,

01:12:48.490 --> 01:12:49.490
yeah.

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:57.590
&gt;&gt;Josh: So you really want your users to feel
something then it should look like a lion

01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:58.590
or [ ].

01:12:58.590 --> 01:12:59.590
[laughter]

01:12:59.590 --> 01:13:01.440
&gt;&gt;Brad: Absolutely. One of the, one of the
problems with, one of the problems with the

01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:04.980
thing I just showed you, remember there was
an alert that was bright red in the, in the

01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:09.860
middle of the screen? One of the problems
with that is I'm misaligning interests in

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:21.700
a way that I'm trying to avoid. That thing
was the brightest, prettiest thing on the

01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:26.240
screen. And it's the most dangerous damn thing
that could happen to a specialist on the floor

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:30.640
of the New York Stock Exchange. So, they know
after a while, "Oh yeah, I better be aware

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.950
of that." But there's some part of them saying,
"Ooh, pretty. I want more of that."

01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:35.950
[laughter]

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:46.950
And they really don't. So, so, I misaligned
these myself. Yeah. I pointed at this gentleman

01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:54.950
first. Probably cause his hand went up first.

01:13:54.950 --> 01:14:09.960
&gt;&gt;audience member #5: [ ] Let's say you have
no gravity. The speed of a bouncing ball [ ]

01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:15.200
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah, yeah. We would learn that other
thing.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.730
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: [ ]

01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:24.160
&gt;&gt;Brad: I didn't have, in 35 minutes, enough
time to do all of the proper academic escapes

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:32.520
and cautions in that. I think of it as hardwired
because, because as far as I'--

01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:34.860
&gt;&gt;audience member#6: [ ]

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:36.200
&gt;&gt;Brad: Right.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:44.220
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: [ ].

01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:51.010
&gt;&gt;Brad: We, we are amazingly flexible within
certain limitations and it's, that's a question

01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:57.460
to talk to psycholinguists and cogno scientists
about. Point taken. I take it as a designer,

01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:01.510
not a cognitive scientist, as a designer I
take it as given because most of us grow up

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:06.200
in a pretty similar world. However, your point
does bring up the point that, that we grew

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:10.940
up in a similar world with respect to physics,
but not with respect to culture. And so, if

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:16.510
you wanna use red as "hot" in physics and
you think that that means a high number and

01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:20.750
you go to Wall Street and you proudly show
them a visualization--I did this 20 years

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:28.910
ago where I used a heat map and they said,
"Lemme get this straight. Black is low and

01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:34.500
when I'm in the red that's good? Oh, ok, fine."
Different cultures have different color mappings

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:40.720
and we need to be aware of that. It's part
of our ability to learn.

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:43.740
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: [ ].

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:52.350
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah, which will work unless you're
in China where it's up and down or Jewish

01:15:52.350 --> 01:15:53.350
where it's backwards.

01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:56.320
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: [ ].

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:58.500
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah.

01:15:58.500 --> 01:16:01.770
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: [ ].

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:04.360
&gt;&gt;Josh: The back button. [ ] down.

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.360
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:06.360
&gt;&gt;audience member #6: [ ].

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.900
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah, exactly. Yeah. You need to take
advantage of your culture.

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:13.160
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: It's really very interesting
to hear you talk about [ ] feeding the brain

01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:17.100
in a way that will reward us and these ideas
of the breadcrumbs and visual cues that you

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:18.100
recognize before your conscious does--

01:16:18.100 --> 01:16:19.100
&gt;&gt;Brad: Mm-hmm. Exciting stuff.

01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:25.420
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: I'm wondering if you
have any ideas about the third dimension in

01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:34.830
data visualization and spatial memory? There's
something called the HNR memory where--

01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:40.231
&gt;&gt;Brad: Where you visualize a room, a structure
and you put ideas in the structure?

01:16:40.231 --> 01:16:47.330
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: Right. And you use physical
notations to bookmark some ideas and [ ]. Do

01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:49.050
you see that as our [ ] limitation to talk
about creative--

01:16:49.050 --> 01:16:53.820
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah. Well, think about what that
is, by the way. You're using your amaz-, your

01:16:53.820 --> 01:16:59.260
eye and what your eye has created, which is
this remarkable ability to deal with space

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:04.520
and remember spatial structures, and you're
using that to leverage something that we really

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.530
weren't built for at all, which is memorizing
lists of things. So you walk through the space

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:13.190
and you leave this idea here, this idea there,
this idea here and then when you walk through

01:17:13.190 --> 01:17:18.770
the space again you, if the things are tied
with the space. Yeah, so, they're doing, that

01:17:18.770 --> 01:17:23.750
was high-tech, very high-tech when the Greeks,
I guess it was, did that stuff. I'm not sure

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:28.720
I'd call that the third dimension. That's
still, I mean, it, I mean, I think of three

01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:32.910
dimension as three dimensional visualization
stuff and that's, it's a hard thing to pull

01:17:32.910 --> 01:17:38.910
off well and I'm interested to see somebody
do it and I'm not sure I have seen anybody

01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:41.520
do it yet. We can talk later if you want to
talk.

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:42.520
&gt;&gt;audience member #7: [ ]

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.641
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah because it's volumes worth of
stuff and I've only read half of one of the

01:17:46.641 --> 01:17:48.390
volumes, but at least we could have the beginning
of that talk.

01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:59.150
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: My question is actually
very related to that. This excitement in mathematics

01:17:59.150 --> 01:18:00.150
where there's [ ].

01:18:00.150 --> 01:18:01.150
&gt;&gt;Brad: Ok.

01:18:01.150 --> 01:18:02.150
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: Which basically says
higher dimensional space does not act like

01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:03.150
two dimensional spaces.

01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:04.150
&gt;&gt;Brad: Oh. Ok, fine.

01:18:04.150 --> 01:18:08.390
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: So, for example, there's
something called the exotic seventh sphere

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:09.390
where you start with an eight dimensional
cube and sort of sand off its edges so that

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:13.180
you can shrink it down to a sphere.

01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:14.180
&gt;&gt;Brad: Ok.

01:18:14.180 --> 01:18:18.560
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: Which is what would
happen in three dimensions and two dimensions--

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560
&gt;&gt;Brad: Mm-hmm.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:23.950
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: Well, in eight dimensions
there's thirty eight different kinds of spheres

01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:26.420
and they're all spheres. They all have constant
 [ ] but they're not shaped the same.

01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:27.420
&gt;&gt;Brad: Interesting.

01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:29.790
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: It's such a strange
idea we can't even--

01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:34.271
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah. Well, there are three kinds
of parallel lines you can do even in our universe,

01:18:34.271 --> 01:18:35.271
right?

01:18:35.271 --> 01:18:36.271
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: Exactly. And that was
the start obviously that something's not maybe

01:18:36.271 --> 01:18:45.530
as simple as, it seems like this is a big
dilemma for you guys who are in higher dimensional

01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:46.530
spaces [ ] not making that things like the
notion of the nearest neighbor is not as simple

01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:47.530
as it might be if I project down.

01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:48.530
&gt;&gt;Brad: I see.

01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:49.530
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: or if I take my touch
points and count them up and put them on a

01:18:49.530 --> 01:19:11.890
dimensional grid with their nearest neighbors
 [ ]. But if you're in a higher dimensional

01:19:11.890 --> 01:19:13.380
space you don't take into account the age
of the people, the sexuality. It's the same

01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:19.580
problem [ ] Pandora. It's a lot of complaints
like, "How come when I'm listening to my rock

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:23.310
and roll all of a sudden I hear it's not."

01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:24.310
[Brad laughs]

01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:26.660
And he's got 60 parameters that can measure
 [ ].

01:19:26.660 --> 01:19:27.660
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah.

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:31.240
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: He's in 60 dimensional
space. How does that work?

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:38.650
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah, but you know if I gave you a
list of stocks and their prices today, yesterday

01:19:38.650 --> 01:19:43.840
and two days ago, you wouldn't necessarily
call that a three dimensional space. There's

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:50.660
no continuity, there's no sense of whether
it's bounded or not, I mean, we use dimensions

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:54.610
in kind of a wonky way. I mean, when somebody
talks about a 60 dimensional space it has

01:19:54.610 --> 01:19:57.980
nothing to do with the eleven dimensions in
which we live and the three of which we are

01:19:57.980 --> 01:20:05.560
aware. So, when you conflate those two things
it sounds like we have a harder problem than

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:11.980
when you disentangle them. The multi-dimensional
space issues are well taken care of by, and

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:17.730
you guys know this better than I do, these
guys know the math behind the, a lot of these

01:20:17.730 --> 01:20:23.350
things like multi-dimensional scaling or finding
Eiken vectors through higher quote dimensional

01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:33.250
spaces. But those, that, the arbitrary scaling
of those different quote "dimensions" is well

01:20:33.250 --> 01:20:40.550
taken care of by certain kinds of mathematical
tricks. And the thing that I wanted to disentangle

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:48.660
is the space we live in and train our brains
to be able to respond to is very strictly

01:20:48.660 --> 01:20:54.270
three, it's really only three dimensions;
it's even silly, in a sense, to call time

01:20:54.270 --> 01:21:04.080
the fourth dimension. That's just freshmore's
trying to sound clever. It's something that

01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:09.580
has no physical reality that we can tie into
with it. You couldn't just swap width for

01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:12.082
time. It doesn't work that way.

01:21:12.082 --> 01:21:13.490
&gt;&gt;audience member 8: It's a clear game.

01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:17.310
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah. Someone suggested, I want to
suggest that you're right -- we could've been

01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:23.870
in danger there, but fortunately it's just
a linguistic confusion that's tying together

01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:27.150
dimensions of one sort with dimensions of
another.

01:21:27.150 --> 01:21:30.530
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: [ ] those things that
are the predecessor. the pre-announcement--

01:21:30.530 --> 01:21:31.590
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah, foreshadowing.

01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:37.250
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: By your own admission,
when you look at the texts, you say, "Oh.

01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:42.420
Wait a minute. This is a third person reference.
It's not that [ ] that Queen spelled Q-U-E-E-N

01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:45.600
is in a different [ ].

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.550
&gt;&gt;Brad: It's a different concept. Yeah.

01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:51.650
&gt;&gt;audience member #8: Right. But on your thing
You heat wave, you heat wave. And you even

01:21:51.650 --> 01:22:04.880
let the young person who's trying to write
their Alice in Wonderland that all they have

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:13.401
to do is indruce the queen buh-buh-buh and
that person – they don't get the rest of

01:22:13.401 --> 01:22:14.401
your lecture. They don't hear the part "Oh,
by the way. You might want to put the notion

01:22:14.401 --> 01:22:15.401
of the queen in somebody else's minds."

01:22:15.401 --> 01:22:16.430
&gt;&gt;Brad: That's a good, that's a good point.
So, I should be careful if I give somebody

01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:20.710
a map and say, "Here's where the ice cream
store is." I should be careful that they don't

01:22:20.710 --> 01:22:25.510
try to cut it out and eat it. I'll be very
careful about that in the future.

01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:27.330
[Brad laughs]

01:22:27.330 --> 01:22:32.520
That there are people who I could confuse
because this is a new kind of map, into thinking

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:40.390
this was reality, but at our best we're showing
one fractured view of an incredibly rich phenomenon

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:44.320
than I think we all realize that. That's my
inspiration for going on actually, because

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:50.170
I wanna unfracture it and show two views before
I die. Do we--

01:22:50.170 --> 01:22:54.840
&gt;&gt;lady: Yeah, we have time for another question.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:56.590
&gt;&gt;Brad: Ok, yes.

01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:58.340
&gt;&gt;audience member #9: [ ].

01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.510
&gt;&gt;Brad: Yeah.

01:22:59.510 --> 01:23:04.180
&gt;&gt;audience member #9: [ ] feeling of elegance
 – kind of [ ].

01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.960
&gt;&gt;Brad: It's so beautiful.

01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:08.760
&gt;&gt;audience member #9: [ ].

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:18.180
&gt;&gt;Brad: Oh that's true. So, just the very
interpretation is focusing your eye on it.

01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:22.210
Maybe that's where the art comes in. That's
what artists are supposed to do.

01:23:22.210 --> 01:23:23.710
&gt;&gt;audience member #9: [ ].

01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:29.120
&gt;&gt;Brad: It's not poss-, it's not impossible
to do that. You can, Victor Vescarelli, for

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:37.130
instance, a pop artist of far too high stature
compared to his talent, as far as I'm concerned.

01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:44.620
Is he still alive? Is this going out on the
air? Ok. That's good, I think. But, was able

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:50.480
to draw things that were much more realistic
looking than real, than they could by--actually,

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:57.430
Salvador Dali, whose early work I respect
very, very highly, intentionally did something

01:23:57.430 --> 01:24:03.700
that your retina does. It takes a light, low,
a high level of light and a low level of light

01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:09.850
and your retina has cells that span the receptors
under the low light and the high light and

01:24:09.850 --> 01:24:15.130
the cells--retinal ganglion cells-- that span
those two say, "Ooh. This is bright and this

01:24:15.130 --> 01:24:19.290
is dim. I'm gonna make this one even dimmer
and this one even brighter so the apparent

01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:25.930
profile at an edge is like this." And Salvador
Dali said, "Well, I'm trying to make things

01:24:25.930 --> 01:24:31.940
that are illustrations of things in dreams,
which are hyper-, more real than real by definition

01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:36.920
because dreams are just meant to, some people
would say, work through an emotion and you

01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:41.630
invent objects to help you work through the
emotion and the objects have to be more real

01:24:41.630 --> 01:24:47.120
than external reality because they are built
from the forms of internal reality-- the perfect

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:50.760
Platonic ideal, right? So that they are truly
more real than this stuff.

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:51.950
[knocks on wood]

01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:56.540
So Salvador Dali was trying to illustrate
that and so he took this, which your retina

01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:02.060
does, and did it even more and that's one
of the visual tricks that he may or may not

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.590
have even known he was, I mean he knew what
he was doing, he implied in every one of his

01:25:04.590 --> 01:25:07.810
brushstrokes. I don't know if you knew where
it came from, retinal ganglion cells, but

01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:15.090
it's certainly possible to feed the machinery
that we have to engage with it even better

01:25:15.090 --> 01:25:21.400
than reality and it's a really, really hard
thing to do though. But it's, I wouldn't expect

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.350
us, I wouldn't expect us to--

01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:24.800
&gt;&gt;audience member #9: [ ].

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.260
&gt;&gt;Brad: I'm sorry?

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.720
&gt;&gt;audience member #9: [ ].

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:34.270
&gt;&gt;Brad: Well, you know what? It just leaves
me in awe of evolution and how it could have

01:25:34.270 --> 01:25:40.850
put together something so facile, so instantaneously
workable. Of course, instantaneous on our

01:25:40.850 --> 01:25:44.600
time frame and we evolved with the time frame
so [ ]. Take out instantaneous there, but

01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:49.690
it leaves me in awe of the fact that we have
this machinery that can take in so much information

01:25:49.690 --> 01:25:56.350
and parse it out at so many different levels,
edges and textures and people and behavior

01:25:56.350 --> 01:26:07.330
and meaning and social context and future.
It's so it doesn't, it's not like hmmm? And

01:26:07.330 --> 01:26:11.040
it's not like, confusing, it's just – it's
awesome in the pre-1980s use of the word.

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.040
[laughter]

01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.300
&gt;&gt;Josh: And let's bring it to an end there.
Thank you very much, everybody.

01:26:13.300 --> 01:26:14.300
[applause]

01:26:14.300 --> 01:26:15.300
Thank you Brad.

01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:16.720
Thank you Martin and Fernanda.
