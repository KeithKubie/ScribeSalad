00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.360
So another consideration we might want to think about with

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.550
decision trees but you're not going to go into a lot

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.290
of detail but I think might be worth at least

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.890
mentioning is the problem of regression. So, so far we've

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.440
only been doing classification ,where the outputs are discreet, but

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.850
what if we were trying to solve something that looked

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.930
more like x squared or two x plus 17, or

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.660
some other continuous function. In other words, a regression problem.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.390
How would we have to adapt decision trees, to do that? Any ideas Michael?

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.560
&gt;&gt; So these are now continuous outputs, not just continuous inputs.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.890
&gt;&gt; Right, maybe the outputs are all continuous, maybe

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.370
the outputs are discrete, maybe they're a mix of both.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.380
&gt;&gt; Well it certainly seems like out

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.840
rule of using, information gain is going to run

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.150
into trouble because it's not really clear how

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.850
you measure information on these continuous values. So,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.880
I guess you could measure error some other way. Well we're not, it's not, it's

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.719
not error right it's tryin to measure how mixed up things are? Oh so ,maybe

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.140
something like variance? Cause in a continuous

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.470
space you could talk about you know, if

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.110
there's a big spread of, in the values

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.000
that, that would be measured by the variance.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.440
&gt;&gt; Oh good. So what you really have now is

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.156
a question about splitting. What's the splitting criteria? Maybe [CROSSTALK]

00:01:15.156 --> 00:01:15.900
&gt;&gt; I guess there's also an

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.000
issue of, of what you do in the leaves.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.280
&gt;&gt; Right. So, what might you do in the leaves?

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.270
&gt;&gt; I guess you could do some sort of more standard kind of fitting algorithm.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.555
So, like, report the average or, or do some kind of a linear fit. [SOUND]

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:37.270
&gt;&gt; Is any number of things you can do. By the way ,that's worth pointing out

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.640
on the, on the output that if we do pruning like we did before, we have errors,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.420
we did actually say when we talked about that how you

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.190
would report an output. Right? If you don't have a clear

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.060
answer where everything is labeled true or everything is labled false,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.110
how do you pick? So something like an average would work there.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.760
&gt;&gt; I don't know, I mean, it seems like it depends

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.740
on what we're trying to measure with the tree. If the tree

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.740
is, we're trying to get as many right answers as we can,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.178
then you probably want to do like a vote in the leaves.

00:02:03.178 --> 00:02:06.600
&gt;&gt; Right, which ,at least, if the only answer is true or false,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.729
that would look more like an average I guess. Right, so

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.740
you pick, you do a vote. So we do a vote,

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.860
so we do pruning. We do have to deal with this

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.310
issue of the output. Somehow ,and something like a vote mixing.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.580
And here, when you have a regression, then I guess average is a lot like voting.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah, in a continuous phase.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So either way we're doing a kind of voting. I like that.
