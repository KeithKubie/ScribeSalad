00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: Chance to
enjoy some of the tunes

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.090
that we set out to set the mood.

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.750
From Barrett Strong's,
"Money"-- that's what I want--

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.515
to Pink Floyd's, "Money", to
Lady Gaga's, "Money Honey",

00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:16.955
it's multiple generations of
music all singing the same

00:00:16.955 --> 00:00:17.630
tune.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.760
Money is kind of a big deal.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.460
So that's why I'm so
excited to introduce you

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.012
to Alexa Von Tobel.

00:00:24.012 --> 00:00:25.595
And let me read a
little bit about her

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:28.610
so that you can get
just as excited as I am.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.596
So Alexa is the CEO and
founder of LearnVest,

00:00:32.596 --> 00:00:34.220
and she's a certified
financial planner

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.315
who attended Harvard College
and Harvard Business School.

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:40.690
Alexa has been featured as a
financial expert in the Wall

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.760
Street Journal, The New York
Times, Fast Company, Forbes,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.470
InStyle, Glamour,
the list goes on.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.510
She has been recognized
in Inc's "30 Under 30".

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.080
She's just been a really,
really strong presence

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.470
in what's going to be a
great and important road.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.270
So without further
ado, I really want

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.334
to have you meet
Alexa Von Tobel.

00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:09.118
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:09.118 --> 00:01:11.450
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Hi guys.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.900
I'm gonna stand
here if that's OK.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.400
Hi guys.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.509
Thank you so much
for coming out.

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.050
It's Thursday, so
I really appreciate

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.383
that everyone's coming to
hear a little bit about money.

00:01:19.383 --> 00:01:20.690
Come in, sit down.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.650
This is going to be
totally informal,

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.190
and here's the goal of today.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.680
When you leave
here in one hour, I

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679
want to make sure that
you've learned everything

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.110
that you need to about money.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.300
Ask questions.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.400
Stop me.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.320
I'm in middle of
actually my book tour,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.395
so "Financially
Fearless" is our book.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:36.770
It's a New York
Times bestseller.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.310
It's actually number one on
Wall Street Journal on business.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.393
So that's pretty exciting.

00:01:40.393 --> 00:01:43.660
It came out about now 12
days ago, 15 days ago.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.620
And so we've been going around
the country giving this talk.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.094
I actually gave it to
the Google in New York.

00:01:50.094 --> 00:01:51.760
I'm going to the
Google in Beverly Hills

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.120
after this and a bunch of other
companies and organizations.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.037
So I've done it a lot.

00:01:56.037 --> 00:01:57.328
You're going to have questions.

00:01:57.328 --> 00:01:58.350
Ask them.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.360
And I'm going to stay and
sit up here at the end

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.670
and actually ask
one on one questions

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.419
if you wanna take the
time to do something

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:05.130
that's really specific to you.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.610
So 10 seconds on me.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.680
I grew up in Florida,
I went to Harvard.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.170
Went back to Wall St-- to Morgan
Stanley and worked as a trader

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.400
on the prop-desk.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.970
Went back to Harvard Business
School in the fall 2008.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.630
Won a big business
plan competition

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.660
and ultimately dropped out.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.670
I think we were in the heart
of the worst recession in 81

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.400
years, and I was literally
customer number one.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.047
You guys are really
great product people.

00:02:30.047 --> 00:02:32.380
I literally didn't know what
to do with my own finances.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.302
I was young, I didn't
have a ton of money,

00:02:34.302 --> 00:02:35.260
I didn't have no money.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.551
I was trying to figure out
like, what's a credit score?

00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:39.390
What are the things
that I need to know?

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.960
And what I found
was, it was such BS.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.260
Literally trying to
navigate your money.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.654
It's like, you literally
go Google tons of content.

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:49.070
You don't know it's updated,
you don't know if it's wrong.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.486
I actually just had some at
the Google in New York come up

00:02:51.486 --> 00:02:52.890
to me and actually was in tears.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.609
And she was like,
Alexa, I really

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.150
need and want to
figure out my money.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.300
She was like, I'm not
in a bad position.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.460
She was like, but I spent
over eight hours trying

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.829
to find a financial expert,
finally found someone.

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.620
Took about a week to
get them on the phone.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.036
We got on the
phone, and they want

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:08.917
to charge me like
a $3,000 retainer,

00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:10.500
and then I have to
commit that I wanna

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.875
work with them for over a year.

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:14.000
She was like, and I don't
have thousands of dollars

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.490
to spend to figure out my money.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.770
And the bottom line is, I was
like, why isn't there a way

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.910
to make people feel
great about money?

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.185
To make it extremely accessible,
and frankly, affordable.

00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:26.310
And I'm going to share some
really important stuff.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.240
But the goal of today is for
you to walk out feeling smarter.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.320
I'm really psyched that
we got you guys books.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.180
And without further
ado, we'll get started.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.900
So first, what is LearnVest?

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.451
We've raised $45 million.

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:41.450
We're now one of the
leading and fastest growing

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.960
online financial planning
companies in the whole country.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.900
We raise money from
Excel Venture Partners.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.795
We actually just closed a big
round of another $20 million.

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.260
We're located in New York City.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.580
We've got 110 employees.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.160
By the end of year we'll
probably have about 180 to 200.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.090
Plainly, simply put, we are
a program for your money.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.230
We literally, and you guys get
product, as I said, so well.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:03.800
We spent the last
three years, got

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.716
some of the best certified
financial planners.

00:04:05.716 --> 00:04:07.200
That's the doctor
for your money.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.660
Most people don't
even notice CFP is.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.860
We then took a bunch of
really great product people

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.850
and technologists, and we
built really rich software

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.570
that can take any household,
whether you make $50,000,

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.670
or $500,000, And
quickly find out

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.140
what your big weak points are.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.262
Like where you have
sort of red alerts,

00:04:24.262 --> 00:04:26.220
and then figuring out
how you can make progress

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.430
on your money.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.590
It's a really simple program.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.210
The goal when I set out was that
I want to make it accessible.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.816
It shouldn't be this
like, five day process,

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.190
where you don't
know where to go.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.350
You don't know if
it's actual expert.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:39.830
It's really expensive.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.235
Because the message that
happens there is you then

00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:44.180
tell yourself, I
shouldn't be doing this.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.740
It's so complicated.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.640
It's so hard.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.610
Clearly I shouldn't be
taking care of my money.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.570
When in fact, that's
not the point.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.450
And then finally, we wanted to
make it trusted and unbiased.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.030
So our experts at LearnVest
don't sell anything.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.420
They just give you advice.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.920
And my whole
family's in medicine.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.420
And one of the
things that I started

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.840
recognizing as I was
building the company,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.220
was you literally could
go to some experts

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.500
and they actually get
paid to sell your product.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:08.820
The problem there, it's
like going to the doctor

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.194
and them getting
paid to pump you

00:05:10.194 --> 00:05:14.020
full of antibiotics and shots,
when you're actually just sick

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.190
and need someone to
take care of you.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.060
Next slide.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.200
So first, follow
me and LearnVest.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.510
We're on the tour
for the next 30 days.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.130
But also, shoot questions to us.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.330
We will answer them.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.080
But we share a ton
of behind the scenes,

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.460
a ton of really important
money hacks at all times.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.850
So, this is us.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.180
Next.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:35.972
And really quickly,
so the book's

00:05:35.972 --> 00:05:37.930
call-- I wanted to call
the book, "The F Word",

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:38.230
first of all.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.980
Because none of us
wanna talk about money.

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:40.940
It's this topic.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.140
It's super stressful.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.750
In fact, like for
a century, like

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.790
we've taught everyone
never to talk about money.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.490
It's this totally
impolite thing.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.950
But the problem is,
everyone deals with money.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.310
In fact, we make 6 to 10 money
decisions every single day.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.570
And we will every day that
we're alive on this earth.

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.400
I actually go so far as to say
that financial planning should

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.901
be, literally should
be a civil right.

00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:04.650
Just like sort of
getting access to health

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:07.294
care, because if your
money's in complete disarray,

00:06:07.294 --> 00:06:08.710
you can't protect
your family, you

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.980
can't take care of
yourself, you can't

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.500
lead even a normal average life.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.620
And so, I'm actually
going on this tour.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.020
It's kind of crazy.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.610
I was in Denver this morning,
I was in Nashville yesterday,

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.840
Chicago the day before,
Indiana the day before that,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.360
and going back to New York.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.110
Shooting everything
from, tomorrow morning

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.010
we're on Good Morning America.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.210
We're supposed to be shooting
Piers Morgan tonight,

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.570
all the way to next week
Seattle, San Francisco,

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.526
Jacksonville, etc.

00:06:34.526 --> 00:06:36.150
Running around the
country, doing this.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.000
Going to high schools colleges,
churches, hospitals, companies.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.550
Literally giving
this money talk so

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.542
that everyone gets empowered.

00:06:43.542 --> 00:06:45.250
We call it "Financially
Fearless America"

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.330
because a really important
rule is, I've probably

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.200
talked to well
over 10,000 people,

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.140
and I've actually never met a
single person that has said,

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.820
I feel great about my money.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.291
It is just this topic of stress,
anxiety, eating cu-- none of us

00:06:59.291 --> 00:07:00.790
grew up with enough
money, trust me.

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.330
Even if you did, you know
someone who grew up with more.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.110
It's really this topic of
pretty deep stress and strain.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.340
You're not saving enough,
you don't make enough.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.640
Because it literally
is this topic

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.020
that you always are comparing.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:17.270
And the problem with that is, we
know mathematically, about 85%

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.870
of the audience
is too embarrassed

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.890
and too stressed out to actually
go and jump and make progress.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.050
And about 15% sort of
feels maybe ish confident.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.490
They're like, I think I'm
doing it, I think I'm doing it.

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.080
And what we find is
both a really bad,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.250
because you end up not actually
making progress on your money.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.710
Next.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:36.940
So some really important stats.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.510
Right now, 76% of the country,
and I gave a TED talk on this,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.580
feels out of control when
it comes to their money.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.562
And we describe
exactly what we found.

00:07:46.562 --> 00:07:48.770
It is like being in a boat
in the middle of the ocean

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:51.050
and you literally just don't
know which way is land.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:54.100
That may sound dramatic, but
it's actually pretty accurate.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.566
And the reason, what we
find, is the average person

00:07:56.566 --> 00:07:57.940
can spare a lit--
and by the way,

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:00.510
this is obviously not
above the average audience,

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.900
and you'll see some stats
about the more money you make,

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.660
how things actually can
get more complicated.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.524
But the takeaway here is, you're
in the middle of the ocean.

00:08:08.524 --> 00:08:11.190
And let's just say you can spare
a few thousand dollars a month.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.820
Which, let's just
say that that's

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.360
what this room can spare.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.170
You then have so
many priorities,

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.792
that you're not quite sure
which bucket to fill first.

00:08:18.792 --> 00:08:20.000
Do you pay down student debt?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.374
Do you pay down
credit card debt?

00:08:21.374 --> 00:08:23.000
Do you contribute to your 401K?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.690
There's a matching program here.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.040
Do you think about 529
plans for your kids?

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.850
Do you help your
aging parent, which,

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.690
that is a really big new
topic that our generation will

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.980
be faced with.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:34.500
Do you have emergency savings?

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.200
Do you contribute
to your mortgage?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.780
I mean, you quickly can see,
that you end up being like,

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.090
where does my next dollar go?

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.130
Like, how do I prioritize?

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:45.120
And the takeaway is, most
people feel pretty stressed out.

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.020
Next.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.570
So right now, 61%
of the country,

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.400
so just think about
the whole country,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.450
literally lives
paycheck to paycheck.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.060
Which means that they
are not in the position,

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.360
if anything happened, to be
able to go grab some cash

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.280
and do something.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.210
Most people have
less than one month

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.137
of savings of what
their life costs them.

00:09:04.137 --> 00:09:06.470
And what's really interesting,
especially for this room,

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:09.850
is 30% of people who
make over $100,000,

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.350
live paycheck to paycheck.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.971
So I say that because
we sort of intuitively

00:09:13.971 --> 00:09:16.220
think having more money means
that you have less money

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.250
problems.

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.830
But we all know
exactly what happens.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.250
You get the slightly
bigger home,

00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.920
with the nice
marble counter tops.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.360
And you drive the nicer car.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.374
And you go on the
slightly nicer vacations.

00:09:25.374 --> 00:09:26.790
So simply having
more doesn't mean

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.220
that you have any less problems.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.710
And I make that
point, because when

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.376
you think about your
own money, and when

00:09:31.376 --> 00:09:32.850
you think about
sort of the we all

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.380
do the comparison situation.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.680
Simply because someone
makes more money does not

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.596
mean that behind the scenes,
they're in a better situation.

00:09:40.596 --> 00:09:42.470
And I can tell you,
we've seen the bus driver

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.710
who makes $60,000, who owns
two homes, and has no debt.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.750
And we've seen the
Wall Street guy or gal

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.170
who makes $250,000 who has
$20,000 of credit card debt,

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.610
doesn't own anything.

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:56.600
And the takeaway there
is, what you make,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.410
and what you do with it are
very, very different things.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:01.630
Next.

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:04.260
So, I always go
through these excuses

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.750
and I say it just because I
have literally-- LearnVest

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.750
is massive.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:11.230
We have hundreds and hundreds
of thousands of users.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.710
Adding anywhere from
about 1000 to 5000 a day.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:17.510
People write in all the time,
and I read probably at least 50

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.750
to 100 emails every day.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.140
And I can't tell you
the number of people

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.536
who-- we hear the excuses.

00:10:23.536 --> 00:10:25.660
And it's things like, but
I don't have enough money

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.960
to care about my money.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.750
And actually, mathematically,
when you have less money,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.182
it is actually more
critical for you

00:10:32.182 --> 00:10:34.000
to know where your
next dollar should go.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.730
Which, my whole TED talk was
about how financial planning

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:38.415
should not be a luxury product.

00:10:38.415 --> 00:10:40.540
Right now, if you have well
over a million dollars,

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.070
there's a slew of places you
can go to get investment advice.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:46.870
But if you have less,
which 98.6% of the country

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:49.247
has less than a million
dollars, there's

00:10:49.247 --> 00:10:50.580
not a lot of great places to go.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:53.980
In fact, I would argue that
there was not a great place

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.870
to go, before LearnVest.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.302
So first, I don't
have enough money.

00:10:58.302 --> 00:10:59.520
I'm ashamed.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.280
I don't want to get started.

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.240
Last night, I was in Denver,
and a woman who was in her

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.340
'60s came up to me and was like,
I cannot tell you what I would

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.390
have given for someone to
tell me this when I was

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.860
in my '20s, '30s.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.430
Maybe even '40s, because it
could have changed so much.

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:16.110
She was just like here I
am, and I can't do a lot.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.610
So we always say like, the
problem's not going to go away,

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.740
you just have to solve it.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.730
And it's about
making that barrier

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.670
to solving it pretty low.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.190
We get a lot of, I don't even
know what a financial plan is.

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.320
Well, that's what I'm
going to walk through.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.540
That's what the
book walks through.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.748
And I'm gonna share some of
my favorite hacks for you

00:11:30.748 --> 00:11:33.750
guys today that are
absolutely worth your time.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.276
And then finally, we
see a lot-- again,

00:11:36.276 --> 00:11:37.900
a small portion of
people say I kind of

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.869
think I handle on things.

00:11:39.869 --> 00:11:41.660
And then we actually
look at their finances

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:43.450
and see that they're
no better off,

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:45.400
but they just sort of
think that they are.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:48.034
And so the takeaway is,
put those excuses aside.

00:11:48.034 --> 00:11:48.700
You already did.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:49.560
You came to this talk.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.410
But I like to say them out
loud, because they sort of run

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.640
through all of our heads.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.760
Next.

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.900
So, this is LearnVest.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.720
We literally as I just
said, raised $45 million

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:00.920
with the whole
goal of disrupting

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.810
the financial planning space.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:05.870
Let me talk about what
that means for a second.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.430
Right now, like that whole
offline, go see a planner,

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.720
print out your documents,
bring them to them.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.601
It is so anticrated.

00:12:11.601 --> 00:12:13.350
When you think about
the incredible things

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:16.380
that a company like Google has
done, or Apple's Genius Bar,

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:21.020
or even Weight Watchers, a
program for your weight loss.

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.649
For me, the financial
space is so old school.

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:26.690
Literally, banks are open
from like 9:00 to 5:00.

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:29.630
Actually the bank near me
closes on Saturdays its open

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.780
from 11:00 to 2:00.

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:31.640
I'm like wait, what?

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.080
It's Saturday.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.260
But it is this last space
that hasn't been completely

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.560
disrupted by incredible
technologies.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.540
And so all we did
was pretty simple.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.286
We built an incredible basic
way to filter any household

00:12:44.286 --> 00:12:45.910
to make sure that
they know what to do.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.530
And then we connect you
to an expert on our staff.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:50.200
And then we got
rid of all the BS.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:50.982
All the friction.

00:12:50.982 --> 00:12:52.440
I don't know where
to find someone.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.547
It's way too expensive.

00:12:53.547 --> 00:12:55.380
I don't know how to get
them my information.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.310
So the tips that came out,
that are in this book,

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.070
are from four years of being
a certified financial planner

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:02.110
myself.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:05.320
From talking to literally
thousands of customers.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.000
From tremendous
amounts of research.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.320
And I'm going to tell
you guys the one,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.550
because at the end
of the day, I'm

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.980
not that different than
you guys, in the sense

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.240
that none of us have extra time.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.240
We're all-- you know, you have
your job, you have your family,

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.470
you have your kids,
you have your health,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:16.880
you're juggling so much.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.710
So one of the big
things at LearnVest,

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.250
we only share things that
are worth your energy.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.160
Things are going to make a real
impact on your financial life.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:25.302
Next.

00:13:25.302 --> 00:13:27.760
So we developed this thing,
it's called the Action Program.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.350
It's literally a
seven step process.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:30.750
And it can take any one.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:31.716
Any household.

00:13:31.716 --> 00:13:33.090
One thing you guys
should know is

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:35.890
our users are between 25 and 65.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:38.430
Our core users are really
in their '30s and '40s,

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:39.804
and they're often households.

00:13:39.804 --> 00:13:41.470
You know, if you're
single, it's single.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.132
But if you're
married, it's both.

00:13:43.132 --> 00:13:44.590
And we put you
through this filter.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.010
What I'm going to
do today is walk you

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:47.130
all through the filter.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:48.680
So think about
your own situation.

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.430
Think about the tips
that really resonate.

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.480
Write down questions.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.580
And again, I'll answer
some broad ones at the end.

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:56.038
And then I can sit up here and
answer one on one questions.

00:13:56.038 --> 00:13:58.680
So, the first step is organize.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:01.357
I cannot tell you guys
the number of people,

00:14:01.357 --> 00:14:02.690
really well educated by the way.

00:14:02.690 --> 00:14:04.410
So I don't care if you went
to Harvard Business School

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:07.280
and work at Goldman Sachs,
you went to community college,

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.030
we don't learn about
this in school.

00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.210
I had two great educations.

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:12.240
Doesn't matter.

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.750
We don't learn about it in
high schools or colleges

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:14.541
across the country.

00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:17.800
I was actually just
at the White House

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.786
last Thursday with
Congresswomen trying

00:14:19.786 --> 00:14:21.160
to figure out how
we can actually

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:24.030
start changing some of
the rules around that.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.720
But the takeaway is,
regardless of your education,

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.310
regardless of what you make, we
see disorganization everywhere.

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.910
And here's what I mean by that.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.900
First of all, ideally, all
your accounts are online.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:37.760
I mean, even my husband who
went to Harvard with me,

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.370
he still had that
like one account

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.540
that doesn't have
anything online.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:43.007
And I was like,
what are you doing?

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:44.590
We've gotta like,
be able to see that.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:45.540
You've got to be able to log in.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:47.132
You can't wait for
paper statements.

00:14:47.132 --> 00:14:49.340
Or to have a bank it's
literally in a different state

00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.107
that you actually
can't go and see.

00:14:51.107 --> 00:14:52.690
So one of the things
that we recommend

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:55.600
are, and again, we don't
work with any banks directly.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.249
We don't promote any accounts.

00:14:58.249 --> 00:15:00.540
Everything that you do you
should be able to be online.

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:01.510
And I'll give you a quick sense.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:03.430
So, people come in all
the time and we end up

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:05.426
realizing that they
have like 14 accounts.

00:15:05.426 --> 00:15:07.300
When you have a household,
and you have kids,

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:09.510
it quickly can turn
into 20 accounts.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.540
And so we just say,
fewer is better.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:12.420
Plain and simple.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.990
You know, you're FDI insured
up to a huge amount of money.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:18.530
And so first, link them to
the LearnVest Money Center.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.000
It's our free tool.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.630
Great, great five
star ratings etc.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.540
If you go to the next slide.

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.500
Let me give you some
really specific things.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:30.590
So first, my accounts, I
actually have personally,

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:31.380
two credit cards.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:32.980
Now with my husband
I have a third.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:34.810
I have my Bank of
America account,

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.200
because I have ATMs
within three blocks of me

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.240
in both places, my
job, and my home.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:44.500
I have all my money over at
Fidelity, and my 401K is there.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.240
That's it.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:45.700
That's what we got.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.991
That's what we're working with.

00:15:46.991 --> 00:15:48.024
And it's really--

00:15:48.024 --> 00:15:48.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.390
ALEXA VON TOBEL: FDIC?

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:52.702
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
split their money

00:15:52.702 --> 00:15:54.660
between different accounts
so that none of them

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.670
was above the limit.

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:58.530
ALEXA VON TOBEL: If you have,
if you're with a partner,

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:01.840
you have up to $2 million
of FDIC insurance.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.550
And it's across four
types of accounts.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:08.070
So, I'm not in a position where
I have more than $2 million

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.860
of cash, so you're
ultimately protected.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:15.020
And then if it's in a brokerage
account, it SPIC insurance,

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.120
and that's even more.

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:19.390
So the takeaway there is, if
you are in a household that

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:21.320
has less than that,
it makes sense

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.770
to be able to put
your money there.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.759
For us, why I just
showed you how

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:28.050
we have our accounts set up,
is because everything then

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:29.260
goes into one email address.

00:16:29.260 --> 00:16:31.360
It's basically
Alexasbills@gmail.

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.142
I get all of our
statements in one place.

00:16:34.142 --> 00:16:35.850
If you looked in my
like Gmail right now,

00:16:35.850 --> 00:16:38.229
I have 23,000 unread
emails, because you

00:16:38.229 --> 00:16:39.770
know, all of the
alerts that you get.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:41.620
I get my news alerts
from everything.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.910
And what would find is,
bills, statements, alerts,

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:46.300
things I should probably
be seeing would get lost.

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.200
So what we say is, with your
household, link everything

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.040
up to a new, fresh,
clean account.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.340
Next with that, then
I run my finances

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:55.460
like I run my social life.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:57.380
I have my Google
Calendar set up.

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.316
And I have some really
specific alerts.

00:16:59.316 --> 00:17:00.940
They're outlined in
detail in the book.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.510
But the following: in
January, I contribute

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:06.194
to my IRA, and my 401K.

00:17:06.194 --> 00:17:08.069
You guys have matching,
so that's free money.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.450
You should take advantage
of every dollar that.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.490
If you can go above the $17,500
that you can put into a 401K

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:17.818
at work, then you want
to contribute to an IRA.

00:17:17.818 --> 00:17:20.109
We recommend that contribute
to an IRA at the beginning

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:23.240
of January because you get
a full extra year of tax

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.319
free earnings.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.869
And the takeaway there
is, either sit down

00:17:26.869 --> 00:17:29.570
and put in the
$5,500 that you can,

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:32.290
or set it so that it's
going to automatically do it

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:33.940
across the year.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.240
That's an alert on my
calendar in January.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:38.770
In January, I also go
to all my doctor visits.

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.390
I do them all in one month.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.820
And I'll share with you in
more detail a few reasons why.

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.460
But your health is
your biggest asset.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.376
And actually, you have
great health insurance,

00:17:46.376 --> 00:17:48.120
take advantage of it.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.510
In January I also sit
down with my husband.

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:53.017
And if you have a family,
what are we trying to do?

00:17:53.017 --> 00:17:54.350
What are our goals for the year?

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.940
What are we trying to save for?

00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.830
And really sit down
and map it out.

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:59.370
Where do we want
to be in one year?

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:00.300
Three years?

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:01.650
Then break it down into months.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.220
You can really get a sense
of what you should be saving.

00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:05.844
These are the beginning
pillars of what

00:18:05.844 --> 00:18:08.260
a financial plan looks like.

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.400
I also, every three months,
check my credit score.

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.890
And every year I check
my annual credit report.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.280
Just again, they're
on annual renews.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.000
They just alert.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.900
I get them on my phone.

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:18.066
It's pretty straightforward.

00:18:18.066 --> 00:18:19.280
I can't forget.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.780
But those are the
things that we do.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.160
You then have alerts for when
your credit cards are due.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.374
And I'll go into a
lot more detail what

00:18:25.374 --> 00:18:28.040
goes into your credit score, but
the takeaway is, missing a bill

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.520
is literally one of the
simplest things that

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.090
can hurt your credit
score so badly,

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.744
and it's just not worth it.

00:18:33.744 --> 00:18:35.660
And particularly the
bills that really mess up

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.590
are doctors visits.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:39.170
Because they're
mom and pop shops.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.080
They tend not to have
great online systems.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:41.580
Right?

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:44.000
You go to your dermatologist,
they send you a paper bill.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.320
We as young people
in this generation,

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.530
we move all the time.

00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.870
So if you don't do mail
forwarding, you miss a bill,

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.000
it's $86.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.626
They turn you over
the credit agencies.

00:18:52.626 --> 00:18:54.000
Those are the sort
of things that

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.480
happen that really affect
people's credit scores that

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.510
are simple.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:00.340
So what we say is, make sure
you have a uniform system

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.710
to track everything
all in one place.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.450
Next, as I said, set
up an email address

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.090
where everything comes in.

00:19:06.090 --> 00:19:08.420
The average person
doesn't check their bills.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.400
Why we say-- there's
Mint and then there's

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.159
LearnVest, and both of
us, you can see everything

00:19:13.159 --> 00:19:13.700
in one place.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:14.575
We have no ads in it.

00:19:14.575 --> 00:19:16.920
It's literally just your data.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:20.890
And one of the things that
I do pretty much every day,

00:19:20.890 --> 00:19:23.325
at least every few days, is
login, take a money minute,

00:19:23.325 --> 00:19:24.930
and just check what's going on.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.170
The reason I do that is, pretty
much every three months I

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:28.970
find an issue.

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:30.910
And I'll explain
what that means.

00:19:30.910 --> 00:19:33.300
Let's say I ate at a
restaurant for $100.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:35.770
I tip 20%, it was $120.

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:38.610
I will find, if I log
in, sometimes people

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:39.490
change your tips.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:40.301
It happened.

00:19:40.301 --> 00:19:42.300
I'd be like it was--
you're nodding, it happens.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.280
It's crazy.

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.200
But I was like, wait,
I didn't tip $40.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.260
And one of the things
is if you don't actually

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:50.547
have everything that's
online, accessible.

00:19:50.547 --> 00:19:52.130
Linked through a
place like LearnVest,

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.770
where you can see everything
in one place, where

00:19:53.770 --> 00:19:54.980
you can log in--
you know, if I go,

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:57.440
I can't tell you what I eat
for dinner seven nights ago.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.357
So if I go look
at a bill, I don't

00:19:59.357 --> 00:20:01.690
know if it's exactly right,
but I take the time to do it

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.360
and then I use credit cards
where I can dispute things.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.399
So one, I think it's
really important

00:20:06.399 --> 00:20:07.440
that everything's online.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.320
I think it's really important
all linked to one place.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.736
And I think it's
really important,

00:20:10.736 --> 00:20:13.180
one of the things we learned
is, well over more than half

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:15.440
the country doesn't
even open their bills.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.180
And game here plan number
one is open your bills.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:20.800
Have them come into
an email address.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.630
And then finally,
I log in once a day

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.260
so I can actually
see what's going on.

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.630
Next.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.820
Step two is focus.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.200
So this is a really
important step.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.660
And again, we built
this entire system

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:34.350
to put a household
through it, and it's

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.120
very thoughtfully
in a certain order.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.200
So first, we've gotta
get you organized,

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.699
we gotta know what
your numbers are,

00:20:38.699 --> 00:20:40.410
we gotta see exactly
what's happening.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.090
From there, we
have to figure out

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.690
what comes in every year or
every month, and what goes out.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:46.714
And let me explain.

00:20:46.714 --> 00:20:48.380
So I can't tell you
the number of people

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:50.480
that are like, I make $100,000.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.690
And I'll be like, you don't.

00:20:51.690 --> 00:20:53.090
You make $68,000.

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.466
Because you have to think of
your life in after tax dollars.

00:20:56.466 --> 00:20:58.090
And the reason why
we say that is, one,

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.600
it's really easy to over inflate
what your household income is.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.280
Like, you make $100,000, I make
$200,000, we make $300,000.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.070
But you have to think
about an after tax dollars.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.120
So first, look at
your paychecks.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.740
Quickly figure out,
multiply it by 26 or 27,

00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:14.922
based on the number
paychecks you get.

00:21:14.922 --> 00:21:15.880
That's the first thing.

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.370
What really comes in?

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:19.140
And for freelancers,
for people who

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.800
have extra money on the side,
it gets more complicated.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.140
Then, what goes out.

00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.290
So, plain and simple, you have
your obvious fixed expenses.

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:30.040
Your rent, those sort of things,
that are clear, you know them,

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.310
they're very regular.

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.310
But on the other stuff,
the restaurant and bars,

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:36.180
the travel, the shopping; that's
the stuff that people never

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.700
really have a good grasp on.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.180
And so one of the
things is one, do

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.030
you know that there's actually
money at the end of the month?

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.360
So, if you're not tracking it,
and again, 61% of the country

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.842
is living paycheck to paycheck.

00:21:47.842 --> 00:21:50.300
Which basically means they're
spending more than they make.

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.600
And so, again, good people with
good incomes, that happens.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.965
So what we look at is what
comes in, what's going out,

00:21:56.965 --> 00:21:58.340
and we help you
get a real sense.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.840
And you know, LearnVest has
great trends and analysis.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.410
And at the end, we
find out what is left.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.910
We then go through this is
really good negotiation process

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:09.860
with you where, let's just say,
your household makes $7,000

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.410
a month and at the end,
there's only $1,000 left.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.810
We figure out, is there
anything else we can do?

00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:16.460
And we have great
tips in the book.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.060
And our planners
literally work and tweak,

00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:21.500
and we find a way, how do
we get $1,000 to be $2,000?

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.400
Because we can get you towards
your goal so much faster.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.560
So we help you figure
out how to cut costs,

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.390
things you can turn
off, really great hacks.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:28.730
And basically, we
come up with what's

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:30.188
the number at the
end of the month?

00:22:30.188 --> 00:22:32.300
Let's just say it's $2,000.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:33.760
Next.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.490
So one thing is, you
go to your budget.

00:22:35.490 --> 00:22:39.100
This is a really important
financial planning principal.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.130
So I'm a CFP, just so you
guys all know what that means.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.060
It basically means you have to
go to school for about a year.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.060
Pass many tests.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.572
You then have to take a
two day, 10 hour exam.

00:22:49.572 --> 00:22:52.030
And honestly, it's the hardest
exam I've ever been through.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:53.920
It's only about a 30% pass rate.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.960
It's not only extremely
broad in the topics

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.570
it covers, but extremely deep.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:01.320
And this is one of
the best principles

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.630
that I learned in it.

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:04.127
So, I didn't make
it up, but it's

00:23:04.127 --> 00:23:06.460
one of the things that sort
of changed my life, in terms

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.740
of thinking about my money.

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:10.190
So let's just say, for
the sake of this example,

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:13.130
that my household makes
$10,000, after taxes.

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:14.419
That's what comes in.

00:23:14.419 --> 00:23:16.460
So when you think about
living within your means,

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.150
what that really
means, is 50% or less,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.630
should go to essentials.

00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:23.120
Essential is what this
actually essential to live.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.890
It's the roof over your
head, it's your groceries,

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.402
it's your utility bill, and
it's your transportation

00:23:28.402 --> 00:23:29.110
to and from work.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.770
So for you guys, you drive.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.410
So it's not just whatever
your car payment is.

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.870
Your auto insurance,
and your gas.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:37.630
So that's what's essential.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:39.920
Ideally that's 50% or less.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.400
One of the reasons is, if
you're a two person household,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.150
if someone lost their
job, you would still

00:23:44.150 --> 00:23:45.608
be able to maintain
your essentials

00:23:45.608 --> 00:23:47.450
without going into debt.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:53.210
A really important about that
50% is, of the 100, 30% or less

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.180
is your rent or mortgage.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.630
So this is the one that
people get wildly wrong.

00:23:57.630 --> 00:24:00.130
And I can't tell you the number
of people that will come in,

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:03.030
and their rent or their mortgage
is 60% of what they make.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:06.000
And we can see in
a 10 second window,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.080
that you're going to
have a pretty jeopardized

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.530
financial future, because
of that one decision.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:13.390
And I say that for
the following reason.

00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:16.361
20% is supposed to go
towards the future.

00:24:16.361 --> 00:24:17.610
And I'll walk you through why.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.570
But 20% of what you
take home every month

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:21.779
should go to if you have
debt, paying down your debt.

00:24:21.779 --> 00:24:23.278
If you don't have
debt, contributing

00:24:23.278 --> 00:24:24.100
to your retirement.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.016
If you are already maxing
out your retirement,

00:24:26.016 --> 00:24:28.350
your next savings goal,
whatever it may be.

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.580
Whether it's saving
for your kids 529 Plan,

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.880
helping with some dream,
some small project

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.380
you want to work on,
whatever it may be.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.534
And then, 30% is the fun stuff.

00:24:37.534 --> 00:24:38.700
That's the lifestyle budget.

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.520
That's the like do you
want to go shopping?

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.394
Do want to go travel?

00:24:41.394 --> 00:24:44.260
Do you want to have an
Equinox membership, etc.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.780
And one of the reasons why
people often will be like,

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.580
well my rent's 60%.

00:24:48.580 --> 00:24:50.384
And we're like, well
your 20%'s gone.

00:24:50.384 --> 00:24:51.800
And the truth is,
you can't really

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:55.010
live on your 30%
being anything--

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:58.490
we say-- people are like,
but I can make that 10%.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:59.867
Well here's the problem.

00:24:59.867 --> 00:25:01.950
Every time your phone
rings, literally every time,

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.100
someone's calling you to
ask you to spend money.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:05.570
They're calling, do you
want to go for margaritas?

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:06.370
Do you wanna go to the gym?

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.500
Do you wanna go to the game?

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.450
Do you wanna meet for yoga?

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:09.790
Do you wanna get a manicure?

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:11.984
Your parents need
something, doesn't matter.

00:25:11.984 --> 00:25:13.400
Every time someone's
calling you ,

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.700
they're asking you to do
something that requires money.

00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:18.910
And people just don't have the
willpower to always say no.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:21.290
That's also not a
fun life to live.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.380
And so what we find is,
if you are in a position

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:26.910
where your rent is more than
30% of what you take home,

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.630
you often end up
in a big mistake.

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:31.390
You're not saving
enough for the future.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:34.350
You're in a position where
you wildly have to underspend,

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.580
which is pretty difficult
for a lot of people.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:38.246
And so the takeaway
there is, my mentor,

00:25:38.246 --> 00:25:40.350
she's one of the early
founders of Goldman Sachs.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:42.500
And she's on the board of
Goldman Sachs, said to me

00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:45.480
early when we were building
LearnVest together, she goes,

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.090
Alexa, the number
one thing you can

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:49.130
do to always keep your
finances in shape,

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:50.590
is always spend
beneath your needs

00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:51.980
in your living environment.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:54.370
And so if it's rent,
that's pretty clear.

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:57.860
But for your mortgage, is
what we call PITY, principal

00:25:57.860 --> 00:25:59.981
and interest, taxes
and insurance,

00:25:59.981 --> 00:26:01.730
because those are the
four things that you

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:04.410
must have in order to be
able to afford that home.

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:07.340
So right now, if
you're way over 30%,

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.460
we don't recommend you
go sell your house.

00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.360
It's just, you need to be aware
that you're actually at risk.

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:14.746
So next.

00:26:14.746 --> 00:26:16.120
Really quickly,
on credit scores,

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.286
this is one of the ones
guys, that I can't tell you,

00:26:18.286 --> 00:26:21.390
I had like almost a full
hour of questions last night

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:21.890
about this.

00:26:21.890 --> 00:26:23.680
And it's pretty regular.

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.989
Here's the takeaway, your
credit score really matters.

00:26:25.989 --> 00:26:28.030
As extremely smart, talented
people in this room,

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:29.660
it is the only
grade that matters

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.400
after you leave the
education system.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.860
And here's why it matters.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:34.710
So over my life, in
the next 60 years,

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.750
I'm gonna buy probably
four or five homes.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.290
I'm probably also going
to like, get a nice car,

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.690
start another business,
whatever it may be.

00:26:41.690 --> 00:26:43.130
Every time I go
to borrow, they're

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:44.260
going to look at one number.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.385
They're going to be like,
what's your credit score?

00:26:46.385 --> 00:26:49.180
They'll look at your income too,
but that's basically the grade.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:53.060
From there, it's the difference
of 4% interest or 3% interest,

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:55.040
based on what it looks like.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:59.630
Over 40 or 50 years, that
could be more than $100,000,

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:02.120
$200,000, of saved
earnings in interest,

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.690
because my credit score is good.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.402
It's that simple.

00:27:04.402 --> 00:27:06.610
And again, this is literally
why I was in Washington.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.490
I was making it so that credit
scores, and giving college kids

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.170
credit cards,
should be outlawed.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.870
The average college senior
gets their credit score

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.550
on like, Freshman welcome day,
with a free piece of pizza.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:19.015
And they graduate with
$4,000 in credit card debt.

00:27:19.015 --> 00:27:20.390
And they're already
in a position

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:22.621
where they also have
$20,000 in student debt

00:27:22.621 --> 00:27:24.995
and they make less than that
in their first few years out

00:27:24.995 --> 00:27:25.662
of school.

00:27:25.662 --> 00:27:27.370
So as a result, it's
really hard for them

00:27:27.370 --> 00:27:28.890
to change that situation.

00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:31.040
So, credit score really matters.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.520
It ranges from 300 to 850.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.050
Everyone in this room, you
want it to be about 700.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.950
Ideally, it's above 760.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.190
That's considered excellent.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:40.461
That makes a big difference.

00:27:40.461 --> 00:27:41.710
And here are the three things.

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:43.630
Only look at the top three,
because the ones at the bottom

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:45.124
aren't even worth your time.

00:27:45.124 --> 00:27:46.290
Number one, payment history.

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:47.340
Never miss a bill.

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:50.630
Missing a bill knocks it about
60 points, even up to 100.

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:54.280
And it takes literally a year,
two years, three years to fix.

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.170
Something as simple as
an $86 dermatology bill.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.970
Number two, is your
credit utilization rate.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.630
So what's important
about this, and it

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.262
sounds like a complicated
concept, it's not.

00:28:04.262 --> 00:28:05.970
Let's just pretend I
had one credit card,

00:28:05.970 --> 00:28:08.220
and it was $10,000,
that was my limit.

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.420
So I have one credit card,
let's just say $10,000 limit.

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.140
If you're carrying no debt, you
don't have to care about this.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.390
If you're carrying zero
credit card debt at all times,

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:18.220
you always pay
your bills in full,

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.740
you're at 0% for that
credit utilization.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.680
You're in good shape.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.660
If you are carrying
debt, and let's say

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.350
that I'm carrying $5,000
of debt on that one credit

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:31.800
card, that $10,000 limit, I'm
utilizing my limit at 50%.

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.190
If it's above 50%,
red flags go off.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.940
So you first, want to get your
credit below 30% utilization.

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:39.970
Which means, across
all your credit cards,

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:42.320
you have to know what
your total limit is.

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.310
But Additionally, the
takeaway, the big thing

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:46.650
here is, just pay down your
debt as quickly as you can.

00:28:46.650 --> 00:28:50.150
That's the best way to improve
this, and it is a huge portion.

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:52.530
And then finally, your
length of history.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.070
So, the take away
here is, you want

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.403
to go to annual credit report
once a year, as I told you

00:28:56.403 --> 00:28:57.510
in the beginning.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.490
You want to print out
that credit report.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:00.990
And you wanna look
at all the things

00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.250
that are associated with
your social security number.

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.640
I promise you, you
will find mistakes.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:06.437
Most people do.

00:29:06.437 --> 00:29:08.020
And the takeaway is,
you want to know,

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.520
not only what's
associated with you,

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.370
so that you can dispute
anything that's not yours.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:13.884
But also, you may
find, you know,

00:29:13.884 --> 00:29:15.800
that silly Bloomingdale's
credit card that you

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.004
opened to save 15%,
blah, blah, blah.

00:29:18.004 --> 00:29:19.920
And the takeaway there
is, what you want to do

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.270
is, never close your
oldest credit card.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:25.810
And the reason being is, that's
your longest line of history.

00:29:25.810 --> 00:29:27.811
So that's what goes
into your credit score.

00:29:27.811 --> 00:29:28.560
It really matters.

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.150
And the takeaway is,
don't miss bills,

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.350
pay your debt down to zero, and
don't close your oldest credit

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.945
card.

00:29:32.945 --> 00:29:34.820
One important thing is
if you're sitting here

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.540
and you have seven credit cards,
don't go out and close all

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:38.720
them.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.800
You really can only
close one credit per year

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.690
because it affects
that utilization.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.280
What it does is,
it starts quickly

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.580
lowering your ability
for limit very quickly.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:49.520
And it can make or
your credit score dip.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:51.436
So don't do anything
major with your credit.

00:29:51.436 --> 00:29:53.810
Also, if you're going out and
borrowing in the next year,

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:56.459
or going back to grad school,
or anything like that, because

00:29:56.459 --> 00:29:57.500
it will dip a little bit.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:58.020
So.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:29:59.645
I love the site called
CreditKarma.com.

00:29:59.645 --> 00:30:00.527
I know the founders.

00:30:00.527 --> 00:30:01.360
They're good people.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.170
They have the same mission
that LearnVest does.

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:03.920
To empower people.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.410
And you can check your
credit score there for free.

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.410
Next.

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:10.202
After all of that's
done, you're organized,

00:30:10.202 --> 00:30:12.201
you know your numbers,
you know where you stand,

00:30:12.201 --> 00:30:14.290
you know your net worth,
then we go into Planning.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:16.510
So go back to, remember
I said my household,

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:18.203
let's just say at
the end of it, I

00:30:18.203 --> 00:30:20.600
have $2,000 of free
money every month.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.280
So we then make
that money, it has

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:23.990
to go essentially
to three things.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:26.600
This is three priorities
before anything else.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.030
First, paying down your debt.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:31.260
Second, is dealing
with your retirement

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.150
and making sure that
you're on track.

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:35.590
And we run this really
simple rule for you.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.600
We can take anyone in this
room, find out how old you are,

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:41.030
find out what lifestyle you
would like in retirement,

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:43.080
and look at your account and we
can tell you if you're on track

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:43.810
or not.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.350
And then finally, an
emergency savings account.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.150
So when you think about
financial planning,

00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.800
these are three
essential pillars

00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.360
that are critical to starting.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.610
And I can't tell you the
number of really smart people

00:30:53.610 --> 00:30:56.330
that start being like, I wanna
invest and I wanna buy a home.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.510
And we're like, you
can't do that until you

00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:00.390
make sure you've covered
these three things.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.310
So let's run through
them really fast.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:03.780
And guys I'm gonna go a
little faster because there's

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.060
a ton of good content in
here I wanna get through.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.300
So really quickly,
good debt, bad debt.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:09.820
All debt is not created equal.

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.680
Bad debt is credit card
debt, and it's car loans.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.360
The second you drive a car off
the lot, depreciating asset.

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.890
So, any debt that has
a depreciating asset,

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.190
is considered bad debt, and
it hurts your credit score,

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:21.630
and you want to get rid of it.

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:25.400
Good debt is things like
student debt and your mortgage.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.850
The asset in a house,
hopefully it goes up in value

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.580
and it's not considered
as negatively

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.800
against your credit score.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.575
And then student debt, and guys,
you know, the entire nation

00:31:33.575 --> 00:31:36.264
is under a trillion
dollars of student debt.

00:31:36.264 --> 00:31:38.680
So I can't tell you the number
of people who have come in.

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:39.680
My brothers are doctors.

00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.390
One's a surgeon.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:43.680
Hundreds of thousands of
dollars of student debt.

00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:46.180
The good thing there is, the
government has set up a system,

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:49.050
because our brain is the asset,
and they're investing in us,

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.439
so that we can actually
earn greater for the future.

00:31:51.439 --> 00:31:53.230
The one takeaway there
is, I can't tell you

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:54.470
the number of people
that come and say,

00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:55.950
I'm going to go to x school.

00:31:55.950 --> 00:31:59.150
I'm gonna pay $100,000 to get a
master's degree, and I'm like,

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.950
is it going to increase your
salary enough to pay it down?

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.370
So don't just collect
degrees for the sake of it.

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:06.740
If it can't increase your
salary, it's pretty tough.

00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:08.260
Next.

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.210
So, retirement.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:11.350
This is a really simple graph.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.740
I brilliantly came up with
it, it's so complicated.

00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.900
It's so simple.

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:16.300
You're 25 years old.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.290
I wanna retire at 65.

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:20.230
I live to 95.

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:24.280
So I work for 40 years
to fund 70 years.

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.620
Plain and simple.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.530
I only really work
for half the time

00:32:27.530 --> 00:32:29.190
that I will be funding myself.

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.610
So if you are not
putting away at least 20%

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:34.150
towards the future, you're
not going to be on track.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:34.886
It's that simple.

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:36.260
And I was literally
with the head

00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:38.840
of the treasury for
all Colorado yesterday.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.410
And we were talking about
the fact that, literally

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:42.850
quick history tip here.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:45.640
In the '70s, pretty much all
of our parents, a lot of them,

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:47.370
had pensions and
Social Security.

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:50.510
They literally, we, as a country
would fund your retirement.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:52.660
The problem is, great
science is happening.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:53.950
We're living much longer.

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.850
And companies started flailing
because growing populations,

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.270
they weren't able to keep up.

00:32:58.270 --> 00:33:00.210
So what happened is, we went
from a very paternalistic

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.810
government, where we were trying
to fund people in retirement,

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:06.250
and we shifted it to you and us
all funding our own retirement,

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.810
via the 401K.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:10.332
The big problem was, there
was no education about that.

00:33:10.332 --> 00:33:11.790
So they gave us
the responsibility,

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.540
but didn't make us really
understand the big impact.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.610
And the result is, most people
are off track for retirement.

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.660
And it's really tough,
because a lot of our parents

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:21.970
are not going to be on track.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:24.136
And so it means that we
will be funding our parents.

00:33:24.136 --> 00:33:26.770
And I'm telling you guys, I see
this from even affluent people.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:29.570
Where there just like, my mom's
living til she's 98 years old.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.170
And it's $100,00 to have care.

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:33.590
It's very expensive.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.449
And as a result, our money
could be filtering out.

00:33:36.449 --> 00:33:38.990
Which means, we're worse off,
and our children are worse off.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.090
And it's this huge
domino effect.

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:43.630
So the takeaway here
is, walk away from here,

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:44.850
increase your 401K.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:47.060
If your 401K maxed
out, which is awesome,

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.680
go contribute to an IRA.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.800
Next.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.670
Quick graph.

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:53.120
When I was Harvard undergrad,
I was like such a math dork,

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.050
that I like went to a money
presentation that I found.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:58.150
And here's the
really simple things.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.060
Compounding interest.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.330
It's not magic it's math.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:02.010
And Jessica starts
when she's 20.

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:04.640
She puts away the same
dollar amount as Kate.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.880
Literally at retirement,
simply putting the same dollars

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.810
but with a 20 year
difference, what happens

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.960
is, Jessica has over a quarter
of a million dollars more.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.585
So if you think about
the biggest hacks

00:34:15.585 --> 00:34:17.199
that you can possibly
come up with,

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:19.639
right now, before you have
a lot of responsibilities,

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:22.659
put away as much money as
possible into retirement.

00:34:22.659 --> 00:34:23.730
That's the takeaway.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:25.219
And one thing you
guys should know,

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:27.139
is we see a lot of
people in their late '30s

00:34:27.139 --> 00:34:29.190
early '40s with a few
kids, with mortgages,

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.800
thinking about
their kids college.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.550
And they never contributed
to their retirement.

00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:35.175
And it's really hard once you're
in that position, where you're

00:34:35.175 --> 00:34:37.397
running a full household,
to find extra money.

00:34:37.397 --> 00:34:39.480
So the takeaway is, you
want to contribute ideally

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:41.070
before you have kids.

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:43.860
And again, wish this was a
class, before you have kids.

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.620
Because once you do have a
family, it gets much harder.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.370
And this is a great
earning audience,

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.219
so you will always
be able to be maybe

00:34:51.219 --> 00:34:52.995
better off the average American.

00:34:52.995 --> 00:34:54.120
But it's still pretty hard.

00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:55.420
And so, I'm lazy.

00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.010
Start early.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.051
It does the work for you.

00:34:57.051 --> 00:34:58.690
Which is great.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:34:59.752
Step four, is Build.

00:34:59.752 --> 00:35:01.210
So then, after we
get through that.

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:02.850
We've made sure those
three things are on track

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:03.870
and have a game plan.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:05.930
In step four, this
is when you should

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:07.780
start to think about
the other things.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:09.530
Am I having children?

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:10.290
Do I like my home?

00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:11.581
Do we want to upgrade our home?

00:35:11.581 --> 00:35:13.870
Are we thinking about
starting a small business?

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:15.730
Are we thinking about
a vacation to Tahiti?

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.405
I love the customers that walk
in the door and their like,

00:35:18.405 --> 00:35:20.070
I truly wanna go on a trip.

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.030
And we're like, let's
first make sure that we

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:24.070
can cover you and protect you.

00:35:24.070 --> 00:35:26.060
So, then we start to
build towards the future.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.950
We have these really
great tracking devices.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:29.470
It's all through
the money center,

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.554
that you can set up goals.

00:35:30.554 --> 00:35:32.761
We show you how many months
you're going to be there,

00:35:32.761 --> 00:35:34.420
and we do it all
automatically for you.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.371
Step five is Protect.

00:35:36.371 --> 00:35:38.870
And I'm going to take an extra
few minutes on this one guys,

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:41.460
because this is one of
the most important things

00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.860
that you will learn that
I will say here today.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:48.950
So, my same mentor who was
a professor at Columbia

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:50.450
basically was like,
Alexa, what if I

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:52.657
could promise that you
will never go bankrupt.

00:35:52.657 --> 00:35:53.990
I'm like, that'd be pretty cool.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.760
Put me in coach.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.980
What do I have to do?

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:59.296
And the takeaway was,
be properly insured.

00:35:59.296 --> 00:36:00.670
LearnVest doesn't
sell insurance.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.910
In fact, I don't like people,
typically, who sell insurance.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:04.880
Because they get big
chunks of commission.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:07.220
And they typically tell you
probably more than you need.

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:10.930
But what is important about
this is, insurance is actually,

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:12.990
in the financial
planning exam, it's

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:14.700
step one of a financial plan.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:16.690
We made it step
five, because people

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:18.290
tend to be pretty daunted by it.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:20.167
And it's not a sexy topic.

00:36:20.167 --> 00:36:20.750
It is not fun.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.874
I actually joke that I
drank a whole bottle of wine

00:36:22.874 --> 00:36:25.840
while I was writing the
chapter on Protect Yourself.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.150
But it is so critical, you guys.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:30.670
And let me give you a
few important examples.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:35.580
So first, 62% of the country
that went bankrupt this year,

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.240
went bankrupt not because
they didn't have insurance,

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.195
because they were
improperly insured.

00:36:41.195 --> 00:36:43.320
Meaning, they didn't know
what they're riders said.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:46.530
They didn't know Hurricane
Sandy-- my husband's family had

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:49.040
a house in this place
called Breezy Point.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.420
Literally most people lost
almost everything they had.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:52.636
And it was because
they didn't know

00:36:52.636 --> 00:36:54.300
that they didn't
have flood insurance.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.600
And when it flooded, sorry.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.550
That's not covered.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:36:59.695
And it's literally
critical for you to know,

00:36:59.695 --> 00:37:01.930
what's not covered,
what is covered.

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.930
Am I in a place where, I
was in Denver yesterday

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:04.880
with tornadoes.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.170
Do you have tornado coverage?

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:07.110
You need it.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.570
If you're in California,
earthquake coverage.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.110
And the takeaway
here is, I'm going

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:14.840
to walk through all the
types but, insurance.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.140
One, it's not that
expensive, often.

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.900
But it is critical
that you layer it

00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:20.070
into your financial plan.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.580
And one thing for me, you
know, I built LearnVest,

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:24.390
not because I want
people to be rich,

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:26.510
but I want people to be
able to enrich their life.

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.740
And for me, what's invaluable,
is financial security.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.050
So that anything in
the world can happen,

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.800
and I don't have to
worry about the money.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.690
You can lose your job tomorrow,
and you have a game plan

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:35.700
to figure that out.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.890
Someone in your family can
get sick, and you're OK.

00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:39.640
And you guys are going
to be able to focus

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:41.880
on the person who's
sick, not all the money

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.510
implications of it.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:45.760
And when I promise you,
like life will happen.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:47.100
I share in the first
chapter of the book,

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.766
one of the reasons
I'm really passionate

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:50.580
about personal finance
is, when I was 14,

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.200
my dad unexpectedly passed away.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.950
My mom had three kids.

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:56.070
And she didn't even know
where our money was.

00:37:56.070 --> 00:37:58.300
So there, she was dealing
with a major life event,

00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.650
scrambling to figure out
what to do with our finances.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:03.049
And I think what's really
important is, in those moments,

00:38:03.049 --> 00:38:04.590
that's why you have
a financial plan.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:07.170
So you can look at
whoever's really suffering

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.830
and say, we're fine, we're
going to figure it out.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.800
So the takeaway on insurance,
if you go through quickly.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.150
Next slide.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.270
So you can't read it, but I can.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:18.250
You need homeowners,
and you need renters.

00:38:18.250 --> 00:38:21.301
I have an employee who actually
literally just started, got

00:38:21.301 --> 00:38:23.550
renters insurance, because
she's working at LearnVest,

00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:25.008
and everyone who
works at LearnVest

00:38:25.008 --> 00:38:26.380
has a full financial plan.

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.430
Her apartment was on
top of a pizza place

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:30.350
and the oven caught on fire,
and burned her entire apartment

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:30.900
down.

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:32.719
She lost 90% of what she owns.

00:38:32.719 --> 00:38:33.510
And she came to me.

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.176
She had like two weeks
out of the office

00:38:35.176 --> 00:38:36.340
to deal with the crisis.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:39.530
She came to me was like, because
of you, I get all new stuff.

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:40.440
All new.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:42.380
And renters insurance
is $20 month.

00:38:42.380 --> 00:38:43.852
And I mean, these
stories happen,

00:38:43.852 --> 00:38:45.060
and they happen all the time.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.660
And I get to hear about them,
because all the emails come in.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:48.430
But it's critical.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:51.870
So homeowners insurance, and
you need renters insurance.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.470
Disability, I'm pretty
positive that Google offers it.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:55.930
Opt in today.

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.950
You are 10 times more
likely to be disabled then

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:58.930
you are to die.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.465
And the takeaway there is,
if something bad happens,

00:39:01.465 --> 00:39:02.840
you want to make
sure that you're

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.150
getting not just Any
occupation, but Own occupation.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:07.140
That's the key.

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.730
That replaces whatever
salary you currently have.

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:11.960
If you have Any, so
let's say you work here,

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:13.700
and let's say you make $100,000.

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.609
And you have Any disability
insurance called Any.

00:39:16.609 --> 00:39:18.900
What it means is, if you can
go work at McDonald's, you

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:20.270
don't get $1.

00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.530
Because you get a $30,000
job at McDonald's.

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:25.660
So it's really important
that you know the difference.

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:26.864
Term, you need it.

00:39:26.864 --> 00:39:28.780
You need, if you're
married, if you have kids,

00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:30.110
you need life insurance.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:31.927
And again, our
experts from LearnVest

00:39:31.927 --> 00:39:33.510
will tell you the
exact dollar amount.

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:36.620
They will tell you exactly
what you really can afford,

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.167
and what you should
be protecting.

00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:39.750
If you have a lot
of assets, if you're

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:41.830
someone who has a
really nice home, who

00:39:41.830 --> 00:39:43.554
has money coming
from their family.

00:39:43.554 --> 00:39:44.970
You want maybe
umbrella insurance.

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:47.600
You want to further
protect your assets.

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.480
Long term care, this is
a pretty fascinating one.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.240
And because we are all living
longer, in your '30s and '40s,

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.482
you can buy long term
care pretty inexpensively.

00:39:55.482 --> 00:39:57.440
And it all depends on
what your medical history

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.690
is, and things like that.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:00.300
But like, my
grandmother, who I saw

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:03.450
last Sunday is 95 years old,
and she's like, kicking.

00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:05.240
She is like, icy as hell.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:07.230
And I'm like, oh my
god, she's going live

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:08.536
for like, 10 more years maybe.

00:40:08.536 --> 00:40:10.660
And the home she lives in
is like really expensive.

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:12.420
It's like $90,000 a year.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:15.157
And luckily, she was
able to afford that.

00:40:15.157 --> 00:40:17.490
But I wouldn't be able to pay
for that if that happened.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:19.198
And so one of the
things that's important

00:40:19.198 --> 00:40:22.010
is, this is an insurance that
may make sense in your '30s

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:23.724
and '40s to potentially get.

00:40:23.724 --> 00:40:25.640
And then we also walk
through these documents.

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.580
And I'll give you estate
planning documents,

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:28.979
as boring as they are.

00:40:28.979 --> 00:40:30.520
You can go to
LegalZoom, you actually

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.320
get a discount through
LearnVest at LegalZoom.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:32.903
Fill them out.

00:40:32.903 --> 00:40:33.762
Takes a few minutes.

00:40:33.762 --> 00:40:34.970
And I'll give you an example.

00:40:34.970 --> 00:40:37.430
If you have a child, and you
don't have a Guardian letter,

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:39.596
those are the sort of things
that we call red flags.

00:40:39.596 --> 00:40:41.770
And we would help you do first.

00:40:41.770 --> 00:40:43.220
Because money doesn't matter.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.640
But if, God forbid,
something happens to you

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:45.640
and you don't know
who's actually

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.480
become the legal
guardian of your child,

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:48.800
for me that's step one.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.320
And so that's the sort
of stuff that our program

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.060
takes into account.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.815
And what we do is we put
you through the filter,

00:40:52.815 --> 00:40:54.356
and we figure out
all the things that

00:40:54.356 --> 00:40:55.844
are critical that you must do.

00:40:55.844 --> 00:40:58.260
And then we start talking about
the things you want to do.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.430
Next.

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:01.380
And then finally,
step six is Maximize.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.734
And so, really smart people,
and I mean really smart people,

00:41:04.734 --> 00:41:07.150
come in the door of LearnVest
every day, and they're like,

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:08.380
I want to invest.

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.530
And we're like, yeah,
we'd love you to invest.

00:41:11.530 --> 00:41:13.060
But let's first
make sure that you

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.893
have those pillars in
place, and that you're

00:41:14.893 --> 00:41:16.350
protected from everything.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:18.890
And if at the end of that,
you still have extra money,

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.754
then here's what we ask you.

00:41:20.754 --> 00:41:22.170
So we'll look at
your 401Ks, we'll

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:24.270
make sure that you have the
appropriate asset allocation,

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:25.280
we'll make sure that
they're invested

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.750
in things that are inexpensive.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:29.820
I'm going to assume that
you have a great 401K here.

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.252
But outside of that.

00:41:31.252 --> 00:41:32.960
Let's say I have an
extra pocket of money

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.470
after getting through
all of those steps,

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:35.810
but my husband and I
are going to buy a house

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.780
in New York in the next
two or three years.

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.120
Money shouldn't be invested.

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.020
It should have zero
equity exposure.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.790
And so we put you
through a few things.

00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:43.940
One is the rule of five.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.900
Do you need the money
in the next five years?

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:49.540
If it's money to go on a trip,
to go start a small business.

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.506
Just literally,
you want to have it

00:41:51.506 --> 00:41:53.380
there because you're
having a baby in a year.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.200
We're like, no, no,
you can't invest it.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.450
So literally, rule of five.

00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:58.075
If you need it in
five years, it should

00:41:58.075 --> 00:42:00.240
have zero equity exposure.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.500
The other thing is quick--

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.430
AUDIENCE: What's
equity exposure?

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:04.670
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So literally
it's any set of stocks.

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:07.120
It's ETFs that have
like an S&amp;P 500,

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.820
it's anything where
the underlying

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:11.790
asset is portions of companies.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.462
What we would
recommend, potentially

00:42:13.462 --> 00:42:15.795
again, depending on who you
are and what your goals are,

00:42:15.795 --> 00:42:19.060
is things like CD
ladders or bonds.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:22.520
And long story short, another
important tip that maybe you'll

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:27.100
appreciate is, for
your 401K or your IRA,

00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.560
which are both just investment
accounts for retirement,

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.880
most people can't maximize.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.220
It's $23,000 a year
you can put away.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.720
You should be doing
that, before you

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.240
should be doing anything else.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.790
And what we look at is,
it's called the rule of 120.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.360
You take 120 and
you minus your age.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.730
So let's say I'm 30.

00:42:41.730 --> 00:42:42.850
120 minus 30.

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:45.410
90% should have equity
exposure, because that's

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:46.500
where all the risk is.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:50.200
And over the last century, the
average stock market return,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.320
the average over
a century is 10%.

00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.269
So that's great.

00:42:53.269 --> 00:42:54.810
And in fact, you
need to be investing

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:58.364
to outlive that inflation,
which is 3% a year.

00:42:58.364 --> 00:42:59.780
The takeaway here,
a lot of people

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.265
just quickly jump to conclusions
mat, and they're like,

00:43:02.265 --> 00:43:03.279
I should be investing.

00:43:03.279 --> 00:43:05.570
And the takeaway is, it's
really about these principles

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:09.260
to make sure that you're doing
it in the right thematic order.

00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.860
And then step
seven is literally,

00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:14.810
anytime your life
changes, we gotta

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:16.904
rerun every scenario for you.

00:43:16.904 --> 00:43:18.320
And one thing I
will tell you guys

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.295
is, if you're doing
anything major,

00:43:21.295 --> 00:43:23.470
if you're buying a home,
if you're having a child,

00:43:23.470 --> 00:43:27.070
if you're changing majorly
jobs, moving across coasts.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:30.040
If you're in a position where
someone in your family is sick.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.360
You're going to
major life event,

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.180
take the time to
talk to an expert.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.806
It is critical.

00:43:35.806 --> 00:43:37.680
You don't know all the
things you don't know.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.290
And it's not all Google-able.

00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:41.090
You can't go and find them.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.280
And the real big key here
is, before LearnVest existed,

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.000
it was thousands of dollars to
be able to talk to an expert.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.910
But one thing that
we really say is,

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.950
these big things that
you're going through, I just

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:53.450
talked about
insurance, the riders

00:43:53.450 --> 00:43:56.862
are like multiple, multiple
pages of fine print.

00:43:56.862 --> 00:43:57.570
You're no lawyer.

00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:59.530
Like you're not an
insurance expert.

00:43:59.530 --> 00:44:02.900
It's worthwhile to make sure
that God forbid, Hurricane

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:05.440
Sandy or an earthquake
happens, you're protected.

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.800
And you guys can
absolutely all afford

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.180
to be able to talk to an expert.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.130
And it's worthwhile.

00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:13.266
And I'll just say, as part of
just the LearnVest program,

00:44:13.266 --> 00:44:15.890
we actually worked with a bunch
of behavioral experts from MIT,

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:18.480
and some really serious
behavior scientists.

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.820
And figured out that a lot
of people learn this stuff,

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:24.114
and then it's overwhelming,
so they don't actually do it.

00:44:24.114 --> 00:44:26.280
So one of the things that
we're doing, it's January.

00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:30.490
90% of the country's financial
resolutions is do it.

00:44:30.490 --> 00:44:33.791
And when I wrote the book,
if you go to the next slide.

00:44:33.791 --> 00:44:36.290
So when I wrote the book, one
of the things that we did was,

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:38.820
we wanted to make not only
financial planning affordable,

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.800
but we wanted people
to actually do it.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.500
So just 10 seconds on
how our company works,

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.740
because you guys obviously
are so attached to the web.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.570
So it's literally
like a gym membership.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:51.147
You pay an up front fee, you
get connected to an expert,

00:44:51.147 --> 00:44:53.230
and then it's $19 a month,
and you can shut it off

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:54.510
at any time.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:56.340
If you go to the next slide.

00:44:56.340 --> 00:44:57.490
Here's what the process is.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.050
You fill out an online profile,
and this asks you everything.

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.890
Where are you today?

00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:01.952
Where do you want to go?

00:45:01.952 --> 00:45:03.410
What would you like
to have happen?

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.310
What does financial
security mean for you?

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:07.400
What are the risks that
keep you up at night?

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.770
And we actually go
and build everything.

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:10.270
Next.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:12.840
You get your own dedicated
financial planner

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.100
through LearnVest.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.350
These are people on our staff.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:18.100
They're CFPs, which
I just told, in order

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.990
to even be a CFP
you by nature have

00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:21.820
to have about four
years of experience.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.160
Most of ours have 10.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.150
But you get the same
dedicated expert,

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:26.830
and they're on demand for you.

00:45:26.830 --> 00:45:28.340
If you go to the next slide.

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.060
So this is literally what a
financial plan looks like.

00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:33.300
We built our own software
because the stuff

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.940
that was out there
was pretty bad.

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:37.620
What it does is
literally, and you

00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:39.869
can't see it necessarily
perfectly is, we literally

00:45:39.869 --> 00:45:40.660
build you a budget.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.010
Show you where every
single dollar should go.

00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:44.502
We even then build a calendar.

00:45:44.502 --> 00:45:46.210
And it shows you, so
go back to let's say

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:48.660
you have $2,000 at
the end of the month

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.395
that you can use
toward your goals.

00:45:50.395 --> 00:45:52.520
We break it down month by
month, where it should go

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.290
and what it should look like.

00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:56.000
And I think the
takeaway here is,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.800
this is what a financial
plan looks like.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:59.150
It is dollar per dollar.

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:00.840
And what I love about
financial planning

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.885
is, guys I come from
a family of doctors.

00:46:03.885 --> 00:46:05.510
You know, when it
comes to cancer like,

00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:07.801
it's really stressful because
we don't have the answer.

00:46:07.801 --> 00:46:10.380
Like, we're working in labs
trying to figure it out.

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.060
Financial planning,
and why I believe

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:13.390
with all my heart
and soul, literally

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:15.050
should be accessible to
everyone in the country is,

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:16.032
it's just math.

00:46:16.032 --> 00:46:17.740
It is not-- at the
end of the day, what's

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:19.830
complicated is the rules
and all the legislation.

00:46:19.830 --> 00:46:21.400
But if you know what
someone's dollar amount is,

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.950
you can put it through a
system and you can tell them

00:46:22.950 --> 00:46:24.594
exactly what they need to do.

00:46:24.594 --> 00:46:26.260
And so anyways, we
build you a calendar.

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.600
And then the final thing is, we
literally give you unlimited,

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.500
if you go to the next
slide, we give you

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.990
unlimited phone
and email support.

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:34.800
Your expert's on demand for you.

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.390
Put them on your speed dial.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:37.970
And you always get
the same person.

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:39.430
And so, this is
in a nutshell what

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.750
I've spent the last four
years of my life building.

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:44.210
If you go to the next slide.

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:46.320
Google got you guys
books, which is awesome.

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:48.982
In the book, everyone
gets a $50 credit

00:46:48.982 --> 00:46:50.690
if you want to work
with your own expert.

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:52.106
And if anyone wants
to get a plan,

00:46:52.106 --> 00:46:55.170
we just as a thank you
for having us here,

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:56.976
we'll give you an
extra month of service.

00:46:56.976 --> 00:46:58.600
But I'm going to
stand up here, and I'm

00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.961
going to answer any questions.

00:46:59.961 --> 00:47:01.960
And the one thing I will
say that's so important

00:47:01.960 --> 00:47:07.090
is, everyone can make progress.

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:09.569
I would gamble to say
that everyone in this room

00:47:09.569 --> 00:47:11.610
is in a pretty good
situation, where you actually

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:12.940
have extra money at
the end of the month

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:14.410
that you can put towards goals.

00:47:14.410 --> 00:47:17.330
So then it's a matter of making
sure that actually happens.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:18.210
But anyways.

00:47:18.210 --> 00:47:19.589
Most people are pretty stressed.

00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:21.130
Lots of people have
questions, so I'm

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:22.857
going to stay as late
as I possibly can,

00:47:22.857 --> 00:47:24.190
before I go to the other Google.

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:25.219
What's your question?

00:47:25.219 --> 00:47:25.760
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.567
My question is something you
said about credit reports.

00:47:28.567 --> 00:47:29.442
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.

00:47:29.442 --> 00:47:29.884
AUDIENCE: Credit rating.

00:47:29.884 --> 00:47:30.768
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.

00:47:30.768 --> 00:47:32.094
AUDIENCE: And, I
want to make sure I

00:47:32.094 --> 00:47:33.000
understood what you said, so--

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:33.630
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:35.213
AUDIENCE: You said,
credit utilization

00:47:35.213 --> 00:47:38.980
is based on a balance
held over a period.

00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:42.514
So it wouldn't be the amount a
person used and then paid off.

00:47:42.514 --> 00:47:44.430
That doesn't count towards
credit utilization?

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:45.220
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're
absolutely correct.

00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.870
So let's just say, I actually
have an American Express credit

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:48.370
card.

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.830
Also you guys should call and
actually increase your credit

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:53.610
limits if you are able,
if you have good credit.

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.520
So I have an American Express
card with a $50,000 limit.

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.390
If I go buy a car on
it, which by the way

00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:59.515
would give me great points.

00:47:59.515 --> 00:48:02.180
My whole life is 1% on
sale, which is awesome.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:04.680
And I pay it off in full
every month, no issue.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.560
But American Express doesn't
let you carry a balance anyways.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.680
But if you have three credit
cards, total limit of $10,000,

00:48:10.680 --> 00:48:13.390
and you're carrying $10,000
of debt month over month,

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:14.920
that's when you
are in big trouble.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:17.740
And the key there is, just pay
your credit card off in full.

00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:18.660
And for those--

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:21.140
AUDIENCE: Every credit
report I actually got,

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:24.805
ever, told me that
my revolving balance

00:48:24.805 --> 00:48:29.085
is negative [INAUDIBLE] let's
say $10,000 credit limit.

00:48:29.085 --> 00:48:29.960
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:32.600
AUDIENCE: My revolving
balance is like, $3,000,

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.730
but it's paid off every
month, the credit report still

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:39.184
said that's negative
on my credit report.

00:48:39.184 --> 00:48:41.100
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Because
you're spending-- but

00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:42.560
are you carrying
any of the debt?

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.260
AUDIENCE: No.

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:44.040
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
Month over month?

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.050
AUDIENCE: Nothing's
carried forward.

00:48:45.050 --> 00:48:46.750
ALEXA VON TOBEL: I think you may
have a misunderstanding there.

00:48:46.750 --> 00:48:48.770
Because if you pay it
off in full every month,

00:48:48.770 --> 00:48:50.370
you're good to go.

00:48:50.370 --> 00:48:51.510
So, that's the key.

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:53.496
And again, you can send
us your credit report,

00:48:53.496 --> 00:48:55.870
and we'll actually walk you
through it if you want us to.

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:56.572
Step by step.

00:48:56.572 --> 00:48:57.988
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
like, you're

00:48:57.988 --> 00:48:59.852
using too much of your credit.

00:48:59.852 --> 00:49:00.784
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:00.784 --> 00:49:02.030
AUDIENCE: Ask for more.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:02.420
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.586
What I would do is, if you
have a good credit score,

00:49:04.586 --> 00:49:05.400
first I'd call.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.140
One of the reasons why we tell
you to increase your credit

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.265
limit, is it boosts your
credit score a little bit.

00:49:09.265 --> 00:49:13.070
But also, if God forbid, like
shit totally hits the fan,

00:49:13.070 --> 00:49:15.010
you are in a position
where you can go out

00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:19.124
and access, God forbid something
really catastrophic happens.

00:49:19.124 --> 00:49:21.290
We would never want you to
use credit, but is there.

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:24.440
And so it's one of the
things, and for example,

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.770
also when you get really
sophisticated with your money,

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:28.019
I have a $50,000 credit limit.

00:49:28.019 --> 00:49:30.000
I could by a car, and
get points for it.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.430
Which actually means
it's like 1% to 2% off.

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.350
That's the sort of
stuff that like really

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:36.610
is sort of maximizing
your finances.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:37.110
Go ahead.

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:38.560
And-- Yeah.

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:39.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: If everybody
can come to the microphone.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:40.820
It's just better
for the recording.

00:49:40.820 --> 00:49:41.260
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Oh, perfect.

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:41.740
Sorry.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:42.600
Everyone come to the microphone.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:44.250
And guys, I love
these questions.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:45.380
I get them nonstop.

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:47.300
And there's really, like
there's no such thing

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.454
as a dumb question.

00:49:48.454 --> 00:49:50.370
AUDIENCE: My question,
you mentioned Mint.com,

00:49:50.370 --> 00:49:52.730
which I've been using,
and it's been helpful.

00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:54.140
But there are some bugs with it.

00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:54.430
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:55.960
AUDIENCE: Like certain
accounts don't work at all.

00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:58.210
And the biggest one for me
is our Google stock account

00:49:58.210 --> 00:49:59.347
doesn't work with it.

00:49:59.347 --> 00:50:01.680
So I'm just wondering if you
know if your software does,

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.150
and what the differences between
your software and Mint are?

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.900
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
So great question.

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.650
And I love you for asking that.

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:08.070
So first, our biggest--

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:09.630
AUDIENCE: Other reasons as well.

00:50:09.630 --> 00:50:10.900
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:12.390
The first biggest
difference, and I

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:14.150
think Mint is a great tool
that you can see everything

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.700
in one place.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:15.620
We don't recommend anything.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.050
In fact, what I don't
like what Mint does,

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:19.299
is they do make all these
recommendations of products.

00:50:19.299 --> 00:50:20.890
You opening extra
credit cards, not

00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:22.389
good for your
finances at it's core.

00:50:22.389 --> 00:50:24.820
Good for Mint, they'll get $150.

00:50:24.820 --> 00:50:27.180
But the other thing is, so
we run no ads through it.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.920
But the real key is,
if you're working

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.820
with one of our
experts, they can,

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:33.140
once you upgrade, and
work with a planner, boom.

00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:35.570
They can see your entire
account right there.

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:36.810
They can set goals for you.

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:38.290
They can set budgets for you.

00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:39.550
You don't have to
communicate anything.

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:41.610
You don't have to take the
time and energy to say,

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:42.590
here's all my paperwork.

00:50:42.590 --> 00:50:43.548
Here's what's going on.

00:50:43.548 --> 00:50:46.820
So the biggest real difference
is, the tool is free for us,

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:49.140
and it's just part of the app.

00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.250
It's working with a
planner that actually

00:50:51.250 --> 00:50:52.940
makes you change your finances.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:55.050
So, that's the
biggest difference.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:58.400
And for the Google stock, I
do not know the exact answer.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.970
We'll get back to you as
soon as I possibly can.

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:01.510
Go ahead.

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:04.370
I wish I had Google
stock, that'd be awesome.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:08.770
AUDIENCE: So beyond insurance
and financial investments,

00:51:08.770 --> 00:51:11.490
retirement savings,
is there anything

00:51:11.490 --> 00:51:17.335
you think most people don't
spend or consume enough?

00:51:17.335 --> 00:51:19.460
ALEXA VON TOBEL: I mean I
really can tell you this.

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.579
I don't care what
your household looks

00:51:21.579 --> 00:51:23.120
like, if you walk
in the door for us,

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.350
we find big blind spots.

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:27.610
Things that you
were like, whew, you

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:30.200
don't have like the right
level of auto insurance.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:30.960
That's not good.

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.619
You drive like,
seven times a day.

00:51:33.619 --> 00:51:35.660
So one of the things that
we find out, and again,

00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:36.267
like step one.

00:51:36.267 --> 00:51:36.850
Get organized.

00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:37.551
Have less.

00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:38.050
Follow it.

00:51:38.050 --> 00:51:38.640
Track it.

00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.640
I mean, you guys saw all
the crazy Target stuff.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.310
Neiman Marcus got broken into
today, their credit cards.

00:51:44.310 --> 00:51:45.140
Track it.

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.600
Because it behooves you-- sorry.

00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:49.200
It behooves you in
every single way.

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.440
So we get you organized.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.898
Then we make sure
that you actually

00:51:51.898 --> 00:51:53.370
know what you can spare.

00:51:53.370 --> 00:51:55.430
And a lot of people
don't spare as much

00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:58.515
as-- if you're making $10,000
a month, your household,

00:51:58.515 --> 00:52:00.551
we're like, save $3,000.

00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:01.050
Come on.

00:52:01.050 --> 00:52:02.280
Like, let's do it.

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.330
And then we can start
working towards your goals.

00:52:04.330 --> 00:52:07.216
And I think, to
answer your question,

00:52:07.216 --> 00:52:08.715
those goals include
things like, you

00:52:08.715 --> 00:52:10.740
need to be able to pay
premiums on insurance.

00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:14.080
Because that's actually step one
of protecting your household.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.320
So most people do not
have the right insurance.

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.495
They don have the right
legal documents in place.

00:52:18.495 --> 00:52:19.870
And it sounds
really complicated,

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.070
but what's great
about our experts,

00:52:21.070 --> 00:52:22.360
they just tell you to do.

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.160
They're like, shh.

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.150
Here's what you need.

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.110
We don't sell anything.

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:27.180
So we're totally
aligned with you.

00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:29.720
And then, go talk to these
three providers and go.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.655
Now you're armed in
a position to get it.

00:52:31.655 --> 00:52:33.030
So that's the
biggest thing, is I

00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:35.276
think most people
aren't saving enough,

00:52:35.276 --> 00:52:37.650
and then they just don't know
what their blind spots are,

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:38.450
necessarily.

00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:42.046
And they're often not paying
what they need to on insurance.

00:52:42.046 --> 00:52:43.020
Go ahead.

00:52:43.020 --> 00:52:44.830
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned not closing

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:46.180
you're oldest credit card.

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.055
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.

00:52:47.055 --> 00:52:48.369
AUDIENCE: Is that per provider?

00:52:48.369 --> 00:52:50.410
I'm in the position where
I just actually changed

00:52:50.410 --> 00:52:52.900
Bank of America cards to
a to a rewards version.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.370
If I close the old one and
start using the old one instead,

00:52:55.370 --> 00:52:57.230
is that going to
create a discontinuity?

00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.900
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Potentially.

00:52:57.900 --> 00:52:59.608
So one of the things
that you should know

00:52:59.608 --> 00:53:04.270
is, I had like a card when I was
16, 17, that my mom had opened.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.469
And I had like a
junior card on hers.

00:53:06.469 --> 00:53:08.010
First that wasn't
building my credit,

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:10.190
but that was my oldest
line of history.

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:12.540
I then have another
line of credit--

00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:15.390
I had my own credit card that
I opened when I was like 21.

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:17.160
So oldest credit card.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:19.550
I then said hey, I'd
like to change that card

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:21.840
to better card that would
suit my needs today.

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.570
And they were like,
if you close it,

00:53:23.570 --> 00:53:25.190
that ends that line of credit.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:27.180
And so the takeaway
there is, sometimes

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.160
it does make sense to
keep a credit card that's

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.100
not like your
favorite, because it

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:33.770
is you're oldest line of
credit, and to get another card.

00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:36.100
And so like I'll give you a
sense of some of the cards

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:36.790
that we like.

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:40.585
So one in general, free American
Express cards are great.

00:53:40.585 --> 00:53:41.960
You get points,
and they actually

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:43.290
make you pay them off
in full every month.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:44.120
So I like that.

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.100
You're not able to
carry debt there.

00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:49.350
Chase has a great
freedom rewards card

00:53:49.350 --> 00:53:51.610
for people who like, spend
a lot on groceries and gas.

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:54.030
So when you're outside
of New York City,

00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:55.730
and you're driving a ton.

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:56.300
Great.

00:53:56.300 --> 00:53:57.820
5% back.

00:53:57.820 --> 00:53:59.690
So I would say go
open another card

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.160
and use it and
just keep it open.

00:54:01.160 --> 00:54:02.368
Because there's not any risk.

00:54:02.368 --> 00:54:04.824
If you have just a few credit
cards and you monitor them.

00:54:04.824 --> 00:54:07.240
What I don't like are like,
they Ann Taylor cards, the Gap

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:07.890
cards.

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:10.180
All that BS, which actually,
it's a funny story.

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.500
Over the holidays, I was
buying a $17 shirt at the Gap,

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:14.790
like a work out t-shirt.

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:17.290
And they were like, would you
like to open a line of credit?

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:18.270
You'll save $4 today.

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:19.770
And I almost punched
the poor woman.

00:54:19.770 --> 00:54:22.061
I was like, you're talking
to the wrong girl right now.

00:54:22.061 --> 00:54:22.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:23.580
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
But the takeaway

00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.038
there is, those are the cards
that don't even have on-- you

00:54:26.038 --> 00:54:28.050
can't log into some of them.

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:32.060
The national average on a
credit card is 17% negative APR.

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:34.630
On those cards,
it's often like 30%.

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:36.650
So that compounds
daily, by the way.

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:39.000
The best savings account in
the country is 1% right now.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:39.976
So, they're horrible.

00:54:39.976 --> 00:54:42.350
So the takeaway, I would say,
leave your oldest one open,

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.150
and then go get another credit
card that you really like.

00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.555
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:54:44.555 --> 00:54:44.960
Thank You.

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:45.370
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:47.036
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
create a statement

00:54:47.036 --> 00:54:48.270
if your balance is not zero.

00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:50.548
So there's no statement
that shows that you paid.

00:54:50.548 --> 00:54:51.454
[INAUDIBLE].

00:54:51.454 --> 00:54:52.370
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:53.060
I mean.

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:53.630
It's nuts.

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:54.130
Go ahead.

00:54:54.130 --> 00:54:55.546
AUDIENCE: So I
have two questions.

00:54:55.546 --> 00:54:58.250
The first is, what about opening
checking and savings accounts?

00:54:58.250 --> 00:54:59.724
Do those affect
your credit score?

00:54:59.724 --> 00:55:00.890
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Not at all.

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:02.949
A checking account, a
debit card is not credit.

00:55:02.949 --> 00:55:04.990
So that's one thing that's
really important guys.

00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:07.574
Debit, credit, like
black and white.

00:55:07.574 --> 00:55:09.490
And then opening things
like savings accounts,

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:10.384
that's totally fine.

00:55:10.384 --> 00:55:11.800
One of things that
I don't like is

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.900
when you have a mutual fund
at this old brick and mortar

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:16.690
store that you like
aren't tracking,

00:55:16.690 --> 00:55:19.350
and don't even know if like--
one of the reasons why we like

00:55:19.350 --> 00:55:20.860
people to really
consolidate is, we

00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:22.825
need to look at-- so I'm
just going to make this up.

00:55:22.825 --> 00:55:24.306
Let's say I have
a million dollars,

00:55:24.306 --> 00:55:26.310
across like my cash
and my investments.

00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:28.510
We have to look at your
portfolio as a whole.

00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:31.276
Is everything properly allocated
based on what your goals are?

00:55:31.276 --> 00:55:32.900
And when you have a
little bit of money

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:34.358
there, a little
bit of money there,

00:55:34.358 --> 00:55:36.660
a little bit of money here,
you can't track it all.

00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.909
It's much harder to look
at it as the full picture.

00:55:38.909 --> 00:55:39.450
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:43.430
And so you recommended calling
our credit card companies

00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:45.580
and asking them to increase
your line of credit.

00:55:45.580 --> 00:55:47.330
So last time I did
that on my credit card,

00:55:47.330 --> 00:55:49.092
they asked me for a reason.

00:55:49.092 --> 00:55:51.300
What is the reason that you
recommended getting that.

00:55:51.300 --> 00:55:51.460
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:52.840
So, there's scripts
like this in the book,

00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.381
if you have credit card debt,
exactly how you can potentially

00:55:55.381 --> 00:55:56.160
negotiate it down.

00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.820
You may not always win.

00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:01.900
But you can say, I've just
been a really healthy customer.

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:03.750
As you can see, I
pay my debt in full,

00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:07.030
and I ultimately want to be
able to use this card more.

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.350
That's what they want to hear.

00:56:08.350 --> 00:56:09.650
That's how they make money.

00:56:09.650 --> 00:56:11.060
So you're like, I just want to
be able to use this card more.

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:12.471
It's my favorite credit card.

00:56:12.471 --> 00:56:13.987
Boom, you're done.

00:56:13.987 --> 00:56:14.820
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:16.403
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
They're like, please,

00:56:16.403 --> 00:56:19.539
thank you for spending
on my credit card.

00:56:19.539 --> 00:56:21.080
AUDIENCE: Are your
financial planners

00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.600
able to work with you if you
have accounts internationally,

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.350
in addition to US?

00:56:24.350 --> 00:56:26.480
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So,
it's pretty fun for us

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.550
how many people are
like can you help us.

00:56:28.550 --> 00:56:30.340
So, one of the
things, it depends

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.034
exactly what the situation is.

00:56:32.034 --> 00:56:34.450
And I can spend a lot more
time to like ask you in detail,

00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:37.660
but the takeaway is, if you have
accounts in other countries,

00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:39.130
we can help you
think that through.

00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:40.990
But if you were like
a Canadian citizen,

00:56:40.990 --> 00:56:44.399
and everything is there, and you
happen to just be living here,

00:56:44.399 --> 00:56:45.690
we're not going to be the best.

00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:47.180
Because you're
going to be dealing

00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:49.690
with like 401Ks in Canada that
are actually very different.

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:51.316
They're called like
RBSs, or something.

00:56:51.316 --> 00:56:53.273
But the takeaway is, if
you have a few accounts

00:56:53.273 --> 00:56:55.182
abroad, we can help
you think it through.

00:56:55.182 --> 00:56:57.390
But if you are living full
time in the United States,

00:56:57.390 --> 00:57:00.886
and like going to stay
here for a long time.

00:57:00.886 --> 00:57:03.135
And I want to go abroad as
quickly as we possibly can,

00:57:03.135 --> 00:57:06.510
I'm just dealing with customers
coming in every minute right

00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:07.331
now in the US.

00:57:07.331 --> 00:57:07.830
Go ahead.

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:08.380
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:10.296
I was wondering can you
make mortgage payments

00:57:10.296 --> 00:57:12.700
on like credit cards
and get points back?

00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.700
ALEXA VON TOBEL: That's
a really great question.

00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:15.750
So a few things.

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:17.100
It depends.

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.540
The most likely answer
is absolutely not.

00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.200
But one thing that
is really helpful

00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.440
is, if you want to
be in a position

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.770
where you are just
like hacking your life,

00:57:25.770 --> 00:57:27.870
you can make your mortgage
payments twice a month,

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:28.870
instead of once a month.

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:31.328
Where you make an extra payment
throughout the entire year.

00:57:31.328 --> 00:57:33.730
So instead of 12 payments
you can make 13 payments.

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:35.014
Is what it adds up to.

00:57:35.014 --> 00:57:37.180
And so that's one of the
best things we help you do.

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:39.180
Because also that
interest compounds daily.

00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:42.040
So what it not only does is
force you just to budget better

00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.480
and actually make an extra
payment, but over time,

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:45.820
we like, and it's in the book.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:47.986
We like, run a scenario for
you of like how much you

00:57:47.986 --> 00:57:50.230
can save on interest
simply just by doing that.

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:51.947
So that would be a smarter tip.

00:57:51.947 --> 00:57:52.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.720
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.

00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:57.700
AUDIENCE: So, one
thing that I think

00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:02.510
that when I've looked
at what CFPs can provide

00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:04.370
for me, or for
people in general,

00:58:04.370 --> 00:58:06.604
it's like a lot of
when you've got money

00:58:06.604 --> 00:58:08.520
that you need to put in
different pots, that's

00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:09.100
one thing.

00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:13.030
But like, if you have like
a question about should I

00:58:13.030 --> 00:58:15.070
become a landlord?

00:58:15.070 --> 00:58:16.872
That's a harder
question to answer,

00:58:16.872 --> 00:58:19.330
and I'm wondering how do you
deal with something like that?

00:58:19.330 --> 00:58:22.544
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So actually, I
mean that's like a pretty not--

00:58:22.544 --> 00:58:24.460
that's a pretty standard
question that we get.

00:58:24.460 --> 00:58:25.760
For a few reasons.

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:29.050
Actually, what's amazing
about the financial system

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:31.300
in the United States is,
once you get really organized

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.674
and start getting
pretty healthy,

00:58:32.674 --> 00:58:34.440
there's so much awesome
stuff you can do.

00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:36.624
So then we're like,
second properties,

00:58:36.624 --> 00:58:39.040
where you can become a landlord,
and all the tax benefits.

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:41.651
And there's like tax shelters
that are really complex,

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:43.900
but if you are in a position
where you can potentially

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.310
become a landlord,
we could show you

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:46.768
exactly what the
benefits would be.

00:58:46.768 --> 00:58:48.750
So that's a pretty standard
question, actually.

00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:50.960
We have a lot of customers
who are landlords, or who

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:53.680
have rental properties, that
have been beneficial tax

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:54.742
benefits.

00:58:54.742 --> 00:58:56.200
And then, if you
have kids, there's

00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:58.584
so much cool stuff
that you can do.

00:58:58.584 --> 00:59:00.000
I'll give you a
10 second example.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.400
Your parents can actually tax
free, pay for their educations.

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:05.630
Move money to your
children's accounts.

00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:07.280
You can overfund
your first 529 plan

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.300
so that your second
kids are going

00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:09.599
to be better taken care of.

00:59:09.599 --> 00:59:11.890
I mean, there's so much stuff
once you're in a position

00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:12.940
where you have extra money.

00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:14.648
So in fact, I should
have said, you know,

00:59:14.648 --> 00:59:17.510
our average customer's household
individual incomes are actually

00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:19.950
above $75,000 to $100,000,
and household incomes

00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:21.940
are in the $200,000
to $300,000 range.

00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:26.070
Those customers come in, and
we can do so much for them.

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:27.690
But we also sign
up 23-year-olds who

00:59:27.690 --> 00:59:29.230
are like, I'm just
getting started.

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:31.164
And we're like,
yes, get started.

00:59:31.164 --> 00:59:32.580
Because then you'll
be in position

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:34.455
to be able to have more
money for the future.

00:59:34.455 --> 00:59:35.956
So when you have
healthier finances,

00:59:35.956 --> 00:59:37.288
there's so much more you can do.

00:59:37.288 --> 00:59:38.950
And yes, we answer
that question a lot.

00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:39.658
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:59:39.658 --> 00:59:41.340
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.

00:59:41.340 --> 00:59:42.610
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:45.610
One is the, one of the
frustrating things about,

00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:49.190
about online-- about
the packages that

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:53.130
pull your online accounts
is that there's always

00:59:53.130 --> 00:59:56.262
this account where you can't
really pull the information.

00:59:56.262 --> 00:59:57.720
So do you have some
kind of system?

00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.970
I just put it into a
spreadsheet and upload it, or?

00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:00.420
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:00.920
Even better.

01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:02.520
We just let you add
a manual account

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.255
so you can add
any-- first of all,

01:00:04.255 --> 01:00:06.750
you can link to LearnVest
literally everything.

01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:11.287
Debt, student debt, mortgages,
credit cards, small businesses.

01:00:11.287 --> 01:00:13.370
You could actually link
your entire small business

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:14.890
into LearnVest and have
your own small business

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:16.700
if you're a small
business owner.

01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:19.690
You can add assets
like jewelry, cars,

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:22.190
literally like solid assets.

01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:23.750
You can add things
like annuities.

01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:24.950
You can pull those through.

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:26.408
And then, if anything
doesn't link,

01:00:26.408 --> 01:00:28.180
so some people
have credit unions.

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.300
And they're like these
tiny little very like--

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.675
and one of the things is,
we'll look at your credit union

01:00:32.675 --> 01:00:34.510
and be like, is it
worth you keeping it?

01:00:34.510 --> 01:00:36.019
Are the benefits so strong?

01:00:36.019 --> 01:00:38.310
And if you can't link it,
you can add a manual account.

01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:40.180
And your planner just
helps you do that.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.210
But also, the planner helps
you evaluate whether or not

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:43.390
you should keep those accounts.

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:44.765
AUDIENCE: And the
second question

01:00:44.765 --> 01:00:45.950
has to do with privacy.

01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:50.391
I mean, if I join, I'm going to
like, everything is open to you

01:00:50.391 --> 01:00:50.890
guys.

01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:51.720
How do you deal with that?

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.678
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So, 10
seconds on that answer.

01:00:53.678 --> 01:00:55.595
So number one, it's
actually just a mirror in.

01:00:55.595 --> 01:00:57.178
I think you guys as
like technologists

01:00:57.178 --> 01:00:58.060
will appreciate this.

01:00:58.060 --> 01:00:59.540
You can't move a dollar.

01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:02.110
It is a mirror into what's
happening with your finances.

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:04.860
So first, there's
no account numbers,

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:08.920
it's just a window into what's
happening with the money.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.480
So you can't accidentally
have it hacked and move money,

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.429
you're not at risk.

01:01:13.429 --> 01:01:15.470
There's no account numbers
or anything like that.

01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:17.344
Second, were a registered
investment adviser.

01:01:17.344 --> 01:01:18.760
We report to the SEC.

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.240
So, we go through
compliance both technical,

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.490
literally running all of
our technical compliance,

01:01:24.490 --> 01:01:28.850
but also internal compliance,
every literal month.

01:01:28.850 --> 01:01:31.760
But the takeaway here is,
deeply safe and secure.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.180
Also just one of our
very recent investments

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:37.912
was places like American
Express Ventures invested,

01:01:37.912 --> 01:01:39.370
because American
Express eventually

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:41.030
is going start offering
LearnVest with their credit

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.890
cards.

01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:43.820
As a bene-- not a benefit
that they pay for,

01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:47.190
but as a way to help improve
their customer's well being.

01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:50.080
So we have to go through
all their technical scrutiny

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:50.700
as well.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:51.890
So, yes, yes, yes.

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:52.723
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.060
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.827
I recently reread "The
Millionaires Next Door".

01:02:00.827 --> 01:02:01.660
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.160
AUDIENCE: And one of the
things that they mentioned--

01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.451
ALEXA VON TOBEL: I loved those.

01:02:04.451 --> 01:02:08.280
AUDIENCE: Is that people who are
wealthier or good accumulators

01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:10.660
of wealth actually
spend about eight hours

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:15.220
a month managing their money.

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:16.780
Do you have like
a recommendation

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.060
for how much time we
should be spending a month,

01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:22.990
and also, do you see
that prolong over time,

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:24.915
or once you have like,
hopefully, you know,

01:02:24.915 --> 01:02:27.290
I would love to get the point
where everything is set up.

01:02:27.290 --> 01:02:28.206
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

01:02:28.206 --> 01:02:30.165
AUDIENCE: Like do you
see that time decreasing?

01:02:30.165 --> 01:02:31.080
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:31.890
So a few things.

01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:34.020
What I just described
for you, And again,

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:37.490
like I could have sat here for
five more hours, to be honest,

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:38.970
was a system.

01:02:38.970 --> 01:02:43.050
The program that we built is a
system, that literally hacks.

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:45.960
You saw, as I was
describing it, like we

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:49.100
make you do the 50,
20,30, because that 20%

01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.830
should be going into
your retirement,

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:52.450
and we should get
that automated.

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:54.360
So what we create
is a foundation

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.580
that runs a system
that automates it,

01:02:56.580 --> 01:02:57.590
so that it runs through.

01:02:57.590 --> 01:02:59.370
I also then told
you about habits.

01:02:59.370 --> 01:03:01.230
And actually, the last
chapter of the book

01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:03.280
is about protecting
yourself from yourself.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.570
Because we all have
pretty bad habits.

01:03:05.570 --> 01:03:08.190
We actually asked our users to
confess, and on Good Morning

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:11.340
America tomorrow I'm
sharing some confessions

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:13.390
from some of their users.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:16.230
Good Morning America
had them call in.

01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:18.550
So one, we teach you
really good habits.

01:03:18.550 --> 01:03:19.590
I log in, as I said.

01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:21.720
To my LearnVest account
once a day, for a minute,

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:23.820
just to see and track
and see what's going on.

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:25.100
But I do spend.

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.060
January, I sit down
and we go through

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:29.242
and really make sure we
have a complete plan.

01:03:29.242 --> 01:03:31.200
And guys, it's like
anything else in your life.

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:33.340
If you have a plan,
you will do more.

01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:36.460
If your goals are set, which we
actually write your goals down

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:39.050
in the LearnVest platform,
so they're there.

01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:41.060
And then you can expert
that checks in with you.

01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:42.550
And then you get
awesome benefits

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:44.216
that are like little
surprises, once you

01:03:44.216 --> 01:03:45.960
start achieving them from us.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.965
And the takeaway there
is, writing things down,

01:03:47.965 --> 01:03:49.340
having some hold
you accountable.

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.705
That's how you end up
really making progress.

01:03:51.705 --> 01:03:53.830
And so it's not eight-- I
think eight hours a month

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.480
is a lot, to be honest.

01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:58.684
As an expert who like is a
total geek for this stuff,

01:03:58.684 --> 01:04:00.100
I don't spend eight
hours a month.

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:02.350
But some months, maybe
I will spend eight.

01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:03.480
Some months I spend 12.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.516
I mean it depends
one, what's going on.

01:04:05.516 --> 01:04:07.140
And then, just so
you guys know, if you

01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:09.348
want me to sign your books,
I'm going to sit up here,

01:04:09.348 --> 01:04:10.970
so we'll go through any of that.

01:04:10.970 --> 01:04:12.220
Did you have another question?

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:13.150
AUDIENCE: OK, yes.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:14.560
What do you think
of Lending Club

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:18.144
as a vehicle for investment?

01:04:18.144 --> 01:04:19.060
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.420
I just think that if
you're in a position where

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.640
you have like an extra
million sitting around,

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.610
then I would be like,
maybe something like that

01:04:27.610 --> 01:04:28.460
could make sense.

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.052
But the truth is,
of all the things

01:04:30.052 --> 01:04:31.510
you could be doing
with your money,

01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:35.110
I would put that as probably
lower on the priority list.

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:37.060
They of course, are
like-- they actually

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:40.140
were shut down by the
SEC for a full year.

01:04:40.140 --> 01:04:42.330
Yeah, they had a
bunch of problems.

01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:44.780
And I'm not saying that
they're like risky today,

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:49.000
but what I am saying is,
I think that it's probably

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.720
not your highest priority.

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.070
I think there's
probably safer things

01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:55.617
to be doing with your money.

01:04:55.617 --> 01:04:56.200
AUDIENCE: Hey.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:57.783
So, I'm curious what
your thoughts are

01:04:57.783 --> 01:04:59.382
on paying your
mortgage down early,

01:04:59.382 --> 01:05:01.340
versus taking that money
and kind of putting it

01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:01.820
somewhere else.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:03.260
Because obviously with
your mortgage payment,

01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.426
you have interest deductions,
all these other things

01:05:05.426 --> 01:05:06.244
like tie into it.

01:05:06.244 --> 01:05:07.160
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:10.050
So again, what we
would do is, literally

01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:12.350
run what's going on in your
life through the system.

01:05:12.350 --> 01:05:13.850
And you can actually
see, it's based

01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:15.641
on what's going on with
your interest rate.

01:05:15.641 --> 01:05:17.620
What other things that
are-- interest rates

01:05:17.620 --> 01:05:19.030
that your juggling.

01:05:19.030 --> 01:05:21.000
And potentially,
the answer is yes.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.349
Potentially the answer
may be, you know what?

01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:25.390
That extra cash is going
to be much better served

01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:26.900
doing this next
goal that you have,

01:05:26.900 --> 01:05:28.566
because that mortgage
isn't bad for you.

01:05:28.566 --> 01:05:30.989
So it really depends on who
you are, where you're going.

01:05:30.989 --> 01:05:33.530
Do you want to sell your house
in this period of time or not,

01:05:33.530 --> 01:05:34.100
etc.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:34.940
So.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.800
Great question but the answer
there is, run a financial plan,

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.165
and it tells you perfectly.

01:05:40.165 --> 01:05:40.790
AUDIENCE: Cool.

01:05:40.790 --> 01:05:41.260
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Go ahead.

01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.420
AUDIENCE: So, I understand
that financial planners

01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:44.860
don't sell us anything right?

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:48.510
But do they make specific
product recommendations?

01:05:48.510 --> 01:05:53.180
So let's say I need life
insurance, or investments,

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:54.140
mutual funds.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.560
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So literally,
our financial planners

01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.992
are all full time
on staff for us.

01:05:56.992 --> 01:05:57.950
They're salaried by us.

01:05:57.950 --> 01:06:01.250
Their bonus is only based on
customer satisfaction, customer

01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:02.390
results, period.

01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:04.140
And efficiency of
getting back to you.

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:04.810
That's it.

01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:06.810
So that's how they
get compensated.

01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:08.810
Let's just say that you
come in and you're like,

01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:09.830
I need life insurance.

01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:11.385
Just, let's use
that as an example.

01:06:11.385 --> 01:06:11.760
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.885
ALEXA VON TOBEL: We would
go through and figure out

01:06:13.885 --> 01:06:15.480
what is actually best for you.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:18.106
Hey, you do need
a million of term.

01:06:18.106 --> 01:06:19.230
That's what you can afford.

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:21.720
That's the best thing
that we can do for you.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.490
We don't sell it.

01:06:22.490 --> 01:06:24.490
We will then make a
recommendation that

01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:27.280
looks like this,
we like MassMutual

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.690
for this specific
product that you need.

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:33.527
And we also like Guardian,
and we also like Prudential.

01:06:33.527 --> 01:06:35.360
And then will help you
go and look at those,

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.526
and then you can get quotes.

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:39.250
Or we'll connect you to an
agent who can then get quotes.

01:06:39.250 --> 01:06:41.930
We will not get a single
dollar in that recommendation.

01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:42.930
Zero.

01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:45.740
It's one of our pillars
of our company's policy

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:47.740
of being trusted and
unbiased for our customers.

01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.240
AUDIENCE: Right but
I still may need

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.874
to go to an agent who would
get a commission on it.

01:06:52.874 --> 01:06:54.540
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You
will go to an agent

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:56.331
and they still will
get a commission on it.

01:06:56.331 --> 01:06:56.980
That's correct.

01:06:56.980 --> 01:06:58.890
But the takeaway there is
you won't be in a position

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:01.690
where you go to that agent, and
end up getting too much, or too

01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:02.960
little because you
don't trust them,

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.690
and you don't know what
you're supposed to be doing.

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:06.320
And one of the things that
we're in the middle of piloting

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:09.040
is actually us doing it
for you, and you paying us

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.540
a simple fee of like $100,
and we'll go get it for you.

01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:14.680
But we are just
piloting that right now.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.873
So that we'd just say,
let us do it for you.

01:07:16.873 --> 01:07:17.414
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:07:17.414 --> 01:07:17.806
Thank you.

01:07:17.806 --> 01:07:19.139
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.

01:07:19.139 --> 01:07:19.820
Go ahead.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:19.970
Hi.

01:07:19.970 --> 01:07:20.920
AUDIENCE: I just had--

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.360
ALEXA VON TOBEL: And by the
way, thanks guys for, I mean,

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.230
this stuff everyone
really needs help.

01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:26.244
And so, I'm always
never surprised

01:07:26.244 --> 01:07:27.660
by how many questions
people have.

01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:28.530
Go ahead.

01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:31.310
AUDIENCE: Do have any
recourse if you go to a CFP

01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:33.350
and you get bad advice?

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:36.150
Like factually incorrect
things, or they

01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:38.485
advise you to do something
and it turns out not to work?

01:07:38.485 --> 01:07:39.360
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So--

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:41.370
AUDIENCE: I'm not talking
about like telling the future

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:43.245
with like stock market
or anything like that.

01:07:43.245 --> 01:07:43.890
I mean.

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:44.806
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

01:07:44.806 --> 01:07:47.510
I mean, so first, I'd would be
like, were they actually a CFP?

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:48.990
So let me just give
you an example.

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:51.540
I worked at Morgan Stanley.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:53.685
A lot of times, they
just have people

01:07:53.685 --> 01:07:54.810
who are just well educated.

01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:57.640
They're actually only licensed
by like a series seven,

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.741
and they like, will give advice,
but they're actually just

01:08:00.741 --> 01:08:02.490
managing investments,
if that makes sense.

01:08:02.490 --> 01:08:04.281
So like, a lot of people
go and get advice,

01:08:04.281 --> 01:08:06.200
and they'll just manage
your investments.

01:08:06.200 --> 01:08:08.640
But none of that other
stuff, which is actually

01:08:08.640 --> 01:08:10.260
step one for what
you should be doing.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.900
So the takeaway there is,
I would first be like,

01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:15.490
were they even an
expert to begin with.

01:08:15.490 --> 01:08:17.529
If they work for a
reputable company that

01:08:17.529 --> 01:08:20.330
reports to the SEC,
you can complain.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:23.180
And you can write a complaint
that then goes on their record.

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:25.819
We personally will
never hire anyone

01:08:25.819 --> 01:08:27.046
with even a single complaint.

01:08:27.046 --> 01:08:27.545
Done.

01:08:27.545 --> 01:08:28.189
Get outta here.

01:08:28.189 --> 01:08:29.260
We're not hiring you.

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.180
So I think that's
the sort of stuff.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:33.359
So the answer is,
the recourse is

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:37.010
that you can file a
complaint on their record.

01:08:37.010 --> 01:08:38.720
But, I would then,
a lot of people

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:41.057
get advice from people
that are not experts.

01:08:41.057 --> 01:08:42.390
Because it's really complicated.

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:43.960
Like, you don't even know
who really an expert is.

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:46.340
So that's why we say, we
really believe in the CFP.

01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:48.430
There are 69,000 in the
country, and I'm even

01:08:48.430 --> 01:08:50.870
on one of their boards.

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:53.521
That's like how deep
we are with the CFP.

01:08:53.521 --> 01:08:54.062
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:08:54.062 --> 01:08:54.849
Thanks.

01:08:54.849 --> 01:08:56.140
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Good question.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:56.640
Go ahead.

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:00.850
AUDIENCE: You described
your automated system that

01:09:00.850 --> 01:09:03.141
tells you should do this,
and this, and this, and that.

01:09:03.141 --> 01:09:05.270
And I've found
with other systems

01:09:05.270 --> 01:09:07.450
that they are often
very inflexible.

01:09:07.450 --> 01:09:11.818
Like, they would make
assumptions like, oh, customers

01:09:11.818 --> 01:09:13.609
should not have to deal
with single stocks.

01:09:13.609 --> 01:09:15.189
They should always
use mutual funds.

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:20.250
Or customers are generally not
able to control themselves.

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:21.420
How much they spend.

01:09:21.420 --> 01:09:24.040
So we assume they always over
spend, or something like that.

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:26.840
And so I find these
systems fairly useless,

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.745
because they don't adjust
to my own personal habits.

01:09:29.745 --> 01:09:30.620
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:31.069
So, a few things.

01:09:31.069 --> 01:09:32.170
AUDIENCE: How's your
system handling that?

01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:32.569
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
So actually, what's

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:35.029
really cool about our system,
and this is like super dorky,

01:09:35.029 --> 01:09:36.237
but just to give you a sense.

01:09:36.237 --> 01:09:38.710
There's actually behind the
system, is 44 standards.

01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:40.180
They're literally
the 44 standards

01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.479
of every single person's life.

01:09:42.479 --> 01:09:44.210
It's not in the book actually.

01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:46.750
We took it out because it
like overwhelmed people.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.370
But there's actually a grid.

01:09:48.370 --> 01:09:50.840
And it literally, for
each step, there's

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:53.640
basically 15 things
that are critical.

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:55.760
And when you get a
plan, we actually

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:59.150
will circle what's urgent,
so that you are aware of,

01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:00.010
here are the things.

01:10:00.010 --> 01:10:02.060
But that's when you then get
on the phone with your expert,

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:03.550
and when we're
delivering a plan.

01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:05.493
And so it happens
in the sign up flow,

01:10:05.493 --> 01:10:07.243
when you're actually
filling out the form.

01:10:07.243 --> 01:10:08.620
But then also, on
the first call,

01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.900
we call it the listening call.

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.150
Where you say,
here are the things

01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:12.510
that I like that I want to do.

01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:16.490
We'll then tell you, hey,
maybe you want single stocks.

01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:18.190
We don't like them
for these reasons.

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:18.870
You now know.

01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:21.080
But if that's what you
want to do, we'll help you.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.270
But we'll tell you
it's like really

01:10:22.270 --> 01:10:23.480
damaging for your finances.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:25.813
You know, some people walk
in and they're like, I really

01:10:25.813 --> 01:10:27.580
like to bury money my backyard.

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:30.740
And we're like, I
get that you love

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.970
that, we don't recommend that.

01:10:32.970 --> 01:10:35.020
And so, there's a little
bit of like a process.

01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:37.459
But you get to weigh in
on what you care about.

01:10:37.459 --> 01:10:39.000
And also, we help
you ultimately work

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.730
on what you want to work on.

01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:43.100
But if there's something
that is really critical,

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.300
we're like you are at risk.

01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:47.030
And then, you can
either do it or not.

01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:48.460
We strongly recommend you do it.

01:10:48.460 --> 01:10:50.340
We try to hold you accountable.

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:54.030
But at the end of the day,
we don't force you to do it.

01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:56.520
AUDIENCE: So once I tell my
adviser on the phone that I

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.020
really--

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.120
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So it's
a very flexible schedule.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:58.690
So the takeaway--

01:10:58.690 --> 01:11:00.314
AUDIENCE: So that I
really want to bury

01:11:00.314 --> 01:11:02.180
my money in the
backyard, is your system

01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:03.375
able to deal with that?

01:11:03.375 --> 01:11:04.250
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yes.

01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:06.870
The takeaway is, the
system literally, is built.

01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:08.916
There's 44 standards,
and they can move around

01:11:08.916 --> 01:11:10.290
based on what the
customer wants.

01:11:10.290 --> 01:11:11.410
There's also a few
filters where it's

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:13.118
like, this customer's
really overwhelmed.

01:11:13.118 --> 01:11:15.020
So let's give him slower goals.

01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:16.390
This customer's a champ.

01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:18.460
I walk in, I'm like, let's
go tell me everything.

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:19.210
I want to know it.

01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:20.150
I want to see it.

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:22.990
But it depends on,
and you can decide.

01:11:22.990 --> 01:11:25.810
So you actually, it's very
much built around who you are.

01:11:25.810 --> 01:11:27.351
And that's actually
one of the things

01:11:27.351 --> 01:11:29.270
that's a requirement
of LearnVest.

01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:31.380
You have to know your
customer to a law.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:32.840
You have to know your customer.

01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.160
How they want to act.

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.100
What they care about.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:37.705
And that form you
fill out, is actually,

01:11:37.705 --> 01:11:40.180
it's not just like us being
like, we'd love to know.

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.350
We actually legally need
to know what you care about

01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:43.516
and how you want to operate.

01:11:43.516 --> 01:11:44.430
So.

01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.830
AUDIENCE: A different question
that just came to my mind.

01:11:46.830 --> 01:11:48.746
There was the previous
question about privacy,

01:11:48.746 --> 01:11:51.590
and you said you don't
have any account numbers

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:52.920
and stuff, right?

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:55.230
But you do link
into our account so

01:11:55.230 --> 01:11:57.890
that we can see our
balance in your system.

01:11:57.890 --> 01:12:00.530
ALEXA VON TOBEL: But it doesn't
pull your account number.

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:02.900
AUDIENCE: So how do you
get my information if you

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:05.170
don't-- without having
all my bank information?

01:12:05.170 --> 01:12:06.250
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So
it's as simple as this.

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:07.916
Let's just say you're
linking your bank.

01:12:07.916 --> 01:12:09.730
You literally, to
link it, all you do

01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:11.880
and it takes less
than about 45 seconds.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:15.160
You go, Fidelity, my
username, my password, boom.

01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.390
And it pulls in just
the information.

01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:18.080
The data.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.990
It's not pulling in your account
number, your routing number.

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:21.844
It's not pulling in all
of that information.

01:12:21.844 --> 01:12:23.510
But we can see at the
transaction level,

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.770
so you can see--

01:12:23.770 --> 01:12:25.820
AUDIENCE: But you would have
my username and my password.

01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.100
ALEXA VON TOBEL: We have your
username and your password.

01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.180
But we don't store your
username and password.

01:12:29.180 --> 01:12:30.220
It's just like Mint.

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:31.450
It's just like Quicken Books.

01:12:31.450 --> 01:12:32.240
It's just like--

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.370
AUDIENCE: I don't
know these products.

01:12:33.370 --> 01:12:34.286
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

01:12:34.286 --> 01:12:36.828
AUDIENCE: But don't you update
that information all the time?

01:12:36.828 --> 01:12:38.452
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
Every time you log in.

01:12:38.452 --> 01:12:39.280
It just pulls it.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.100
AUDIENCE: But then I have to
type in my other passwords

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:42.895
all the time?

01:12:42.895 --> 01:12:43.230
ALEXA VON TOBEL: No.

01:12:43.230 --> 01:12:44.650
Once they're linked
their linked.

01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:45.630
And that connection's there.

01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:47.960
And every time you log in,
we refresh the latest data

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:50.332
from the last 30 day--
the last 90 days.

01:12:50.332 --> 01:12:51.290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]--

01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:53.581
ALEXA VON TOBEL: And if you
had an account for like, me

01:12:53.581 --> 01:12:55.620
from the beginning, we
store all your trends

01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:56.580
from literally day one.

01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.960
And you can see it all.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.010
It's really amazing actually.

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:02.110
I, living in New York,
restaurant and bars,

01:13:02.110 --> 01:13:03.450
I'm like, I live at my company.

01:13:03.450 --> 01:13:03.950
Right?

01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:07.815
Like I literally like can't
cook, because I'm just working.

01:13:07.815 --> 01:13:09.356
And so it was like,
I never knew what

01:13:09.356 --> 01:13:10.530
I was spending on
restaurant and bars.

01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:12.350
And quickly it was
like, oh my goodness.

01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:15.330
I can see exactly, and it's
much worse than I thought.

01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:17.060
So we can pull those
trends and analysis.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.080
But when you log
in, you don't have

01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.057
to re insert your
username and password.

01:13:20.057 --> 01:13:21.390
It's one time and then it pulls.

01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:21.750
OK.

01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:22.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:23.050
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.

01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:23.960
Go ahead.

01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:24.890
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:27.077
I am getting married this
year and I was wondering--

01:13:27.077 --> 01:13:28.160
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Congrats.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:28.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:29.630
ALEXA VON TOBEL: I
got married this year.

01:13:29.630 --> 01:13:29.920
AUDIENCE: Huh?

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:31.160
ALEXA VON TOBEL: I
got married in 2013

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:31.740
AUDIENCE: Oh good.

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:32.240
Yes.

01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:34.380
So I was wondering,
if I sign up for this,

01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:37.570
and then my fiance also
signs up, can we merge?

01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:39.070
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
It's per household.

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:39.830
It's just you guys.

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:40.190
Both of you.

01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:40.420
One account.

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:41.570
AUDIENCE: So we can go--

01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:42.945
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
My husband and I

01:13:42.945 --> 01:13:45.010
have a plan, even though
I'm the CEO and a CFP

01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:45.900
and wrote this book.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.400
We have a second set of eyes
looking at what we're doing.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.970
AUDIENCE: Even if our bank
accounts aren't joined yet?

01:13:50.970 --> 01:13:51.310
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

01:13:51.310 --> 01:13:52.020
Totally fine.

01:13:52.020 --> 01:13:53.090
AUDIENCE: We can sign up
under the same account?

01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:53.660
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.

01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:53.860
It's your household.

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:55.440
AUDIENCE: And you guys would
work with us as far as--

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:56.700
ALEXA VON TOBEL: You can
both get on the phone.

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.140
Sometimes my husband
doesn't get on the phone

01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.370
because he has to miss it.

01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:01.029
I get on it, he can get on it.

01:14:01.029 --> 01:14:03.070
And actually, to be honest,
I've been giving it--

01:14:03.070 --> 01:14:05.290
so we like literally
see it gifted as a baby

01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:06.936
gift, a wedding gift.

01:14:06.936 --> 01:14:08.560
We see kids giving
it to their parents,

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.893
parents giving it to their kids.

01:14:09.893 --> 01:14:12.820
Last night people bought like
10 plans for their friends.

01:14:12.820 --> 01:14:15.374
I mean, it's really amazing
how often it's gifted.

01:14:15.374 --> 01:14:17.790
But particularly for a wedding,
it's such a critical time.

01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:20.080
Like you're dealing
with all that stuff.

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.541
Our experts are experts at that.

01:14:22.541 --> 01:14:24.040
And so you both--
and it's one-- you

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.623
don't have to buy
two plans, just one.

01:14:25.623 --> 01:14:26.950
And also, if your life changes.

01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:29.170
Let's say tomorrow, you're
like, we're having a baby!

01:14:29.170 --> 01:14:30.970
We don't make you re-buy a plan.

01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:32.610
We just rerun your information.

01:14:32.610 --> 01:14:34.820
And be like, hey you now
have a different goal.

01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.110
And so that's why it's
like a gym membership.

01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:37.930
You pay the up front
fee, it's $19 a month,

01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:39.506
it's always the same expert.

01:14:39.506 --> 01:14:40.300
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:14:40.300 --> 01:14:41.216
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Cool.

01:14:43.710 --> 01:14:44.980
Do you have another question?

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:45.480
Wow.

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:46.460
Awesome guys.

01:14:46.460 --> 01:14:48.150
And guys, keep me
honest Annie for when

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:49.890
I know I have to go
to the other Google.

01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:53.911
And guys, page 11 is your
dedicated promo code.

01:14:53.911 --> 01:14:54.410
Use it.

01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:57.890
And if you guys get a plan,
I'm just going to say,

01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:00.700
Annie's email address
is a-n-n-i-e@LearnVest.

01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.856
If you buy a plan today,
and just shoot us a note,

01:15:02.856 --> 01:15:04.730
we'll get you an extra
free month of service.

01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:07.740
So another free month of $19.

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:09.211
That's just a
benefit for you guys.

01:15:09.211 --> 01:15:11.710
AUDIENCE: One of the biggest
parts of any financial planning

01:15:11.710 --> 01:15:13.250
is taxes.

01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:14.170
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.

01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:17.050
Income tax planning is actually
six pillars of-- the CFP

01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:18.159
is six pillars.

01:15:18.159 --> 01:15:20.700
Income tax planning, insurance
planning, investment planning,

01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:23.900
retirement planning, general
principles, and then,

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:25.150
what did I miss?

01:15:25.150 --> 01:15:26.120
Estate planning.

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.800
Estate planning was biatch.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:32.960
So, our experts are
experts in all six.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.020
AUDIENCE: So we just
learned this, actually.

01:15:35.020 --> 01:15:38.570
The advisors actually give
like tax planning advice and--

01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:40.660
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So as
part of-- so, so, let me

01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:41.520
give you an example.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.936
If you have like,
over $5 million,

01:15:42.936 --> 01:15:44.830
and you're in a
position where like,

01:15:44.830 --> 01:15:47.494
you have pretty complex
income tax planning,

01:15:47.494 --> 01:15:48.910
we would actually
go and recommend

01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:51.880
that you do that with
an income tax expert.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.371
However, most people.

01:15:53.371 --> 01:15:54.870
Your income tax
planning is actually

01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:56.470
just the basics of
financial planning.

01:15:56.470 --> 01:15:57.260
And so yes.

01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:59.810
You do get basic income
tax planning advice.

01:15:59.810 --> 01:16:02.470
But if you're someone who's
like, owns five properties,

01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:04.340
like, we're like,
you've complexity

01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:06.010
that is beyond a normal plan.

01:16:06.010 --> 01:16:07.120
Let's go get that.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:10.720
Estate planning was actually
the pillar called protect.

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:13.990
So we include that in insurance
and estate, is pillar five.

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:17.000
And we do give basic
estate planning advice.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.220
Because that's things
like, simple things guys

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:21.540
like TOD and P-- stuff
that you wouldn't even

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:22.481
know to know about.

01:16:22.481 --> 01:16:24.230
It's really basic
things that you can just

01:16:24.230 --> 01:16:27.140
do on your account, wherever it
may be, to protect, God forbid,

01:16:27.140 --> 01:16:27.970
anything happens.

01:16:27.970 --> 01:16:29.345
AUDIENCE: So that
includes things

01:16:29.345 --> 01:16:31.300
like setting up trusts and--

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:33.740
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So if you're
setting up a basic trust,

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:36.156
that's the type of thing our
expert can talk to you about.

01:16:36.156 --> 01:16:38.830
If you're setting up
some very complex trust,

01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:41.937
depending on again, and one of
the takeaways that we say is,

01:16:41.937 --> 01:16:43.895
we have customers who
have millions of dollars,

01:16:43.895 --> 01:16:46.370
and that we can give really
great advice to and service.

01:16:46.370 --> 01:16:49.600
But we would look at how complex
you are, what's going on.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.210
And if it's something that
if you're in that situation,

01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:54.010
and it's so beyond,
we would say,

01:16:54.010 --> 01:16:56.910
here's an estate planner that
we really like, that we trust,

01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:57.793
work with them.

01:16:57.793 --> 01:16:58.660
AUDIENCE: I see.

01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:59.160
OK.

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.350
Thank you.

01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:02.580
ALEXA VON TOBEL:
Any other questions?

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:03.260
Go for it.

01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:05.385
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have a
follow up to his question.

01:17:05.385 --> 01:17:08.370
Now, in your answer
it sounded like you're

01:17:08.370 --> 01:17:10.150
giving advice for income tax.

01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:12.384
You're giving advice
for estate planning.

01:17:12.384 --> 01:17:14.800
But you're not actually doing
the estate planning with me,

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:15.300
do you?

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:17.759
I mean I'd still need to get
the forms from somewhere else,

01:17:17.759 --> 01:17:20.008
and still need to fill them
out myself, and still need

01:17:20.008 --> 01:17:20.930
to file them myself.

01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:22.490
ALEXA VON TOBEL: So here's,
I'll give you an example.

01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:24.140
So first, the
income tax planning

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.010
is actually part of
actually making a plan.

01:17:26.010 --> 01:17:29.260
So I'll give you an example.

01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:31.744
When I recommend a Roth
IRA versus a regular IRA,

01:17:31.744 --> 01:17:33.910
that's actually a little
bit of income tax planning.

01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:35.440
Because based on which
one you should get,

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:37.106
is based on what your
income is and what

01:17:37.106 --> 01:17:38.150
your tax bracket will be.

01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:39.974
So that's part of the plan.

01:17:39.974 --> 01:17:40.640
Just in general.

01:17:40.640 --> 01:17:43.830
Income tax planning is sort
of a pillar of all planning.

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:46.810
If you're in a position
where it's like,

01:17:46.810 --> 01:17:49.780
you're making $1.5
million and we could maybe

01:17:49.780 --> 01:17:52.650
help shepherd some of that
so you could afford taxes

01:17:52.650 --> 01:17:54.400
in like a thoughtful
planning way.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.330
That's like, high level
income tax planning.

01:17:56.330 --> 01:18:00.120
So just in general, income tax
planning is part of every plan.

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.159
And then for things
like documents.

01:18:02.159 --> 01:18:03.950
So we actually get a
discount at LegalZoom.

01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:06.646
We like them a lot, because
they make it really affordable.

01:18:06.646 --> 01:18:08.270
A lot of people go
get wills and end up

01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:09.750
spending $1,000 to do it.

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:12.420
And we're like, you can get just
as good of a will doing this.

01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:14.336
But we'll show you exactly
which one you need,

01:18:14.336 --> 01:18:15.890
exactly how to fill it out.

01:18:15.890 --> 01:18:18.100
And then one thing that
confidentially we're

01:18:18.100 --> 01:18:20.820
rolling out is as part of
getting a plan with us,

01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:22.830
were also starting
to offer classes.

01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:24.850
So detailed, step by step.

01:18:24.850 --> 01:18:26.880
If you're like, how
do I fill out my will?

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:30.450
Literally, here's exactly,
those sort of things.

01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:32.120
How do I deal with
getting a mortgage?

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.320
Or refinancing my mortgage?

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:33.989
Step by step.

01:18:33.989 --> 01:18:35.530
That's the sort of
content that we're

01:18:35.530 --> 01:18:38.113
creating so you can just like,
attend a quick 30 minute class,

01:18:38.113 --> 01:18:39.460
or download a webinar.

01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:40.980
We show you exactly
how to do it.

01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:43.770
AUDIENCE: And come tax season,
right now basically, I still

01:18:43.770 --> 01:18:45.990
need to get my own CPA
or do you have to--

01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.906
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.

01:18:46.906 --> 01:18:48.969
We do not do your taxes.

01:18:48.969 --> 01:18:51.510
But we help you prepare for what
you need to do, and tell you

01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:52.190
what you need to do.

01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:53.530
But we don't actually
file them for you.

01:18:53.530 --> 01:18:54.071
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:18:54.071 --> 01:18:54.670
Thank you.

01:18:54.670 --> 01:18:57.490
ALEXA VON TOBEL: Just separate
types of financial planning.

01:18:57.490 --> 01:18:58.580
Any other questions?

01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:59.400
OK.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:00.430
Great.

01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:03.372
So Annie, a-n-n-i-e, if
anyone wants to get a plan,

01:19:03.372 --> 01:19:05.080
we'll give you an
extra month of service.

01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:07.413
If anyone wants me to sign a
book while I'm walking out,

01:19:07.413 --> 01:19:08.390
I'm happy to do that.

01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:12.289
