00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:15.879
Over the last century and a half or so, humans,
as a group, have grown significantly taller,

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.150
with men from western, industrialized countries
today being on average between 3 and 7 inches

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.090
(7-18 cm) taller than their counterparts in
the mid-19th century.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.700
So why have humans gotten taller?

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.550
There is very strong evidence that this simply
comes down to nutrition and the body’s ability

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.210
to fully benefit from said nutrition via not
getting certain diseases that hinder the absorption

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.460
of consumed nutrients.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.769
That the environment is drastically more important
than other factors, such as microevolution,

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.889
is strongly indicated via looking at human
height during times of relative comfort compared

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:53.300
with times of strife.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.809
For example, examination of skeletons over
human history has shown that, while there

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.190
have been peaks and valleys of average height
across different cultures at different times,

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.010
from the Stone Age through the beginning of
the 19th century there has been little significant

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.750
difference in average human height on the
whole.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.660
As for the peaks and valleys, during the Black
Death (1346-1353), 60% of the European population,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.540
about 50 million people, died quite suddenly,
leaving the surviving 40% and their offspring

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.210
with greater access to food and less crowded
living conditions; together, this contributed

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.210
to fewer diseases and better nutrition, and
as a result, people during the 15th and 16th

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.700
centuries in Europe grew rather tall.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.530
In fact, in England, the average man was only
about 1.5 inches (3.81 cm) shorter during

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.300
this time compared with the average Englishman
today (at about 5’9″ or 175 cm).

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.930
Seventeenth century Europe, however, was a
mess, with cold winters from the Little Ice

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.310
Age limiting crop production, civil war in
England, Louis XIV’s expansionary aggression

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.010
and the Thirty Years’ War.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.659
As a result, human health and height suffered,
with the average Frenchman reaching only about

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.980
5’4″ (162 cm).

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.420
(Not coincidentally why French men popularized
wearing high-heels around this time, a practice

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.590
that women would later adopt and men largely
abandon, outside of horse riding boots.)

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.730
Faring little better during the 18th and early
parts of the 19th century, many western Europeans

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.390
lived in dirty, disease-ridden slums that
prevented them from increasing significantly

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.069
in height, with men across Europe in 1850
only reaching, on average, about 5’5″

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.950
(165 cm).

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.870
Starkly marking the difference proper diet
and living conditions can make here is that

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.840
19th century English students at the Sandhurst
Military Academy (upper class) were on average

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.270
a whopping 8.7 inches (22 cm) taller than
their compatriots at the Marine Society boys

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.750
(lower class).

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.350
In the United States, things were quite different,
with the average man in 1850 attaining a height

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.170
of about 5’7″ (170 cm).

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.569
In fact, on average, people in the U.S. remained
taller than their European counterparts from

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.800
the Revolutionary War through World War II
(with a slight dip during the second industrial

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800
revolution).

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.320
It is thought that American height dominance
during this period was due to having a relatively

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.270
resource-rich environment, where, with the
largely privately owned agriculture-based

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.820
society, many had easier access to a wider
variety of nutrition sources than was common

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.270
in places like the UK, where a very small
percentage of people owned much of the land

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.420
being farmed and much higher population densities
existed.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.520
(See: Why the Mass Avoidance of Some Business
is Called Boycotting)

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.430
historical-median-male-heightThings began
to change after WWII.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.410
In the last half century or so, the average
American height has more or less remained

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.959
the same, while post-war Europeans have, on
the whole, sprouted like crazy.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.690
In the most extreme case, throughout the 19th
century men and women of the Netherlands averaged

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:54.490
roughly 5’5″ (166 cm) for men and 5’1″
(156 cm) for women- relatively short for their

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.239
era and region of the world.

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.239
Today, the tallest people in the world are
found in the Netherlands, where the average

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.670
man is just over 6 feet tall (183 cm) and
the average woman is nearly 5’7″ (170

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.670
cm).

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:16.760
By comparison, American men are 5’9″ (175
cm) on average, and women are 5’4″ (163

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.940
cm).

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.780
Some believe that the great strides in height
made by Western Europeans over Americans can

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.070
be attributed to their universal health coverage
and other social policies, such as maternity

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.780
services and greater parental leave allowing
for better practicality of things like breastfeeding

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.690
vs. formula fed and, later, more time off
work providing extra time for preparing nutritious

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.700
meals, rather than relying on fast-food and
other quick high-calorie, low nutrition “junk”

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:44.700
foods.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.150
Further, the so-called “over-nutrition”
prevalent in the U.S., combined with lack

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.690
of physical activity leading to widespread
obesity, has also been noted for its negative

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.169
effects on growth hormones and metabolism,
limiting the ultimate adult height somewhat.

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.610
So how high will humans grow with perfect
nutrition and health care?

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.040
It’s generally thought the Dutch are close
to the peak of average human height potential,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:11.280
at least based on innate genetics, and Americans
and others are close to it.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.530
This is probably a good thing as the human
body is not adapted well for extreme height,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.940
and those outliers who do tower over the rest
of us often suffer from various pains and

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:36.550
other debilities related to their abnormal
height as they age.
