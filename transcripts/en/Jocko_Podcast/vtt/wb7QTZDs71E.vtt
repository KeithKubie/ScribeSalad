1
00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.220
How do you deal with anger and flared tempers in yourself or your team?

2
00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:10.610
Later on?
We'll go ahead and turn that one over to you.

3
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.880
I got experience with this one life's way more experienced than he

4
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.470
losing your temper.
I've,
I've got a lot of experience with this one.

5
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.350
And I talked about being a direct guy,
be B and a,

6
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.380
a a default of aggressive guy and uh,

7
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.800
and that's good.
There's a lot of good in that.

8
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.980
There's also some bad when you lose your temper,
when you,
you know,

9
00:00:32.981 --> 00:00:35.730
you lose your cool one.
You know,
when you get emotional about things,

10
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.820
react to stuff,
you don't make good decisions.
And so,
you know,
we,

11
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:42.550
we always taught our guys at the most important quality they could have as a

12
00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:46.840
combat leader is to remain calm and make good decisions under chaos and

13
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.000
pressure.
So,
uh,
that doesn't happen when you lose your temper.
Um,
so,

14
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.640
uh,
you know,
when I look back on that,

15
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.300
the other thing about it too is when you do lose your temper about stuff and

16
00:00:58.301 --> 00:01:01.750
it's,
um,
I can give you a number of scenarios where it happened,

17
00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:05.170
where if guys had a,

18
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.130
people always think like,
seals are always focused all the time,
you know,

19
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.220
and it's life and death for you guys out there.
When we talk about businesses,

20
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:17.220
they say that all the time,
like it's life and death for you guys.
You know,

21
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:19.050
so it's not really life and death for my guys,

22
00:01:19.051 --> 00:01:21.740
but how do I get them to stay focus?
Guess what?
Um,

23
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.840
people lose discipline,
right?

24
00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:27.660
People lose discipline if there's not leaders that are holding those standards

25
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:30.060
and,
and pushing hard.
And I remember one time in particular,

26
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.170
we were patrolling back to our combat outpost and,
uh,

27
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.620
we've been on a long operation.
It was a foot patrol into a dangerous area.
And,

28
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:41.000
uh,
we captured a bunch of prisoners and we had,
we had,
uh,

29
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.730
walked him back on foot because they,
there was so many IED threats in that area.

30
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.880
Um,
I think we finally met up with some Bradley Fighting Vehicles,

31
00:01:47.881 --> 00:01:51.150
a smaller tank from the army that came down.
We loaded them up in that and,
and,

32
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:54.650
uh,
and they,
they took him back from there.
But,
so we're walking back,
uh,

33
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.690
patrolling back and we're almost,
you know,
we're,

34
00:01:56.691 --> 00:02:00.060
we're still a few hundred yards back away from this combat outposts,

35
00:02:00.061 --> 00:02:01.230
but we're in enemy territory.

36
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.850
And I could see that some of the guys are starting to not be as focused,

37
00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:09.390
like looking down their weapons and drop it security in those things.
And,
um,

38
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.810
and I was infuriated by that.
I was totally infuriated by that.

39
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:15.920
And it was because I knew what was at stake that,
okay,

40
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.340
if we're not disciplined all the way back until we're inside that wire of the,

41
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.920
of the front,
the combat outpost,
we could take fire at any moment.

42
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.130
And if we're not watching,
you know,
at that very second we get shot at,

43
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.930
people might get guilt,
you know,

44
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.390
it decreases our probability of winning that firefight of,

45
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.200
of bringing everybody back.
So,
um,
so it was a big deal.
And,
and,
uh,
but I,

46
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:36.450
I definitely lost my cool on that when I came back.

47
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:40.230
I was Jew and it has it like fired up at people and like,
here,

48
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.260
this is why this is important.
And looking back on that now and like that's,

49
00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.190
that's not the best way to do that,
right?
The best way to do that is to say,
um,

50
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.790
well I mean forced guys to,
to,
to,
to keep security,

51
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:53.750
remind them to keep security certainly while,
while it's happening.
Uh,

52
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.210
but getting back and saying,
guys,
here's why we've got to keep security.

53
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.710
I know we're only a couple of yards from combat outpost,

54
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.430
but recognize their enemy fighters out here and they're going to hit us when we

55
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.030
least expect it.
And just because it hasn't happened to us before,
you know,

56
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:08.380
even though we've done this dozens of times,

57
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.030
does not mean that it won't happen to us the next time.
And we can't,
you know,

58
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.990
this is important.

59
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.830
Think about how you would feel if somebody got killed when you were supposed to

60
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.590
be holding security as they were crossing the street and you are paid attention.

61
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.360
You know,
it's interesting you use that example.

62
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:26.080
I almost feel that you showing legit anger at that point,

63
00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:26.914
it was a positive thing.

64
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.120
Like you want to make it perfectly clear to everybody and the way you get their

65
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.690
attention because it's not like you lose your temper all the time is by,

66
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.220
you know,
getting angry and people go,
oh,
you know,
he's,
he's,

67
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.580
he doesn't lose his temper very often here he is super fired up.
Well,

68
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.640
I don't think it's,
I don't need to probably,
it's not a problem to get angry.

69
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:47.680
I got really,
really angry.
Okay.

70
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.810
So it's one of those things where it would have been more effective for me to be

71
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:56.350
stern and not back down from that in the least.

72
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.530
And not treat it lightly in the league.
I'm not saying that at all,

73
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:02.820
but I think just to Lou to yell and scream and those things,

74
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.660
it just never the best way to get right across.
Right.
That is true.
If you,

75
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.350
if you completely lose it and you're yelling and screaming,
it's,
it's,

76
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.350
it's not a good thing even though you're absolutely right.
It was important.
And,

77
00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:14.580
and I,
I wanted that addressed.
It was like,

78
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.920
it just wasn't the best way to address that.
I looking back on it now,

79
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:22.230
one time in particular to was,
uh,
I can think,
uh,
when,
uh,

80
00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.590
you wanted to make some changes to our operation.
Oh yeah,
that's right.

81
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.610
That's right.
I get,
remember we talked about that,
the last part guys are now,

82
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:35.080
but we,
we,
uh,
I was ready to cancel the op Jocko came in and was like,

83
00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.030
well what about this,
you know,
maybe we look at it from this direction.

84
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.260
Why don't you guys make me patrol in on this route and not go across this bridge

85
00:04:44.261 --> 00:04:48.130
where there's a choke point and they might vary ids in the road.
And I was like,

86
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.840
we've been looking at this for hours.
It was like,

87
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.180
now he's changing it two minutes prior like gasoline
and Jocko,

88
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.170
he could've,
he could've lost his cool with me cause I just lost my cool.

89
00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.320
And you know,
I've been,
we've been hours at this and I was frustrated.

90
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:02.900
I was ready to get,

91
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.090
get this op launched and all the paperwork requirements and the levels of

92
00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.980
approvals that we need and running around trying to,
you know,

93
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.540
fix all these things and,
and uh,
he actually just looked at me and was like,

94
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:19.170
we don't need to cancel the up.
It's fine.
It's going to be fine.
And then you,

95
00:05:19.171 --> 00:05:22.900
you actually get asked me some questions like,
does what I'm saying makes sense?

96
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.970
And I wanted to be like,
no,
I can't,
you know,
but it was like,
yes,

97
00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.390
I hit totally,
totally makes sense.
And you're like,
okay,

98
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:34.840
how long is it going to take to change it?
They were like,
I was like,
two minutes.

99
00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.840
Like,
well,
we have eight minutes left,
so no problem.
It looks good.

100
00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.560
We don't need to cancel the operation.
I was like,
no,
we don't.

101
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.780
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh,
and,
and
like you said,

102
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.470
it's important to maintain your cool.

103
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.060
And the way I do that is by being detached,
talk about it all the time.

104
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.630
And that situation when you've got all fired up at,
I was like,
Eh,
like,
okay.

105
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.340
You know,
latest getting fired up.

106
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.720
And I didn't think lace get fired up because he's immature or cause he's

107
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.600
doesn't,
can't control himself.
I thought to myself,
Hey,
you know what?

108
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.260
He's been working on this all day.
He's,
he's got a lot of pressure on him.

109
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.840
There's a lot of frustration when you're doing these plans and doing all this

110
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.890
paperwork.
I understand where he's coming from.
Let me give him some space,

111
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:21.200
let them vent a little bit and then let's reapproach this thing.

112
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:24.680
That's how I'm coming at the situation.
So how you handle it though,

113
00:06:24.681 --> 00:06:28.400
it was perfect because had you blown back up and they want just the natural

114
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:31.340
human reaction is right.
Then I get Matt were yelling each.

115
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.090
Even though we have ministry close relationship,
we would have cancelled the out.

116
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.080
Yeah,
it would've been a big deal.
It or even if,
even if you ended up saying like,

117
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.460
you know,
so many leaders would do like,

118
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.210
you're going to do it this way and then I'm mad at you and I'm,

119
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:47.330
I'm all pissed off at you.
You,
you know you came in and Trump knee.
Oh yeah.

120
00:06:47.331 --> 00:06:50.540
By the way.
What happens when something goes wrong on the operation?
And I'm like,

121
00:06:50.541 --> 00:06:55.160
Jocko told us to do this,
do this,
and then you have those frictions.
But the bet,

122
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:58.760
the best thing that you did in that situation would you actually just smiled and

123
00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:03.170
laughed at me like,
just take it.
Well,
I didn't like that just to make that clear.

124
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:07.130
I didn't laugh at him like he was a little scary.
I'll just like,
hey man,

125
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.640
you know,
and he knows me and he knows exactly where I was coming from.
Like,
Hey,

126
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.520
I know I know what's going on.

127
00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:14.950
It was the perfect way to deescalate the situation,
which,

128
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:18.590
which made me deescalate.
Exactly.
And made me realize that yeah,

129
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:21.130
it makes total sense and then we executed.
It was no problem.
Yep.

130
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.500
That's how you deal with that.
That's how you deal with,

131
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.630
so when someone gets mad at you,
deescalate.

132
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.990
When you feel yourself getting spun up,
detached,

133
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.600
when have you got spun up and lost your cool,

134
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:35.300
I've said this before on the podcast.

135
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.500
Printers and copy machines,

136
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.800
they don't like me or not.
I don't like them.

137
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.570
And so are we talking straight up office space,
the office space style.
Um,

138
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.940
I don't like,
I don't like printers and copy machines.

139
00:07:49.941 --> 00:07:52.670
They don't ever do what I want them to do.
And so I get,

140
00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.450
I get angry at them so I'll lose,
I'll lose my mind a little bit.
Uh,
but no,

141
00:07:56.451 --> 00:07:58.820
I don't,
I don't lose my temper very often.
You know,
it doesn't,

142
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:00.230
doesn't do me a lot of good at it.

143
00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:04.420
Usually it usually doesn't help the situation,
you know,

144
00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.460
it doesn't help you solve the problem.
And,
and my mind is always already,

145
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:11.180
how do I get this thing solved?
They never helped you solve the problem,

146
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:14.780
that's for sure.
Nope.
So if you're like me and you lose your cool,
you gotta,

147
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.490
you gotta practice it,
you get to rehearse that.

148
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:19.010
You got to make sure that you're detaching and uh,

149
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.770
not losing your cool so that you can get the job done when that's,

150
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.390
that's what it's all about.
And the Delta tune commander,
no,

151
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:30.530
he would go into a little bit of rage from time to time.
And you know,

152
00:08:30.531 --> 00:08:35.270
one day the Delta platoon commander is going to be out of the military and he's

153
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:39.710
coming to ride on this podcast that he knows that he's fired up.
But,
uh,
you know,

154
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:44.240
he's my,
my other brother,
and that's going to be a good time,

155
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:48.320
but you know,
he would get some rage going and I'd have to,

156
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:53.270
I'd have to back him down a little bit and say,
Bro,
it's me.

157
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.970
They raised to get fired up right now where we're here to win and I'm here to

158
00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:02.630
help you.
And you'd go,
oh,
I know,
but damn

159
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.300
awesome.
