question

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930
question
 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.230
question
it depends see the problem with any

it depends see the problem with any
 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.470
it depends see the problem with any
question that says is a B is a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480
question that says is a B is a
 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.440
question that says is a B is a
equivalent to B is that it depends on

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450
equivalent to B is that it depends on
 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.240
equivalent to B is that it depends on
how you define a and B right and I'm not

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250
how you define a and B right and I'm not
 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.950
how you define a and B right and I'm not
trying to weasel out of the question I'm

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
trying to weasel out of the question I'm
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.320
trying to weasel out of the question I'm
very very serious about that the Nazis

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330
very very serious about that the Nazis
 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.000
very very serious about that the Nazis
regarded themselves as National

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010
regarded themselves as National
 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.540
regarded themselves as National
Socialists you know so they weren't

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550
Socialists you know so they weren't
 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.209
Socialists you know so they weren't
free-market capitalist slits se so they

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219
free-market capitalist slits se so they
 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.920
free-market capitalist slits se so they
certainly weren't right-wingers in the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
certainly weren't right-wingers in the
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.810
certainly weren't right-wingers in the
way that free-market capitalists are

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
way that free-market capitalists are
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.130
way that free-market capitalists are
right wingers even though they're

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
right wingers even though they're
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.459
right wingers even though they're
probably more centrist they differed

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
probably more centrist they differed
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.560
probably more centrist they differed
from the International Socialists which

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
from the International Socialists which
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.720
from the International Socialists which
were the Marxists because they were much

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
were the Marxists because they were much
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.119
were the Marxists because they were much
more concerned with national identity

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
more concerned with national identity
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.490
more concerned with national identity
and racial identity and to the degree

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500
and racial identity and to the degree
 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.040
and racial identity and to the degree
that you regard nationalism and racial

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
that you regard nationalism and racial
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.160
that you regard nationalism and racial
identity as primarily right-wing views

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170
identity as primarily right-wing views
 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.150
identity as primarily right-wing views
then the Nazis would have been

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160
then the Nazis would have been
 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.360
then the Nazis would have been
right-wing so let's say that they maybe

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370
right-wing so let's say that they maybe
 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.490
right-wing so let's say that they maybe
they pulled from the worst of both

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500
they pulled from the worst of both
 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.619
they pulled from the worst of both
extreme something like that but I do

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
extreme something like that but I do
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.230
extreme something like that but I do
think it's reasonable to note that their

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
think it's reasonable to note that their
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600
think it's reasonable to note that their
extreme nationalism and ethnocentrism

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610
extreme nationalism and ethnocentrism
 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.000
extreme nationalism and ethnocentrism
and racial identity probably has more in

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
and racial identity probably has more in
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.580
and racial identity probably has more in
common with the radical right that it

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
common with the radical right that it
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.560
common with the radical right that it
does with the radical left which tends

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570
does with the radical left which tends
 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.870
does with the radical left which tends
to be utopian Universal so one of the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880
to be utopian Universal so one of the
 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.100
to be utopian Universal so one of the
things I thought would be an interesting

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110
things I thought would be an interesting
 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.109
things I thought would be an interesting
research project would be to take like a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
research project would be to take like a
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.020
research project would be to take like a
hundred Nazi policies and to turn them

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
hundred Nazi policies and to turn them
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.260
hundred Nazi policies and to turn them
into a questionnaire and ask people

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270
into a questionnaire and ask people
 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.880
into a questionnaire and ask people
either how much they agree with them

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
either how much they agree with them
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.770
either how much they agree with them
after I figured out whether they were

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
after I figured out whether they were
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.510
after I figured out whether they were
left or right wing to begin with or

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520
left or right wing to begin with or
 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880
left or right wing to begin with or
whether they thought the policies were

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
whether they thought the policies were
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.499
whether they thought the policies were
representative of the left or the right

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
representative of the left or the right
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.179
representative of the left or the right
because that could be studied

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
because that could be studied
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.649
because that could be studied
empirically and I don't think anyone's

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
empirically and I don't think anyone's
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.179
empirically and I don't think anyone's
done it but that would be a very

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
done it but that would be a very
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.429
done it but that would be a very
interesting that would be a very

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439
interesting that would be a very
 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.880
interesting that would be a very
interesting research project
