MAN (VOICEOVER): But
even here, there's

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.100
no escape from the storm.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.065
I have to get out of
this freezing wind.

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:13.000
Best I can do is just find a
quick shelter behind the wind

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.065
shadow of these trees.

00:00:15.066 --> 00:00:16.467
[wind howling]

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.834
I dig down through the snow
at the base of a spruce,

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:21.767
making a hole just big
enough to fit myself into.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.200
Snow is the key to
keeping warm out here.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.734
Fresh snow is up
to 95% trapped air,

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:36.800
and that air acts as
a powerful insulator--

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.400
trapping heat and
preventing it from escaping.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.934
That's why the Cree keep it
up around their temporary

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:46.065
shelters, and why many
animals survived the winters

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:49.233
buried in snow caves.

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:51.599
By digging down into
the snow like this

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.667
and then using my
snowshoes to create a roof,

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:57.367
I'm not only protecting
myself from the wind,

00:00:57.367 --> 00:00:59.900
but creating an
insulated air pocket

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.400
where I can try to stay warm.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.934
All I can do is hunker down
and wait for the storm to pass.

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:08.600
[music playing]

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.300
Priority right now is
to keep myself warm.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.600
If this storm goes
on until dark,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.500
I won't be able to build
a shelter or light a fire.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.166
And without them, I will not
survive through the night.

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:23.100
