1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,290
What do you do for recovery?

2
00:00:01,291 --> 00:00:05,330
Do you fuck around with cryotherapy
or Saunas or nothing? Nothing, dude.

3
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:09,180
Nothing really. No. Nope.
Nothing. Uh, how come?

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:15,190
I don't know. I cause I haven't
really liked needed it. Yeah. Uh,

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,430
you should just get a sauna. Get us
all in your gym. Yup. Just that alone.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,950
Get a sauna and a fucking
ice bath. Yeah. I drink,

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,790
I drink beer for recovery.
That's that.

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,260
That's an nightly ritual.
I will,

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,380
I will not be able to function
if I don't how many beers? Oh,

10
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:37,950
usually route four. But they're
like good quality pints. You know,

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,290
I'm not like Chug a lug in
Nascar soda by the case. Right.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,570
Um,
barley pops,

13
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:49,770
but like good quality a IPA,
stouts,

14
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:52,830
porters or that kind of thing. You
just live for it. Yeah, I love it.

15
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,370
I'm a hobbyist and then ama
hobbies that are bourbon,

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,400
so I, that doesn't seem to go hand
in hand. A lot of people's eyes.

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,870
I know hard. You freaking kidding me.
It's like, hey man, I have a policy.

18
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:10,200
My wife having a, and I have a
policy every night is Saturday night,

19
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,220
but every morning is Monday
morning. Wow. I like it. Yeah.

20
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:19,221
So we'd go out almost every night we
go out just because if I'm at home,

21
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,000
I'm going to work.
I'm going to work until I fall asleep.

22
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,470
So you know, that clock hits six,
seven at night. I'm like, all right,

23
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,110
let me go meet my wife.
She's getting off of work.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,720
We're going to go have a couple pints,

25
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,650
have a big old bourbon or
something like that. And uh, Yup.

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,600
I smoke cigars. Um, dip, uh,

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,620
how to, to kick. The thing is,
well that's what I'm going to diet.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,540
It's all about diet.
I mean,

29
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:53,541
my Diet's ridiculous and it's
predominantly when I meal prep,

30
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,010
um, it's Collard Greens, Spinach,
bell pepper and chicken and that's it.

31
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,570
And then spice it up with, you know,
salt, pepper, garlic prep for the week.

32
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:04,980
You make like a bunch of,
but it doesn't,

33
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:09,860
I don't have a pot big enough to prep
for the week. So I prepped for like two,

34
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:14,730
three days at a whack and just chow down.
And that's the other thing.

35
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:19,560
Diet man die. You know, there's this,
what's due to puts a secret and diet,

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,820
eat food in food doesn't
come in a bag or a box.

37
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:27,180
That's a product shop at the
periphery of the grocery store.

38
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,240
If you go into the guts,
all you're going in there as for coffee,

39
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,140
all boils salt and that's it. Yeah. Um,

40
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:38,160
that's a good way of looking at you.
Stay right. Stay on the outside.

41
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:41,160
That's where the meat and vegetables,
Yep. Beware of the inside.

42
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,190
Just be aware if you're going in
there, go with a purpose. You know,

43
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:48,900
don't get a bunch of God
Damn

44
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,120
God. Yup. Because that,
and then the older you get,

45
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,890
the less you can prop your body can't
process that crap. Right? So Diet for me,

46
00:02:58,891 --> 00:03:03,400
get in the morning. It's habitual for
quarter waters. Since I wake up full,

47
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:08,080
full quarter one, first thing, power
slam. Don't even don't even set it down.

48
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,460
And then, um, why is that?
What's the thought process
behind? I'm getting that down.

49
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,890
I'm getting it in me.
No waste in time.

50
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,540
It's there for a reason.
I want to cause you wake up dehydrated.

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,680
I just want a power slam that and uh,
get it all into me.

52
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,360
Um, and then, you know, a
clean it to clean breakfasts,

53
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:30,040
like a couple of boiled
eggs and some bacon.

54
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,320
And then throughout the day in people say,
well,

55
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:38,710
is there a certain amount? Because too
many people follow too many like diets,

56
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:42,130
which good for them if you're
following a diet, Kudos. Um,

57
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,030
but like meal times and how many times
a day I eat when I'm hungry and I don't

58
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:51,020
eat til I'm full. It's, it's
pretty freaking simple. Uh,

59
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,750
you don't eat until you're full, so right
back off, right when you hit like 70%,

60
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,580
80% about that,
about that.

61
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,040
And then part a portion
of that is thinking, well,

62
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,340
what if I got a sprint 400 yards?
You know,

63
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:10,780
or what if I got a kick somebody's ass
right now, right now. And if I'm 100%,

64
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,190
I mean it's going to be
shooting out of both ends. Um,

65
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,030
so I die is freaking huge man.
Huge.

66
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,570
But it allows me to drink
those beers at night. You know,

67
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,530
it allows me to do stuff like that and
then make sure I'm hitting it every day.

68
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,640
That, uh, you know, the gym,
even if on the road, um,

69
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:37,870
I usually don't have time
for seven days. Um, and I,

70
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,720
even if I did,
I probably wouldn't,

71
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,210
I'd probably take at least
one day off maybe too. Um,

72
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,680
but you know,

73
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,750
as well as I do that you are more in
tuned when you get older to what your

74
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:56,920
body's telling your brain, your body
when you get older, says, you know what?

75
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,990
Back the fuck off today.
You don't need to do this shit.

76
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,250
And I listened to that man.
I do listen to them.
