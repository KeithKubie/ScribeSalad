Remember that we're trying to get X by itself. So what's the next step that we

00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:07.871
should take to move towards that? Should we square both sides of our equation?

00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:11.472
Should we find the positive square root of each side? Should we find the

00:00:11.472 --> 00:00:15.367
negative square root of each side? Or should we find both the positive and the

00:00:15.367 --> 00:00:17.285
negative square roots of both sides?
