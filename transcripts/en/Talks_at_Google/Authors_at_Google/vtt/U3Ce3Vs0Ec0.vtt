&gt;&gt;Amy: Hi. Isaiah Berlin wrote that "the fox
knows many little things, but the hedgehog

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:18.160
knows one big thing". Steven Johnson knows
many big things. Steven Johnson is not only

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.340
the author of books like "Everything Bad is
Good for You," "Interface Culture" and "Mind

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.270
Wide Open." But he's also an entrepreneur
and founder of early online communities. He

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:36.070
founded "Outside.in", a provider of hyper-local
news and information as well as two influential

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.030
websites; the pioneering web feed, "Seed,"
and the community news discussion site, plastic.com.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.480
"Emergence" is not only a title of one of
his books, but is also a theme throughout

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.640
his works. "The Ghost Map" illustrates the
emergence of public health; "The Invention

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.310
of Air", the emergence of science, and his
latest book, "Where Good Ideas Come From:

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.740
The Natural History of Innovation", looks
at the emergence of the new. Innovation is,

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:14.560
of course, central to Google and in his latest
book, Steven explores the space of innovation,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.020
observing the environments and networks from
which good ideas emerge from coral reefs to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:28.329
Building 20 at MIT. He debunks the myth of
the lone genius, suddenly struck by inspiration

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.020
and instead, dwells on all of the work that
that genius has built on and connects to.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.179
And most importantly for Googlers, Steven
proposes six specific patterns that foster

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:45.539
innovation within environments. So, please
join me in welcoming Steven Johnson to the

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.119
Authors@Google series.

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.659
[applause]

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:57.360
&gt;&gt;Steven: Thank you, Amy. It's great to be
back at Google. As always, you all are wonderful

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.320
people I like to be around. Iâ€™m always inspired
by the things that you do, so it's an honor

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:09.610
to be back to talk about this new book. So,
I wanted to say I come here via Chicago, where

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.439
I was talking on Wednesday night, but before
that, I was in D.C., talking to some people

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:20.280
in the government and did a very fun thing
at the White House. But then on Tuesday, I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:27.319
was talking about this book and these ideas
in the intelligence community, because they

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.220
were doing a series on being more innovative
and creative inside of bureaucracy. So, they

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.760
invited me to come in and give this talk and
they called me up and they said, "Listen,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.239
here's the deal. We have to send a special
car to pick you up because the building where

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.870
you're gonna speak does not show up on Google
Maps anywhere, even in satellite view. You

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.409
won't see it at all. So, we have to take you
to this special, secure, undisclosed location."

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:58.079
Which sounded really intimidating, but then
when I got there, it turned out it was great

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:03.989
because there's very little Foursquare competition
there, so I'm now the mayor of the location.

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:04.989
[laughter]

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.689
I think Cheney was the mayor before, but I
can't come out.

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:08.689
[laughter]

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:12.720
Anyway, so it's nice to be in a slightly more
open, architecture environment. So, I wanna

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.709
talk about this new book, and talk about a
little bit about the arguments and then talk

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.530
a bit about some of the things that I think
are happening, particularly with books and

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.720
e-books, and some of the things that you guys
are on the cutting edge right now. So, I'm

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.329
gonna do a little bit of the book talk and
a little bit of something custom-tailored

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.829
for this particular venue. One of these I
would start by doing is telling you a little

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:41.310
bit about how I got to this project. It actually
dates back to book that Amy alluded to, which

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.719
is a book called "The Ghost Map", which I
was here talking about four years ago. "The

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:55.780
Ghost Map" is a story about a cholera epidemic
in London, in the 1850s. And I got interested

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.989
in the story because it was one of those things
that I kept colliding with from different

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.209
angles. So, I'd be reading something about
the history of science and I would stumble

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.459
across this story. And then I'd be reading
something about interface design, or cartography,

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.930
because there's a map at the center and I
would stumble across this story, or I would

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.410
read about something and the history of public
health and I would stumble across this story.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.790
And anytime there's some interesting nugget
of historical data or some perspective of

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.060
person that you keep colliding with from different
angles, it's always a sign that something

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.790
interesting is going on. And so, I decided
to dig in a little bit more and the story

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:38.530
is I heard it; went something like this: It's
1854 in London. The city, like many cities

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.130
in Europe and in the United States, is being
regularly attacked by this terrible disease

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.910
of cholera. Every five years or so, a big
epidemic will roll through the city. Five

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.690
thousand people will die over the course of
a summer. Nobody really understands it, but

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.690
the reigning orthodox theory about cholera
is that it's in the air. It's the miasma theory

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.780
with the dominant model for understanding
it, which was somewhat understandable because

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.730
London was probably the smelliest city in
all of the world at that particular point.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.140
So people naturally assume that this noxious
air that they were breathing had to be the

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.440
culprit here. But, in fact, we now know that
cholera was in the water. It was not at all

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.540
a problem of poisonous vapors; it was because
the water supply was contaminated by this

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:28.870
bacterium. So, this outbreak rips through
the neighborhood of Soho in London in late

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:34.460
August, early September of 1854. It kills
ten percent of the population in the space

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:40.330
of about ten days. And in the middle of all
this, this lone genius, this brilliant man,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.700
a local doctor named John Snow goes right
into the belly of the beast of the outbreak

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.900
and starts knocking on doors, investigating
what's going on with this outbreak and calculating

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.370
who has died at what address. And he built
this map, and the map shows the number of

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.661
deaths at each address in the neighborhood
with this little, black bars. And when you

00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:07.690
look at the map, you can see very clearly
that there's this very strong pronounced cluster

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:14.060
of deaths right around a popular pump at the
center of Soho at 40 Broad Street. And you

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.660
can see the further you get from the pump,
the deaths fade away. And so he looks at this

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.270
map and he says, "Aha! The problem is with
the water. It's not in the air. Cholera is

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:31.390
a water-borne disease, so if we can clear
the water up whatever this is causing this;

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:37.610
we'll rid the city of this terrible menace."
So, he goes to the authorities, convinces

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.690
them of his theory. They remove the pump handle,
the epidemic stops, they start building things

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.800
like the London sewers to clean up the water
supply and by 1866, the cholera is gone from

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.010
London forever. So I thought, "That's a great
story. It'll be like a Victorian episode of

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.760
CSI. It's got a page-turner kind of feel,
but it's a triumph of science and all this

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.560
kind of stuff." So, I started to really research
it in earnest for this book, and what I found

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.590
was, quite quickly, was that almost every
important fact in that story that I just told

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:13.970
you was wrong. And the first part of it was
that Snow had the theory of cholera as a water-borne

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:21.550
disease for six years before the outbreak
came to Soho. He was convinced in late 1848

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.610
that, in fact, everybody was wrong about this
disease and, in fact, it was a water-borne

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:31.810
problem, not an air-borne problem. And he
wrote a number of essays, wrote a number of

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:37.120
letters to "The Lancet", he actually created
a couple of other maps and basically, his

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.660
whole theory was roundly ignored by the authorities
for a very long time. When the outbreak finally

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:50.340
came to Soho, the map he made was actually
not triggering a eureka moment--a sudden moment

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.190
of clarity in his head--it was, in fact, more
of a marketing vehicle for an idea that he'd

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.910
had for a long time that he'd been working
on for a long period of time. And it turned

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:04.390
out, also, that Snow's interest in all this
was actually just a hobby that he had on the

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:09.750
side. Most of us don't have cholera as a hobby,
but Snow was that kind of guy,

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.720
He was trained as a physician and an anesthesiologist,
but he was interested in a million different

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.100
things, and cholera was one of those things.
In fact, it turns out to be a trait of a lot

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.811
of people that I look at in this new book
that unusually innovative people have a lot

00:08:21.811 --> 00:08:27.620
of hobbies. This is a very interesting characteristic.
So, it turned out to be precisely because

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:32.669
he did have a number of different hobbies
and interests that it was the interaction

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:38.000
between all these different passions that
allowed him to see around a lot of the orthodoxies

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.560
of the day and solve this riddle in a way
that other medical authorities couldn't. But

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:48.590
the most important thing that I found in researching
this book was that Snow had a collaborator

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:52.990
that no one had talked about. It was almost
entirely written out of the historical accounts

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:56.680
of this outbreak. And this collaborator was
this guy named Henry Whitehead, who was a

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:02.640
local vicar; not at all a man of science.
He was one of these local vicars, he was a

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.470
classic connector figure who knew everyone
in the neighborhood, he had a great social

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:13.120
intelligence and he got involved in the case,
initially actually, to try to prove Snow wrong,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:17.060
which was kind of funny, and then became an
ally of Snow's. And it was Whitehead who did

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.930
a lot of the shoe-leather detective work;
particularly in tracking down people who had

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:27.240
left the neighborhood because he had these
thick ties to them socially. And it was Whitehead

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.890
who ended up tracking down the patient zero
of the whole outbreak, which turned out to

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:37.240
be crucial in addition to the map in convincing
the authorities that Snow's theory was right.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:42.900
So, what had been this kind of classic story
of the lone genius having a eureka moment

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:51.490
of sudden clarity, turned out to be a much
slower, much more complex, and much more collaborative

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:57.880
and networked process than the story had originally
been told to me, and I thought much more interesting.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:03.820
And so, I realized as I was writing that book
that there was, in a sense, a latent theory

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:08.760
of innovation of breakthrough ideas in the
environments that make them possible that

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:12.640
was lurking in the background of this story
I was telling you about cholera. So, I decided

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:19.830
to make that story, that theory, front and
center in a new book. And so, I went to my

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.450
publisher and persuaded them that I should
write a book about innovation and the spaces

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:28.570
that encourage innovation. And early on, I
decided that I would look not only at human

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:34.340
societies and cultural environments, but also
biological ones and that there would probably

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:39.610
be an interesting set of analogies to draw
between human innovation and biological innovation.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:44.890
And so, I knew that I wanted to look at environments
like rainforests and coral reefs that have

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:50.430
a long track record of generating biological
diversity, because I figured there would be

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.760
patterns that you would see in both of them.
The problem was then, when I actually sat

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:59.650
down to decide what would go into the book,
I realized that I had set the scope of this

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:04.590
project ridiculously wide because it could
include potentially, any good idea that any

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.440
human being had ever had in the course of
human history, or any interesting life form

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.900
that ever evolved in the course of life on
Earth, which, when you're sitting--

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:11.900
[laughter]

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:16.210
with Google search box open on your desktop
and a cup of coffee in the morning, is daunting

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:20.070
when you can include everything like that.
So, I had to figure out and for a while I

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:25.240
panicked and thought that I had made a terrible
mistake. But, eventually what I realized is

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:31.279
that I was seeing these recurring patterns
that were showing up again and again in the

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:36.520
environments that I was looking at. And I
decided that each chapter, basically, should

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.720
be devoted to one of these patterns and eventually
came up with seven of them really. There's

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:46.220
an introductory one that you can count as
one or not. And once I had that, it got a

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.870
lot easier to write because the patterns,
in a sense, became these magnets that would

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:53.840
attract all these different stories to the
right slot and then it became really fun.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.449
And it was almost a question of "where do
I stop?" cause there was so much to say. And

00:11:57.449 --> 00:12:03.670
I wanted to talk a little bit about a few
of them and tell you a little bit of my theory

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:09.940
about them. The first is one that we've already
seen in the case of Snow. It's what I call

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:21.600
"the Snow hunch." There seems to be this almost
innate desire to tell stories about innovation

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.370
in terms of eureka moments. For some reason,
we just want to condense them down to these

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:31.770
moments of sudden clarity where a light bulb
pops over someone's head and they suddenly

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:35.230
see the world differently. The apple falls
from the tree and they have a theory of gravity;

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:41.460
whatever the trigger is. But when you actually
go back and look at it, it turns out that

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:48.410
the historical record is an historical record
of innovation. Eureka moments are the exception

00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:54.790
and not the rule. Almost always, there is
a very long incubation period that goes into

00:12:54.790 --> 00:13:00.860
a breakthrough idea where people start with
this inkling, this sense, that there's something

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:06.500
interesting in a particular problem; a feeling
that the authorities are missing something

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.480
or there's an opening, but they can't quite
put their finger on it. And for whatever reason,

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:16.339
they have patience or they have a work environment,
or they're just stubborn or they have good

00:13:16.339 --> 00:13:20.779
tools that help them remember these things
and they are able to keep these hunches alive

00:13:20.779 --> 00:13:26.690
for long periods of time. This is a great
example of this. I show this slide a lot.

00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:29.990
This room will probably guess what this is
cause you can see in the upper left hand corner,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.400
it says "CERN." It says, "This machine is
a server. Do not power down." Right? So, this

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.839
is the first World Wide Web server that Tim
Berners-Lee put together. This is back in

00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:43.380
the day when the World Wide Web was on one
server, where you could trip over the power

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.110
cord and be like, "Oh, I'm so sorry. The World
Wide Web is down."

00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.110
[laughter]

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:54.330
Which we've moved beyond that. But, it's a
famous story, but Berners-Lee, this is a classic

00:13:54.330 --> 00:14:00.570
instance of a slow hunch, right? He starts
working at CERN in 1982, almost as a consultant

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:04.080
and he's overloaded with all the information
and projects and people who are there and

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:09.779
so he starts working on this project he calls
ENQUIRE for a while. And then he puts that

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:13.450
aside and a few years later, he starts working
on something called Tango, which doesn't really

00:14:13.450 --> 00:14:17.910
take off and then it's only three or four
years later after that, that he starts working

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:22.510
on something that he ends up calling the Web.
And, of course, he's basing it on existing

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:25.980
platforms that are out there; he's basing
it on the Internet, of course, and parts of

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:32.800
SGML and things like that. And it's only eight
years after this hunch starts to be cultivated

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:39.670
in his mind that he finally goes to his bosses
and says, "I think I may have invented a new

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:46.580
global medium here. Could this be part of
my day job, please?" Right? And I think it's

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:52.630
in part because he didn't set out to invent
a globally transformative communications platform

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:57.390
in 1982, that he was ultimately able to do
it. If he tried to do that from the beginning,

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:00.460
it would have been too much; it would have
been too ambitious, but because he started

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:05.881
with a smaller, less ambitious project and
let it incubate for a long period of time,

00:15:05.881 --> 00:15:09.880
and because he had an environment and a certain
sensibility that allowed that to happen, he

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:16.970
was able to turn it into something that changed
all of our lives and made this company possible.

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:21.370
You often find, even in individual cases,
people in telling the stories of their own

00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:27.430
innovations, they will invent these eureka
moments, even if it turns out it didn't really

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:34.990
happen. So, one great example of this is Darwin.
For many years, the standard story of Darwin's

00:15:34.990 --> 00:15:40.170
discovery of the theory of natural selection
was that he had this epiphany. In his study,

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:44.910
late one night in October of 1838, when he
was sitting around--

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:50.540
reading Malthus' book on population and he
writes about this in his autobiography; he

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:56.279
actually describes this what scholars eventually
call the "Malthusian Epiphany", where he's

00:15:56.279 --> 00:16:01.170
reading Malthus one night and, as he writes
in the autobiography, suddenly the idea for

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:06.450
the algorithm of natural selection pops into
his head. And he writes, "At last I had a

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:12.120
theory with which I could work." And it all
sounded great and he writes this in his autobiography.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:18.890
And for a hundred years that was the canonical
story of the roots of evolutionary theory.

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:24.380
But about 20, 25 year ago, a really interesting
scholar named Howard Gruber went back and

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:30.890
read through all of Darwin's notebooks from
this period. And Darwin kept these wonderful

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:36.980
notebooks which were called in that period
"The Commonplace Books." And the whole genre

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:41.920
of "The Commonplace Book" is very interesting.
Many Commonplace Books, which were crucial

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:47.030
to the explosions of intellectual activity
and the enlightenment in the 1700s and 1800s,

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:53.240
what people would do with Commonplace Books,
is they would find interesting quotes and

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:58.560
jot them down, transcribe them word by word
in these Commonplace Books and they would

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.870
intersperse them with their own ideas on thoughts
about the world and their various inquiries

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.899
and crucially, they would then go back and
reread through these books. And so, they would

00:17:07.899 --> 00:17:12.559
take all these different voices and different
snippets and remix them, intersperse them

00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:16.989
with their own ideas and by rereading all
these different voices, they would give birth

00:17:16.989 --> 00:17:21.549
to their own intellectual sensibility to the
world. Thomas Jefferson did this, John Locke

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:27.860
did this, Darwin did this, Erasmus Darwin
did this and it was actually a really crucial

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:33.320
intellectual vehicle for the period and I'll
come back to that in a second. With Darwin,

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:38.610
he kept these wonderful notebooks, or he wrote
a lot of his own ideas as well as borrowing

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:44.139
quotes and things and doing sketches and stuff
like that. We have all these notebooks. So,

00:17:44.139 --> 00:17:48.470
Gruber went back and read through all these
notebooks; they're all chronologically organized

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:54.940
very clearly, and what he found was there
is, in fact, a moment of excitement in late

00:17:54.940 --> 00:18:01.110
October of 1838, when Darwin is reading Malthus.
There are a lot of exclamation points that

00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:06.529
night and he's all excited. But, what Gruber
found was, in fact, there are many, many passages

00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:11.669
from months and months before the alleged
epiphany where Darwin writes out whole paragraphs;

00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:16.070
it seemed like they are taken straight from
a contemporary evolutionary theory textbook,

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:21.730
where he seems to have the whole theory of
natural selection in his head on some level.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:26.950
And then you have the epiphany, and the next
day there's no sense that he's passed this

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:30.869
really important watershed point, like he's
not like, "I have solved my big problem."

00:18:30.869 --> 00:18:34.889
He goes and writes his own entry on the sexual
curiosity on primates that has nothing to

00:18:34.889 --> 00:18:39.909
do with his big, new discovery the night before.
He's had the most important idea in 19th century

00:18:39.909 --> 00:18:43.090
science and the next morning, he's like, "All
right, I'm gonna do the crossword puzzle."

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.450
There's no sense that some momentous thing
has happened, right? And, in fact, it's not

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:51.980
for another two months before Darwin actually
starts writing about his theory as this thing

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:56.549
and he has to then figure out what he has
to do with it, which he spends, of course,

00:18:56.549 --> 00:19:02.100
20 more years trying to figure out. And so,
Gruber's point is if you try and pinpoint

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:07.580
the exact moment that Darwin has the idea,
you can't do it; that you can say pretty confidently

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:11.840
from the notebooks that he doesn't have it
three months before the epiphany and he clearly,

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:16.869
fully has it two months after. But when you
try and get more precise in that, it's actually

00:19:16.869 --> 00:19:23.769
very blurry. It's really hard to specify and
that's because the idea is not a single thing

00:19:23.769 --> 00:19:29.970
that happens in an instant; it's a much more
evolutionary process, a much slower process.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:39.480
Now, when you think about the process of innovation
as something that is built around hunches,

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:44.989
and it built around ideas from other people
colliding and being mixed in other ways, it

00:19:44.989 --> 00:19:49.960
sets up, I think, a lot of different assumptions
about the kind of tools that you use to make

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:55.390
sense of these ideas and to keep track of
them. So, for many years, I've been using

00:19:55.390 --> 00:20:00.239
this piece of software--I think I may have
talked about this in one of the times I was

00:20:00.239 --> 00:20:04.289
here in the past-- that is called Devonthink.
How many people have seen Devonthink? Anybody

00:20:04.289 --> 00:20:09.190
else? Yeah, a couple folks have seen it. I
should get royalties from these people. I

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:12.549
think I've about this. This is an obscure,
German software company that makes this thing;

00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:19.070
it's Mac only, but I've been using it for
a long time. And it is my version of the Commonplace

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:25.169
Book, although, I'm working on something that
will be a little bit different that may replace

00:20:25.169 --> 00:20:32.210
this. For years, I've been keeping digital
clips of quotes that I find useful from books,

00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:38.759
anticipating that software like this was gonna
come around. So, initially, I would actually

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:44.200
just take the book and I would type in the
excerpts. I tried OCR-ing the books to get

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:48.220
the text in there, which never really works
very well. I had this amazing technology called

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:53.080
A Research Assistant, but it's fantastic,
very accurate and just a little more expensive

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.700
than some of the other techniques to get the
quotes in digital form. And now, of course,

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.809
because of e-books, it's getting easier and
easier, although it's harder than it should

00:20:59.809 --> 00:21:05.809
be which I will get back to. To get quotes
from books and put them, store them here.

00:21:05.809 --> 00:21:09.609
So, I've collected, I don't know what it is
now, six thousand fragments from books and

00:21:09.609 --> 00:21:15.190
from webpages and various things that I found
that I've been working on for basically 12

00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:21.639
or 13 years. And so, I've curated this Commonplace
Book of interesting ideas that I don't know

00:21:21.639 --> 00:21:25.320
really where they're gonna be useful or what
they're gonna be good for, but I've been storing

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:30.499
them around and porting them along from computer
to computer. Now, what Devonthink does is

00:21:30.499 --> 00:21:37.720
it lets me store all that stuff, but basically
it lets me do a pretty smart, semantic analysis

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:43.610
of text of these little snippets so that I
can select one and say, "Show me things that

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:48.630
are like this." Right? So, I use it sometimes
as a straight search query where I'm like,

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:52.510
"I need to find that one passage about turtles."
And so, I search for turtles and I find it.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:58.310
But the interesting use that I have for it
is I use in an improvisational way, right?

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:04.460
I use it an idea association generating way
as a triggering tool, not just as a search

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.900
and retrieval tool. And so, I'll take a passage
that I'm interested in and I'll say, "Show

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.450
me other things that are like this. Do you
wanna think?" And it'll give me this list

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:16.369
of things. Sometimes, I will write a passage
in my own words and I'll say, "Show me things

00:22:16.369 --> 00:22:19.830
that are like this passage that I've just
written," because the number of things that

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:23.529
you've, of course, forgotten that you've read,
even things that you really love and found

00:22:23.529 --> 00:22:27.109
interesting is immense. You forget much, much
more than you remember, right? So, keeping

00:22:27.109 --> 00:22:32.019
this outboard memory is extremely valuable
to me. But what's crucial about it, is that

00:22:32.019 --> 00:22:35.639
it's not everything. It's not everything I've
ever read, it's not everything in every book

00:22:35.639 --> 00:22:40.029
thatâ€™s ever been written. It's massively
filtered by my own interests, my decisions

00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:44.500
to read a certain book and then my decisions
to pick these passages as being the most important

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:50.519
ones. But it also has this noise to it, right?
It's not tremendously accurate. Oftentimes,

00:22:50.519 --> 00:22:54.850
the number one result will be the next paragraph
from that book that I've quoted at the beginning

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:58.570
to start the search query, and I'm like, "Yes,
do you even think I know that passage is interesting?

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:05.369
I just read it." And sometimes it'll be irrelevant,
but the noise, the surprise and serendipity

00:23:05.369 --> 00:23:11.739
that you get from the software suggesting
things that are kind of off but not totally

00:23:11.739 --> 00:23:18.970
off, has generated a number of trains of association
and some of which have led to entire chapters

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:24.009
of books that I've writ. And so, there's a
very interesting question, which of course,

00:23:24.009 --> 00:23:29.749
you all wrestle with all the time, which is
"When I have that idea, when there's an idea

00:23:29.749 --> 00:23:34.399
suggested to me in association between something
I've read and something else I've read, and

00:23:34.399 --> 00:23:40.309
it leads to something as substantive as a
chapter in a book. Who's having that idea?"

00:23:40.309 --> 00:23:45.289
Is it me or the software, all right? On some
level, obviously it takes me to curate it,

00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:50.669
it takes my intelligence to curate, my intelligence
to recognize that that's the valuable connection

00:23:50.669 --> 00:23:53.629
and my intelligence to then build a whole
chapter out of it, and that's important. I

00:23:53.629 --> 00:23:58.179
still have value in that chain, right? But
I probably wouldn't have made the connection

00:23:58.179 --> 00:24:02.851
without the associative intelligence of the
software. And so, in a real sense, it's a

00:24:02.851 --> 00:24:08.359
duet between these two different--very different--kinds
of intelligence collaborating on new ways

00:24:08.359 --> 00:24:14.129
of thinking. So it's the beginning of that
digital Commonplace Book I think that could

00:24:14.129 --> 00:24:20.070
be so powerful if we keep working on this.
But it's not just environment; it's like software

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:24.120
where ideas come together, where hunches can
collide with other hunches. I also spend a

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:29.729
lot of time in the book looking at physical
environments, I've got some insight; physical

00:24:29.729 --> 00:24:34.289
environments that have been unusually innovative,
real world environments where people get together,

00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:38.659
where ideas get together and I look at environments.
It's like office environments and cities and

00:24:38.659 --> 00:24:42.749
things like that. Well, one of my favorites,
which I've now written about in a couple of

00:24:42.749 --> 00:24:49.179
books, is the coffeehouse of the 18th Century.
The coffeehouse, particularly in London and

00:24:49.179 --> 00:24:55.679
Paris and in Vienna and a little bit in Boston
and United States, the coffeehouse was a tremendous

00:24:55.679 --> 00:25:00.869
driver of innovation in this period and just
an amazing number of really world-changing

00:25:00.869 --> 00:25:05.980
ideas in science and in politics and religion
and in business, technology, have somewhere

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:14.879
in their story a coffeehouse. And the question
is why? What is it about this space that made

00:25:14.879 --> 00:25:21.629
it so generative? What were the core ingredients
that made it so powerful? Now, one answer

00:25:21.629 --> 00:25:25.700
which is important but a little off-topic,
is the fact that they were drinking coffee,

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:30.929
right? I mean, this is not a trivial thing,
right, because until coffee and tea became

00:25:30.929 --> 00:25:39.019
affordable for mass audiences, the daytime
beverage of choice for both mass and elite

00:25:39.019 --> 00:25:43.870
people was alcohol. It was the safe thing
to drink because the water wasn't safe to

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.240
drink; it was the healthy choice, basically.
So, people would wake up and they would have

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.629
some beer with breakfast and then would have
a little more beer during the morning and

00:25:49.629 --> 00:25:52.700
they'd have some wine at lunch and in the
1600s, they drank a lot of gin. Gin was the

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:57.639
big craze in the 1600s. And so, you really,
truly had a population that was just drunk

00:25:57.639 --> 00:26:02.919
all day long. That was the standard state
of existence in society. And so, it's--sounds

00:26:02.919 --> 00:26:08.320
like a joke--but it's not an accident that
when a society moves from a depressant to

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:13.659
a stimulant in their daily intake, they're
gonna have better ideas as a society.

00:26:13.659 --> 00:26:14.659
[laughter]

00:26:14.659 --> 00:26:17.440
It's just gonna happen. So for those of you
who spend all day drinking alcohol, you should

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.450
think about, and one of the key takeaways;
my talk is maybe wanna switch to coffee.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:27.799
But it wasn't just the coffee. What was so
important about these environments is that

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:34.929
they were hubs where different interests and
passions and hobbies were able to collide

00:26:34.929 --> 00:26:40.179
and connect with each other in surprising
new ways, right? When Ben Franklin would hang

00:26:40.179 --> 00:26:47.039
out at the London coffeehouse near St. Paul's,
he would have this group called the Club of

00:26:47.039 --> 00:26:50.749
Honest Whigs. This was during the period of
time, the long period of time when Franklin

00:26:50.749 --> 00:26:55.649
was in London and they would meet every fortnight
and they would hang out and they would have

00:26:55.649 --> 00:26:59.840
these five hour long sessions where they would
just talk about the American political situation

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:04.769
and the science of electricity and new developments
in chemistry and business models and all this

00:27:04.769 --> 00:27:09.179
kind of stuff. And it was precisely because
the space wasn't so structured; it wasn't

00:27:09.179 --> 00:27:14.149
an office environment, it wasn't a lecture,
but it wasn't completely chaotic and disorganized.

00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:18.860
It was in this middle zone that I call "the
liquid network," where ideas were free to

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:25.979
bounce off each other and collide and take
these new forms. It was the multi-disciplinary

00:27:25.979 --> 00:27:32.309
nature of the space that made it so powerful.
And, in fact, went back to London when I was

00:27:32.309 --> 00:27:36.720
writing this last book, "The Invention of
Air", to see if there was any plaque or anything,

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.309
but this London coffeehouse was absolutely
just an amazingly historic place for so many

00:27:40.309 --> 00:27:43.999
different reasons, and there's no record of
it anywhere, except there is a Starbucks basically

00:27:43.999 --> 00:27:44.999
right where it used to be.

00:27:44.999 --> 00:27:50.629
So, they're holding, they're keeping the torch
alive, basically, for the memory of it. And

00:27:50.629 --> 00:27:55.830
so, it's that kind of environment, that liquid
fluid environment, where there's a lot of

00:27:55.830 --> 00:28:00.869
diversity in the points of view and in the
hobbies of all the people there that you're

00:28:00.869 --> 00:28:09.549
so often the generator of innovation. Now,
in biological terms, there's a clear parallel

00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:16.370
here in terms of the importance of diversity
and multi-disciplinary thinking. It's a somewhat

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:21.789
awkward word, but I find it really useful;
it's worth knowing. Originally coined by Steven

00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:27.110
Jay Gould and Elizabeth Verba about 30 years
ago in a paper about the mechanisms of innovation

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:35.090
in evolution. And the word for it is "exaptation."
And exaptation is the idea that there is a

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:42.019
feature of some kind, that is sculpted by
evolution for a certain purpose. It turns

00:28:42.019 --> 00:28:46.649
out, when the environment changes for some
reason or some new possibility opens up, turns

00:28:46.649 --> 00:28:50.840
out to be good at something else that wasn't
the original point of that feature, of that

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.249
trait. So, the classic example is feathers,
right? Feathers originally evolved, we think,

00:28:55.249 --> 00:28:59.321
for thermal regulation, for just keeping an
organism warm and it turned out that some

00:28:59.321 --> 00:29:04.159
of the feather owners decided to adopt this
crazy new lifestyle of flying and the ones

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:07.600
that had feathers were suddenly better at
it. And so after that point, feathers started

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.789
to get sculpted by selection to be more aerodynamic.
In fact, you can see a very clear difference

00:29:11.789 --> 00:29:16.389
in the feathers of flying birds versus non-flying
birds, because non-flying birds' feathers

00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:20.669
are perfectly symmetrical, which makes them
less aerodynamic. So, what Gould and Verba

00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:28.499
were saying is that that's a big driver of
new lifestyles and new features and new functionality

00:29:28.499 --> 00:29:32.139
in the evolutionary record, which is that
things designed for one thing turn out to

00:29:32.139 --> 00:29:36.639
be good some surprising new use down the line;
it's not just driven by mutation, but it's

00:29:36.639 --> 00:29:42.309
driven by this kind of migration across different
uses. So, something is exapted for a new purpose.

00:29:42.309 --> 00:29:48.489
That's the way you use that phrase. And it
turns out that the history of technology is

00:29:48.489 --> 00:29:51.620
replete with examples of exaptation, right?
I mean, think of all the ways in which the

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.130
Web has been exapted to do all these things
that Tim Berners-Lee never dreamed of, right?

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:59.820
That's so much of what we do in this business
is take old things and put them to new uses

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.899
that were not in the minds of their creators
by any means. But it actually dates back to

00:30:04.899 --> 00:30:10.429
early technology, so when Gutenberg was coming
up with the original technology of the printing

00:30:10.429 --> 00:30:15.490
press, he'd done this amazing work with movable
type and with inks he'd had this state of

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:19.899
the art technology because of his skills of
a metallurgist, but he didn't actually have

00:30:19.899 --> 00:30:26.619
a pressing mechanism for all this. And so,
he's missing this key component and so he's

00:30:26.619 --> 00:30:31.570
stuck. And so, it turns out to be wine grape
harvesting season in Rhineland, Germany, so

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.020
he goes up to the hills and decides to drink
some wine because coffee wasn't available

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:37.020
yet.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:42.861
And he's hanging out there and one day looks
over and he sees this ancient technology,

00:30:42.861 --> 00:30:48.029
the screw press, which is being used to press
grapes and has been around for two thousand

00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:55.130
years. And he looks at it and he's like, "Hahaha,
that's what I need." And so he exapts this

00:30:55.130 --> 00:31:02.119
very old machine designed to press grapes
and reconfigures it, remixes it, and turns

00:31:02.119 --> 00:31:10.080
it into a machine for printing Bibles. And
so, that kind of borrowing of ideas of across

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.479
their original uses and across disciplines
is really a crucial part of it; the history

00:31:14.479 --> 00:31:19.789
of innovation. Now, this has an interesting
implication, which is that there is conceptual,

00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:26.249
all creative value that comes from surrounding
yourselves with a diverse set of influences.

00:31:26.249 --> 00:31:30.659
There was a really interesting study a number
of years ago by a Stanford Business School

00:31:30.659 --> 00:31:38.159
professor named Martin Roif, who looked at
unusually innovative people in corporate America

00:31:38.159 --> 00:31:43.880
and entrepreneurs and looked at their social
networks, not their Facebook, Twitter networks,

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:51.129
but the people that they actually know. And
then compared their social networks to folks

00:31:51.129 --> 00:31:54.979
who were--to put it nicely--less innovative
in their careers, which is, by the way, the

00:31:54.979 --> 00:31:57.739
part of the experiment you don't want to be
asked to participate in. When they call you

00:31:57.739 --> 00:32:01.320
up and say, "You seem very dull. Could we
talk to you a bit about your friends?" Don't

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.349
answer the phone, right?

00:32:03.349 --> 00:32:04.349
[laughter]

00:32:04.349 --> 00:32:07.649
So, Roif looks at all these things and what
he finds is that unusually innovative people

00:32:07.649 --> 00:32:11.519
have this very distinct pattern in their social
networks, which is that they have strong and

00:32:11.519 --> 00:32:17.070
weak tie connections to a much more diverse
range of professions, right? So, they work

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:21.620
in an ad agency, but they're friends with
an architect, a Web developer and a Popular

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:26.809
Science writer and government contract writer,
a lawyer and a plumber. Whereas, the less

00:32:26.809 --> 00:32:31.219
innovative people are just friends with other
people who work in ad agencies. And what I

00:32:31.219 --> 00:32:35.389
think that shows is that in a sense, the power,
the creative power of exaptation, you're an

00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:38.850
architect and you're talking to your Web developer
friend and there's something in the way that

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.831
the Web developer deals with his kind of work
flow that turns out to be really interesting.

00:32:42.831 --> 00:32:46.359
If you poured it over architecture, it does
something new and it gets you out of your

00:32:46.359 --> 00:32:50.940
conventional way of thinking about the world.
And so, where you end up when you think about

00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:58.350
things that way is in a sense the non-political
argument for diversity. It's not that we'll

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:03.519
be better as a society and more tolerant to
society if we surround ourselves with people

00:33:03.519 --> 00:33:09.599
who are different from us. That is certainly
true, but also, that will be smarter on some

00:33:09.599 --> 00:33:12.849
level. We'll be more original in our thinking
if we surround ourselves with people who have

00:33:12.849 --> 00:33:18.679
different interests. And that's part of the
reason why people with hobbies are so innovative

00:33:18.679 --> 00:33:23.239
in their careers; it's because hobbies, in
a sense, give you that kind of coffeehouse

00:33:23.239 --> 00:33:26.850
environment, even when you're by yourself,
right? Because you're constantly bouncing

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:31.019
back and forth between different kinds of
projects and different interests. One of the

00:33:31.019 --> 00:33:40.679
things that happened after Gutenberg is the
printer and the printer's workshop became

00:33:40.679 --> 00:33:45.529
the coffeehouse of this period. This is one
of Gutenberg's original disciples who went

00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:50.029
on to; he's Peter Schiffer, who went on to
become actually the first financially successful

00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:55.849
printer because Gutenberg was kind of a disaster
as a businessman. But Schiffer built this

00:33:55.849 --> 00:34:01.039
printing business and it became this really
interesting hub where all these different

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:04.629
people from the community--you had religious
people coming to talk about the Bibles, you

00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:09.800
had technology who wanted to help build the
machines, you had businessmen who were coming

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:14.039
in to think about investing in this and you
had the secular, intellectual groups, such

00:34:14.039 --> 00:34:17.450
as they were, the protoscientists and things
like that hanging out because this is where

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:23.280
the ideas were. And so, you had this interesting
hub that was created by this technology, but

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:30.710
supported this interesting space of diversity
that led to the early, late-Renaissance, early

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:40.550
enlightenment stuff that the book unleashed.
Now, one of the things that Schiffer did in

00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:46.500
the years after the first printing presses
were created, it's a wonderful period to study

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.139
and there've been a bunch of interesting pieces,
written about Clay Shirky has written about

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:55.080
it a little bit and talked about it recently,
because in a sense, what happens all these

00:34:55.080 --> 00:35:00.240
early printers, is that they have this feature
war that breaks out where they're printing

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.430
new books and they're talking about the new
books that they're doing, but they also start

00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:07.950
innovating in terms of the features included
in their books. So, they start saying, "Hey,

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:12.339
we've got a new index," or "we've got this
new way of organizing of the pages," or "we've

00:35:12.339 --> 00:35:16.990
got this new supplementary material." And
literally, the language they use sounds like

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:22.539
the language we use to describe new software
features. So, this right here is this edition

00:35:22.539 --> 00:35:29.140
of St. Augustine's, "On the Art of Printing,"
which was published in 1467, I think it was.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:34.750
And it is, we believe, the first printed book
to have an alphabetized index. You see it's

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:38.160
alphabetical down the side. They don't actually
have page numbers, where we didn't have Arabic

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:43.200
page numbers for another hundred years; it
hadn't become standardized. But this idea

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.109
of alphabetizing all these things that you
could go and find things, in some fashion,

00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:53.120
which is big innovation and Schiffer's description
of the book actually included this plug that

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.859
said, "You know, the index is worth the price
of the book alone. It makes it much more easy

00:35:57.859 --> 00:36:01.890
to use." So, he's literally like, 'it's user
friendly! You should adopt this book cause

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:05.010
of these new features we have. It's got a
great interface for finding the information."

00:36:05.010 --> 00:36:12.180
This is 15th century search technology right
here, is what you're seeing. Now, what's cool

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:15.359
about this is the idea that they were competing,
although the problem with it is that each

00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:18.910
new feature would come out every 20 years.
It was an arms race, but it was very slow

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:26.780
arms race between all the competing printers.
But, when all of these things coalesced, when

00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:32.279
you developed page numbers, when you had alphabetical
indexes, when you created a system of citation

00:36:32.279 --> 00:36:37.369
and footnotes and all that kind of stuff and
a reliable way of storing these books, that

00:36:37.369 --> 00:36:45.200
became a platform that sustained alongside
the coffeehouse, a lot of the great, amazing,

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.109
extraordinary, world-changing innovations
of the enlightenment, because you had a whole

00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:55.610
system of agreeing on where the information
was and how to point to it, right? There was

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:59.549
a whole standardized way of saying, "Here's
this idea that somebody has and now I'm gonna

00:36:59.549 --> 00:37:03.870
build on top of that idea and we've agreed
on a way to figure out where it is, what it's

00:37:03.870 --> 00:37:09.819
address is, and how we point to it." And it
was from these early innovations coming together

00:37:09.819 --> 00:37:14.089
to form the standardized platform that everyone
adopted, basically, in terms of scientific

00:37:14.089 --> 00:37:21.539
reference. It became one of the key architectural
frameworks that made the enlightenment possible.

00:37:21.539 --> 00:37:25.059
So, you know the parallel here, right? You
know where I'm going with this, right? This

00:37:25.059 --> 00:37:31.220
is exactly what Berners-Lee did; this is exactly
what this business was built around; this

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:36.000
world-changing consensus of agreeing where
the information lives and how to point to

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.500
it. That created a platform that enabled this
company and enabled millions of other businesses

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:46.660
and non-profits and amazing innovations that
have happened because we had this kind of

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:53.170
standard agreement about where the information
was and how to get people to it, right? Now,

00:37:53.170 --> 00:37:58.819
the question is what is happening now with
that agreement and that platform? And that's

00:37:58.819 --> 00:38:04.270
really what I wanna just say a couple of words
about, then we can answer some questions and

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:08.339
I'm happy to sign books because there's this
big article that Chris Anderson did, The Web

00:38:08.339 --> 00:38:14.279
is Dead, and all this talk about apps and
things like that. And the truth is I'm not

00:38:14.279 --> 00:38:19.829
so worried about the app world because there's
a lot of what's happening in apps that is

00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:24.500
not necessarily, we don't necessarily need
to have it be linkable in the way that we

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:28.329
have. I mean, nobody needs to link to one
particular screen of angry birds. I think

00:38:28.329 --> 00:38:33.410
that's all right if you lose that ability
to point to that information, right? But there

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:38.680
is information that is going to be built and
stored in the app world that will be unlinkable,

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:44.420
or we haven't figured out a way to make it
linkable. But more importantly, there is a

00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:50.049
massive influx of information and really the
best information in the world that is coming

00:38:50.049 --> 00:38:54.720
online at an incredible speed or becoming
digital at incredible speed is because of

00:38:54.720 --> 00:39:00.680
e-books, all right? My last book, I think,
two percent were in e-book format; this book

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:08.240
will 20 to25 percent in e-books, right? Within
two years we've had two percent to 20 percent.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:12.980
This is actually faster way of than I think
we saw with the original Web in '94, '95,

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:18.279
'96. And that's really extraordinary. And
right now, all that information is digital,

00:39:18.279 --> 00:39:25.240
so it should be part of this whole world,
part of this platform, it should be the ideal

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:30.380
mechanism for creating commonplace books.
It should be a fantastic mechanism for going

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.050
in and pointing to things and citing them
and building platforms and doing all the amazing

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:37.910
things that we've done on the Web and open
up all space for innovation on the Web. We

00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:40.920
should be able to that with the world's best
information; the information that's stored

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:49.260
in books, but it's not quite working right
the way it is now. We don't fully agree on

00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:55.930
a standard of how you link like cite a particular
point in a book, right? The Kindle has locations;

00:39:55.930 --> 00:40:01.450
they've done away with page numbers altogether.
You can point to a particular page, in a google

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:05.750
book edition online, and that can work, but
that's not the standard reference URL for

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:11.579
that page. And being able to move text around
and grab a quote and put it somewhere else,

00:40:11.579 --> 00:40:16.440
put in on a Devonthink, share it, send it
to a friend, is very complicated--the new

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.869
Google Book Reader, as far as I can tell,
does not allow you to copy text at all in

00:40:19.869 --> 00:40:24.299
any form. I may be wrong about that, but it
seems from my experiments with it in the last

00:40:24.299 --> 00:40:30.720
two days, it doesn't seem like you can actually
select text and copy it. And it seems to me,

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:36.150
I understand why publishers and authors guilds,
I mean, I'm going against my constituency

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:40.490
here in saying this, but I know that the publishing
industry is the driving force behind this

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:43.059
and they're saying, "No, no, no. We don't
want to have another Napster for books." And

00:40:43.059 --> 00:40:47.329
they're all concerned about words getting
out there. But it seems to me, at a certain

00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:51.160
point, the whole point of having digital text
is that you can do stuff with it. You can

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.741
move it around, you can take it into new environments,
you can borrow it, and repurpose it and remix

00:40:54.741 --> 00:41:01.010
in all these different ways. And when we have
software that keeps you from actually being

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:06.940
able to just select a paragraph and paste
it somewhere else, but that's not a feature

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:11.220
we'd like to have, or something that would
be nice to have. That's almost an inalienable

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:16.280
right of digital text in this age, right?
Copy and paste within limits, right? Put limits

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:19.290
on it, so you can only copy and paste ten
percent of this book, that's fine. We can

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:25.119
establish those things. Fair use limits is
perfectly appropriate. But to not allow it

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:29.510
at all, to have the words, in a sense, behind
glass there where you can't touch them and

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:33.640
move them around, I think is a great mistake
because we have this wonderful opportunity

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:39.930
to build a new platform with a whole new trove
of information that's out there. And so, to

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:46.069
me, the overarching message of this book is
we spent a lot of time historically thinking

00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:52.380
about new ideas and innovation in terms of
the importance of protecting those ideas.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:56.890
Keeping them locked up in R&amp;D labs, wrapping
them around in intellectual property laws

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:02.660
and patents as best as we can, and making
sure that they're hidden away so they're valuable,

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.589
but I think what's happens when you look at
the history of innovation from the perspective

00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:10.349
of these different patterns, both in the online
world and the history of science, even in

00:42:10.349 --> 00:42:18.890
the history of nature, is that we do ourselves
a disservice if we only emphasize the protective

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:23.440
side of information. That, in fact, there
is oftentimes more value and more creativity

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:28.990
that comes from connecting ideas; making those
new links and building platforms to make those

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:34.619
connections easy to make. Thank you very much
for listening.

00:42:34.619 --> 00:42:35.619
[applause]

00:42:35.619 --> 00:42:42.980
&gt;&gt;Steven: OK, we got a few minutes for questions
about any of this stuff?

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:49.039
If anybody's working on the e-book side, I
would love to hear what you are thinking of.

00:42:49.039 --> 00:42:52.970
I'd like to learn, take this opportunity to
steal some ideas from you all. Yeah?

00:42:52.970 --> 00:43:02.490
&gt;&gt;audience #1: I was interested by--

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:05.660
&gt;&gt;Steven: OK.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:07.250
[laughter]

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:15.460
&gt;&gt;audience #1: OK, so I was interested in
your discussion of the feature wars in the

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.250
early days of printing with moveable type.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:22.769
Can you tell us about any innovative features
introduced in that time that didn't work out

00:43:22.769 --> 00:43:24.339
and that we don't remember today?

00:43:24.339 --> 00:43:33.910
&gt;&gt;Steven: Oh, that's a really good question.
That's a great way of approaching-- I'm trying

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:42.130
to think if there's anything that jumps to
mind. One of the things I'm really interested

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:49.950
in terms of the history of ideas is that kind
of reverse history, where we tend to tell

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:56.540
the history of the winners. And it's just
as important, I think, to look at two different

00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:00.299
kinds of losers. I'm gonna give a theoretical
answer because I can't think of a good concrete

00:44:00.299 --> 00:44:06.380
example. There are two different kinds of
losers that are worth studying. The first

00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:12.640
is, the good idea that failed, right? So,
in the book, one of the things I talk about,

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.650
I'm sure this is familiar to most people in
this audience; one of the most fascinating

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:20.950
stories in the history of technology was Charles
Babbage. And basically, inventing the computer,

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:28.160
the digital computer in the middle of the
19th century, with Ada Lovelace, the first

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:35.300
programmer; Lord Byron's daughter, helping
him. It's such a cool story because he was

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:40.260
literally a hundred years ahead of his time,
which almost never happens, right? It's amazing

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:47.269
how reliably ideas come at the right time;
people really jump a hundred years ahead.

00:44:47.269 --> 00:44:52.779
And what Babbage was trying to do was build
a programmable computer with steam industrial

00:44:52.779 --> 00:44:56.140
era parts. He was trying to build a steam-powered
programmable computer and you just couldn't

00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:02.619
do it, right? So, that's one way in which--
his idea, as visionary as it was, it was so

00:45:02.619 --> 00:45:06.380
far ahead of its time, it died out and most
of the principles had to be rediscovered a

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:10.621
hundred years later when people started actually
to build computers with vacuum tubes and so

00:45:10.621 --> 00:45:14.580
on. So, there are ideas that fail because
they are good, but they're just ahead of their

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:21.490
time in some kind of way. The other question
is ideas that in a sense are bad ideas that

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:25.819
stick around for too long. This is a big thing
that I think intellectuals historians should

00:45:25.819 --> 00:45:32.720
spend more time on; the history of being wrong.
Because no doubt, we're all walking around

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:38.990
with our own biases or misunderstandings of
the world that 30 years from now, or a hundred

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:43.779
years from now, we're gonna go, "How were
we so stupid?" Right? And trying to figure

00:45:43.779 --> 00:45:47.750
out how those ideas have historically stayed
in place for such a long time. In the "Ghost

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:52.030
Map", the theory of the Miasma theory, the
cholera being in the air is one of those.

00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:55.010
Like, why did it stick around for as long
as it did? I think it's a really interesting

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:59.599
kind of problem. So, to totally fail to answer
your question, but hopefully say something

00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:04.380
interesting, I think that going back and looking
at innovations that failed, either because

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:12.200
they were wrong or poorly designed, but interesting.
Or innovations that were so good that people

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:16.299
couldn't deal with them yet on some level.
That's a really fertile field of discovery.

00:46:16.299 --> 00:46:17.779
Go ahead.

00:46:17.779 --> 00:46:23.670
&gt;&gt;audience #2: I'd be interested in your take
on a classic question from the history of

00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:26.730
technology, which is, are innovations inevitable?

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:31.569
Or, meaning, could ideas come together by
someone who just puts them together in the

00:46:31.569 --> 00:46:35.390
right way or is it a matter of genius, or
a matter of an individualâ€™s contribution

00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:39.720
seeing things that maybe are apparent to others,
but who they fail to put together?

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.109
&gt;&gt;Steven: Yeah. It's a great question. By
the way, another fantastic book that deals

00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:47.000
with this and maybe a little bit more, although
I talk about this is Kevin Kelley's book,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.269
"What Technology Wants". I'm sure Kevin has
been here, or is coming here yet.

00:46:50.269 --> 00:46:51.269
[laughter]

00:46:51.269 --> 00:46:53.760
Two weeks ago, there you go. Kevin and I,
we did a fun event near a public library,

00:46:53.760 --> 00:47:01.809
which is online, actually. And we talked about
this quite a bit. There's a term for it, which

00:47:01.809 --> 00:47:06.109
is the multiple, right? In the history of
science and technology where they're again

00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:10.880
and again, there are these multiple, independent
discoveries, or inventions, or the same basic,

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:17.030
the same thing, happening without direct interaction
between the participants and it just, there

00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:22.769
are like, 150 of them in the canon of big
ideas that are out there and have been collected.

00:47:22.769 --> 00:47:28.820
And historically, it's been described in this
very vague zeitgeisty way. Like, something

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:39.950
was in the air, and I think that in saying
that these ideas on some level are inevitable,

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:44.540
that you reach a certain point and someone
will figure out how to build a personal computer,

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:51.750
digital computer, a phone, is true. It doesn't
mean there aren't geniuses, right? This book

00:47:51.750 --> 00:47:57.040
is not against the idea that some people are,
by nature of their genes or their education

00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:02.160
and probably some mix of that; some people
are smarter than other people. So, whoever

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.280
it is who gets to discover that thing in that
particular moment of time is gonna be more

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.480
likely to be someone who's smart and well-educated
than someone who's not, but it's very, very

00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:15.080
hard for someone to have that insight at the
wrong time, right? It's impossible to invent

00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:19.240
a microwave oven in 1650. It just cannot be
done, right. There are just limitations on

00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:24.759
that. So, the example that's very close to
my heart is, in The Invention of Air, the

00:48:24.759 --> 00:48:29.440
hero of that book is Joseph Priestly, who
is most famous for isolating oxygen for the

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:34.760
first time. He's known as the discoverer of
oxygen, although when he did it, he called

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:39.099
it "dephilostigated air" instead of oxygen,
which was not a very good brand and didn't

00:48:39.099 --> 00:48:44.540
really stick. And it turned out that actually,
two other people, Lavoisier and Scheele, the

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:52.180
Swedish, I believe, scientist, also isolated
oxygen within about a year; somewhere between

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:57.029
1772 and 1774. Three people, more or less
independently, have isolated oxygen for the

00:48:57.029 --> 00:49:02.211
first time. So, weird, right? How did that
happen, right? But when you go back and look

00:49:02.211 --> 00:49:07.490
at it, you realize that there are a set of
supporting platforms that basically make that

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:12.779
thought thinkable for the first time, right
around that period. And some of it is technology,

00:49:12.779 --> 00:49:17.420
right? One of the key things that they has
is they developed, in the 1750s, very accurate

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:23.099
scales. And part of the way that they could
figure out that oxygen was something was that

00:49:23.099 --> 00:49:30.259
when you burn things, they got ever so slightly
heavier, right? Because of combustion and

00:49:30.259 --> 00:49:35.140
so, but you couldn't pick that out if you
didn't have really, really precise scales.

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:41.759
And the other thing they had was they discovered
vacuums about a century before. And up until

00:49:41.759 --> 00:49:45.839
the discovery of a vacuum, people never thought
of the air as been something you study; it

00:49:45.839 --> 00:49:49.900
was just this empty space between things.
If you were gonna use this great, new scientific

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.019
method, you wanted to study a tree or a body
or a rock, but why would you study the stuff

00:49:54.019 --> 00:49:56.900
between all those things, right? But then
they figured out that there was this thing

00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:01.829
called a vacuum, which seemed to look just
like air, but not be air. And so, it suddenly

00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:06.819
suggested this idea that there was something
between us all that we could study. So, without

00:50:06.819 --> 00:50:11.289
unlocking that as a kind of a paradigm that
you could get interested in, you couldn't

00:50:11.289 --> 00:50:18.019
even start to solve the problem. So, I think
what happens is there are these stages and

00:50:18.019 --> 00:50:22.040
the technology advances, the perspectives
advance and they unlock a whole new set of

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:25.519
possibilities. In the book, I call this the
adjacent possible, which is a phrase from

00:50:25.519 --> 00:50:30.900
Stewart Kaufman. And then who actually explores
the adjacent possible, some of it is luck,

00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:37.769
some of it is environment, some of it is education,
some of it is skills, mental skills, curiosity,

00:50:37.769 --> 00:50:41.559
but there are many, many doors that can't
be unlocked until you get to the next level,

00:50:41.559 --> 00:50:43.809
which is suddenly sounding like a video game,
but anyway.

00:50:43.809 --> 00:50:49.900
That's the video game theory of scientific
creativity. All right. We probably have a

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:50.900
little bit of time, yeah?

00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:55.970
&gt;&gt;audience #3: So, this isn't exactly a question
about your book, but I was wondering if you

00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:01.170
could say a little biographical background,
what led you to write about the things that

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:02.170
you've written about--

00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:03.170
&gt;&gt;Steven: Yeah.

00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:06.910
&gt;&gt;audience #3: and have the entrepreneurial
experiences that you've had. What's your background?

00:51:06.910 --> 00:51:14.349
&gt;&gt;Steven: Yes. Sure. Well, it's very funny
because I'm more often than not described

00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:18.400
as a science writer, which is hilarious because
I have no scientific training, whatsoever.

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.490
My parents are still like, "We saw your biology
grades in high school." Like, this is ridiculous;

00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:28.520
what's going on? Well, my background is media
theory. I did graduate work at Columbia in

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:32.200
English Literature, actually. And I studied
the 19th century metropolitan novel, so I

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.829
spent a lot of time on the cultural history
of London and the city. So, some of "Ghost

00:51:35.829 --> 00:51:42.549
Map" is out of that, but I always had a technology
interest. And so, when I was still in grad

00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:48.539
school, I started "Feed", the first online
magazine that had established writers writing

00:51:48.539 --> 00:51:55.170
for it. And really, in a way, that's become
a lot more common now. It built my writing

00:51:55.170 --> 00:52:00.480
career by publishing myself and my friends
at my web scene, basically. We didn't have

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:04.970
blogs back then, we had web magazines. And
so I sold my first book, which was "Interface

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:11.300
Culture", about technology and interfaces
on the backs of my experience with "Feed".

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:16.660
So, it was the first generation of writers
who built a career for themselves through

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:22.130
the self-publishing mechanism of the Web,
which is now much more commonplace. And then

00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:26.109
at a certain point after I wrote that book,
I looked at my shelf and realized the last

00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:31.440
30 book I've read were all science books and
that was just the direction my brain was going

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:36.789
in. So, I thought, "OK, maybe I could try
and do that myself." And so, I wrote "Emergence",

00:52:36.789 --> 00:52:42.510
which is half technology, half science, half
urban theory I guess. And I loved so much

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:46.599
this moving back and forth between different
disciplines; all the things I was talking

00:52:46.599 --> 00:52:51.650
about today. And the only other thing that's
interesting I would say about my career is

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:57.190
that I've done these little start-ups while
writing the books. And the start-ups, in a

00:52:57.190 --> 00:53:01.540
way, are hobbies that I was talking about,
right? I think of myself primarily as an author,

00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:06.070
but I love going off and starting some new
Web thing and actually going and hanging out

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:11.359
with human beings and talking to them and
building something together. And each start-up

00:53:11.359 --> 00:53:17.290
I've done has had a direct connection to something
that I was writing, in one way or another.

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:22.220
And so, Outside.in, the hyper-local service,
came out of writing "Ghost Map". I was writing

00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:26.400
about communities and maps and neighborhoods
and I was reading all these local bloggers

00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:31.660
in Brooklyn where I live. And truly, I actually
owe you all a thanks for this; the Google

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:35.410
Maps API had been released, so I was writing
about neighborhoods, communities, I was reading

00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:40.930
local bloggers and there's this new platform
of mapping that was suddenly possible. And

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:47.109
Outside.in is the intersection of those three
vectors, basically. The best thing about it

00:53:47.109 --> 00:53:51.670
is that I've been incredibly lucky that I
basically get to write about whatever I'm

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:56.810
interested in and sometimes my publisher is
like, "Wait, what are you writing a book about

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:59.720
18th century chemistry? What's going on?"
But most of the time, they've let me just

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:05.650
do these things and trusted me, which is a
great gig.

00:54:05.650 --> 00:54:08.730
All right. All right, thank you for coming
out. It's great to see you all here and I'd

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:09.730
be happy to sign some books.

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:09.819
