00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.380
Denial of service attacks have in been the news recently

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.160
and the recent ones have been something called

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.160
amplified distributed denial of service attacks.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.620
Um, this is a fairly straightforward thing...

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.060
but how we got here is quite interesting.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.700
Denial of service attacks have gone on for a

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.720
long long long long time. I can remember being 14, 15

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.580
and going on IRC which is like internet relay chat

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
like an old school chat service and irritating people

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.500
IRC to this day remains a haven for

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.500
the kind of script kiddie type,

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.700
the cracker type; the type that

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.180
has downloaded a few slightly dodgy scripts

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.860
off the Internet and think they are now an extremely

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.160
good hacker because of it

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520
I may have irritated - like - 14 year old me may have

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.520
irritated people sometimes

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.580
and...

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.740
my home internet connection got denial of service.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.400
At that point my internet connection was a 56k modem

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.880
It is incredibly easy to Denial of Service Attack those

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.940
Particularly if you happen to irritate someone who is on

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.540
an enormous university connection, at say, ha, 1 meg.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.560
which isn't that much bigger by today's standards but

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.540
in those days all it meant was they sent a little thing on

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.820
their system, which sends as much traffic as possible

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:13.860
to your system.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.580
And if their system is bigger than yours, well...

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.320
your internet connection gets saturated,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.740
you can't send anything in and out...

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.180
At which point I have to literally hang up the phone

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.420
to dial in again and get a new IP address

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.260
so they can't find me.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.480
And, that was how it worked for awhile.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.420
Uh, and then you started to get the criminals involved

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.920
who were writing botnets.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.020
Who were writing viruses that instead of destroying data,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.980
would go in and take over other people's internet connections.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.520
They would find broadband users, generally in

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.540
The United States or around there, who would...

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.080
[exasperated exhale]

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.100
Who would be running unsecured versions of

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.760
Windows XP or 98 or something like that...

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.980
They would quietly install their software in the background,

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.880
and then would use those unsuspecting users' internet

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.700
connections to launch a big denial of service attack.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.280
This was *distributed* denial of service so,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.740
Instead of having one big computer,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.380
you had lots of little computers,

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.200
Hundreds

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200
Maybe even thousands

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.900
Maybe tens of thousands

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.720
All sending as much traffic as they could

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.600
against one company.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.320
And it didn't matter how big that company's internet connection was...

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.580
Ultimately,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.360
ten thousand people all reloading their website or

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.900
turning out as much traffic as possible

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.400
as fast as possible

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.840
Yeah, it's gonna take down their network connection.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.760
And what was this used for? Well,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.880
Ransom..!

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.720
What you found in sort of the 2000s

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.060
was that gambling companies, finance companies,

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.280
anyone whose job, whose livelihood, depended on being

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.460
up and online all the time, was being held for ransom.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:48.380
They would get a call, an email, or a message

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.940
that said "If you don't pay us -an amount-

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.720
your website's gonna go down for quite a while."

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.920
There are defense strategies, sort of...

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.500
You can generally hire a very expensive company

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.480
to try and mitigate this, at which point

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.640
it does become a bit of a bit of a protection racket.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.040
But ultimately Microsoft got their act together

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.320
The number of zombie computers, as they were called,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.920
started falling down.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.100
And the internet started getting

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.540
more and more and more and more bandwidth.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.740
And you could hire a net connection that could

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.380
stand up to reasonable denial of service attacks for not too much.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.040
Now the new threat is something called Amplified Denial of Service.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.860
And it's not a new threat as such,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.100
it's just a new common threat that's been

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.040
theorized about for a while.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.280
And what it is is a combination of a couple of

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.980
vulnerabilities in how some very old parts of the internet work.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:37.800
Hold that thought,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.940
because I need to explain something else first.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.080
I need to explain the difference between TCP and UDP.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.900
TCP is how most of the web works.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.360
It's how the webpage that you're viewing-

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.180
the YouTube page you're viewing this in,

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.540
gets sent back and forth.

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.200
And it is a two way protocol,

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.620
there's a handshake involved.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.080
You request something,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.120
and then that request is acknowledged,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.820
and you get something back and as all the packets go

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.440
back and forth, there is two way conversation going on

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.300
making sure that everything's arrived

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.300
in the right order, intact.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.920
Which means you can use it for webpages, and use it for

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.300
financial transactions on your online bank.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.040
You can use it for anything where getting everything through

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.120
*bit perfect* is required.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.740
And then on the other hand, you have UDP.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.820
UDP is very much opposite of that. UDP is...

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.140
"Here is a stream of data...

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.700
just just

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.200
deal with it

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.960
As much as it

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.700
as much of it

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.320
as you can

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.140
as fast as you can

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.640
Just

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.140
just

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.640
deal with it!"

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.900
This is what you use for voice over IP

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.160
This is what you use for streaming video- live video.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.000
Anything where it doesn't matter if a bit of it gets lost

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.240
Or a bit of it arrives in the wrong order

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.740
Uh

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.440
I say bit

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.360
A part of it

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.140
Obviously

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.780
Bit... is a... thing with....

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.760
Uh- it doesn't matter if some of it arrives

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.000
a little bit malformed, as long as most of it gets through.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.020
Now the difference between those is that UDP

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.680
doesn't really have a handshake.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.980
You just kind of point a fire hose of data of something

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.680
and blast them with it.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.000
And because of that, well it means

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.520
you don't really have to acknowledge it

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.520
You don't have to say

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.300
"Yes! I approve this stream being sent to me."

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.940
It just kind of arrives and there's not much you can do about it...

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.320
There is a flaw in the UDP protocol,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.200
or at least in some implementations of it

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.280
and a few other subtle things around the internet

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.100
that means I can essentially spoof the return address.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.460
My computer here can claim

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.960
that I am someone else entirely.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:27.700
And that wouldn't normally be a problem

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.800
because most well-designed protocols-

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.620
and pretty much everything in the internet-

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.120
will only let you send on a small amount of data.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.880
I send a small request to them

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.180
They send a small request onwards

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.560
And it's not really a problem.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.680
Except

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.320
There is something called NTP,

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.260
The Network Time Protocol.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.620
And this is the thing that keeps all the clocks

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.240
in your phone and your laptop in sync to

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.420
almost to the milisecond.

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:56.960
Wonderful thing, great boon to society, unfortunately

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.260
has a couple of really badly designed things in it.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.420
And one of them is this command: "MONLIST".

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.540
This is the most useless, frustrating, and abused

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.480
command ever added to anything.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.460
Um- it's horrible.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.360
What is does is it sends the details of the last 600

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.520
people who requested the time from that computer

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.440
back.

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.580
I have no idea why you'd have that...

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.560
I have absolutely no idea why that exists.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.560
Why you would need the last 600 people-

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.120
Why 600?!

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.820
Anyway...

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.020
What it means is that I can send a tiny request,

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.700
just this little monlist command here,

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.220
to the time server and the time servers are all on

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.940
**Enormous connections**

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.520
spoof where it came from,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.840
and they will send...

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.000
AN ENORMOUS

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.920
amount of data. 206 TIMES

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.740
the amount of data to that poor computer there.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:49.640
And more than that...

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.040
You can work out where this is going, you know

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.220
There are many time servers and lets say I have

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:54.880
one of those botnets that I mentioned earlier with

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.040
zombie computers

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.760
Those compromised computers all send small amounts

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.720
of data to lots of time servers and they will all send

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.980
206 TIMES THE AMOUNT OF DATA [furiously scribbling]

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.180
to this poor sod.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.500
This is NTP amplification, but it's not the only amplification attack.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.060
There's been DNS for a while,

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.020
there are a couple of others that security researchers are hinting at,

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.720
but don't want to release the details of-

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.260
Not because that'll stop the bad guys, it won't.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.280
You can't do security through obscurity, that's the term...

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.120
But, you might at least slow them down a bit?..

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.160
If you're watching this a few months after

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.900
it's been uploaded, I wouldn't be surprised if we've seen

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.120
one, maybe two, terabit per second attacks.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.140
That is... a hundred thousand times more than your broadband connection?

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:44.580
It's something that is on the scale of disrupting the entire Internet,

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.420
rather than just disrupting one computer.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.840
How can you defend against it?

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.460
Well... you can't.

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.000
I mean you can hire a company that claims to be able to block a lot of attacks...

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.180
And they can, and they can do interesting things

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.040
at the network level to try and filter it all out...

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.620
But ultimately, against an attack of that size

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.540
which could actually disrupt the infrastructure of the internet itself,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.940
there's not much a victim can do.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.960
But what you can do... is, campaign to get the relays,

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.520
the amplification vectors to shut down.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.300
And we've seen this done before.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.260
We saw it with open mail replays, years ago.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.040
There used to be things called open mail relays

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:27.760
which would be just simple sites that would take an email and forward it on.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.700
And those were incredible vectors for spam...

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.740
And they were blocked, and they were filtered

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.080
and they were shut down, campaigned against for a long, long time.

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.420
And there's now a generally agreed upon list of these

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.760
still open, which just won't be able to send anywhere,

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.880
because everyone simply ignores their traffic.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.960
This is gonna happen, sooner or later

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.980
with relays that still allow spoofing and relays

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.840
that still allow amplification attacks.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.220
Sooner or later, they will get shut down...

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.780
but... until then... well... you just kind of have to hope...

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.400
that no one targets you.

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.580
We would like to thank Audible.com for sponsoring this Computerphile video.

and there's a chance to download one for free.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.160
I'd like to recommend a book today called

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:22.380
Makers, by Chris Anderson, which is all about the idea

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:26.400
of democratizing the world of making things and

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.280
manufacturing, so the idea is that the internet has a

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:32.980
democratized publishing and broadcasting with things

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.240
like YouTube and then the same thing's happening to

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.040
the world of bits and stuff and it kind of covers a hacker

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.940
movement so get over there, check that out... Remember,

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.700

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.000
download a free book and thanks once again to them
