00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:07.280
And welcome back.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.800
So we now have
leaderboards in our game.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.760
And we have this lovely view all
of my leaderboards controller.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.980
However, it would
be awfully nice

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.140
if while I were in the
middle of playing a game,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.190
or done with a game,
I could still also see

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.300
the high scores
that were available

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.050
in that particular level.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.670
You know, just so I know what
score I have to beat, or so on.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.810
And so, we can do that with
our leaderboard controller.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.975
Unlike the leaderboards
controller, with an s,

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:37.050
the leaderboard controller
lets you immediately bring up

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.530
the scores for a
specific leaderboard.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.940
So this is pretty easy to do.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.780
Let's jump into my
game view controller,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.230
and let's look at our
little nib file here.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.110
And I'm going to add a button.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.370
Let's put it down
here at the bottom,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.740
and we'll call it leaderboards.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.740
I guess leaderboard, with
an exclamation point,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.160
because we're super excited
about this leaderboard.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.070
And we'll anchor it
to the bottom here.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.750
Boop.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.250
Done.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.950
And I'm going to bring up
my helper view control--

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.520
or, my helper editor.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.080
Let's go into automatic, and
in our game view controller.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:37.540
Maybe here we will add, a view
leaderboard button was pressed.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.400
Action.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.300
There you go.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.410
So let's go into our game
view controller here,

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.136
and we'll edit this thing.

00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:50.510
So, first thing
we're going to do

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.060
is we're going to create
a leaderboard controller.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.140
Leaderboard VC equals
GBG leaderboard

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.490
controller alloc init
with leaderboard ID.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.040
And I don't actually know
what our leaderboard ID is,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.580
because we've gone ahead
and abstracted it away

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.860
in my leaderboard manager class.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.650
So maybe what I'll do
is-- let me go ahead

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.890
and create a little
class method here,

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.290
that will return
an NSString, which

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.575
will be leaderboard ID
for difficulty level.

00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:31.185
And we'll pass in
our difficulty level.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.320
Simple enough, and
I think actually

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:42.760
implementing this is also
pretty straightforward.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.010
Basically go into
return, and maybe we'll

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.240
just cast this, just to make
sure, leaderboard IDs level.

00:02:52.945 --> 00:02:54.820
And you know, it wouldn't
kill me to add some

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.140
[? arrange bounds ?]
[? checking ?] here,

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.265
but I'm not going to,
because this is a sample app.

00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:00.700
So let's go back to our
game view controller,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.960
and let's create a little
NSString leaderboard

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:14.245
ID equals-- and maybe go up here
and import our GMN leaderboard

00:03:14.245 --> 00:03:14.745
manager.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.890
Now let's go back
down here, and now we

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.240
can create our NSString,
that's our leaderboard ID.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.270
And that will equal GMN
leaderboard manager,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.850
leaderboard ID for difficulty
level self dot game Diff.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.470
And now, we can basically
say our leaderboard VC

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.015
is our leaderboard controller
alloc init with leaderboard ID,

00:03:40.015 --> 00:03:40.640
leaderboard ID.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.750
Leaderboard VC, leaderboard
delegate will be self.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.120
And then we can [? call ?]
self, present, view controller,

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.339
our leaderboard VC, animated
yes, completion handler no.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.630
We're going to get a little
warning, because we haven't

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.850
declared ourself as a
GPG leaderboard delegate,

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.210
so let's do that.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:13.980
I'll go up here, and
we'll do it right here.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.709
Remember, this is leaderboard
controller delegate, not

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.195
leaderboards
controller delegate.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.520
And now we can add
our delegate method.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.340
Leaderboard view
controller did finish,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.650
self dismiss, the view
controller animated yes,

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.790
completion no.

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.000
And we're done.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.770
So now I can run this, and maybe
I can jump into my easy game

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.790
here.

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.720
And I'm thinking maybe before
I start playing this game,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.610
let's see what the
leaderboard says.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.180
And they can look
and say, oh look,

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.880
this guy Todd here, he's got
an all-time score of three,

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.130
no way I can beat that.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.370
So maybe I'll go back, and
check out my medium game, here,

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.750
if I view the leaderboard.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.120
Remember, we're creating
a leaderboard controller

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.950
with a leaderboard ID of
our medium leaderboard,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.810
so we'll directly
bring up the scores

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.850
for this medium
leaderboard, that's great.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.430
And then I say, well, I
guess let's just check out

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.550
the hard game.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.190
And here, in my leaderboard
I've got no scores yet.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:30.740
And so maybe I as
a player now say,

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.760
well, this is clearly
the game I want to play,

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.030
because I'll get the top
high score, or whatever.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.290
So there you go.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:39.880
We now have learned
how to submit

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:41.670
a score to a leaderboard,
we've learned

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:44.530
how to bring up the
leaderboards controller, which

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.560
displays all leaderboards
within a game.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.890
And we've now seen how to bring
up individual leaderboards,

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.660
which would be very useful if,
at the end of the level, say,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.530
you wanted to show players
what the top scores were

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.910
for that level.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:58.640
So there you go,
that's about everything

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.850
you need to start adding some
leaderboards into your game.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.700
No MySQL database required.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.840
Really no database
required on your part,

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.510
we do all that database work.

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.970
So, go ahead and start
adding these to your games,

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.510
and remember, the best part
is all this stuff works

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.440
on both iOS and Android.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.210
So if I had my cross platform
version of Guess My Number,

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:21.524
people could be competing
against all their friends,

00:06:21.524 --> 00:06:23.190
no matter what kind
of phone they owned,

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.950
which is pretty awesome.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.360
So there you go,
in the next lesson,

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.930
we're going to start taking
a look at Cloud Save.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.690
This, I think, is one of
the most powerful features

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.860
that we provide.

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.010
It's just a very simple, pretty
straightforward-to-use Cloud

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.240
Save solution that, again,
works cross-platform.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.349
So, your Android players
can save their state,

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:43.890
no matter what the
device they're on.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.190
Your iOS players can
save their state,

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.570
no matter what
device they're on.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.540
And even if you were to have
an Android phone and an iOS

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.930
tablet, you'd be able to
save your game across both

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.107
of those platforms, which
I think is pretty awesome.

00:06:56.107 --> 00:06:58.440
So we'll start taking a look
at that in the next lesson.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.250
Stay tuned.
