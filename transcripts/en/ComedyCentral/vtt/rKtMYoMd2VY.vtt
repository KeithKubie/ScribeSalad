00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:06.973
- He was like, "Fuck you,
you fucking red head!"

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:08.541
and I lost it

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:09.376
my mind,

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:14.114
because guys, I do not
have red hair, okay?

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.849 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's nothing
wrong with red heads.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.250 align:start size:84% position:16%
If you have red
hair, good for you,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.685
but nobody wants to fuck you,

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:19.753
and that's my point.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.588
I don't have red hair.

00:00:43.643 --> 00:00:46.112
(applause)

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.947
- Here's the show,
it's very simple.

00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:49.315
It's just a bunch
of funny people,

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:50.884 align:start size:84% position:16%
who are all telling
true stories.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.053 align:start size:84% position:16%
This guy is
absolutely hilarious.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.020
My former roommate,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.523
Mr. Steve Rannazzisi everybody.

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:58.625
(applause and cheering)

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.627
- How are you guys?

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.095
Sweet.

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:03.229
Everybody's drinking.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.364
Drinking it up, nice.

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:05.565
Drunk.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.000 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now, some of you might
get drunk tonight.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.435
Now, you know, look

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:09.736 align:start size:84% position:16%
there's different
versions of yourself

00:01:09.736 --> 00:01:10.570
when you're drunk.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:11.538
Me?

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:13.073
I like to get the kind of drunk

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:14.507
where I'm still fun.

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:16.309
I might make a mistake, okay?

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:19.179
I might, like this past summer

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.648
I shit my shorts at
a barbecue, okay.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.783
I was very drunk.

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:25.885 align:start size:94% position:6%
It happens, I was laughing
at my buddy's story,

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:27.387 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I just, you
know, shit my shorts.

00:01:27.387 --> 00:01:28.788
I stuck around, you got to

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.056
stick around the
barbecue, you know.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:31.691
Because I had a whole
thing I was going to do

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:33.193
with a firework out of my cock,

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:36.496 align:start size:94% position:6%
but that's the fun version
of me when I get drunk.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:37.430
There is

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.865
a bad version.

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.767 align:start size:94% position:6%
Everyone's got that
version where you're like,

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.469
"Oh, I didn't know I
almost killed us all."

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.971
"I had no idea that
almost happened."

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:46.606
I was really drunk one night,

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:48.675
and I was finishing up comedy,

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.344
and my girlfriend picked
me up to drive me home.

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.613 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I'm like, "Babe,
I'm starving."

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.782 align:start size:84% position:16%
"We got to stop, we
got to get some food."

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.550 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm sorry by, "Babe,
I'm starving."

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.818 align:start size:84% position:16%
"We got to stop
and get some food."

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:01.454
I mean I scream,
"Fucking Wendy's!"

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:06.493 align:start size:97% position:3%
as we past the Wendy's
going down Sunset Boulevard.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.460
"Loop it, babe"

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.294
"Fucking uey!"

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:09.529
"Uey!"

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.564 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm screaming uey
at her, pull at uey.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.833 align:start size:94% position:6%
She's just like, "Oh,
this fucking neanderthal."

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:15.635
She pulls a uey,

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:18.905 align:start size:88% position:13%
and we get into the
Wendy's drive-thru line.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:22.175
Now, we are two cars away
from placing our order,

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:23.510
and I'm going over it
in my head, you know.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.677
Junior bacon cheeseburger,

00:02:24.677 --> 00:02:26.513 align:start size:84% position:16%
fries, frosty,
five piece nuggets.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.314 align:start size:94% position:6%
Junior bacon cheeseburger,
fries, frosty

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:29.549
like Rain man.

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.483
Just you're going
over your head,

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:32.919
I don't want to fuck this up.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:34.687
Then all of a sudden, boom!

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:36.956
The lights go out, in
the Wendy's fucking

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:37.924
drive-thru line.

00:02:37.924 --> 00:02:39.159
They're closed.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.660
You know when they
shut down the light.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.930 align:start size:88% position:13%
You're in line, and
it's boop, you're done.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.332
You can walk in on
your girlfriend, or

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:48.134 align:start size:84% position:16%
your boyfriend
blowing another person

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:50.003
on Valentine's day,
and that would be a

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:53.640 align:start size:88% position:13%
distant second to the
disappointment you feel.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.674
Once you get into...

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:56.409
You're in the line!

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.744
I'm here already!

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.212
I'm fucking here, I did it!

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:03.216
No, no one's getting
a frosty, nothing.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.251
All you get is the
exhaust fan blowing

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.953
the deliciousness into your car

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.288
that you will never receive.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:09.822
That's all you're left with.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:12.458 align:start size:81% position:19%
That and seven
people behind you.

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:13.593
They know they're
not getting food,

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:15.595 align:start size:88% position:13%
so now we're all
getting out of our cars

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:16.696
trying to organize how the fuck

00:03:16.696 --> 00:03:18.798
we're getting out of this line.

00:03:18.798 --> 00:03:19.832 align:start size:94% position:6%
And now we're just talking
to each other like,

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:21.267
"Anyone know what's open?"

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:24.003
We're like a yelp review.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:27.607
Is there a Tai place
that's open this late?

00:03:32.412 --> 00:03:33.913
We finally back everyone out.

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:36.583
We organized the chaos, we
drive out, and I'm like,

00:03:36.583 --> 00:03:38.384
"Babe, I'm still fucking
starving, I got to eat."

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.019 align:start size:81% position:19%
She goes, "No,
we're going home."

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.688
I go, "No, we got
to eat something."

00:03:41.688 --> 00:03:45.425 align:start size:97% position:3%
We lived in an apartment
building, right above Ralph's.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.260 align:start size:84% position:16%
Ralph's is a grocery
store, just like

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.062
every other grocery
store in America,

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:52.632 align:start size:97% position:3%
except this Ralph's is
located on Sunset Boulevard,

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:55.068
and it's open 24 hours a day.

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:57.804 align:start size:97% position:3%
Okay, so you can only
imagine the kind of clientele

00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.872
that goes into the
Rock n' Roll Ralph's

00:03:59.872 --> 00:04:01.708 align:start size:84% position:16%
on Sunset Boulevard
at two o'clock

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:04.210
in the morning on
a Saturday Night.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:05.878
It looks like Burning Man fucked

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:07.580
Comic-con in this fucking place.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.549
It's disgusting.

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.551 align:start size:84% position:16%
But I was like,
"Babe, we need food!"

00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:13.586 align:start size:88% position:13%
She's like, "Fine, we'll
go to the Ralph's."

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.388 align:start size:84% position:16%
Pull into the
Ralph's parking lot,

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:16.589 align:start size:84% position:16%
She goes, "Hey,
just do me a favor."

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.924 align:start size:88% position:13%
"What ever you get, just
grab me a lemonade."

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.325
I'm like, "Yup, no problem."

00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:21.361
Get out out of the car, I'm just

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:23.162
pull my dick, just
like showing her.

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:23.997
I'm like, "Look at this, babe."

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.231
"Look at my dick."

00:04:25.231 --> 00:04:26.165
She's like, "What
is wrong with you?"

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.301
I'm like, "Check this dick out."

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:30.036 align:start size:81% position:19%
In the parking lot
of the Ralph's.

00:04:30.036 --> 00:04:31.471
"You like this dick."

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:34.874 align:start size:94% position:6%
Through the window, we're
not even conversing.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.378
I'm walking into
the Ralph's, right.

00:04:38.378 --> 00:04:40.013 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm still in the parking
lot, walking through,

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:42.415
and as I'm like getting
close to the front door,

00:04:42.415 --> 00:04:46.052 align:start size:88% position:13%
a car just pulls up,
like so close to my hip.

00:04:46.052 --> 00:04:47.920
Like right here, and
just beeps the horn

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.256
and goes, "Hey man, get
the fuck out of the way."

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:52.859 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was like, "What the fuck did
you say, you motherfuck..."

00:04:52.859 --> 00:04:56.129
You know when you're drunk,
you're like, "Fuck you."

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:57.063
"We're doing this?"

00:04:57.063 --> 00:04:58.064
"We're going to fucking do it."

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:59.932
"Let's fucking do this, bro."

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:01.200 align:start size:84% position:16%
And now we're yelling
at each other.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.002
He's like, "Fuck you,
you fucking red head."

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:04.671
And I lost

00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:05.505
my mind,

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:10.610
because guys, I do not
have red hair, okay?

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.978 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's nothing
wrong with red heads,

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.546 align:start size:81% position:19%
if you have red
hair good for you,

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:15.114
but nobody wants to fuck you,

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:15.982
and that's my point.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.750
I don't have red hair.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.619
Don't call me a red
head, plus I got beef

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:21.154 align:start size:88% position:13%
with the Wendy's
people, so that's still

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.388
a sore subject.

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:27.527
This guy is now, I'm like,
"Fuck you, you motherfucker."

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:28.528
"Do you want to fucking go?"

00:05:28.528 --> 00:05:30.863
I know, I'm not a fighter.

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:32.565
When it gets like
too intense for me,

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.233 align:start size:84% position:16%
my move used to
just be turn around,

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:35.935 align:start size:84% position:16%
and walk like George
Jefferson away.

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.937
I just fucking...

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:38.871
I just left.

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:39.672
I walked into the Ralph's just

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:41.841
George Jefferson style.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.344
Now, I walk into this Ralph's

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.546 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm in the grocery store,
and the first thing,

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:47.547 align:start size:84% position:16%
because you're
like a neanderthal.

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:49.349
I'm like (sniffs) what is that?

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.017
I smell food, what is that
fucking food that I smell,

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.318
that I need in my
mouth right now?

00:05:52.318 --> 00:05:53.786
It's a chicken in the bag.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.588 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know that
rotisserie chicken,

00:05:55.588 --> 00:05:57.056
they put in...

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:58.825
I've never seen anyone
put the chicken in there,

00:05:58.825 --> 00:06:01.227 align:start size:84% position:16%
they're just always
there, those chickens.

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:02.862 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's no box,
there's no heating up.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:03.963
It's the best two o'clock in the

00:06:03.963 --> 00:06:05.331
morning food there is.

00:06:05.331 --> 00:06:06.566
I just pick that chicken up.

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.234
I was like, "This
is what I need."

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:09.802
Just go over, and I slop it down

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:10.970
on the fucking counter.

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.205
The juices are going down

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:13.439
the conveyor belt.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.674
The guys doesn't even
want to ring it up.

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:16.376
I was like, "Here's 20
bucks motherfucker."

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:17.643
"Give me back 18."

00:06:17.643 --> 00:06:21.381
He's like, "That's not
even the price, dude."

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.418
So I take my chicken in a bag,

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:26.619
I'm walking out, right.

00:06:26.619 --> 00:06:28.121 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm already fucking
fingering this,

00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:31.057
I'm separating the dark
meat from the white meat.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.191
I'm moving all the shit around,

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.393
just put it in my mouth.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:35.228 align:start size:84% position:16%
I get in the car,
fucking drop that bag

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:36.596
and I'm just like a big gorilla.

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:39.632 align:start size:84% position:16%
Just eating the
chicken in the bag,

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:41.868 align:start size:97% position:3%
and my wife's like, "Hey, what
happened to the lemonade?"

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:43.369
I was like, "Ahh!"

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:45.972
"Woo, babe."

00:06:46.906 --> 00:06:48.441
"When life hands you lemons,"

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:49.675 align:start size:81% position:19%
"you got to go
back into Ralph's"

00:06:49.675 --> 00:06:50.777
"to get your own
fucking lemonade,"

00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:53.179
"because I forgot that shit."

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:56.115
She's like, "What an asshole."

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:58.584
She goes to drive out of
the Ralph's parking lot.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.820
We make a quick right, we
live right above it, right?

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:01.654 align:start size:84% position:16%
Make a quick right,
all of a sudden

00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:04.457
a car cuts us off, boom.

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:06.159
Like t's us up, just like this.

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:07.860
I'm just, not even
paying attention.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:08.828
And she goes, "Oh, shit."

00:07:08.828 --> 00:07:10.096
"I know..."

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.898
Then he comes driver's
side to driver's side,

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:13.232
this car, and it
was the car that

00:07:13.232 --> 00:07:15.201
I got into the beef
with at the Ralph's.

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:17.937 align:start size:81% position:19%
This guy pulls
out a fucking gun,

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.872
and just goes into
our window like this.

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:22.375 align:start size:94% position:6%
He goes, "Say you're
sorry, motherfucker, huh?"

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:23.209
"You think it's funny now?"

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:24.677
"Say you're sorry."

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:27.180
And my wife's like, "What
the fuck is going on?"

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.781
I didn't see any
of this, because

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:31.651
I'm eating chicken
out of a fucking bag.

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:34.821
Just shoveling it
in my fat pie hole.

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:36.422
And she's like, "What
the fuck is happening?"

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:37.623
"Say you're sorry."

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:39.392
I looked up, and look
I'm not a gun guy.

00:07:39.392 --> 00:07:41.961
I don't know guns, okay, I
don't live in that world.

00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.229
So, I just looked at it.

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:44.630
I was like, "What the
fuck's going on here."

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.899
Right back to the
chicken in the bag.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:48.167
White meat, dark meat.

00:07:48.167 --> 00:07:49.969
And this guy's just
like, "What the..."

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.904
He's like, "Say you're
sorry motherfucker."

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:53.105
"Say you're sorry."

00:07:53.105 --> 00:07:54.106
Keeps screaming,
and my wife's like,

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:55.408
"Say you're fucking sorry."

00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:56.242
"What's wrong with you?"

00:07:56.242 --> 00:07:57.443
"Say you're sorry."

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:59.745 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I don't know, guys,
I'm not a gangster.

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:01.113
I don't know what came over me,

00:08:01.113 --> 00:08:02.415
I just looked up from the bag,

00:08:02.415 --> 00:08:03.816
and was like, "Baby, if
he's going to shoot us,"

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:06.519
"he would have done it already."

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.620
"Goodfellas."

00:08:09.055 --> 00:08:12.625
That's not even a line from
fucking Goodfellas, okay.

00:08:12.625 --> 00:08:16.729
I was so drunk, I was
misquoting Goodfellas.

00:08:16.729 --> 00:08:17.997
Well, this guy

00:08:17.997 --> 00:08:21.367
he just recoiled the
gun, pulls it back.

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:22.602
He's just like, "What the fuck?"

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:23.870
And he goes, "This
is your lucky day,"

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.338
"motherfucker, you
fucking red head."

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.806
and drives down the block,

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:31.177
and I was like, "What the
fuck did he just say?"

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:34.614
I look over, and now my
girlfriend is crying.

00:08:34.614 --> 00:08:36.082 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're like welling
up, you know when

00:08:36.082 --> 00:08:37.316
they start to well up,

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:39.185
and I'm looking at
her and I was like,

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:40.520
"Oh, man."

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.223 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now, I'm just slowing
eating chicken in a bag.

00:08:44.223 --> 00:08:45.124
I was like.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.928
She just, without saying a
word, she starts to drive

00:08:48.928 --> 00:08:50.129
up to our apartment building.

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:51.664
It was like 100 feet away.

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:53.499 align:start size:84% position:16%
Pulls into the
spot, and I'm like,

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.434
"Oh, I think I broke her."

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:57.069
"This is not good."

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:58.538
I'm eating the chicken in a bag,

00:08:58.538 --> 00:09:00.573
she just looks at
me, she's like,

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:02.375
"What the fuck is
wrong with you?"

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:04.043
"What the fuck is
wrong with you?"

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.278
"How could you do that?"

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:07.046
"He had a gun to
my fucking head."

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.881
"You big fucking,"

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:10.616
"fucking fire crotch."

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:12.752 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Fucking Rocky
Dennis motherfucker."

00:09:12.752 --> 00:09:15.121 align:start size:88% position:13%
"What is wrong with you,
you fucking ginger."

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.322
And I was like, "Babe, what?"

00:09:16.322 --> 00:09:18.758
"Is this about the lemonade?"

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:23.062 align:start size:88% position:13%
And we got married
three years later guys.

00:09:23.062 --> 00:09:25.164
Thank you guys very much.

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:27.400
Thank you guys.
