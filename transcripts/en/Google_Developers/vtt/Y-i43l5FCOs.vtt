[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.500
Valuraha is a [INAUDIBLE]
word for smart money.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.400
And what we do at Valuraha,
we organize and connect you

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.980
to Africa's investment options.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.800
We have a virtual
platform where we map out

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.210
all securities in the financial
markets-- shares, bonds,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.950
T-bills, the works.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.030
And we give you an opportunity
to create virtual portfolios.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.750
To actually interact
with the actual markets

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.220
in using virtual money in
a bid to get you learning

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.880
and confident about the markets
so that you actually go out

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.590
and invest in real life.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.330
It actually begun
from a point of need,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.950
where my co-founders
and I realized

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.400
that despite our interest
in finance and in investing,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.700
we don't really have
that much knowledge.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.730
So even the little
investment we'd already done

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.560
wasn't as informed
as it could be.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.170
And we found out that this was
one of the major reasons that

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.070
keeps people away from
the financial markets.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.610
Because a lot of Kenyans
are heavily invested

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.980
in land and farming and
anything safer and much more

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.370
tangible, when actually
if you understood

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.360
the financial markets base you
can take advantage of a lot.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.500
You can really grow
your money further.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.540
We begun building as
soon as the platform was

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.690
minimally functional.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.001
We ran a pilot with a few
finance students-- 10 of them

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:23.500
actually.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.630
And we'd meet with them weekly
to talk about the platform.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.620
And then widespread.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.220
So our first users were
actually finance students

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.200
from Strathmore
School of Finance.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.960
We envision that
we will be the go

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.470
to place for information
about investments

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.360
not just in Kenya but
about Africa as a whole.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.560
And not just traditional
investment options like shares,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.870
but we want to keep
up with the times

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.400
and go Bitcoin and go gold.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.200
And just be that one place
where you come to be empowered.
