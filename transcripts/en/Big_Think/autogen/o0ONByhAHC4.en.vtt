hundreds of years of history it would
 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.209
hundreds of years of history it would
take more soldiers than we are capable

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:27.219
take more soldiers than we are capable
 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.069
take more soldiers than we are capable
of providing it would take more money

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079
of providing it would take more money
 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:30.989

than we can afford and what we've done
 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:33.149

instead is we've sort of muddled our way
 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.819
instead is we've sort of muddled our way
through an ongoing insurgency with the

through an ongoing insurgency with the
 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:37.800
through an ongoing insurgency with the
Taliban and here's the problem in both

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810
Taliban and here's the problem in both
 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.899

you know it's their democratically
 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.029
you know it's their democratically
elected but if America creates the

elected but if America creates the
 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.469
elected but if America creates the
conditions for these governments we back

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479
conditions for these governments we back
 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.510

marginally effective in both Iraq and
 

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.149
marginally effective in both Iraq and
Afghanistan so what we have in

Afghanistan so what we have in
 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.459
Afghanistan so what we have in
Afghanistan is the unwinnable war

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
Afghanistan is the unwinnable war
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.349
Afghanistan is the unwinnable war
seventeen years after the war starts and

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359
seventeen years after the war starts and
 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.749
seventeen years after the war starts and
the Taliban is stronger today in control

the Taliban is stronger today in control
 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.449
the Taliban is stronger today in control
of more provinces today and there is

00:02:06.449 --> 00:02:06.459
of more provinces today and there is
 

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.370
of more provinces today and there is
nothing that 15,000 American soldiers

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380
nothing that 15,000 American soldiers
 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.830
nothing that 15,000 American soldiers
can do besides die of course they can do

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840
can do besides die of course they can do
 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.000
can do besides die of course they can do
that but there's nothing that fifteen

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010
that but there's nothing that fifteen
 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.560
that but there's nothing that fifteen
thousand soldiers American soldiers can

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570
thousand soldiers American soldiers can
 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.900
thousand soldiers American soldiers can
do besides muddle along and keep the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910
do besides muddle along and keep the
 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:16.920
do besides muddle along and keep the
insurgency going

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930
insurgency going
 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.630
insurgency going
and just keep everything that sort of a

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640
and just keep everything that sort of a
 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.630
and just keep everything that sort of a
stasis we're not winning and so if we're

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640
stasis we're not winning and so if we're
 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.890
stasis we're not winning and so if we're
not winning then I think that we have to

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900
not winning then I think that we have to
 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.420
not winning then I think that we have to
take a hard look at our interventions in

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430
take a hard look at our interventions in
 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.920
take a hard look at our interventions in
Iraq and Afghanistan and if we're gonna

take a hard look at Iraq and Afghanistan
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.429
take a hard look at Iraq and Afghanistan
we ought to take a very hard look at our

about the oil or it's all about the

about the oil or it's all about the
 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:57.059
about the oil or it's all about the
money and and all of that is a part I

money and and all of that is a part I
 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.190
money and and all of that is a part I
think it's much more complex I think

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200
think it's much more complex I think
 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.099

there are two major pieces you know two
major things the threads that hold us in

major things the threads that hold us in
 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.659
major things the threads that hold us in
these wars number one is that there's a

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:06.669
these wars number one is that there's a
 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:07.709
these wars number one is that there's a

budget is eight or ten times Russia's
 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.559
budget is eight or ten times Russia's
okay it's three times China's it's more

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569
okay it's three times China's it's more
 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.899
okay it's three times China's it's more
than the next nine or so in a row so

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:30.909
than the next nine or so in a row so
 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.399
than the next nine or so in a row so
that's one threat and the other one is

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409
that's one threat and the other one is
 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:35.219
that's one threat and the other one is
we've got sunken costs okay it's a

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:35.229
we've got sunken costs okay it's a
 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.390
we've got sunken costs okay it's a
sunken cost dilemma

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400
sunken cost dilemma
 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.550
sunken cost dilemma
we've lost all these soldiers we've

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560
we've lost all these soldiers we've
 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.619
we've lost all these soldiers we've
spent all this money we're fighting

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629
spent all this money we're fighting
 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.719
spent all this money we're fighting
terrorism okay well that's a tactic it's

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:42.729
terrorism okay well that's a tactic it's
 

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:44.159
terrorism okay well that's a tactic it's
a very strange thing to declare war on

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:44.169
a very strange thing to declare war on
 

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:46.860
a very strange thing to declare war on
we're fighting Islamist extremists we

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870
we're fighting Islamist extremists we
 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.670
we're fighting Islamist extremists we
say in the Middle East when we do that

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680
say in the Middle East when we do that
 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.569
say in the Middle East when we do that
if we pull out there's a a portion of

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579
if we pull out there's a a portion of
 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.949
if we pull out there's a a portion of
the American electorate I would say

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959
the American electorate I would say
 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.469
the American electorate I would say
probably a majority that would say well

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479
probably a majority that would say well
 

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.420
probably a majority that would say well
we can't leave because if we leave

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430
we can't leave because if we leave
 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.800
we can't leave because if we leave
they'll be more terrorist attacks on us

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810
they'll be more terrorist attacks on us
 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.800
they'll be more terrorist attacks on us
but we can't leave we've already spent

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810
but we can't leave we've already spent
 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.170
but we can't leave we've already spent
7,000 lives and 2.2 trillion dollars and

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180
7,000 lives and 2.2 trillion dollars and
 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.599
7,000 lives and 2.2 trillion dollars and
so I think this sunken cost fallacy

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:09.609
so I think this sunken cost fallacy
 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:12.330
so I think this sunken cost fallacy
steps in so what do we have now we have

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340
steps in so what do we have now we have
 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.890
steps in so what do we have now we have
the inertia of a military industrial

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900
the inertia of a military industrial
 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.449
the inertia of a military industrial
complex which makes a lot of money for a

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459
complex which makes a lot of money for a
 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.649
complex which makes a lot of money for a
lot of people and keeps a lot of people

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:16.659
lot of people and keeps a lot of people
 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.949
lot of people and keeps a lot of people
employed on one end and then we have the

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959
employed on one end and then we have the
 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.509
employed on one end and then we have the
sunken cost fallacy on the other side

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519
sunken cost fallacy on the other side
 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.580
sunken cost fallacy on the other side
where we say we've committed so much we

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590
where we say we've committed so much we
 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.940
where we say we've committed so much we
can't possibly leave and it's it no

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950
can't possibly leave and it's it no
 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:28.500
can't possibly leave and it's it no
president wants to be the president that

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510
president wants to be the president that
 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.950
president wants to be the president that
lost the war on terror instead

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960
lost the war on terror instead
 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.360
lost the war on terror instead
we're in our third administration now

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370
we're in our third administration now
 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.059
we're in our third administration now
okay President Bush he just wanted to

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:35.069
okay President Bush he just wanted to
 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.300
okay President Bush he just wanted to
leave without losing rock obama totally

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310
leave without losing rock obama totally
 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.650
leave without losing rock obama totally
different figure he wanted to leave

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660
different figure he wanted to leave
 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.210
different figure he wanted to leave
without losing he didn't want to be the

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220
without losing he didn't want to be the
 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.159
without losing he didn't want to be the
president that lost the Warrens her and

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169
president that lost the Warrens her and
 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.960
president that lost the Warrens her and
i would argue that it is very unlikely

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970
i would argue that it is very unlikely
 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.909
i would argue that it is very unlikely
that President Trump will be the

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919
that President Trump will be the
 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.950
that President Trump will be the
president who ends the war on terror so

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960
president who ends the war on terror so
 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.930
president who ends the war on terror so
that means we're looking at potentially

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940
that means we're looking at potentially
 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.439
that means we're looking at potentially
up to seven more years of war with no

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449
up to seven more years of war with no
 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.270
up to seven more years of war with no
end in sight and no one even talking

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280
end in sight and no one even talking
 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.279
end in sight and no one even talking
about final victory anymore and that's

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289
about final victory anymore and that's
 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.920
about final victory anymore and that's
interesting because soldiers will join

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930
interesting because soldiers will join
 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.469
interesting because soldiers will join
the army next year who were born after

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479
the army next year who were born after
 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:06.020
the army next year who were born after
9/11 and we need to think on that for a

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030
9/11 and we need to think on that for a
 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.460
9/11 and we need to think on that for a
second and what that says about our

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470
second and what that says about our
 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.890
second and what that says about our
Republic what that says about the nature

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900
Republic what that says about the nature
 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.810
Republic what that says about the nature
of service and the nature of warfare a
