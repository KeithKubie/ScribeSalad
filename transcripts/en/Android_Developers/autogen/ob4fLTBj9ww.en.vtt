 My name is Nishant Pattney

 Founder and CEO of Hello English Project 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:11.086
 This project is an application that helps millions of Indians learn English in a way 

00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:13.788
 A fun and attractive way to design an attractive character that carries games. 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.747
 I came up with the idea Hello English 

00:00:16.747 --> 00:00:19.180
 When I was studying in China, I was wandering around everywhere and my luggage was on my back 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.826
 I try to meet my needs as a vegetarian without speaking Mandarin. 

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:26.935
 Then I realized that it was much harder for me 

00:00:26.935 --> 00:00:26.948
 Indians who try to learn English, 

00:00:26.948 --> 00:00:29.545
 Learning English has become important 

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:31.720
 For those who want to achieve success in their work today. 

00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:36.721
 India has a remarkable diversity thanks to 22 languages ​​adopted by the government. 

00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:40.351
 English is the preferred language of business 

00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:43.048
 All other large companies prefer to use them. 

00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:48.090
 My name is Brancho Bandari, the co-founder of Hello English 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.896
 We wanted to make it fun and easy to learn English at no cost 

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:55.758
 Since learning English is via smartphone 

00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:57.851
 Is of great importance to millions of Indians. 

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:02.192
 Hello English is compatible with more than 15 Indian languages, 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.540
 12 languages ​​have support for built-in Android fonts. 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.888
 One of the main objectives of the application is to help people speak English, 

00:01:07.897 --> 00:01:11.071
 Google's text-to-speech engine helps 

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:15.168
 In making it very easy to maintain the English accent, 

00:01:15.168 --> 00:01:17.398
 Therefore our weekly retention rates have grown at an average of over 18%. 

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:21.077
 Users encountered some normal problems initially due to slow Internet connection 

00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:25.244
 And the use of devices with low storage capacity 

00:01:25.244 --> 00:01:29.586
 Power Processing Limited. 

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:31.638
 So we decided to pay attention to improving our application to address these problems. 

00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:35.751
 We've found that Google has a wide range of tools for developers 

00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:39.023
 Utilizing them to improve applications to suit emerging markets such as India. 

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:42.959
 We were able to reduce the application size from 16 to 9 MB 

00:01:43.324 --> 00:01:47.263
 Which immediately reduced the rate of uninstallation by 15%. 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.396
 Most application features can also be used 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.621
 No Internet. 

00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:57.065
 Today, the number of users exceeds 13 million who want to learn English 

00:01:57.065 --> 00:02:00.198
 On Hello English, not only from India but from all over the world. 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:05.116
 We are also expanding geographically to other emerging markets with similar needs 

00:02:05.397 --> 00:02:08.242

00:02:08.284 --> 00:02:11.689
 We are very encouraged by the success stories we hear from the beneficiaries
