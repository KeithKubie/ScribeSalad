00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.420
Hey guys, Matt here for Science or Fiction.

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.779
Ever meet someone so happy that you figure
they must be hiding some terrifying secrets?

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.860
You know, like your co-worker Brad.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.860
Ugh.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.330
Nothing good could come from hanging out with someone as happy as Brad, right?

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.420
Maybe I should give Brad a call.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.320
A few years back headlines were running with
the assertion that happiness may be contagious,

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.080
like a bizarro awesome version of the flu.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.000
So can the happiness of others make you happy?

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.990
Is our best hope for happiness to hang out
with happy guys like Brad who refuse to share

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.040
everyone’s gloom that it’s only Tuesday
and the workweek is lasting FOREVER.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.159
The idea that happiness is contagious comes
from a study that followed more than 4,700

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:44.179
people for 20 years and asked them to periodically
fill out questionnaires about their wellbeing.

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:48.370
After creating an emotional baseline, the
researchers found that emotions fluctuated

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.380
based on the participant's social network.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.139
And no, not we’re not talking about their
Snapchat followers.

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:57.530
For example, the study found that a good friend
who lives about a half mile away can increase

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.559
happiness up to 42%, a neighbor can increase
happiness 34%, and a spouse can only increase

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.000
happiness by about 8%.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.140
Sorry guys.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.520
The study found that happiness doesn’t seem
to spread in the workplace however, possibly

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.720
because if one person gets a promotion, someone
else doesn’t.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.700
Hey wait a minute, does that mean Brad got
the promotion?

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.480
Ugh, typical.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.020
But some people have their doubts about the
study’s findings, arguing that it’s possible

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.450
that happy people are just drawn to other
happy people.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.570
It could also be that people who live near
each other share the same types of environments

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.039
that might increase happiness, like safe neighborhoods,
affluence, or good employment.

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.460
In response to these arguments, the study’s
authors said that strangers sharing the same

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.040
environment, say a affluent, safe neighborhood,
didn’t have the same positive happiness

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.900
effect as neighbors who knew each other, concluding
that it was the WHO and not the WHERE.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.600
However, detractors remain, even publishing
another study based on the same data set and

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.780
using the same correlation reasoning.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.840
Using those methods, they were able find that non-transferable traits like height were also contagious.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.780
They found short teenagers who befriended
tall kids actually became taller over time.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.760
Man, studies trolling other studies, it happens.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.200
Other serious research has shown that it is
actually biological factors rather than societal

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.180
ones that determines happiness.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.030
One such study found that 35-50% of happiness
was attributable to genetic factors like those

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.790
found in your brain, not your neighbor.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.200
In the end, the happiness contagion findings weren’t as conclusive as some headlines indicated.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.400
That “contagion” may be more correlation
and less causation, and if there is causation,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.040
it could also be impacted by biological factors.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.960
That’s not to say that you can’t become
happy: It just means I might not have to hang

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.720
out with Brad to do so.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.280
You just can’t stop smiling, can you?

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.060
Yea, I know!

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.960
Anyway, what do you think?

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.280
Not about the dark secrets Brad is probably hiding behind that cold smile,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.540
about what makes people happy!

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.160
Who makes you happier: your significant other
or your friends?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.950
Don’t answer if your spouse is in
the room.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.700
Especially if she’s a praying mantis.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.800
