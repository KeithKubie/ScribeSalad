ROMAN NURIK: Welcome to Android
Design in Action.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:15.450
I'm your host, Roman Nurik.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.730
ADAM KOCH: Hey, guys.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.105
My name is Adam Koch.

00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:17.600
NICK BUTCHER: And hi.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.260
I'm Nick Butcher.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.340
ROMAN NURIK: And today's episode
is about the beautiful

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.755
design collection
on Google Play.

00:00:23.755 --> 00:00:26.320
And I think it was about a
month or so ago that we

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.370
released a collection on
Google Play called the

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.720
Beautiful Design collection
for summer 2013.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.200
And this is a collection of 11
apps that highlighted some of

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.880
the best of class, or I guess
some of the best designed apps

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.310
on Google Play.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.050
So in today's episode, we're
going to look through these

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.680
different apps on
our tablet here.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.300
And we're going to talk about
some of the best design

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.930
details in each app.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.370
And then I think we'll
have time to go

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.880
through all 11 apps.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.820
And then we have a couple things
at the end that we'll

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.420
show as well.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.984
So with that, any other intro,
guys, before we jump in?

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:08.960
ADAM KOCH: Nope.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.650
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I just
want to talk a little bit

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.480
about how these apps
were picked.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.160
I think that the idea behind
this collection is that these

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.550
are applications which really
embrace the design guidelines

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.370
but also go beyond that and
really have that level above

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.660
that adds the polish that
makes it a beautifully

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:28.360
designed application.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.930
ROMAN NURIK: Absolutely.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.810
So let's see.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.650
So the collection from the blog
post that we posted about

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.380
this collection talks a lot
about attention to detail.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.940
And it's not really about just
getting the 80% of the app or

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.150
90% of the app looking great.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.460
It's really just adding that
final 10% of fit and finish

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.790
and polish that, again, like
Nick said, goes above and

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.000
beyond just following the
guidelines and really kind of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.550
stressing that every
single part of

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.490
the app must be polished.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.240
And really, you have to think
about every single flow that

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.790
the user would go through.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.400
And so these 11 apps we found
contain some of these

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
masterfully crafted
design details.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.740
And so that's why these
were chosen.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.410
Obviously, this is
only 11 apps.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.110
There are tons more beautiful
apps out there on Google Play.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.910
This is just kind of the first
set, or I guess the first

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.780
collection in this set,
in this series.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.190
You should expect more in the
future, in the coming

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.040
different seasons, since this
is just the summer 2013

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.940
collection.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.410
And we also wanted to mention
that very recently, there are

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.000
some other apps that have
been published.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.400
And Matias Duarte, who's the
Director of User Experience

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.990
for Android, had this really
long Google+ post that talked

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.660
about kind of where the
guidelines sit in terms of the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.560
design process.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.330
How you should approach the
guidelines, what types of

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.900
decisions you should be thinking
about, where you

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.550
should begin introducing
branding and consistency and

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.890
things like that.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.610
So while we're on the topic
of the Beautiful Design

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:11.170
collection--

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.130
which, again, the apps there do
follow the guidelines, but

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.860
they go above and beyond that--
while we're on the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.660
topic of this, I think that this
post really summarizes

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.070
some of the Android Design
team's views on the guidelines

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.840
and consistency and
where they fit in.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.490
So with that, should we jump
in with the first app?

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.930
OK.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.800
So the first app we're going to
look at-- and so, actually,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.530
these are the apps that we're
going to look at today.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.920
We have Pattrn, Eye in the Sky,
Pocket, Timer, Grand St.,

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.150
Pinterest, Press-- lot of Ps--

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.830
Press, "New York Times,"
Expedia, Flipboard, and Ted.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.090
So those are the 11 apps
in that collection.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.630
So the first of these
is Pattrn.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.000
So Pattrn is basically an app
that lets you look at

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.660
different wallpapers.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.970
And actually, these wallpapers
are all pattern tiles, hence

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.260
the name Pattrn.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.450
So they kind of tile across.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.330
They're not just one big photo
or anything like that.

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.910
But it's really something that
lets you browse and browse

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.750
patterned wallpapers
and set them.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.580
So we're only looking
at tablet today.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.010
One of the key things in this
collection, actually, before

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.110
we jump in here, is that most,
if not all, of these apps are

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:21.640
really responsibly designed.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.000
So this is one of the--

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.390
meaning it works on tablet, it
works on phone, it works on

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.300
seven-inch, and so on.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.290
And so this app right now is one
of the best examples of a

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.260
very nice standardish responsive
design, where

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.280
basically on a tablet here, you
see multiple columns of

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.860
patterns, of wallpapers.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.200
And on a phone, you actually see
fewer columns, maybe just

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.050
one column and two columns
on landscape.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.940
And then you have your kind of
core navigation on the left.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.660
You basically can jump in
between or switch between

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.500
different sections.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.600
And then you can open up one
of these wallpapers.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.210
And one of the nice touches is
that they have these very

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.070
subtle animations here that
let you see more.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.720
And actually, it also goes
into lights-out mode.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.770
So you actually fade out, or you
dim the navigation bar and

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.830
the status bar in the process.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.610
And one of the last things I
wanted to mention about this

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:17.600
app-- and obviously the
responsive design, I think for

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.460
me, is one of the biggest
things about it

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.500
that makes it so great--

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.920
one of the last things is that
there are subtle little

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.490
touches here and there, like
letting you rotate the

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.090
wallpaper, set the wallpaper
automatically on a schedule.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.000
And then also, just the overall
fit and finish, it

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.480
really does feel like
a really, truly

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.730
Android-designed app.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.380
So overall, just a
very solid app.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.356
That's the first one
in our collection.

00:05:44.356 --> 00:05:45.700
Can we move on Pinterest?

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:46.460
ADAM KOCH: All right.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.290
So let's talk a little
bit about Pinterest.

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.050
So for those of you who are not
familiar with Pinterest,

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.800
it's a social networking app
that sort of revolves around

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.920
these virtual pinboards,
where you can

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.680
pin up virtual content.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.420
I will admit I am not a big
Pinterest user myself.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.590
But that doesn't mean I can't
play with the app and use the

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.380
app and see how it's beautifully
designed.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.230
So the first thing you'll
notice, and this is kind of

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:13.610
interesting because there's no
sort of standard action bar.

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.450
And of course, if you've
listened to any of our shows,

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.056
we're always talking action bar,
action bar, action bar.

00:06:18.056 --> 00:06:21.110
But in this case, they've
actually gone for almost like

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.700
a hybrid between top-level tabs,
which you may see in an

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.640
app like, say, the "People" app,
and the sort of standard

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.870
action bar, where you have
branding only in the top left.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.190
And it actually works nicely
because on their website, they

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.640
have this same design
and layout.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.880
So you can see here, they've
still got the sort of standard

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.200
interaction patterns of swiping
between these tabs,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.650
where the middle tab is
really sort of home

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.650
or browse your stream.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.180
And the left tab, while it does
have a search icon, it's

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.060
more of a discover tab or
something along those lines.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.090
And so that's the first
I wanted to call out.

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:03.650
The second thing is this
multi-column layout.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:07.070
And that's, again, very similar
to their website.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.810
And this is really nice because,
obviously, their

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.760
social network revolves heavily
around content, so

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.760
it's a very content-forward
design.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.140
And it has the added advantage
that it's also very

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.810
responsive.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.810
It scales very well to different
screen sizes.

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.800
As we mentioned before, we
couldn't show you the phone

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.530
layout today.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.670
But you'll see on the phone
layout and on the smaller

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:29.310
tablet or portrait layouts,
you'll see that it reduces the

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:32.030
number of columns
nicely there.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:33.320
ROMAN NURIK: One of the best
things about this, really

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.320
quick, is that the Chrome of the
app, the bar at the top, I

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.000
guess the action/tab bar, the
bar at the top follows the

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.250
natural Android interaction
model, but the content is very

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.010
much Pinterest.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.130
It's very much

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.740
Pinterest-branded content, almost.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.850
The exact layout of
the posts is very

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:54.010
much a Pinterest thing.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.967
So that's one of the
ways in which they

00:07:55.967 --> 00:07:57.060
let their brand show.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.490
ADAM KOCH: And they've also
sort of fused their brand

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:01.420
design with the Holo
design language.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.875
So you sort of see the
Holo design tabs.

00:08:03.875 --> 00:08:08.520
You sort of see the buttons
are much flatter than what

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.000
they have on their website
and in other platforms.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.520
They have sort of the
overflow down here.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.560
So they've done a very good
job at the middle ground

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:19.810
between fusing Android design
with their own brand.

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:20.970
NICK BUTCHER: And just one
little thing on Pinterest.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.950
I absolutely love the way, as
it's loading in a new image,

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.076
it'll take the average color
of the image, right?

00:08:27.076 --> 00:08:28.350
Yeah, there we go.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.780
So the color shown will be the
average color of the image

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.330
once it's loaded.

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:35.640
It's a completely unnecessary
detail that I love.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.439
It is delightful.

00:08:36.439 --> 00:08:39.309
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, it's one
extra database field, but for

00:08:39.309 --> 00:08:42.795
a lot more value there.

00:08:42.795 --> 00:08:43.830
ADAM KOCH: All right, guys.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:44.450
So that's Pinterest.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.010
We really like the
Pinterest app.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:47.570
ROMAN NURIK: Pocket?

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:49.385
Nick, you want to talk
about Pocket?

00:08:49.385 --> 00:08:51.010
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.725
So Pocket, hopefully you know,
is kind of a catch-up reading

00:08:53.725 --> 00:08:55.640
of the news sites.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.730
So you can save sites, videos,
images, and so forth into your

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:00.990
Pocket and catch up later.

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:02.990
So when trying to pick what I
wanted to highlight in this

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:05.050
application, I initially
thought about

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.000
the responsive design.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.520
Because like these other
applications we looked at so

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.370
far, this app responds
beautifully to the form factor

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.890
of the device you're
looking at it on.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:14.980
So on a phone, for example,
it'll use list-based

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.480
navigation when you click
a [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.720
And as you get to larger
devices, it breaks out into a

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.590
grid, and then there's kind
of an asymmetric grid,

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.770
as you can see here.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:25.260
If you have more content, there
would be lots and lots

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:25.530
at the top.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:27.341
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, sorry about
not filling it out completely.

00:09:27.341 --> 00:09:29.025
ADAM KOCH: I forgot to add
it in, but that's OK.

00:09:29.025 --> 00:09:29.450
NICK BUTCHER: No problem.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.400
But in fact, my favorite detail,
I think, about this

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.180
application is the sheer focus
on the reading experience.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:41.010
The application does a lot of
stuff, but it doesn't feel

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.180
heavy in its user interface.

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.830
Everything seems to get out of
the way in order to let you

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.110
have the best reading
experience.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.810
So for example, the user
interface here, the action bar

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.360
and so forth, is all
quite muted.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.280
So it immediately recedes
out of the way.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.305
And if you could start scrolling
down through the

00:09:56.305 --> 00:09:58.884
article, as soon as you start
scrolling-- that's a very

00:09:58.884 --> 00:09:59.362
short article.

00:09:59.362 --> 00:10:02.360
Were it longer, as soon as you
start scrolling down, the

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:03.540
action bar hides.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.700
And once again, we go into
this, what we refer to as

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.130
lights out mode, where
the system bar and

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.275
navigation bar recede.

00:10:11.275 --> 00:10:14.260
See the slightly dim state.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.750
So it's all about the
reading experience.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.950
But as soon as you start
scrolling back up, which

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.510
indicates you've finished the
article, for example, the

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.280
affordances jump right back.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:26.380
So you can check the time or
multitask to another app or

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:28.090
use one of the action
bar options.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:31.230
So it just gets out of your
way, and it just works.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.910
And I love that focus on
the reading experience.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.060
And the same thing's
true of their kind

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.960
of pagination model.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.420
So you can either read it in
an endless stream, so where

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:39.640
you're swiping up and down.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:43.660
Or you can swipe left and right
to change to a paginated

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:44.610
content model.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.600
And I love the fact that there's
no-- you can imagine

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.640
that one way of implementing
that interface would be some

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.450
kind of toggle or switch or
machinery in order to do it.

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:54.810
But instead of doing that, they
just listen to how you're

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:55.520
trying to use it.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.370
So if you scroll vertically,
then it'll give you a vertical

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:00.770
stream of content.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:02.880
And if you scroll horizontally,
then it'll

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.780
automatically flip into this
paginated content model.

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.540
So again, it just reduces all
the machinery around it and

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.860
just really, really focuses on
getting out of your way and

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:12.070
letting you get to
the content.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.730
So really, really great
attention to

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.210
detail in this app.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.782
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, I'd say
that it's one of the best

00:11:18.782 --> 00:11:21.820
in-reading experiences.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.450
If at all, you need to build
an app that lets you read

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.390
through large chunks of content
that have large body

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:32.400
copy, definitely look at this
app as a shining example of

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.360
how to do that right.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.920
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, it looks a lot
different once it's filled

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:35.570
out with content.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:38.815
We did a bad job at
prepopulating it today.

00:11:38.815 --> 00:11:39.700
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:42.500
Shall we move on to Timer?

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:46.000
So Timer is a very,
very simple app.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.410
It's--

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:48.138
ADAM KOCH: Let's start
the ADiA timer.

00:11:48.138 --> 00:11:49.820
ROMAN NURIK: Oh yeah, sure.

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:53.070
So Timer is basically an app
that it's just that.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:53.780
It's a timer.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:55.180
It has a couple of features.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.960
It has basically a stopwatch.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.936
Does it have a stopwatch?

00:11:58.936 --> 00:12:00.956
I actually don't remember.

00:12:00.956 --> 00:12:01.440
NICK BUTCHER: Nope.

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.570
ROMAN NURIK: But it basically
has a countdown timer.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:06.700
It's just kind of your standard,
run of the mill

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.540
countdown timer.

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.820
But the best thing about this
is the interactions and the

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.980
little ways in which they
sprinkle Android goodness.

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.080
So for example, if you pull down
the shade here-- well,

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.560
Android Design in
Action is live.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.650
That's good--

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.810
you'll notice that the
notification is very

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:22.740
customized.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.850
And they have actions built
into the notifications.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:27.340
So without even-- let's
say I'm just at

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.280
the home screen here.

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:30.850
I can manage my timer
right from here.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.240
So I can pause and resume it.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.750
I can see how much time
is remaining.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.580
And I can obviously end
it if I needed to.

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:40.350
But also, one of my other
favorite things about this was

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:43.420
that the interaction for
creating a timer is very

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.120
simple and intuitive.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.500
So you basically just drag
this thing around.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.590
And sorry for the lag here.

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.620
I think our HDMI connection
is laggy.

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.215
But you basically just
drag this around.

00:12:52.215 --> 00:12:57.730
And it's very tactile and kind
of visceral, the feeling of

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:58.680
rotating a dial.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.430
It almost hints back
to the earlier

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.590
days of a rotary telephone.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:06.740
So the interaction model here
is very nice, and it's also

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.500
very simple.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.440
The last thing I wanted to point
out is that they have a

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.450
couple of themes.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:13.560
And while having multiple themes
is not a necessity,

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:16.410
it's always a nice
extra touch.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.790
And they also basically
theme everything.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:23.800
So if you switch from the light
blue to the light orange

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.560
theme, basically everything
becomes orange.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:32.160
The action bar, tabs, even the
app icon becomes orange.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:36.030
So you can see here, their
single accent color changes to

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:37.860
fit what the user prefers.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.650
So overall, very nice, simple
app, obviously also using

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.130
responsive design
best practices.

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:45.350
They have a tablet version
that works in portrait,

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:46.930
landscape, 7-inch, 10-inch.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:51.530
So just an overall very solid,
very simple app that just gets

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.780
the job done.

00:13:55.169 --> 00:13:57.090
I think next we have Grand St.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.170
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, just pardon
me jumping in there.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.610
One last really subtle touch
that I really like about this

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.590
is-- and you can't really it--

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.710
is that in the actual rich
notification, they have that

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:09.800
same circular representation of
the timer, which actually

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:12.370
fills in with the color of the
theme that you chose as well.

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.730
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah,
if you just do--

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:15.760
NICK BUTCHER: Show
the timer, maybe.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.770
ADAM KOCH: OK, let's move on.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:17.150
Let's move on.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:18.280
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah,
just do on this.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.942
NICK BUTCHER: We could probably
use this app to make

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:20.840
sure we don't overrun.

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.210
ADAM KOCH: I know.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:24.750
We should use it every
week, actually.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:27.100
Let's leave it running.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.090
All right.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:32.213
Let's move on to Grand
St. So yeah, I'll

00:14:32.213 --> 00:14:34.120
switch this to featured.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.970
ROMAN NURIK: Oh no!

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:35.760
Ah!

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.040
ADAM KOCH: Oh, demo fail.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.480
NICK BUTCHER: Cannot
see the demo.

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.440
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah,
there we go.

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.650
ADAM KOCH: Demo fail.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:43.980
So Grand St., for those of you
not familiar with it, is

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:48.800
basically a curated
gadget catalog.

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.080
And the Grand St. team goes and
finds these interesting

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.390
gadgets and then reviews them
and then posts them up through

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.420
their app and through
their website.

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:00.030
And the first thing you'll
notice is it's basically like

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.980
a digital magazine.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:04.300
They've essentially converted
the old school version of a

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.200
physical magazine into
a digital magazine.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.240
And you can see, it's instantly
full-screen imagery,

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.140
really nice typography.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:15.380
And they've actually gone for
this sort of custom action

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:18.960
bar, but very much sticking to
the interaction patterns and

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.300
the layout, the sort of gist
of the regular action bar.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.630
You can see they've got their
app icon in the top left, a

00:15:25.630 --> 00:15:27.280
spinner next to that.

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.590
And then they've left the area
between that empty, and then

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:32.700
they've got the regular sort of
action items and overflow

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.750
on the right there.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.590
I think it works really well for
taking the focus off the

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.980
UI elements and then bringing
the focus to the actual

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:41.500
content of the application.

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:44.590
So you can see here, they've
got these dots representing

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:46.660
the different pages
of the magazine.

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.930
And then this is one
of the products.

00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:50.870
Let's go into it here.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:54.740
And then they've got this really
nice representation of

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.790
the actual review and content.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.450
So between each of the screens,
there's actually

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:01.430
these full-screen images.

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:04.470
And around subtle design
touches, you can see here it

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:07.950
sort of fades in as
you swipe out.

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.520
You can read some information
about the design and then,

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.450
again, see another really nice
full-screen image here.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:15.900
And an interesting thing that we
can't actually show here is

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.070
that if you go into portrait
mode, it is a slightly

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:22.360
different representation where
you can view the images at the

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.740
top of the screen and then
the content below that.

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.090
Can't show that here because
we're on HDMI, and it's kind

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:28.340
of hard to rotate around.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.490
And then I'm not going to talk
too much more about this

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:35.020
because we're low on time.

00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.530
But for previous items that
they've talked about, the sort

00:16:37.530 --> 00:16:40.950
of non-featured items, they
have this nice, clean grid

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.710
view of items.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.900
And again, it's multi-column,
so it scales very well to

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.520
different screen sizes.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.715
You can go back and browse all
of the previous items that

00:16:48.715 --> 00:16:50.480
they've actually reviewed
in the past.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.020
NICK BUTCHER: And the Grand St.
Team, actually, they had a

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.650
really nice blog post about the
iterations of design they

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.490
went through in order
to arrive here.

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:01.720
So if you check out their
blog [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.846
It's pretty interesting.

00:17:02.846 --> 00:17:03.220
ROMAN NURIK: Cool.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.210
You'll have to share that
in the comments somehow.

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.930
My favorite thing about this app
is just the complete focus

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:12.689
on full-bleed imagery
and typography.

00:17:12.689 --> 00:17:15.400
And that really makes it feel
more like a magazine because

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.030
there's no Chrome
on magazines.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:18.525
There's no buttons you can
press in a magazine.

00:17:18.525 --> 00:17:20.750
It's really all content that
you're playing with.

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.010
So this really feels
like that.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:24.300
ADAM KOCH: And they even go to
the point of engaging the

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.220
low-profile mode so that you're
really engaged in the

00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:29.190
full-screen content.

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:30.160
All right.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.870
ROMAN NURIK: Let's move on to
Eye in the Sky Weather.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:34.700
Nick, do you want to talk
about Eye in the Sky?

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:35.640
NICK BUTCHER: Yep.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.930
OK, so my favorite thing about
this application is the sheer

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.680
simplicity of it and the way
it elegantly shows the

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.260
information hierarchy.

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.850
So I think they do a really,
really great job of really

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.890
picking out the most important
information and then making

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:54.260
the flow of that information
really obvious.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.390
So it instantly jumps out at
you what the immediate

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.490
conditions are, and then you can
tell by the layout and so

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.140
forth what the upcoming
dates are.

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.820
I think it's a very simple
application.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.720
There's a ton of web
applications out there.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.070
But I think this one in
particular does a great job of

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:11.455
just elegantly displaying what
you need to know and putting

00:18:11.455 --> 00:18:12.890
everything within easy reach.

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:15.140
Once again, it's also
another example--

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.130
I think like all of the apps
in this collection--

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:18.690
of great responsive design.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:20.030
It'll move--

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.085
on a phone device, you'll have
these three major sections on

00:18:23.085 --> 00:18:26.820
the left will be swipeable tabs,
and on a larger device,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:29.610
at a certain point, they get
broken out into this dedicated

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:30.900
navigation section.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.540
And it rearranges what we
call the macro reflow.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.760
It rearranges the major content
blocks in order to use

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:41.460
the space well.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.550
ROMAN NURIK: I also personally
love the upgrade

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:44.350
banner at the bottom.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:45.560
It's not in your face.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:46.590
You can actually dismiss it.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:49.965
And I think if you dismiss
it, it shows ads.

00:18:49.965 --> 00:18:52.820
Well, at some point it shows--
yeah, there it is.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:55.300
But it's basically kind of an
unobtrusive way to hint at

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.660
other features that
are available.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:00.330
Or it's like an upsell,
but it's an

00:19:00.330 --> 00:19:01.920
unobtrusive upsell, basically.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.420
So it's kind of a nice
way of doing it.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.340
ADAM KOCH: I think weather
apps are actually an

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.335
interesting problem because
there's so much information

00:19:06.335 --> 00:19:07.150
you can display.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.353
And it's actually challenging
to get everything displaying

00:19:10.353 --> 00:19:15.380
in a nice, concise format,
as Nick was saying.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:16.414
ROMAN NURIK: Shall we move on?

00:19:16.414 --> 00:19:16.826
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:19:16.826 --> 00:19:18.400
We need to go quickly.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:18.760
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.620
What are we at?

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.170
10:48.

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.070
Ah, that's fine.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.510
We got plenty of time, guys.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:24.440
All right, next, let's
look at Press.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.130
So Press is an app that-- let
me just go to the very

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:27.760
beginning here.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.070
Press is an app that is
basically your feed reader.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.680
Formerly, it hooked up
to Google Reader.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.110
So it was basically a Google
Reader client.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.330
It would show you all your
different subscriptions and

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:38.740
all the different articles that
you haven't read under

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.900
each subscription.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.090
And now it supports a variety
of different services,

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.780
including Feedly, which is what
we have hooked up here.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.830
But the idea is that it's
basically a client your

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.450
reading stuff, your
reading queue.

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.120
I would call it the
pre-Pocket.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.095
You look at something here, and
maybe if you want to read

00:19:58.095 --> 00:19:58.910
it later, you throw
it into Pocket.

00:19:58.910 --> 00:19:59.504
ADAM KOCH: That's definitely
my workflow,

00:19:59.504 --> 00:20:01.360
like press to Pocket.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.080
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:03.450
But the idea here--

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.140
the reason we like this app so
much is that it's just very

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.740
clean, again, very minimal.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.400
It's all about content.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:10.310
You can even look here.

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.770
The tabs here on the left--

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.970
actually, on a phone,
this would be one

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:16.300
screen here on the left.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.510
And this would be
the next screen.

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.550
We basically have tabs
here on the left.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:25.950
And the icons for the tabs
are incredibly minimal.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.810
The filled circle means
that it's unread.

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:31.890
The outlined circle
means it's read.

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.920
And the star just means it's
your starred content.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.630
So it's a very interesting
workflow.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.590
You basically have your step
one, you have stuff that you

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:41.140
haven't read.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.370
Step two is the next evolution
of that, stuff you've read.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:46.085
And step three is stuff that
you really care about and

00:20:46.085 --> 00:20:46.490
you've starred.

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.680
So the hierarchy there
is very clear.

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.105
So once you jump into a category
and then a feed--

00:20:52.105 --> 00:20:54.860
let's look at the Verge,
for example.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:56.090
Actually, yeah, the
Verge is fine.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:56.990
That'll do.

00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.890
ADAM KOCH: You could do all.

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:01.190
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, let's look
at all, all subscriptions.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.860
So you basically have this very
simple master detail flow

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.950
on the left.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:10.270
And you can expand this fully.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:13.010
And you have another very,
very nice reading view.

00:21:13.010 --> 00:21:15.250
The one thing that I love about
this app is that the

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:16.310
typography is great.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.990
You have lots of different
choices for fonts.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:20.020
But their default choice--

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:23.110
I think it's Source Sans by
Adobe, looks great here.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.630
The other thing is that there
are some variations to the

00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:30.580
design guidelines.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:34.490
So for example, if you long
press, you get this kind of

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:36.590
embedded contextual actions.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:40.060
We generally prefer doing things
a different way, but it

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.490
is one way of doing things.

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.380
And actually, the nice thing
about doing it this way is

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.810
that it offers an in-place,
contextual kind of mark

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.910
everything above
me as red, mark

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.430
everything below me as red.

00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:54.190
So it's almost like you have
an immediate sense of what

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.170
you're marking as red.

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:58.395
In general, we tend to use the
contextual action bar instead,

00:21:58.395 --> 00:22:00.600
but this is an alternative.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.080
And then they have nice
little touches.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.620
You can mark something as red
here and things like that.

00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.970
So overall, it's a very
well-branded app.

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:11.110
You'll see that the highlights
throughout are very sharp red.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:16.190
And the general color scheme is
almost like USSR, like dark

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:18.340
gray and bright red.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:20.060
It's almost a little--

00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:24.620
not stock, but it's almost
USSR-colored.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.490
But it's kind of cool.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:31.330
It gives it a very simple,
sharp feeling.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:32.740
So yeah, that's Press.

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:36.350
And like we said before, it's
very much following responsive

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:39.260
design best practices, supports
tablets, phones, all

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.270
sorts of things.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:43.190
ADAM KOCH: All right,
let's keep going.

00:22:46.886 --> 00:22:47.350
All right.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:50.470
So the next up is "New York
Times." Hopefully you're

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.040
familiar with "New York
Times." it's a

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:54.040
very well known newspaper.

00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.580
And we really like this app.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.860
What they've done here really
is use two things which are

00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:03.080
very sort of central, core to
the Android design guidelines,

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.490
is typography and white space,
to really show hierarchy and

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:11.060
also make it feel like
a newspaper.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:15.360
So you can immediately see
here, the titles of each

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.390
article really jumps
out at you.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.250
And then it's got the brief
blurb below that and then some

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.980
imagery in certain cases.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.890
So let's have a look at one
of the articles here.

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.020
It's a very clean layout.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:31.970
I also like how they've used
white space on the sides here

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.180
to bring in the margins to
make it a better reading

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:35.090
experience.

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:37.850
And as recommended, they
have this swipe to

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.070
navigate between articles.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.900
ROMAN NURIK: The images are
really, really crisp.

00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:44.290
So they're serving the right
size images for tablets.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:45.620
ADAM KOCH: Yep.

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.510
And they've done also a great
job here of, again, merging

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.240
the brand colors.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:53.930
In particular, typography
really screams "New York

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.020
Times." You look at this, and
immediately, you're like, oh,

00:23:57.020 --> 00:23:58.990
that looks like the "New York
Times." That feels like the

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.920
"New York Times." But it also
feels very much Android, very

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.290
much Holo designed.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:05.080
ROMAN NURIK: One quick thing
about typography I wanted to

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.590
mention is that in general, you
can't just throw any TTF

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:12.160
file at Android's rendering
engine.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.730
Just because it may look great
on your desktop machine

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.680
doesn't mean it will look
great on Android.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.590
Specifically, there are some
character spacing things that

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:22.750
come up with fonts that
aren't optimized.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.090
So "New York Times's" font here
is specifically optimized

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.060
for mobile, so it works just
great with Android's native

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.140
type rendering system.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.700
ADAM KOCH: Now obviously, the
focus of "New York Times" is

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.590
on text, on reading,
on articles.

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:38.475
But they also actually have a
really nice photos screen.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.080
And as Roman was saying, the
images are really crisp,

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:46.840
really nice.

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.450
This on a Nexus 10.

00:24:48.450 --> 00:24:50.730
They engage the low-profile mode
here so you can really

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.410
just get immersed
in these images.

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:56.540
And they have a similar screen
for videos, as well.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:57.040
All right.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:57.720
Let's keep going.

00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.750
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.745
Next, we have Expedia.

00:24:59.745 --> 00:25:02.320
Nick, do you want to
talk about Expedia?

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.710
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:05.070
It's almost a shame we're
showing this on a tablet

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.260
because they have quite
different running modes on a

00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:08.230
tablet and a phone.

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.070
And I think the phone's been
updated most recently, and it

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:13.230
knocks my socks off.

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:15.910
But the aspects of the Expedia
app that I really wanted to

00:25:15.910 --> 00:25:18.840
call out are the elements
of fun and

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.940
whimsy which they introduce.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.660
So if you can see here, they
have a loading spinner, which

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.590
is a hotel door hanger.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.280
And this actually responds
to the accelerometer.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.020
So I'm not sure if we'll
be able to show it.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:28.510
ADAM KOCH: For some
reason, we can't.

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:32.290
NICK BUTCHER: If you tilt the
device side to side, this

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:35.330
swings back and forth
to remain level.

00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.900
Things like that.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:37.980
All the animations
are super smooth.

00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:40.530
And one of the things the does
really, really well,

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.660
especially the phone one,
is inspire you.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:48.400
So it uses imagery to inspire
you about different

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.580
destinations you might
want to travel to.

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:56.170
So while searching for a hotel
or a flight could be quite a

00:25:56.170 --> 00:25:59.500
dry task, they actually really
introduce fun elements and

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:01.710
inspirational elements
that make the

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:03.110
process much more enjoyable.

00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:05.940
You actually find yourself
really enjoying using the

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.290
application.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:08.680
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah, it
is a shame we can't

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.400
show the phone version.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.780
On the phone version, there's
this really beautiful two-tab

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.940
system, where on the first tab,
you have this kind of

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.960
parallax scrolling list of
hotels and flights, kind of

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:22.626
like deals that give you some
ideas on where to go.

00:26:22.626 --> 00:26:24.340
ADAM KOCH: And among the design
touches, as well,

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.560
there's one loading screen, I
think, where it's like an

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.310
aeroplane window, and you can
actually open the window and

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:30.110
close the window as well.

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.630
It's really cool.

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:32.970
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, if you do a
flight search, you can play

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:35.070
with the shade on the window.

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.513
ROMAN NURIK: Oh, there
is planes.

00:26:36.513 --> 00:26:38.220
ADAM KOCH: I'm not sure
if we can do it.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:41.660
ROMAN NURIK: So not the entire
app is tablet-optimized, but

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.700
certainly this immediate
screen.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.810
OK, so let's move on.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:47.670
Just take our word for it.

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:48.850
Check out Expedia
on your phone.

00:26:48.850 --> 00:26:50.980
It's really awesome.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:52.870
The next app is Flipboard.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:54.820
So I don't think Flipboard
needs too much of an

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:55.350
introduction.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:59.500
But it's, again,
a very simple--

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.960
"Now optimized for Android
tablet screens.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.410
If you prefer, you can switch
back to the phone mode."

00:27:02.410 --> 00:27:04.030
That's fine.

00:27:04.030 --> 00:27:08.400
So Flipboard is kind of an
interactive magazine.

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:14.280
It aggregates everything from
Facebook to Google+ to tech

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:17.260
blogs to news to things like
that and puts it in this kind

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:19.440
of unique UI.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.720
And as you can see here, just
from the beginning, it

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.850
immediately starts
interacting.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:30.710
It starts zooming in photos,
panning photos.

00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:32.670
And it really is immersive.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:35.480
You open this, and you really
feel like you're getting a

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.470
full view of your content.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:39.970
So let's actually flip
through this page.

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.260
And actually, you'll notice that
they have this kind of

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:45.870
unique Flipboard interaction
that's the same across all

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.740
their different platforms.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:52.600
I believe that's part of their
branding, that flip.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:58.380
So if we open up one of these
items, you'll notice that it's

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.550
still very much customized.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:02.580
The UI is--

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.490
again, just like some of the
other apps that we've talked

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:06.590
about, it's very much
about the content.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.580
There's minimal Chrome.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.060
It recedes, fades
out of the way.

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:14.370
But they are, like in Grand
St.'s case, they're using

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:18.070
their visual styling but
applying our interaction

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:21.310
design and UI pattern
best practices.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.770
So they still have the up
button in the top left.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.380
They still have the overflow
that gives

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:26.590
you additional things.

00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:30.290
They do have this additional
option for navigation there,

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:32.110
but whatever.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.720
And they do have search in the
top right, which is kind of

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.480
the standard place
to expose search.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:43.720
But all throughout, their
flipping UI is still there.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:46.260
And so it still feels
like Flipboard, just

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:48.230
customized for Android.

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:53.500
And then if you open up one of
these articles, you'll notice

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:57.620
that, again, they include large
margins on the sides.

00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:03.110
They tweak the font sizes and
line spacing, especially, to

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.580
make sure that on a tablet,
things look great.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.500
And they don't really have
a top action bar here.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.280
But they do have kind of like
a split action bar.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.470
We'll give them that.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:15.770
And basically, all the actions
are available on the bottom

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:19.880
right, and then with an
overflow, as you'd expect.

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:24.590
So yeah, Flipboard, overall,
really custom visual styling,

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:28.340
but still following
a lot of our

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.832
interaction design best practices.

00:29:30.832 --> 00:29:31.410
ADAM KOCH: All right.

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.550
Better get a move
on, as always.

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:36.390
Last is TED, right?

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:36.990
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.670
ADAM KOCH: All right.

00:29:37.670 --> 00:29:39.500
So TED, hopefully you're
familiar with it.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:44.360
They post up some great free
TED talks to inspire you.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:46.780
This app actually follows
the Holo design

00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:48.365
language quite closely.

00:29:48.365 --> 00:29:51.440
They've just customized the
colors accordingly to fit in

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:53.670
really nicely with the TED
colors, which are just the

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:55.440
white and red.

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.780
The focus, purely on content.

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:02.730
You see these great big,
large video thumbnails.

00:30:02.730 --> 00:30:04.900
Multi-column, again,
scales very well to

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:05.840
different screen sizes.

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:08.900
You can swipe between the tabs
here, between these three main

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.911
tabs, My Talks, All Talks,
and Featured.

00:30:12.911 --> 00:30:16.090
They've got these three larger
banner images at the top here

00:30:16.090 --> 00:30:18.910
to promote the featured
or latest.

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.860
And then again, once you're
viewing the talks, you can

00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:23.870
swipe between the talks
very nicely here.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:24.980
It's a great app.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:27.180
Hopefully, a lot of you
have seen it before.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.190
There's really not that much
more to say, other than

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:32.300
they've done a really good
job merging TED brand

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.050
with Android Holo.

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:35.220
ROMAN NURIK: Yeah.

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.540
Solid.

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:36.900
ADAM KOCH: All right.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:38.640
We've got one more.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.790
ROMAN NURIK: OK, so those are
the 11 apps in the Beautiful

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:42.460
Design collection,
summer 2013.

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:46.650
If you just search for Beautiful
Design 2013, you

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.370
should find our blog
post announcing it.

00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:50.020
And I think that it's currently
visible on Google

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.610
Play, if you go to Apps
and scroll all

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.290
the way to the bottom.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.080
Now there's one more app we
wanted to talk about.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:58.040
Nick, do you want to
talk about Timely?

00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:58.320
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.350
So this is a new app that
launched just yesterday, I

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:05.360
think, which is an alarm
and stopwatch and timer

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:07.490
application.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:09.340
But I really love this app.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:13.200
So I think the one word which I
would use to summarize this

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.550
app is polish.

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:16.245
Every single thing you do
in this application

00:31:16.245 --> 00:31:17.860
is extremely polished.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.855
So from right here,
we can show--

00:31:20.855 --> 00:31:23.190
so this panel on the right hand
side showing the current

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.650
time is the main display.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.480
On the phone app, this would
be the launch screen.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.150
And I love the way that as you
swipe between the three major

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.470
tabs, that content always
stays persistent.

00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:34.620
So whether it's larger when
you're in the center view or

00:31:34.620 --> 00:31:37.660
over on the side, it's a really
fun way to use the

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.590
extra space on larger devices.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:43.630
But as Roman is swiping around,
you can see the

00:31:43.630 --> 00:31:46.030
changes in the background color
and the subtly moving

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.520
background images.

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.160
Everything about this
application screams polish.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:55.290
So I think one of the fun things
I like, they have a lot

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:56.400
of custom items in here.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.650
So like the background, for
example, is very, very custom.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.030
And you can even go ahead and
can tweak the colors on that,

00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.890
which is kind of fun.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:06.370
So if you go into the overflow
menu and change themes and

00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:08.355
then click on that little thing,
you have this really,

00:32:08.355 --> 00:32:11.050
really fun color picker that
lets you just completely,

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:15.055
completely customize this
application to whatever color

00:32:15.055 --> 00:32:16.700
scheme you want.

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.360
And I really love the-- and I
think it's actually quite a

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.190
clever marketing idea, that
lets you do the full

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.870
customization.

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:23.510
But if you want to save it,
that's an in-app purchase.

00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:27.140
So I think it's really fun to
demonstrate its value before

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.520
charging you for that.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.940
If you want to show the
stopwatch and timer.

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:32.900
So for example, if you look at
the interaction used for

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.365
setting a timer--

00:32:34.365 --> 00:32:37.070
actually, the stopwatch
is fine.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.430
ROMAN NURIK: OK, stopwatch.

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.720
Got it.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.000
ADAM KOCH: We're just having
too much fun here.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.195
NICK BUTCHER: So hopefully,
the framerate

00:32:40.195 --> 00:32:41.200
is picking up here.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:43.155
But you have this almost
like a heartbeat.

00:32:43.155 --> 00:32:45.960
You see the pulse moving around
the circle, tracking

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:48.230
the time as it goes up.

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.680
Little details like that,
they've gone beyond the level

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.410
of just having the
time ticking up.

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.360
They actually have these
beautiful, interactive

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.250
animations.

00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:00.670
And if you go the timer as well,
I think very similar to

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:02.300
the Timer application we looked
at before that had a

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.680
very visceral way
of setting it.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.260
But these beautifully engaging
kind of animations.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.660
And I love the way, as you go
past the minute or hour or

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:13.610
whatever, how it shrinks
in and grows out.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:15.930
ROMAN NURIK: Also, one of the
coolest things is that the

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:17.750
text actually morphs.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:20.900
So 6 morphs into 5
into 4 and so on.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.545
So I don't know how they're
doing that, but it's really,

00:33:22.545 --> 00:33:24.480
really cool.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.050
One thing that I wanted to
mention is that I feel like

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:31.660
they've done a crazy good job
of styling everything to fit

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:33.480
their almost transparent UI.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:37.180
So even the setting screen that
you would expect to be

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:43.330
kind of boring has this
immersive, interactive,

00:33:43.330 --> 00:33:45.040
animated background.

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.670
And all of the controls
just blend

00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:48.990
beautifully on top of it.

00:33:48.990 --> 00:33:53.280
So they've just done an insanely
good job on that.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.530
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, so just
animations, polish everywhere.

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.150
This app is incredibly
polished.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.727
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, they have
a lot of those subtle

00:33:59.727 --> 00:33:59.870
animations.

00:33:59.870 --> 00:34:00.693
NICK BUTCHER: I love
that interaction.

00:34:00.693 --> 00:34:02.545
ADAM KOCH: Sorry, Nick.

00:34:02.545 --> 00:34:05.790
NICK BUTCHER: No worries.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.220
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.449
I think that's all the
time we have, right?

00:34:08.449 --> 00:34:09.909
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, we're a bit--

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:10.370
ROMAN NURIK: OK.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.590
So I think that's all the
time we have for today.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:15.550
Thanks again for joining.

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.830
And yeah, just one
last reminder.

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.210
If you haven't seen this
collection, if you haven't

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:20.739
downloaded and installed some of
these apps, definitely make

00:34:20.739 --> 00:34:22.120
sure to do so.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.460
Just search for Beautiful
Design summer 2013,

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.580
and you'll get there.

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:25.940
All right.

00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.300
That's it.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.190
NICK BUTCHER: And a challenge
to all you

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:28.290
designers out there.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:31.630
As Roman said at the top of
the show, the plan is to

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:34.440
update this collection
periodically.

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.900
So we're going to cycle
out some apps,

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.570
bring in some new apps.

00:34:36.570 --> 00:34:40.010
So this is really a challenge
for you designers out there.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:42.690
This is the goal you want be
aiming for is to be getting

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:43.520
into this collection.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.400
And so let's see what
you can do.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:46.870
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:47.540
All right, thanks, everyone.

00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.000
ADAM KOCH: Thanks, guys.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:48.862
ROMAN NURIK: See you later.

00:34:48.862 --> 00:34:50.250
NICK BUTCHER: Bye.

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:51.500
ADAM KOCH: Bye.
