00:00:02.863 --> 00:00:04.444
- I just think it's very
important to kind of

00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:06.390
accept your reality, you know,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.244
and accept where you are, and, you know,

00:00:08.244 --> 00:00:10.230
but you just have to keep on doing you.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.231
I mean, despite what it
looks like, you know.

00:00:12.231 --> 00:00:14.722
You're the man of the family,
you're the head of the family.

00:00:14.722 --> 00:00:15.793
But are you?

00:00:15.793 --> 00:00:19.978
It's where you are, you're
the head of the house,

00:00:19.978 --> 00:00:21.942
you're not working, you're
not bringing in any money,

00:00:21.942 --> 00:00:24.350
and that's tough, you know.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.370
I don't love that.
- Yeah.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.616
- But . . .

00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:27.449
- Yeah.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.078
Yeah, well, I'm, yeah,
I'm, I'm gettin' there.

00:00:31.078 --> 00:00:31.911
Baby steps.

00:00:31.911 --> 00:00:33.911
- Very small steps.

00:00:33.911 --> 00:00:36.661
Tiny, tiny, little steps for you.

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:40.973
Little, little, little,
little, little baby steps.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:42.556
So small, so small.

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:45.344
- We're,
- Yeah.

00:00:45.344 --> 00:00:46.609
- We're doin', we're doin' it.

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:47.720
- We're all doin' it
- We'll get there.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.260
Everyone's got their own road, and

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.549
- We all have our own journey.
- and we have our own journey.

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:55.216
And you could get hit
by a bus tomorrow, so.

00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:58.133
- I'm so glad you're here.

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:00.883
Oh, my God, I wanted to show you,

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.137
you are gonna die, this
will really cheer you up.

00:01:04.137 --> 00:01:04.970
- [Jason] Yeah?

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.188
- Yeah, this is, I just want you,

00:01:07.188 --> 00:01:09.102
just take a look at these photographs,

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:12.485
and just check out these pieces.

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:14.240
- Uh huh.
- These photographs.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.347
- What am I lookin' at here?

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:18.463
- That is a landscape.

00:01:18.463 --> 00:01:19.296
- Okay.

00:01:19.296 --> 00:01:21.625
- Actually, you know,
gotta turn it that way.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:23.946
So, tell me who you think took these.

00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:25.646
- Who?
- They're the most brilliant--

00:01:25.646 --> 00:01:26.940
- [Jason] Who do I think took these?

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.935
- Yeah, who took these photographs?

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:29.783
- I don't, I don't know.

00:01:29.783 --> 00:01:31.803
- Ryder.
- A blind person?

00:01:31.803 --> 00:01:34.193
- Ryder, my five year old.

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:35.845
- Oh, yeah, Ryder.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:37.241
- He's five years old.

00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:38.460
My son is five years old

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.843
and he is taking
- Yes, he is.

00:01:39.843 --> 00:01:41.216
- These kinds of pictures.

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:43.764
This is the most brilliant,
the colors are just like--

00:01:43.764 --> 00:01:44.597
- There's a shot of--
- These are the most

00:01:44.597 --> 00:01:46.196
brilliant stuff.
- There's a shot

00:01:46.196 --> 00:01:47.118
up your nose, there.

00:01:47.118 --> 00:01:48.175
- Yeah, it is.
- Right up your nose,

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:49.685
- Yep.
- and then there's your teeth.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.521
- He's just, what he frames, I don't even,

00:01:52.521 --> 00:01:54.943
I wouldn't ever think to do that.

00:01:54.943 --> 00:01:56.587
Is he not brilliant, and the kid's like,

00:01:56.587 --> 00:01:59.170
just, he's brilliant, isn't he?

00:02:00.158 --> 00:02:01.825
- Um, yeah, I don't,

00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:08.142
I don't know if I'd
use the word brilliant.

00:02:08.142 --> 00:02:09.721
Seems like he--
- What would you call him?

00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:11.348
Like--
- You know, it's great that

00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:13.663
your son knows how to
work a digital camera,

00:02:13.663 --> 00:02:16.638
and, you know, I think he, I think he just

00:02:16.638 --> 00:02:18.765
was snappin' the picture a lot, you know.

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:21.113
He was ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.

00:02:21.113 --> 00:02:23.325
I'm not really sure--
- When the moment struck him.

00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:24.460
Absolutely he was.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.462
When--
- Yeah.

00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:26.541
- When he saw something that he

00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:28.958
wanted to frame up, and, yes.

00:02:30.074 --> 00:02:34.123
- Yeah, I probably wouldn't
call them brilliant.

00:02:34.123 --> 00:02:38.206
I wouldn't just throw that
world around, you know

00:02:41.503 --> 00:02:43.420
- Can I have this back?

00:02:46.237 --> 00:02:47.904
- [Jason] I'm sorry.

00:02:49.227 --> 00:02:50.123
- You wouldn't, so, what then?

00:02:50.123 --> 00:02:52.555
- [Jason] No, I'm just sayin' I, you know,

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:55.138
I don't know if it's brilliant.

00:02:57.714 --> 00:02:58.897
- I don't wanna say this
in front of the kids,

00:02:58.897 --> 00:03:01.213
you're being an asshole right now.

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:02.046
- Me?

00:03:02.046 --> 00:03:02.884
- I think you're being kind of an asshole.

00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:05.026
- You think I'm, you think
I'm being an asshole?

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:06.879
I'm not being an asshole.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:08.628
I'm just saying, you asked
me if they were brilliant,

00:03:08.628 --> 00:03:11.378
and I just, hey, no, they're not,

00:03:12.492 --> 00:03:14.810
they're not that, they're not brilliant.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.712
I reserve my use of the word brilliant

00:03:17.712 --> 00:03:21.545
for different things,
you know, like a sunset,

00:03:22.448 --> 00:03:26.304
or somebody who creates the AIDS vaccine.

00:03:26.304 --> 00:03:27.293
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:03:27.293 --> 00:03:28.126
- Okay.
- So.

00:03:28.126 --> 00:03:29.663
- I just think, just because the word

00:03:29.663 --> 00:03:31.639
has never been used to describe you

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.382
or your work, doesn't mean you can't be

00:03:33.382 --> 00:03:35.584
generous with it when it's deserved, okay.

00:03:35.584 --> 00:03:36.492
- Um, okay.

00:03:36.492 --> 00:03:37.554
- And that's all I'm saying.

00:03:37.554 --> 00:03:38.387
I don't want you to look at them again.

00:03:38.387 --> 00:03:39.573
- Okay, you know, well maybe.
- Like you give me that back.

00:03:39.573 --> 00:03:41.003
- Well, maybe I'll go out and take

00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:44.801
a couple of shots of your cat's asshole.

00:03:44.801 --> 00:03:46.634
- That was his sister.

00:03:47.846 --> 00:03:50.513
(uptempo music)
