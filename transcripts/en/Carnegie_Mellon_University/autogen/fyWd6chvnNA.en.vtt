that's been underway for about a year
now and we'll find out if this approach

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760
now and we'll find out if this approach
 

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:46.030
now and we'll find out if this approach
has any role in the treatment of

has any role in the treatment of
 

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.100

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:06.950
 
I think we have time for a several

01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960
I think we have time for a several
 

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:10.550
I think we have time for a several
questions so actually it's open for

01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:10.560
questions so actually it's open for
 

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:29.440
questions so actually it's open for
discussion yes

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:29.450
 
 

01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:36.039
 
consumer applications

01:00:36.039 --> 01:00:36.049
 
 

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:40.039
 
now the question was whether the these

01:00:40.039 --> 01:00:40.049
now the question was whether the these
 

01:00:40.049 --> 01:00:41.569
now the question was whether the these
kinds of artificial proteins might be

01:00:41.569 --> 01:00:41.579
kinds of artificial proteins might be
 

01:00:41.579 --> 01:00:43.640
kinds of artificial proteins might be
used as commodity large-scale materials

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:43.650
used as commodity large-scale materials
 

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:45.890
used as commodity large-scale materials
I think if that happens I think it will

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:45.900
I think if that happens I think it will
 

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.900
I think if that happens I think it will
happen a long way down the road i think

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:47.910
happen a long way down the road i think
 

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:52.370
happen a long way down the road i think
that the higher cost applications are

01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380
that the higher cost applications are
 

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.640
that the higher cost applications are
more easily justified i think that what

01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:55.650
more easily justified i think that what
 

01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:59.359
more easily justified i think that what
is novel about this class of materials

01:00:59.359 --> 01:00:59.369
is novel about this class of materials
 

01:00:59.369 --> 01:01:02.059
is novel about this class of materials
is there information content and so i

01:01:02.059 --> 01:01:02.069
is there information content and so i
 

01:01:02.069 --> 01:01:03.710
is there information content and so i
think its applications in which that

01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720
think its applications in which that
 

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:06.049
think its applications in which that
information content is important that

01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:06.059
information content is important that
 

01:01:06.059 --> 01:01:09.319
information content is important that
will develop first it may be over time

01:01:09.319 --> 01:01:09.329
will develop first it may be over time
 

01:01:09.329 --> 01:01:19.890
will develop first it may be over time
that larger scale applications come

01:01:19.890 --> 01:01:19.900
 
 

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:28.049
 
before

01:01:28.049 --> 01:01:28.059
 
 

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.760
 
yeah that's that's a serious complaint

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:30.770
yeah that's that's a serious complaint
 

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:34.030
yeah that's that's a serious complaint
the question was when you incorporate

01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:34.040
the question was when you incorporate
 

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.490
the question was when you incorporate
amino acids not natural amino acids the

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:36.500
amino acids not natural amino acids the
 

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:38.890
amino acids not natural amino acids the
way I described they'll be incorporated

01:01:38.890 --> 01:01:38.900
way I described they'll be incorporated
 

01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.750
way I described they'll be incorporated
into all proteins that being made in

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:40.760
into all proteins that being made in
 

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.880

acids in there does this cause problems

01:01:45.849 --> 01:01:45.859
acids in there does this cause problems
 

01:01:45.859 --> 01:01:47.829
acids in there does this cause problems
for the help of the cell and do they

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839
for the help of the cell and do they
 

01:01:47.839 --> 01:01:50.890
for the help of the cell and do they
complain for example by dying members

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:50.900
complain for example by dying members
 

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:56.250
complain for example by dying members
that is the phrasing of the question and

01:01:56.250 --> 01:01:56.260
 
 

01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:59.470
 
the answer has it's often the case is it

01:01:59.470 --> 01:01:59.480
the answer has it's often the case is it
 

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:02.680
the answer has it's often the case is it
depends on how you do the experiment if

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:02.690
depends on how you do the experiment if
 

01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:07.000
depends on how you do the experiment if
you try to replace every copy of a

you try to replace every copy of a
 

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:09.579
you try to replace every copy of a
natural amino acid by not naturally one

01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:09.589
natural amino acid by not naturally one
 

01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:12.309
natural amino acid by not naturally one
then it typically will have a few hours

01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319
then it typically will have a few hours
 

01:02:12.319 --> 01:02:14.770
then it typically will have a few hours
in which to do that in a bacterial cell

01:02:14.770 --> 01:02:14.780
in which to do that in a bacterial cell
 

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:18.099
in which to do that in a bacterial cell
those are doing a material synthesis and

01:02:18.099 --> 01:02:18.109
those are doing a material synthesis and
 

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:20.910
those are doing a material synthesis and
you do it in a batch mode you'll have

01:02:20.910 --> 01:02:20.920
you do it in a batch mode you'll have
 

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:24.010
you do it in a batch mode you'll have
three to six maybe even 10 hours where

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:24.020
three to six maybe even 10 hours where
 

01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.420
three to six maybe even 10 hours where
those cells will continue making

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:25.430
those cells will continue making
 

01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:27.760
those cells will continue making
proteins at a high level and eventually

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:27.770
proteins at a high level and eventually
 

01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:30.160
proteins at a high level and eventually
they will begin to shut down because

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:30.170
they will begin to shut down because
 

01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:33.160
they will begin to shut down because
you've been activated some set of

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:33.170
you've been activated some set of
 

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:35.980
you've been activated some set of
essential proteins so for synthesis

essential proteins so for synthesis
 

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:37.660
essential proteins so for synthesis
that's perfectly okay that's the way we

01:02:37.660 --> 01:02:37.670
that's perfectly okay that's the way we
 

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:40.059
that's perfectly okay that's the way we
do batch protein expression anyway and

01:02:40.059 --> 01:02:40.069
do batch protein expression anyway and
 

01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:42.760
do batch protein expression anyway and
as you saw we can make grand quantities

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:42.770
as you saw we can make grand quantities
 

01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:45.490
as you saw we can make grand quantities
of these proteins in which we get fairly

01:02:45.490 --> 01:02:45.500
of these proteins in which we get fairly
 

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.530
of these proteins in which we get fairly
high levels of replaces that protein

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:47.540
high levels of replaces that protein

this is a feat now the proteomics

01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480
this is a feat now the proteomics
 

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:04.750
this is a feat now the proteomics
experiment is quite different they were

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:04.760
experiment is quite different they were
 

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.750
experiment is quite different they were
not trying to replace many copies

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:06.760
not trying to replace many copies
 

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.880
not trying to replace many copies
people asking in fact we do single hip

01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:08.890
people asking in fact we do single hip
 

01:03:08.890 --> 01:03:10.890
people asking in fact we do single hip
statistics on the proteins we even

statistics on the proteins we even
replace long cotton or none because we

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:13.660

only need one cycle conjugations in

01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:15.700
only need one cycle conjugations in
 

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.660
only need one cycle conjugations in
order to enrich that protein from mixed

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:18.670
order to enrich that protein from mixed
 

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:20.460
order to enrich that protein from mixed
and so in that case we see very little

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:20.470
and so in that case we see very little
 

01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:22.530
and so in that case we see very little
perturbation of the cellular physiology

01:03:22.530 --> 01:03:22.540
perturbation of the cellular physiology
 

01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:25.050
perturbation of the cellular physiology
as you can imagine this is a very modest

01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:25.060
as you can imagine this is a very modest

a methyl group of finding reincorporated
 

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.060
a methyl group of finding reincorporated
is in at one site in the protein and so

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:33.070
is in at one site in the protein and so
 

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:35.850
is in at one site in the protein and so
this actually shows very little evidence

01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:35.860
this actually shows very little evidence
 

01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:38.730

festive proteins are fundamentally made
by incorporating multiple copies of

01:08:22.810 --> 01:08:22.820
by incorporating multiple copies of
 

01:08:22.820 --> 01:08:26.050
by incorporating multiple copies of
their amino acids and so we regard this

01:08:26.050 --> 01:08:26.060
their amino acids and so we regard this
 

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.599
their amino acids and so we regard this
as an evolution process that's more

01:08:28.599 --> 01:08:28.609
as an evolution process that's more
 

01:08:28.609 --> 01:08:30.910
as an evolution process that's more
nearly parallel to the natural evolution

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:30.920
nearly parallel to the natural evolution
