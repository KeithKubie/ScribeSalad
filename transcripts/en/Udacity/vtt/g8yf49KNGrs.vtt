00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.670
All right. Now so just to kind of reinforce this

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.340
idea and also to let us think about it in

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.460
a slightly different direction, I want you to consider solving

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.810
the following quiz. Here's four payoffs that I've put little

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.880
boxes around. This one at minus 1, minus 1, this

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.890
one at minus 3, 0, and this one at minus

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.120
4, minus 4. And the question is, which of these

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.430
payoffs can be the average payoff for some joint strategy?

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.160
And this is in the repeated game setting, [CROSSTALK]

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.790
okay. So what we're imagining is these two players can

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.917
coordinate in any way they want. We're not talking

00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:36.800
about trying to maximize reward or, or, being Nash or

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.240
anything like that. They're just going to execute some,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.720
some pattern of, of strategies over infinite run. We're going to

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.520
average the payoffs that the two players get and we'll

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.620
say, you know is it possible for them to adopt

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.350
a strategy so that the average per time step gets minus 3 for Smooth

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.532
and 0 for Curly? Yes or no? So check that box if that's possible. Can it be that

00:01:01.532 --> 00:01:05.823
they both get minus one on average? If so, check this box. And can it be

00:01:05.823 --> 00:01:07.762
that they both get minus 4 on average?

00:01:07.762 --> 00:01:10.910
Check this box. Does that, does that make sense?

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:11.770
&gt;&gt; It does make sense.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.260
&gt;&gt; All right, so I'll give you a chance to think it through and answer it.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.650
&gt;&gt; Okay.
