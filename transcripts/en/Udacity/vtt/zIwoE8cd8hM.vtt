00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The numerical approach is just about perfect to determine the heat capacity of the oceans.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In particular, as we need tons of geographic data,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the numerical approaches are not good to prove something about mathematics,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and particularly not when it comes to infinite numbers of operations,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and to determine whether a control system is unconditionally stable or not

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is also not a great task for numerical approaches.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We should first do some mathematics to get some general statements about that control system

00:00:29.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and then we can possibly use numerics on a very abstract level, for instance, to analyze matrices.
