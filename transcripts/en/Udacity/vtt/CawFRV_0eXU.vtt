00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now we can say what the order of a solver is.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A solver is a method such as the forward Euler method

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that we used to solve differential equations on the computer going step by step.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
For the forward Euler method, we know that the global truncation error, the error after a finite time

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is something like a constant times the step size.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In the general case, it may not be the step size but this step size raise to a certain power,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that power is called the order.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The forward Euler method has an order of one, so that we end up with the constant times h.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
More powerful methods we have larger orders, say two or four,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and again, we have to keep in mind that this constant depends on time.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It may grow exponentially with time for instance.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This constant does not depends on step size, however. Know this site.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Be sure not to confuse this notion of order with the notion of order of a differential equation.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
When we have differential equation of this sort for instance, this is of order two.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The order of a differential equation is a different story.
