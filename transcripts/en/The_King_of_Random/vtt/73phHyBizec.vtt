00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.019
Hey guys, welcome back to the dome today, we're gonna be trying out something that a ton of people have requested

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.679
We're gonna try pouring molten salt into both water and ice

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.889
I'm pretty sure both of these are experiments that have previously done by The Backyard Scientist and he had some really cool results

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:14.969
He's got some great stuff on this channel

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.778
Go check it out if you want to see more, but we didn't think it was fair that he had all of the fun

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:19.930
So we want to try it out ourselves

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.019
Plus we got these nifty clear blocks of ice that you can really see through pretty well and I want to see how that looks

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.049
On camera. A quick run-through of how our salt pouring device works. It's a very basic frame with just this one piece

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.679
It's on a hinge

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.189
it's got a steel cup that our crucible fits nicely down into the first binder clip will hold the steel cup in place on the

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.370
Hinge portion and then I have additional binder clips which can fit on the steel cup and that can prevent our crucible from tipping out

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.410
There's a string attached to the back of the hinged portion and when that gets pulled the whole thing tips

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.170
Three two one

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.010
That was pretty cool the water definitely looked like he was exploding it didn't break the tank which I kind of thought it might

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.529
And I'm not sure what makes the difference between breaking the tank and not breaking the tank. Maybe I need more salt

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.820
Maybe they need hotter salt a lot of variables in there, but that reacted very violently and very quickly

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.760
It's slightly warm water

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.729
Not really hot water. I think we need to try that again

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.100
Three-two-one

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.249
I Honestly think this is just stronger glass than the aquarium glass well the heat from our crucible

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.630
Is now starting to burn our wood. So let's take that off

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.980
Nice

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.169
We got another pretty good explosion that water really had a lot of energy coming out of it it was flying through the air

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.930
I'm a little surprised our glass didn't break, but this glass is actually really strong stuff

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.049
Remember, this is the same thing that we use as our vacuum chamber

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.700
It can hold a surprising amount the pressure apparently both pushing from the outside and from the inside

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.150
So I don't think there's any cracks or breaks on this

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.980
So it really did a good job of containing all of our water and while it may have been exciting to watch it explode

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.110
It's good to know how strong these things are

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.790
Really our binder clips are quite warm

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.920
Yeah, we did manage to catch fire to the hinged portion of our little device here that was fun not unsurprising though overall though

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.920
I think this pouring device works pretty nicely

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.329
Now we've tried a couple times pouring it into water

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.270
I want to see what happens if we pour our molten salt into a block of ice

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.600
Here, we've got a block of ice probably weighs about 20 pounds and this is ice that's designed for ice carving

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.439
Which means it is super clear. You can see through this ice pretty darn

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.999
Well, I've drilled a hole about halfway down through the block of ice which you can see through the side

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.929
We're gonna try pouring some salt down into that hole and see what happens

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.680
You do a test

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.619
I'm gonna fill this with water and see where it pours so I can have the block lined up in just the right spot

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.030
It was still warm

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.870
There's some pours

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.820
That's where it lands first

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.200
It's probably a pretty good spot

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.779
All right. Let's get some salt melting put it into our pouring device and pour it into a block of ice

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.379
That sound three two one

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.240
Missed I think

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:50.369
oh I think it still is cracking the surface of the block. I just saw their tiny little cracks appearing in it and then they

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.979
Seal up right away. Oh

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:55.499
It looks like a lot of our salt

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:59.729
Landed on the back of the block and didn't really get down into the drilled out hole of it

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.299
So we'll try scooting the block back and doing this again

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:08.729
three two one

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.469
Ha ha ha Wow, all right. Well it didn't blow up the block of ice but that was

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.120
Amazingly loud. That was pretty much an explosion right there. Holy cow

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:28.199
We have sort of an echo chamber in the dome behind us. But that was really loud. It sounded like a gunshot

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.199
surprised We didn't crack the block quite surprised

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.329
Take this thing off before it lights my whole contraption on fire

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.389
This will be unwise but I'm just gonna pour the rest rest of this little salt right on there

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:43.498
Wow is so loud

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:52.199
That's nuts the blocks of icing you can usually buy at the grocery store or something like that are just chipped ice that have been compressed

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.188
Down into a block and they're not nearly as strong as a solid clear block of ice

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.239
Although I bet we could get one of those to blow up if we had a slightly different layout

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.109
Perhaps if we had a taller block with a longer hole drilled down into it

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.759
We would be able to get more salt down inside the ice and instead of shooting up into the air like we had here

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.299
More of it would push outward that might be something that we try in the future

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.370
I do happen to have one of these blocks of compressed ice. Let's see what happens when we pour a little salt into here

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Three two one

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.580
Exploded pretty well

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.220
exactly as far as I had drilled the hole I

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.839
Had really only drilled to about that far in because I have a short drill bit

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.220
That's how deep it exploded. And then after it exploded salt tunnel the way down in

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:47.510
That was pretty explosive

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.359
Guys we've tried a couple different things with molten salt and ice and I haven't seen the result

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.669
I was most hoping for which is to see the block of ice crack open or even possibly explode

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.480
So I've got another block of clear ice. It's actually an entirely different day

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.519
I came back up here with the new block of ice

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.910
I've got more salt melting in the foundry and we're gonna try this one more time

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.369
in addition to being a new block of ice

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:15.139
This one is actually also a little bit thicker and I've drilled the hole a little bit deeper down into it

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.769
So hopefully there will be more molten salt down inside the ice

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.410
Transferring heat around at the same time

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.200
three two one

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.200
Woah

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.900
it exploded

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.900
Great

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.690
Yeah

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.839
Whoo. Oh, that was beautiful

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.079
Beautiful. Look at that. That is a clean

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.679
Crack ting like you didn't fragment everywhere. Basically just tore the block in half

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:04.160
That is interesting. So I guess not terribly surprisingly it tries to take the path of least resistance

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:10.549
This block was thicker left to right than it was front to back and it cracked along the thinner axis

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.260
That is the result that I was hoping for

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:17.749
So a larger block of ice with a hole drilled farther down into it gave us a much more explosive result

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.510
Yeah, you can see how it went all back together that

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.600
Was beautiful

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.730
