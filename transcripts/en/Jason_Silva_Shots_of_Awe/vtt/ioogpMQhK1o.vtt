JASON SILVA: You
know, I'm somebody

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.540
that's a real big hoarder
of quotes and ideas.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.090
Whenever I stumble
upon something

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.460
that's exquisitely
well written, I

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.350
long to capture it, to
clothe it, to transcribe it,

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:18.180
to basically record it.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.810
There is a manic
desire to capture

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.400
the reverberation of something
magnificent, of something

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.180
beautiful.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.950
And so there's all
these lines that I

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.760
have in my head that seem to
apply to almost every moment

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.320
of contemplative exactitude.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.515
One of them, of course, is,
I look upon this horizon

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:40.020
and I think to myself, and
all the clocks in the city

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.920
began to whir and chime.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.470
Oh, let not time deceive you.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.120
You cannot conquer time.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.380
In headaches and in worries
vaguely life leaks away.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.670
And time will have its
fancy tomorrow, or today.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.170
So that's kind of
depressing, right?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.940
That's about dread.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.500
That's about time
passing, no matter what.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.708
But then there's other lines.

00:00:57.708 --> 00:00:59.045
Other lines that inspire me.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.420
One of those lines, for example,
could be something like,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.860
to see the world
in a grain of sand,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.120
and the heaven in a wild flower.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.790
Hold infinity in the
palm of your hand,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.006
hold eternity in an hour.

00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:12.630
All of a sudden,
everything is radiant.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.880
Everything is resplendent.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.110
Everything is
beautiful, again, right?

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.520
It's like when
Henry Miller says,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.750
even a blade of grass when
given proper attention becomes

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.050
a magnificent thing in itself.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.250
So what does that tell us?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.060
That something as mundane
as grass can be exquisite.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.770
That something as
dull as the every day

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.410
can become magnificent,
resplendent, miraculous,

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.370
divine.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.940
Only if we're able to tweak
our perceptions, to shift

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.570
our perception,
through the arresting

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.130
and modulation of attention.

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.490
That's why cinema, that's
why poetry, that's why art,

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.520
arrests the body
mind and thrusts it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.360
towards the numinous.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.330
And that's such an
important thing.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.420
And all of a sudden we
become like Dylan Thomas.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.540
And we feel inspired.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.190
And we say, I love
this moment so much.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.640
I will not go gently
into that goodnight.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.760
I will rage, rage against
the dying of the light.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.890
I will practice random kindness
and senseless acts of beauty.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.120
Because minds are like
parachutes and they only

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.350
function when open.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.890
And Timothy Leary was right.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.590
In order to use
your head, you've

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.840
got to go out of your mind.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.010
It's amazing how the self
is mediated by the ideas

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.170
that it is exposed to.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.630
My very personality,
my very quest,

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.740
is shaped and authored
by the bumper stickers,

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.480
by the words of wisdom, that
I stumble upon along the way.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.860
Think about that for a minute.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.850
There's a documentary
I saw once,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.190
it was called "In Search
of the Miraculous."

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.420
And isn't that the search?

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.550
I mean isn't the search for
the divine, for the miraculous,

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.430
for the inconceivably sublime,
what life is all about?

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.970
Isn't that what Joseph Campbell
talked about when he talked

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.230
about the hero's journey?

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.030
And apotheosis, and rebirth,
and resurrection, right?

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.420
Holy moments, the mysterium
tremendum et fascinosum.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.020
And again, it all comes down
to controlling and mediating

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.540
our attention.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.560
Darwin said it best.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.050
Attention, if sudden
and close graduates

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.450
into surprise, and this
into astonishment, and this

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.920
into stupefied amazement.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.810
So if you are a wonder junkie,
if you believe as Carl Sagan

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.570
did that understanding
is a kind of ecstasy.

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.190
If you are hungry
for the sublime,

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.980
learn to control your attention.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.930
Learn to control your
mind, your thoughts.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.030
Because your creative
and linguistic choices,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.010
the very words you use
to map your reality,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.700
feed back into your reality.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.020
You are the painting.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.570
You are the paintbrush.
s You are the canvas.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.970
You are the question.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.970
You are the answer to the
question you are looking for.

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.000
You are, also my
friends, the question.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.080
You are everything.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.230
We are everything.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.130
We are sentient.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.290
We are consciousness.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.050
The most sublime, miraculous
thing in the universe.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.290
So you'd better be having a good
time and authoring your fate.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.880
Turn your life into a living,
breathing, work of art,

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.610
because anything less
would be a tragedy.
