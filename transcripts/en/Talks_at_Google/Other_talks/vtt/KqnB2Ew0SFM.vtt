&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hello. Good afternoon.
My name is Alana Weiss, and

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.450
today it is my pleasure to welcome Robert
Steven Kaplan

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.870
to the Leading@Google series. Rob is a professor
of

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.539
management practice at the Harvard Business
School and

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:17.780
prior to joining HBS he served as the vice
chairman of

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.250
the Goldman-Sachs group with oversight responsibility
for the investment banking and investment

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.520
management
divisions. Rob is also currently Google's

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.660
chairman of
the investment advisory committee. Please

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.000
join me in
welcoming Rob.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.990
[Clapping]
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Thanks, Alana, and thanks for

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:43.242
having me. Just out of curiosity given that
you're here

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:48.489
on your lunch break, how many of you feel
stressed out?

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.990
Stressed out. Losing sleep at night? Really?
Worry?

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.660
That's not good. I'm sorry to hear that. What
are you

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.980
worried -- just throw out a few things. What
are you

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.100
worried about? Those who raised their hand,
what are

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.510
you so worried about? All right. So you're
juggling

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.850
too many things. Okay. Which is what we were
talking

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:21.650
about before. Others? Any others? What's that?
Insurance settlement. Okay. All right. What

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.909
else?
How many of you manage a project, or a project

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.070
team, or
people? How many of you would like to manage

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.740
a project,
project team, or people? All right. Okay.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.030
Here's what
I'm going to do. Not to spoil your lunch,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.530
first of all.
Here's what I'm going to talk about. I'm going

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.891
through
just six or seven slides. I'm going to try

00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:49.020
actually not
to talk for more than 30, 35 minutes, then

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.049
we're going to
leave the rest of the time to questions, things

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.820
you want
to talk about. The reason I'm doing this is,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.829
this is
actually a version of a talk I've been giving

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.270
for the past 25
years for better or worse because I learned

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.190
a long time
ago in leading businesses, leading non-profits,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.690
working
with organizations, I realized I was never

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.370
going to
ultimately figure out all the answers. And

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.730
as the world
gets more complex and you're in a very complicated

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.010
business, as a leader, no matter how smart
you are,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.440
experienced you are, you're never going to
have all the

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.260
answers. You're never going to understand
well enough

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.880
to be telling people what they ought to be
doing in a

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.310
lot of cases, and what you don't want to do
is be

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.170
ordering people to do things and be wrong.
And so what

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.701
I've learned over the years is the most important
thing

00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:46.141
a leader can do is learn to ask the right
questions, be

00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:51.250
open to learning. There are times to give
orders and

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.700
advocate and say this is what we're going
to do, but the

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.239
stronger leaders know when to do that and
also know when

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.370
to ask questions. And so what I'm going to
do here

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.790
is go through -- this whole book is about
how to ask

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.269
those questions, and it's basically about
if you want to

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.481
run an organization, you want to be a leader,
you want

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:14.470
to be a project manager, you want to manage
your life,

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.019
here's your road map for doing it, and it's
in the form

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.280
of questions with stories about how to do
it. Okay? So

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.590
that's what I'm going to talk about. And it's
going to

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.000
be -- and you may thing that Harvard Business
School is

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.819
a very sophisticated place. You're going to
be sorely

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.760
disappointed. Your going to basically see,
at least with

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.269
me. Maybe not with them. But you're going
to see that

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.961
the basic questions you need to ask, I think,
to be an

00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:43.870
outstanding leader, are brutally simple. And
I mean

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.380
really simple. That does not mean they're
easy to do.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.129
They're not easy to do. All right. And by
the way,

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.940
where did these pictures come from? I literally
went on

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.239
Google, [audience chuckles] and for every
title I picked a picture that

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.530
resonated with me and boom, put it in there.
So if you

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.430
don't like them, you can't blame the graphics
firm. All

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.100
right. Here's -- here's the first point. This
is true

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.600
for everybody and most of us, including me,
don't think

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.659
about this. If you -- as a leader, the first
thing I

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.879
would argue you need to think about and for
each of you

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:25.430
what is your aspiration? What is your vision?
What is

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.699
it you want to accomplish? Now, let me just
ask you,

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.780
how many here in this room have a vision for
themselves,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.439
for their business, for the project they're
working on?

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:42.259
Okay. That's a -- that's great. A lot of people
don't

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.159
think about what their vision is. And let
me just say

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.999
to you, there's two things I talk to leaders
about.

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:51.219
Number one, can you write down on a piece
of paper your

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.669
aspiration? So all of you who raised your
hand -- I'm

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:56.729
not going to call on you, don't worry -- but
can you

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:06.509
write it down clearly? Okay. Number two, can
your

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.899
people, the people that you're working with,
can they

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:13.129
write it down? If I gave them a quiz, could
they write

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.030
down the same vision that you just wrote down?
Here's

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.669
why this is important. First of all, I would
argue that

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.300
every successful business I've ever seen -- or
non-profit -- a lot of people think that successful

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.339
businesses are because people are so shrewd,
that

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:36.180
they're focused on how to make money, they're
commercially smart. Not really. They ultimately

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.939
need
to do those things, but those come way down

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:42.249
the list.
Successful, sustainable businesses that I've

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:47.529
seen start
with a vision about how to serve a client,

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:49.931
or make a
positive impact on the world. And they're

00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:54.039
based on a
clear distinctive competence. Now, I don't

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.360
need to tell
you this because at Google [chuckles] you

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.729
know this already. You
focus on this every day. But a lot of business

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.189
leaders
don't, and a key to a successful project,

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:08.439
leader, or
leader at all, is to stay with that vision,

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:11.389
or update it
if you need to update it, but everything you

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.650
do needs to
revolve around that, and the people you're

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.683
working with
need to know what it is. Because it is very

00:06:18.683 --> 00:06:23.149
hard to
mobilize people if they don't know your aspiration.

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:26.580
So
to me the first thing you've got to do as

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.930
a leader is
can you write it down clearly? Do you articulate

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.770
it to
the people you're working with? You may not

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.469
have people
working for you. You may not have people reporting

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:38.110
to
you. The people working on your team, the

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.659
people across
departments, do you tell them what the vision

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:45.150
is so
you're on the same page, and could they repeat

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.449
it back?
Now, I could argue -- I'll take an example.

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.879
Barack Obama
was elected President of the United States,

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.099
in my opinion,
in 2008 because he articulated a very clear

00:06:57.099 --> 00:07:01.120
vision for
where he wanted to take the country. And to

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.339
me that
vision was not changed. That was mechanic.

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:08.629
It was
unification. We're going to find a new way

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:11.300
to do
things; we're all going to come together.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.830
Some of you
are too young, but you remember the speech

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.209
that he gave
at the 2004 convention: "There's not a black

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:17.999
American;
not a white American; not a rich American...

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:21.139
there's
just the United States of America." Visionary

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:25.160
candidate. Very clear on what he wanted to
do. Very

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.369
clear aspiration. You should ask yourself
-- people ask

00:07:28.369 --> 00:07:32.509
gee, a lot of people accuse Obama today of
not being a

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:36.879
strong leader. Why? And it takes a little
thought, but

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:40.750
for me, I think people are not clear on what
his vision

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.530
is for lots of reasons, but it shows you how
important

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.099
it is if you're a project leader, if you're
the head of

00:07:48.099 --> 00:07:50.469
the household, or if you're the President
of the United

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:54.229
States, it starts with a clear vision. Okay?
So that's

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:58.569
number one. By the way, these are questions.
So the

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:01.529
reason I write these questions, if you're
struggling or

00:08:01.529 --> 00:08:04.879
you can't seem to mobilize your people, or
your unit

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:07.910
isn't doing well and you're wondering why,
what this is

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.460
intended to be is keep five or six questions
on your

00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.510
wall. Maybe I'm not clear enough on the vision.
Maybe

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:16.300
the world has changed and I haven't changed
the vision.

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.529
Maybe I have a vision; I'm not repeating it
enough and

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:21.930
my people aren't clear. Maybe I'd better repeat
it at

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.899
the next meeting and that's the problem. So
this is

00:08:25.899 --> 00:08:29.989
like a pilot on a plane checklist of what
might be wrong

00:08:29.989 --> 00:08:32.899
when they're having engine trouble. This is
number one

00:08:32.899 --> 00:08:35.629
question. This is the cornerstone for me of
everything

00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:38.650
you do. I teach at Harvard Business School.
I want to

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.509
be the best professor in the world. Okay?
I do. It's

00:08:42.509 --> 00:08:46.300
pathetic, but I do. [laughter] That is my
dream. It really is.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.269
And everything I do is to try to -- we'll
see if I get

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:52.470
there, but that doesn't matter. At he's I
know what I'm

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:56.310
trying to do and it has a powerful impact
on everything

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:01.301
that I do. Okay. Now, once you have a vision,
there's

00:09:01.301 --> 00:09:04.959
one other thing that's got to go with it,
and that is

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:09.790
you have to pick three -- in my opinion three
to five

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:14.030
key tasks -- I call them priorities here,
but what I

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.940
really mean, what are the most important things
you must

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:23.120
do superbly well to achieve that vision? And
same

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.490
question: Can you write them down? How many
think you

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:33.010
could write down the top three? Okay. Interesting.
Not as many. So you're clear on the vision,

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:37.060
but not as
clear on the priorities. And I would argue

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.329
you've got
to be clear on the priorities for one big

00:09:40.329 --> 00:09:45.279
reason, which
I'm about to get to. How do you spend your

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:49.231
time? How
many of you are working 70 hours a week; stressed

00:09:49.231 --> 00:09:52.740
out
because you're working 70 hours a week? No?

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.079
[chuckles] Sixty?
All the ones that are -- okay. Sixty. Fine.

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:59.391
Fifty.
Whatever. But you're juggling a lot. Here's

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:03.170
the point.
When people are struggling on how to spend

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.471
their time or
I have a business leader or anyone come to

00:10:06.471 --> 00:10:08.810
me and say
"Oh, my God, I'm just juggling so many things

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.010
I don't
know what to do. How do you do it? I'm just

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:11.900
trying to
squeeze these things in." And by the way,

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:13.820
I'll say
them, "Well, what's your vision for the business?"

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.500
And
they say, "Oh, Rob, I don't think about it.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:18.829
I'm just
too busy." Okay. Well can you tell me your

00:10:18.829 --> 00:10:21.920
three to
five top priorities? "Oh, Rob. The chaos of

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.880
this
business I can't even think about it." And

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.971
I go oy. I
say to them -- I go listen, the -- this is

00:10:27.971 --> 00:10:31.730
part of your
problem. Clear vision and then you've got

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:35.579
to write down
three to five priorities. Now, some of you

00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:39.170
may say,
"Rob, you couldn't understand. We've got ten

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.759
or fifteen
priorities." I've had people say that to me

00:10:42.759 --> 00:10:46.740
and I would
say politely back, ten to fifteen priorities

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.910
is the same
as zero. Zero. That's zero. Okay? And why

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:56.000
do I say
that? It's not that I don't have a to-do list

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.529
of ten or
fifteen things, but a human being, no matter

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:04.220
how talented, at
any one point, it's hard to really bore in

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.879
on three, or
four, or five. And it's critical. The most

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:13.569
important
asset you have is your time. A lot of people

00:11:13.569 --> 00:11:17.509
think it's
money, it's hard assets, it's all this other

00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:21.360
stuff. I
believe strongly the most important asset

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.110
all of you
have as leaders is your time. Yet many of

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:30.649
us spend our
time in a very sloppy way. And one little

00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:34.579
rule I give
for people, pretend that this time was a big

00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:39.939
sum of money, a lot of money.
Whatever's a lot of money to you. Pretend

00:11:39.939 --> 00:11:41.939
that you were
going to think about how to spend it. I will

00:11:41.939 --> 00:11:44.579
bet you
just looking at this group you don't just

00:11:44.579 --> 00:11:49.600
oh, here let's
spend X-thousand here, X-thousand there. Who

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.649
does that?
Nobody does it. You really think -- some of

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:56.640
you really
think hard before you spend any of it. I would

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:59.819
argue
the irony is, if you do that with your money,

00:11:59.819 --> 00:12:02.490
this is
more valuable I would argue even than your

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:06.249
money, or
it's the same thing. Why don't you do it the

00:12:06.249 --> 00:12:08.759
same way?
And there's only one way that I know how.

00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:12.510
You've got to
decide in advance what your top priorities

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:17.959
are, and then
you've got to match your time with those priorities.

00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:20.930
When I see a business leader, or a non-profit
leader, or

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:24.240
a project manager, you name it, who's having
trouble,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:30.189
invariably, lack of a clear vision or they've
got it but

00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:33.759
do not think about matching their time with
their top

00:12:33.759 --> 00:12:37.230
priorities. Why? A, they just don't think
about it; B,

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.420
they haven't written down their top three
to five

00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.379
priorities. But I can tell you if you don't
know your

00:12:42.379 --> 00:12:45.639
top three to five priorities, I am pretty
certain you

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:50.950
are poorly using your time because it takes
enormous

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.750
effort. If people are asking you to do things
all the

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.899
time, like they were with me -- they still
are. Unless

00:12:56.899 --> 00:12:58.750
you know what you're trying to do, you've
got to know

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:00.999
who to say no to. You've got to learn how
to say no.

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:04.199
The question is, who do you say no to? Unless
you've

00:13:04.199 --> 00:13:10.390
decided in advance, it's hard to say no to
people. How

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:15.050
many of you actually -- I won't even ask.
I've got an

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.360
idea. If you asked me how I spent my time
this last

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.509
week, I would not have the slightest idea.
How many of

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:25.430
you think you know? And how many of you don't
know?

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.399
All right. How many of you got like a shoulder
problem

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.399
or something?
[Laughing]

00:13:29.399 --> 00:13:33.240
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: All right. Okay. We'll leave
you alone on that. You're eating lunch. But

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.620
let me
tell you something. The other advice I'd give

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:38.779
you if
you're like me, go for a week and track how

00:13:38.779 --> 00:13:42.689
you spend
your time. It's annoying to do, but do it

00:13:42.689 --> 00:13:46.329
anyhow.
Track within chunks how you spend your time,

00:13:46.329 --> 00:13:49.309
and then
write it down at the end of the week. Match

00:13:49.309 --> 00:13:53.790
those
chunks with those top priorities and see how

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:57.200
far off you
are. Now, the one other thing if it helps

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.069
-- I talk
about this in the book, and this is simple

00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:03.529
stuff. One
of the things I've done for CEOs of large

00:14:03.529 --> 00:14:07.160
organizations
all the way to, you know, just independent

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:12.189
project
managers is ask them to break their tasks,

00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:14.149
the things
they're spending time on, into ones, twos,

00:14:14.149 --> 00:14:17.199
and threes.
Ones are things you've got to do. And I'm

00:14:17.199 --> 00:14:20.189
going to talk
about that in a moment. For example, I believe

00:14:20.189 --> 00:14:22.740
you've
got to decide on your vision of priorities.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.339
If you're
not making time for that, you've got to do

00:14:25.339 --> 00:14:28.140
that. That's
a one. Then there's twos and threes. Twos

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.999
are things
yeah, maybe, maybe not; and threes are things

00:14:31.999 --> 00:14:35.360
you
absolutely should not be doing. There's no

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.250
--
there's -- I've talked to CEOs who are still

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:42.410
approving
expenses down to blank-thousand dollars. Why?

00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:45.300
Well,
it's just what we've always done. How many

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:49.279
hours a week
does it take? Fifteen. You know. And yet they

00:14:49.279 --> 00:14:51.629
don't
have time to do the very basic things we need

00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:54.279
them to
do -- you need them to do. So I just say to

00:14:54.279 --> 00:14:57.389
you, track
it for a week, break it into one, twos, and

00:14:57.389 --> 00:15:00.000
threes,
match it with your priorities, and see what

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.579
the match or
mismatch is. To me, if you do nothing beyond

00:15:04.579 --> 00:15:07.139
sitting
here for lunch today, if you can write down

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:09.340
your vision,
your top priorities, and you work on matching

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.149
your time,
there's a bunch of other things that we're

00:15:12.149 --> 00:15:17.149
going to talk
about but that I've seen. That alone can make

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:22.990
somebody
who's good a lot better immediately. As simple

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:31.560
as it
is. All right. Okay. Now once -- by the way,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:33.459
my
definition of leadership, just for what it's

00:15:33.459 --> 00:15:36.680
worth given
I asked if you wanted -- who all -- I talk

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.890
about
leadership, I teach leadership. My definition

00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:43.129
of
leadership for purposes of this speech, and

00:15:43.129 --> 00:15:46.819
this book,
and everything I do, all leadership is to

00:15:46.819 --> 00:15:54.190
me is working
on deciding what you believe, which a lot

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.829
of times is
not an easy thing to do. Sometimes you're

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:58.360
just not
sure. You have a strong point of view. Getting

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:02.180
conviction, making the effort to get conviction
on what

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:07.660
you believe, and then having the courage to
act on it.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.999
That's leadership. And by that definition,
you don't

00:16:11.999 --> 00:16:16.529
need to manage anybody to be a leader. You
could be a

00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:20.589
single head of household, you could be a double
head of

00:16:20.589 --> 00:16:23.759
household, you could be in the service, you
could be a

00:16:23.759 --> 00:16:26.510
policeman or woman, you could be a project
manager or

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.980
professional working at Google. There are
many leaders

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:32.589
in this room. There's millions leaders in
this country.

00:16:32.589 --> 00:16:34.699
People ask where all the leaders are. There's
lots of

00:16:34.699 --> 00:16:38.149
them. Here's the problem: Just because you
manage

00:16:38.149 --> 00:16:41.439
thousands of people, which I did in my career,
also does

00:16:41.439 --> 00:16:46.819
not mean you're a leader because you can manage
thousands of people and not make the effort

00:16:46.819 --> 00:16:51.569
to truly
decide what you believe or have the courage

00:16:51.569 --> 00:16:56.420
to act on
it. So there are people that are in positions

00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:58.980
of power
that are not acting like leaders, and there's

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.930
many
people who have no position of power but do

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:06.090
exert
leadership. And so everything that I talk

00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:09.390
about today
is how do you do it. And I would argue a great

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:12.320
company
is one where the leaders do this, but they

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.930
create an
environment in the whole organization where

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:19.120
people are
not afraid to speak up and act like leaders,

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.579
express --
decide what they believe and act on it. And

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.179
I know
that -- I believe as an outsider that strikes

00:17:25.179 --> 00:17:28.240
me as one
of the critical success factors to Google

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.570
and why this
company has done so well. All right. All these

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:34.040
things
are intended to make you more effective at

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.539
that. So
vision, priorities, how you're spending your

00:17:37.539 --> 00:17:40.790
time.
Okay. Now, once you've got those three, now

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.669
you're
ready to coach people and you're ready to

00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:48.960
get coaching.
How many of you have a coach? How many of

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:56.530
you are a
coach? All right. All right. So let me just

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.330
comment
on this. First of all, to me, coaching when

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:02.410
I say
coaching I'm just talking about people you

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:08.990
work with, do
you identify one or two skill-related things

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:12.409
that they
need to do better and confront them with it

00:18:12.409 --> 00:18:14.840
and discuss
it with them, and then hopefully give them

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.170
one or two
ways to improve? That, to me, is coaching.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:21.220
A lot of
people interchange coaching and mentoring.

00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.900
They're not
the same to me. Mentoring is I tell someone

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:28.000
a story or
they tell me a story and I give them advice

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.330
based on the
story. But I probably don't observe them.

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:36.140
Feedback,
real coaching, requires observation because

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:38.929
in order to
know what skills you need to improve on, I've

00:18:38.929 --> 00:18:41.710
got to
watch you, or I need to interview about ten

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:46.399
people who
do watch you. Okay? So most people are not

00:18:46.399 --> 00:18:49.500
great
coaches because of this or don't do a great

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:54.570
job coaching
peers on a project team because they don't

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:57.809
do this.
Takes a lot of preparation, and the year-end

00:18:57.809 --> 00:19:00.590
review is
not the time to coach. How many of you have

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:06.380
a year-end
review? How many of you give a year-end review?

00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:10.320
Wow.
Okay. How many of you wait until the year-end

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.070
review to
give coaching? Now everybody's afraid to raise

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.490
their
hand, of course. Let me comment why. The year-end

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:20.770
review, in my opinion, that's the verdict.
The jury has

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:23.399
come in, it's the very -- the reason I say
it's the

00:19:23.399 --> 00:19:28.260
verdict, it's too late to do anything to affect
your

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.110
compensation or promotion. People are not
really in the

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.500
mood. Think about yourself. Are you really
in the mood

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.010
to get coaching in your year-end review especially
if

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:40.350
you think there's nothing you can do about
it to affect

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:44.279
your promotion or your comp? And so what I
say is,

00:19:44.279 --> 00:19:48.399
people should work on coaching during the
year, at least

00:19:48.399 --> 00:19:52.760
three to six months in advance of the year-end
review.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:57.910
All right? Now, more importantly for this
group, I

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:01.690
would argue it's -- it's 100 percent your
job to coach

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:05.940
people who report to you, but I would argue
for people

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:10.140
that report to you, or for all of you, it
is 100 percent

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:14.641
your job to get coaching. 100 percent your
job. And

00:20:14.641 --> 00:20:17.140
most groups I go into when I ask who has a
coach, how

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.160
many people raised their hand? Who says they
have a

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:23.730
coach? Okay. It's a shockingly low number
of hands,

00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:26.519
especially given in what I would argue is
a

00:20:26.519 --> 00:20:29.480
leadership-oriented organization, coaching
is about as

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.370
important a thing as you can possibly do.
Why? Because

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.590
you've got vision, priorities, how you spend
your time,

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.029
and then the whole thing -- reason you coach
is to try

00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:42.110
to get aligned -- align people and the organization
with

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:47.050
what you're trying to do. I would say to all
of you, if

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:51.419
you don't have a coach, go get one here. And
the way to

00:20:51.419 --> 00:20:56.039
go get one unfortunately is to ask people
to give you

00:20:56.039 --> 00:20:59.090
advice on what they think are one or two things
you need

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:02.850
to improve on. You actually need to go ask.
People

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:05.410
will not volunteer it. Why? Because they would
prefer

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:09.440
not to offend you, or they don't know if you
even want

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.250
to hear it. You may send off a vibe even though
you

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:16.779
want coaching that it's unwelcome to give
you advice.

00:21:16.779 --> 00:21:20.531
And I would argue, you've got to ask. Okay?
And I

00:21:20.531 --> 00:21:25.260
think if you ask people for advice, A, they
may be

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.169
flattered; and B, they may need to go do homework
for

00:21:28.169 --> 00:21:29.880
two or three weeks before they can give you
something

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.150
sensible, but I would argue you should take
ownership.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:40.511
I'd urge you to take ownership of getting
coaching. How

00:21:40.511 --> 00:21:47.670
many of you are up for that? All right. So
then can I

00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:50.460
ask a dumb question? What's stopping you from
doing it

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.001
other than no one's suggested it? What stops
you?

00:21:54.001 --> 00:21:55.001
Anyone want to volunteer? What's stopping
you other

00:21:55.001 --> 00:21:56.360
than no one's suggested it? What stops you
from going

00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:09.899
and getting it? Anyone want to volunteer?
What stops

00:22:09.899 --> 00:22:10.899
you from going and getting it?
[male audience member responds]

00:22:10.899 --> 00:22:12.559
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Right. And so it's an awkward
conversation. All right. I agree with that.

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:16.029
So here's
my advice on how to to this. And you got to

00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:18.950
get in the
habit of doing it, and sometimes you have

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:22.710
to train
people and let them know you want coaching.

00:22:22.710 --> 00:22:25.000
First you
have to do it one on one. You can't do it

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.670
in a group.
In other words, you can't ask somebody to

00:22:27.670 --> 00:22:30.150
give you
advice in front of other people because what

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.970
they're
really thinking they may not want to say in

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.970
front of
other people. Appropriate. Number two, you

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:41.170
need to be
clear with them that you're sincere and that

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:43.750
you want
the advice. And then you need to make sure

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.240
to thank
them for what they do. My experience is when

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:51.179
I started
doing that in my career, had to get people

00:22:51.179 --> 00:22:54.640
going to give
me advice, and they knew when I -- because

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.860
I wanted it
they would watch me a little more carefully,

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:00.789
and often
they would come in and warn me, without me

00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:04.179
asking, about
some area I screwed up in, which used to happen

00:23:04.179 --> 00:23:09.399
frequently. Now, as you get more senior, I
-- I urge

00:23:09.399 --> 00:23:15.360
people to go get junior coaches. So you work
at Google

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.519
now? [female audience member responds] Okay.
Good. Teak Fellowship. Sorry. I'm the

00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:24.320
Chairman of the Board. Anyhow, that's another
story. [laughter]

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.910
But non-profit effort we have in New York
City. Okay.

00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:34.510
So you have to train people to do this. But
it will

00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:38.200
make you dramatically more effective and I
would argue

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.870
for the rest of your career, no matter how
senior you

00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:45.070
get, you've got to get in the habit of asking
either

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.909
senior people for coaching, but as you get
more senior,

00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:50.110
you've got to ask your subordinates for coaching.
Let

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.659
me ask one more question. How many of you
people that

00:23:52.659 --> 00:24:00.049
are senior to you ask you for advice and coaching?
Okay. Good. And by the way, for those who

00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:02.590
got asked,
what do you think of them? Think they're weaklings

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:05.809
or
what's your reaction? How does it make you

00:24:05.809 --> 00:24:07.190
feel about
them?

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.940
&gt;&gt;Male #1:I like them that much better.
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: You like them that much better.

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.419
And that's typical, by the way. It also -- it
makes

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:17.940
them better. So my point is, if you want to
be a

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:22.091
leader, leadership is about getting advice.
Now, people

00:24:22.091 --> 00:24:24.360
don't always think that, or that's not the
first thing

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.149
that comes to mind when I talk about leader.
But the

00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:31.549
great leaders I can tell you seek advice and
then they

00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:34.850
listen to the advice, and they're open to
learning and

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.059
acting on it. And I argue, if you want to
be a leader,

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:42.340
you've got to do that. Yes, sir?
&gt;&gt;Male #2: [inaudible]

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:49.399
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: It's -- so the question is,
written or one on one? My own --. Listen,

00:24:49.399 --> 00:24:54.399
if it's easier for somebody to
give you advice well into the year in handwriting,

00:24:54.399 --> 00:24:58.440
fine,
so that maybe it's safer. If they can do it

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:01.200
in person,
I'll tell you why it's great in person, because

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.889
you're
going to have two or three follow-up questions.

00:25:03.889 --> 00:25:06.889
So
"Gee, Rob, you need to get better at blank,"

00:25:06.889 --> 00:25:09.500
or "I don't
like the way you gave that speech." I'll say,

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.750
"Should I
have done this? Should I have done that?"

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.480
You'll
always have follow-up questions and it's a

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.639
conversation.
Tell me how I would do it, and then I try

00:25:16.639 --> 00:25:21.210
it. But I
would urge you to do this and if senior people

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:24.659
are
asking you for advice, smart. That's a sign,

00:25:24.659 --> 00:25:29.100
I would
argue, of an outstanding leader. All right.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.380
Now, you
guys don't need to worry about this, do you?

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:34.880
Okay. So
I'm going to skip this for today, but let

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.320
me comment
about the people who are much more senior

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:42.010
in this
company, the few that I know. This is the

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.340
-- who do I
ask for advice from if I'm a senior person?

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.200
I ask for
people who are up and coming. And the truth

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.990
is, every
company has a succession plan. I am certain

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:56.570
this one
does. But the only advice I give to senior

00:25:56.570 --> 00:26:00.110
people is,
use it. Now, you will get to a stage in your

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.909
career in
the not-too-distant future where you need

00:26:02.909 --> 00:26:04.789
to start
thinking in everything you do, who's going

00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:07.559
to take your
place? Some of you are probably already doing

00:26:07.559 --> 00:26:10.400
that. I
was trained in my career it's something I

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.899
started doing
it after two or three years at the firm. And

00:26:15.899 --> 00:26:18.570
it's a
great discipline to have because it caused

00:26:18.570 --> 00:26:23.659
me to be a
better coach. All right. Let me go another

00:26:23.659 --> 00:26:26.890
thing. How
many of you think you're a bottleneck? How

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:30.330
many of you
know what a bottleneck is, [laughter] other

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:34.559
than the picture I
pulled off the web? Which I kind of like,

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:39.590
actually.
He's what a bottleneck is. Bottleneck is sort

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.200
of things
are flowing smoothly -- you guys know all

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:46.320
about
bottlenecks [chuckles] -- and because of your

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.019
style, you slow
things down. Now, sometimes it's quite appropriate

00:26:50.019 --> 00:26:53.320
to
be a bottleneck. Check with me before you

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.490
make a
certain level of decision. I think sometimes

00:26:57.490 --> 00:27:00.220
if it's
important enough, perfect. You delegate to

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.309
people and
you say check back with me before you do blank.

00:27:03.309 --> 00:27:05.910
The
problem is, there are two or three other types

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:07.899
of
bottlenecks. And by the way, I've never met

00:27:07.899 --> 00:27:10.889
anybody
who's a bottleneck who thinks they're a bottleneck.

00:27:10.889 --> 00:27:13.809
No
one thinks they're a bottleneck because your

00:27:13.809 --> 00:27:17.279
input is so
valuable. [audience chuckles] It just has

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:23.020
to make things better. We just
know that. Okay. So here's an example. One,

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:27.380
you don't
articulate a vision with priorities and the

00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:32.210
people on
your team are not clear for the project, or

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:35.080
the
department, or the unit. They're not clear

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.639
on what the
vision or priorities are. I would say if you

00:27:37.639 --> 00:27:40.690
have not
done that, I assure you, you are a bottleneck.

00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:44.970
And what
do I mean? Bottleneck impedes others from

00:27:44.970 --> 00:27:47.890
figuring out
what they believe and acting on it; impedes

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:51.230
other people
from being leaders. And if you're freezing

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:52.889
people, and
they're waiting around, and they don't know

00:27:52.889 --> 00:27:56.320
what to do
because you're not clear on the vision and

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.830
priorities
for a project, it slows everybody down or

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:03.480
it sort of
makes them wait for you to explain what you

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.059
want done
next. And so that's one kind of bottleneck.

00:28:07.059 --> 00:28:10.080
Other kind
of bottleneck is you do do that, and you delegate

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.429
to
people, and then you second guess after they

00:28:13.429 --> 00:28:17.389
make the
decision. And you so terrorize them that they

00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:18.970
think
they're never going to make another decision

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:21.930
again
unless they check with you first. Another

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.419
one is, you
delegate to them and agree that so-and-so's

00:28:24.419 --> 00:28:26.990
going to do
something, but then you get involved and do

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:33.330
it anyhow.
Okay. You ever see that one around here? Okay.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.909
And all those
things slow things down. The only thing I

00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:39.120
say to
leaders, are you a bottleneck and I think,

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:42.210
by the way,
the most important one is over-communicating

00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:44.600
your vision
and priorities to everybody's clear on what

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:48.600
they're
supposed to do, and being a coach. By the

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.470
way, there
are a lot of people that are bottlenecks because

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:53.830
they
don't know what their peers or people they're

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.110
working
with think of them, but they get a bad vibe

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.080
that they
don't think too highly, and they're afraid

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.269
to act
because of it. You ever see that? This is

00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:07.029
why I would
far prefer being blunt and direct and giving

00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:08.830
feedback,
and then people know if you've got something

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:12.269
to say,
you're saying it. As opposed to talking behind

00:29:12.269 --> 00:29:13.799
their
back or thinking something that you're going

00:29:13.799 --> 00:29:16.519
to write in
your year-end review that you don't know about.

00:29:16.519 --> 00:29:20.650
Okay?
If that makes sense. You know, a lot of people

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:24.590
think
being a leader is about -- and it is about

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:28.490
collaboration
and harmony, but sometimes it's also about

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:32.149
having enough
commitment to one another, and to the company,

00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:35.870
and to
the organization to be confrontational sometimes,

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:38.539
and
maybe even make a few waves. I'll talk about

00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:41.530
that in a
minute. Coaching is a little risky in that

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:47.570
way. All
right. Now, these next two things are something

00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:51.909
you
need to do and I know this company does frequently,

00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:54.430
and
I call it evaluation. Very simple. Do you

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.850
look at what
you're working on with a clean sheet of paper?

00:29:57.850 --> 00:29:59.600
Do you
look at your career with a clean sheet of

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.760
paper? Do you
look at your project, your department, whatever

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.110
your
doing, with a clean sheet of paper; given

00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:09.690
the world is
constantly changing, you're changing, you're

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:14.120
learning,
your team is changing, customers are changing,

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:19.250
competitors are taking actions all the time.
Successful

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:24.200
enterprises like this one are constantly looking
at if

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:27.880
we were starting from scratch, is this how
we'd do it?

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.529
This is a very difficult thing emotionally
to do,

00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:32.669
especially if you get in the habit of doing
things a

00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:37.880
certain way. And here's really what you're
asking: Is

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.710
the culture, the people we have here, the
way we're

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.720
organized, the way we pay, way we promote,
all that, the

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.289
way you're approaching the project if you're
a project

00:30:47.289 --> 00:30:52.029
manager, is it still consistent with achieving
the

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:57.860
vision? Or is it not? And what happens, history
of

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:00.500
business, the reason that many successful
businesses

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.580
from 30 years ago and 50 years ago you've
never even

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:07.840
heard of? They go away? Is that they do not
continually do this. Because this is hard.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.600
It's extremely
hard. And the reason it's hard is it's very

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:15.370
hard for
people to get out of habits. And what leaders

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:19.019
do in a
constructive way is jar people and give them

00:31:19.019 --> 00:31:22.629
opportunities to say let's look at this with
a clean

00:31:22.629 --> 00:31:26.960
sheet of paper. Coaching, I would argue, does
this. If

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.679
you're getting coaching all the time, and
you're asking

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:32.240
for what you need to do better, it's a way
for you to

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:35.169
jar yourself and say let me look at what I'm
doing with

00:31:35.169 --> 00:31:37.919
a clean sheet of paper. Maybe I'm not going
about this

00:31:37.919 --> 00:31:42.019
the right way. And all I'm saying to you is,
ask the

00:31:42.019 --> 00:31:44.840
question. I don't know the answer, but I encourage
you

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:49.590
the ask the question. Yes?
&gt;&gt;Male #2: [inaudible]

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:57.220
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Did
you hear the question? The question is, underlying

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:02.580
a
lot of this is trust. Right? Correct? Particularly

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.259
if
you're speaking up, if you're asking for advice,

00:32:05.259 --> 00:32:10.360
if
you're making a few waves. And I would argue

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:13.270
that
fundamentally for each of us and each of you

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:16.529
when you
walk into this building, you fundamentally

00:32:16.529 --> 00:32:20.960
every day
make a judgment. Do I feel comfortable here?

00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:25.039
Can I be
myself? Do I trust the organization enough

00:32:25.039 --> 00:32:28.630
to speak up
if I have something to say? Understand I got

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.760
to use
good judgment. If I'm talking, I've got to

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.360
pick my
spots, but do I have enough trust in the organization?

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.460
I would argue even with that -- how many of
you have

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.500
been in a meeting, by the way, where you're
nodding to

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:48.039
something someone senior person said, and
you don't

00:32:48.039 --> 00:32:50.549
understand what they're talking about? Or
worse you do

00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:52.909
understand and you totally disagree? Any of
you ever

00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:57.509
done that? I've done it. So the question is,
why?

00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:59.530
It's because there's -- even if you do trust,
there's a

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.240
little bit of I don't want to look stupid.
So there's

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.791
trust, do I trust that I will be treated fairly;
the

00:33:05.791 --> 00:33:10.340
other part is, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'll
look like an

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:12.399
idiot. Maybe I'm not good enough. Gee, these
people

00:33:12.399 --> 00:33:15.140
seem so smart. Maybe I'm not as smart as they
are. So

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.960
that's also an element of it. You have to
be confident

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.519
about it. To do what I'm saying, you have
to be

00:33:20.519 --> 00:33:22.570
confident enough in yourself that you're going
to kind

00:33:22.570 --> 00:33:25.269
of make the leap and realize yeah, occasionally
I'm

00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:28.450
going to be wrong, and when I'm wrong say
I'm sorry, I

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.820
was wrong.Does that make sense? But you're
right.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.000
There's an emotional part of this that makes
it hard for

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.820
people to make the leap sometimes, and you
want to work

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.509
at a place that encourages you to make the
leap. All

00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:45.821
right. Now, this is a big subject I talk about,
which

00:33:45.821 --> 00:33:48.759
is being a role model. And the reason I talk
about it

00:33:48.759 --> 00:33:51.820
is the fact of the matter is, you can articulate
a

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:55.320
vision, priorities, you match your time with
your

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.610
priorities, you're a good coach, you get coaching,
you

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:01.740
do all the things I talked about, and unfortunately,
for

00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:07.200
many people, including you, there's about
1 percent of

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.930
the time or half a percent of the time that
you throw it

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:12.870
all out the window and undermine all your
efforts. And

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.740
when is that for many people? It's when you're
stressed

00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:20.580
out or when you're under enormous pressure.
And the

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:23.050
tricky part about this and it's hard to coach
people on

00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:26.160
this is for each -- if there's a hundred people
in this

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:29.240
room--, what stresses each of you out is different
for

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:32.480
each one of you. I can tell you what stresses
me out,

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:35.320
what freaks me out. By the way, for me it
was when

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.360
people leave -- at my job when people leave
I

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.610
would go nuts. And so everybody who worked
with me knew

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:46.780
I was going to go nuts, and I had to learn
to calm

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:50.560
myself down a little bit. But I used to have
a joke

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.080
with all the department heads that reported
to me and I

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.180
used to say to them, "All I'm asking is for
you to know

00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.490
what your people are thinking before they
think it."

00:34:59.490 --> 00:35:03.840
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: That's it. Because I want to

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.800
keep this team together. I want to build this
team.

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:11.580
Now, the fact of the matter is, though, for
all of you

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:14.590
there may be things that really -- that make
you at your

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.800
worst. And I'm not asking you to throw them
out here,

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:23.230
but I would encourage you to think of two
situations.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:26.950
Think of -- think of when you're at your best.
When did

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:31.010
you shine? You were great. Okay? Write it
down --

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.650
write that down when you get a chance. What
were you

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:38.460
doing? Okay? What were you doing? What kinds
of tasks

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.650
were you doing? What kind of environment were
you in?

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.770
The flip side of that is, when were you at
your worst

00:35:44.770 --> 00:35:47.710
when you were embarrassed by what you did?
Maybe you

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:51.081
made a mistake and you acted like it wasn't
you. Maybe

00:35:51.081 --> 00:35:56.000
you made a mistake and you quietly blamed
somebody else.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.910
Maybe something went wrong and you just didn't
know what

00:35:58.910 --> 00:36:03.020
to do, and you're not happy with what you
did. Now, I

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:07.131
would argue as a leader it happens to all
of us. You've

00:36:07.131 --> 00:36:11.330
got to manage those periods. The first way
of doing it,

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:12.750
understand what stresses you out. You have
to

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:16.400
understand yourself. Most important person
you manage

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:21.130
ultimately [chuckles] we talk about as a leader
is you. You've got

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:25.250
to understand yourself. Your strengths, your
weaknesses, your passions, when you're at

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:29.100
your best, but
in particular if you're going to be a role

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:32.430
model -- when
I say be a role model, it's not enough to

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:36.160
be a role
model 98 percent of the time or 99. Where

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.280
people really
watch what you do as a role model is the 1

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.920
percent of
the time when it's hard to be a role model.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.590
Maybe
somebody you work with on your team made a

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:47.910
mistake and
you stood up and took responsible with them

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:50.610
and didn't
blame them. That's not so easy. That takes

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:54.140
some trust;
that takes guts. But I'll tell you, if you've

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:56.381
got
people working with you, that say, "I'd like

00:36:56.381 --> 00:37:01.320
to work
with him or her again." I mean, that's fabulous.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.200
It
really matters and leaders need to think about

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.490
it. And
I don't think it's too late or too early for

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:14.030
each of you
to think about that. What stresses you out?

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:16.110
When have
you done things that you were not pleased

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:21.100
with at all?
Why? So when those situations come up, it

00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:23.341
helps to
think about it. This is the same reason, by

00:37:23.341 --> 00:37:26.640
the way, I
ask people to think about their values, and

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.070
particularly
their boundaries ahead of time. Keep a little

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:33.040
journal.
Let me just finish. And think about it. I

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:37.000
will not
lie, cheat, steal. Think about it. All of

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.700
us get in
situations that are very persuasive. Either

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:44.980
a client, or a
boss, or a peer tries to push us to do something

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:49.090
that we
regret, and what helps inoculate you from

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:51.860
that is to
think about it in advance and when you see

00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.850
those
situations, call time out. Slow down. Get

00:37:55.850 --> 00:38:00.060
advice.
Talk to others. Elevate it. Okay? This is

00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:04.960
what I mean
by being a role model. Yes?

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:19.080
&gt;&gt; Male #3: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Well, and here's the -- here's

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:22.210
the context that I'm talking about. So yes,
if a job is

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:26.241
not a good fit for you, fine. But you see,
as you're

00:38:26.241 --> 00:38:30.051
a -- in a leader, you don't have the option,
as they

00:38:30.051 --> 00:38:33.080
used to say, beam me up. You know, beam up.
You have

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:36.250
to manage through it. All of us as leaders
are involved

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.260
in situation where we're not -- this isn't
a great fit

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:42.590
for us. The trick is not how to get out of
it; the

00:38:42.590 --> 00:38:45.310
trick is how to manage through it because
eventually you

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:48.151
won't be able to extricate yourself from it.
You

00:38:48.151 --> 00:38:51.350
actually have to manage through it. Now, sometimes
that

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:54.700
means by building a team with complementary
skills but

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:59.240
in particular, this is really a character
issue for me

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.280
more than a skill issue. So I know there are
going to

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.790
be things I'm not good at. I already know
that. I'm

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:08.340
going to screw up. Can I admit that I made
a mistake?

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:11.110
That's what I'm talking about. Can I admit
that I don't

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:14.190
know it? I don't know. I'm not good at this.
Can I

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:18.770
admit it? Can I say it? Think of senior people
that

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:20.950
you work with that do that. What do you think
of them?

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:24.090
I think your first reaction is "Wow, this
person's

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:29.350
really good." I think it's impressive. Whereas
we tend

00:39:29.350 --> 00:39:30.901
to think when we admit these things, I'm going
to look

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:33.860
like a weakling or I'm going to look like
I'm not very

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.211
good. And what I'm trying to say to people
is, our

00:39:37.211 --> 00:39:40.160
conventional stereotypes of leaders, I don't
think

00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:43.320
they're right. I think the truth is -- that's
with the

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:47.020
whole premise of this book. When I say it's
more important

00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.800
to ask the right question, I don't think that's
our

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:52.740
stereotype of leaders who are, you know, giving
orders

00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:54.830
or a President of the United States saying
I'm the

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.690
decider. Yeah, sometimes that's true, but
you've got to

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:01.080
be willing to admit what you don't know, build
your team

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.990
accordingly, understand your strengths and
weaknesses,

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.460
get advice, and I think you're going to be
dramatically

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:12.710
more effective. Are you being yourself? Those
little -- Alana was showing me the red dots,

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:15.850
and the
green, and about the food. I mean, so you

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.241
got to watch
what you're eating, know the calories. Let's

00:40:18.241 --> 00:40:20.890
all say
it. I want you the feel like this is your

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:24.740
company that
we care about you that you can be yourself.

00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:27.611
The problem
is, no matter how much the company does, some

00:40:27.611 --> 00:40:30.110
of it's
got to come from you, and this gets back to

00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:32.580
the trust
issue. And the one that I'm most interested

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:39.051
in is these
last two. Are you willing to confront, speak

00:40:39.051 --> 00:40:42.600
up,
disagree? And I'm not a troublemaker, but

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.770
there are
times where if you just think your boss, or

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:49.520
the company,
or your peers are about to make a terrible

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:53.770
mistake, are
you willing to say, you know, "I don't think

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.310
I
understand what we're doing. I don't think

00:40:55.310 --> 00:40:58.650
I agree."
Understanding -- you may be wrong, they may

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:01.880
beat your
brains in and make you feel dumb, but the

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.650
occasionally
got to do this I would argue as a leader.

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:07.180
This is the
essence of leadership. And there are some

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.640
people that
are so politically correct that it just -- you

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.920
know,
they think it's rude, or you know there's

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:16.450
lots of
reasons to talk yourself out of this but my

00:41:16.450 --> 00:41:18.960
experience
is, you're going to be much more likely to

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:23.200
reach your
potential if you're yourself. And by the way,

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.540
I am
certain this company and companies generally

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:29.840
will do
dramatically better. The bigger the group

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:32.680
of people
that feel comfortable being themselves so

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.951
they can
assert themselves, you're going to have a

00:41:34.951 --> 00:41:39.000
far more
successful enterprise. So let me stop there.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.530
That's
really all this book is about. And all I'm

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.750
suggesting -- there's a lot more, obviously,
in the book

00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.570
than this, but this is the thumbnail. Keep
five or six

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:49.920
questions on your wall. If you don't like
these ones ,

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:52.910
pick two or three others, but I think you've
got to --

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.990
when you're in trouble, which I get a raft
of people

00:41:55.990 --> 00:42:00.350
come into my office or phone calls at Morgan
Hall when

00:42:00.350 --> 00:42:03.360
they're struggling, at all levels: Former
students all

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.750
the way up to CEOs of companies, governors
of -- you

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:10.670
know, governors, public officials, all with
the same

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.560
point. I'm having a problem. And usually what
I do is

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:16.670
go through a series of questions with them.
All I'm

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:19.900
saying, have four or five questions on your
wall that

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:22.150
you're thinking about when things aren't going
well.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:24.752
Now, you may think "but I hope I don't get
in a situation

00:42:24.752 --> 00:42:26.930
where things aren't going well." Well, that
isn't going

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:30.940
to happen; you're going to. All of us do,
and all I'm

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:34.440
trying to do is help you with a road map to
how to

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:40.630
navigate through it and how to make your organization
more effective. All right. Let's go through

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:49.850
questions
now. Oh, come on. [light laughter] All right.

00:42:49.850 --> 00:42:54.130
Yes.
&gt;&gt;Female #2: [inaudible]

00:42:54.130 --> 00:43:02.150
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Oh, God. Well, you know, some
things feedback is just heartbreaking. You

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:07.700
know, as
you -- the most -- the difficult one when

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.500
I was a junior
person I used to have occasionally a senior

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:15.230
person say
you know, you'll get your chance. Just tone

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:17.530
it down a
little bit here, you know, because I'd be

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:21.240
disagreeing.
That was okay. That wasn't so bad. What happens

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.070
-- you
know, everybody thinks as you get more senior,

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:26.460
you just
get more confident, and there's like nothing

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:31.120
can -- and
it's the opposite. As you get more senior,

00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.990
you feel --
the senior people here and all of us seem

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:37.820
so confident
feel more vulnerable, you're more on a tightrope,

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.740
there's no net below, you got thousands of
people, I

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:43.580
fear I'm going to screw it up. And so what
happens is I

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.370
used to sit down with junior people and say
"Is there one thing I need to

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:48.980
do -- I can do better."I used to train people
to do

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:54.000
that. And they're very reluctant when you're
a senior

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.680
person to give you that advice unless they're
suicidal

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.551
because they think you're going to be offended.
So you

00:43:59.551 --> 00:44:02.290
just pull it out of them, beads of sweat on
their

00:44:02.290 --> 00:44:03.690
forehead, they think, "Oh, how am I going
to get out of

00:44:03.690 --> 00:44:07.300
here, this guy." And they'd give you something.
And

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.290
they'd talk to you about a speech you gave
that wasn't

00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:12.180
very good or something you did, and it's just
like oh,

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.020
it's devastating. Oh, my God. It's terrible.
So then

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.660
after they leave -- you try not to act too
upset. After

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:22.090
they leave you call a loved one, a friend,
and you ask

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:28.282
them, am I like this? And silence on the other
end of

00:44:28.282 --> 00:44:29.282
the line. [laughter]

00:44:29.282 --> 00:44:34.010
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: And they go yeah. Yeah, that
does sound like you. And you go, oh, God.

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:37.000
Oh. So then
you have to go work on it. And the reason

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.990
it's so
devastating you realize not only does this

00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:42.100
person think
it, everybody thinks it, and I'm so embarrassed.

00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:46.421
I'm
mortified. Oh, my God. You learn though. By

00:44:46.421 --> 00:44:51.610
the way, can you write down
on a piece of paper your strengths and weaknesses?

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:54.090
For
most of us it takes a lot of thought. I can

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:57.830
go to
everyone around you in your job and say "write

00:44:57.830 --> 00:45:00.610
down that
person's strengths and weaknesses." Boom,

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:05.590
boom, boom,
boom, 15 seconds. And the truth is, the last

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:10.000
person to
know in your level and as you get through

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.570
the rest of
your career is often you, and the trick for

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:16.450
you is to
break through that. People ask about this,

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:20.140
"what's the
biggest enemy a leader faces or any of you

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:23.470
face?" Isolation.
Isolation. And you don't even know you're

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:28.260
isolated.
You know, people are thinking things, you're

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:32.161
not aware,
and you don't know to ask for advice, you're

00:45:32.161 --> 00:45:37.240
very stoic,
you're afraid to disclose things about yourself

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.371
maybe,
which makes people feel less inclined to give

00:45:40.371 --> 00:45:43.060
you
advice, and you get isolated, and that's when

00:45:43.060 --> 00:45:45.570
you lose
perspective. And so a lot of these questions

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:47.910
are
intended to punch through that and get you

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:53.100
back
connected to people. Others. Yes.

00:45:53.100 --> 00:46:00.590
&gt;&gt;Male #4: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Yes.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:09.390
&gt;&gt;Male #4: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Well, here's my -- first of

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.230
all, in my job, my argument, I have lots of
coaches and

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:16.710
I would say anybody who you think has observed
you

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:22.660
sufficiently to ideally have some constructive
observations on what you could do better,

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.700
they're a
candidate to be a coach. Okay? Then you just

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:28.350
have to
have the nerve to go ask them and say would

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:31.200
you mind
talking to me for 15 minutes or 30 minutes?

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.611
I'd love to
get your advice or observations on what I

00:46:33.611 --> 00:46:37.620
could do
better. That's it. But to me, observation

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:41.540
is the key.
You want somebody who's seen you enough to

00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:45.560
observe you.
I don't care whether they're senior, junior,

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.850
peer. And
I think people will respond very well to that.

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:50.660
And if
you have six, or seven, or eight or those

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:52.780
people,
listen, over the years I've had -- at this

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:56.220
stage of my
life--, I've had hundreds. You know, I'm finding

00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:58.670
people
all the time. I walk out of class let's say

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:02.190
I pull some
poor person who was straggling behind and

00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:05.020
say, "I want
to get your opinion on something. Did that

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:08.130
make sense?
Is there anything you'd do differently?" And

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:12.090
you know,
but I'm asking people for advice all the time.

00:47:12.090 --> 00:47:19.420
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Male #5: [inaudible]

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:27.600
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Okay. So the question is, what
about getting a coach who doesn't know you?

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.440
So here's
the issue. There are folks who don't know

00:47:31.440 --> 00:47:36.230
me where they
can give me maybe some useful advice on some

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:38.181
things.
For example, I can go through with them, let

00:47:38.181 --> 00:47:40.210
me tell you
my vision and priorities. Is that clear to

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:42.390
you? They
could answer that. Here's the concern -- here's

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.990
the
concern. So they're helpful, but on things

00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:49.050
that you can
explain to them that they can give you feedback

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:50.920
In
addition, though, I don't think that's enough.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:53.500
I think
in addition I work with lots of people and

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.620
I've worked
with lots of CEOs who say to me, "Oh, Rob,

00:47:55.620 --> 00:47:58.970
I don't need
a coach. I've got thee outside mentors whom

00:47:58.970 --> 00:48:02.910
I've known
for years, two whom work for McKinsey and

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:07.420
I tell them
what's going on, they give me feedback." Well,

00:48:07.420 --> 00:48:08.791
as
they're saying it, they don't give them feedback

00:48:08.791 --> 00:48:10.861
on the
thing they really need feedback on, which

00:48:10.861 --> 00:48:14.080
is the way
they're acting every day, their leadership

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:17.140
style, that
they offend people and they don't know. They

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:20.281
don't know
it. They have to watch them. You'd never dream

00:48:20.281 --> 00:48:22.350
-- I
would have never dreamed from just knowing

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:25.660
this person
in meetings that they act that way in their

00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:29.460
jobs. I
wouldn't have believed it. You know? You ever

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:32.760
see
people like that? And so in addition to that

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.830
outside
person, you need somebody who observes you,

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:46.030
I believe.
Yes. Yeah. Sure. Right there.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:49:02.640
&gt;&gt;Male #6: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Yeah.So the question is, what

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.080
tasks
do you choose to do yourself, what tasks do

00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:10.140
you have
other people to do? So this is a project team

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:15.180
in this
case? All right. So here's a couple of questions

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.890
I
always ask. If we're just divvying up tasks,

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:23.010
two things I
decide. If I'm running a very large team where

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:25.850
I have
to review everybody's work, then I try to

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:29.500
only pick
tasks where I absolutely have to do it. Okay?

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.660
Because
I realize I need to have time to review everybody's

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:35.280
work. If, on the other hand you're all equal
and

00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:38.320
working on a team, each think of your strengths
and

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.960
weaknesses and what you'd enjoy doing or what
would be

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:46.720
good for you to do; number 1. The thing that
I'm trying

00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:51.110
to -- the thing I'm trying to point out, so
there's a

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:55.000
project task, and some of when you're on a
team -- I

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.020
would argue what I used to do and still do
when I'm on a

00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.550
team, I'll do whatever needs to be done that
helps the

00:49:59.550 --> 00:50:02.040
team. I will, because I feel that's what it
means to be

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:06.600
a teammate. Okay. Now there's one level above.
So

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.320
that's probably the right approach and mindset
at this

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:12.050
level. When you get to let's say you're getting
someday

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:15.240
where you're managing five project teams,
then you've

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:19.310
got to be much more -- here's the problem.
People have

00:50:19.310 --> 00:50:23.690
struggled from being a team participant, to
being team

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:27.210
leader, to being multiple team leaders, and
what they

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:29.560
have to stop doing is a lot of those tasks
that they're

00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:32.750
so great at when they were on a team, unfortunately
they

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:35.640
have to let those go, because if they do those
as well

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:39.431
as do the team oversight, they can't do both.
Or

00:50:39.431 --> 00:50:42.830
they'll squeeze out people on the team. Or
if they

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:45.940
organize multiple teams, they won't do a good
job at

00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:49.310
that. Their priorities much change in that
we're

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:52.330
overseeing the team might be more important
than doing

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:56.370
any one task. Does that make sense? So if
you're a

00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:59.440
member of a six-person team right now, I'd
say do

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:02.101
whatever needs to be done that helps the team.
Simple

00:51:02.101 --> 00:51:06.340
as that. It's that next step that I think
gets

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:13.810
trickier. Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Male #7: [inaudible]

00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:19.150
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: You're team leader.
&gt;&gt;Male #7: [inaudible]

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:21.930
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Okay.
&gt;&gt;Male #7: [inaudible]

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:24.590
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: All right. So let me answer
--

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:27.150
let me answer that. So back to that question
I asked

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:30.030
how many of you are a coach? I would argue
if you're a

00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:33.650
team leader, all of a sudden if you're a team
member you

00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:36.060
don't need to necessarily be a coach. Once
you're the

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:39.230
team leader, got to be a coach. So it means
when you're

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:41.920
allocating your time, money of your top three
or four

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.910
priorities is communicating vision, communicating
your

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:49.470
priorities, and coaching. Make sure whatever
you're

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:53.680
doing you leave time for those three. That
may mean

00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:58.290
doing any one task you don't have time for
because you

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:00.400
figure out in advance I won't have time to
do these

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:16.840
other things. Okay? All right. Others. Yes.
&gt;&gt;Male #8: [inaudible]

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:22.980
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Well, so there's two things
I

00:52:22.980 --> 00:52:26.650
used to do, two questions I used to ask myself:
A,

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:29.560
always -- sometimes painfully -- what are
your strengths

00:52:29.560 --> 00:52:35.931
and weaknesses? Okay? And what is my passion?
Hard

00:52:35.931 --> 00:52:38.790
question to ask, that second one, because
things that

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:43.850
were a passion when I was 27, I found at 31,
I've done

00:52:43.850 --> 00:52:46.380
it. I'm not -- this is not a passion anymore,
but boy,

00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:50.170
I'd love to do blank. So those are the two
questions

00:52:50.170 --> 00:52:54.740
there. And then there's a third question I'm
always

00:52:54.740 --> 00:53:00.240
asking, including today: Am I learning? Am
I learning?

00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.440
Am I learning? And if the answer starts to
be no,

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.960
that's when I think you start running out
of gas, or

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.540
worse, it's -- the opposite is bad. If I ever
get to

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.740
the point where I don't think I have any more
to learn,

00:53:11.740 --> 00:53:14.970
then I really know I'm in trouble, okay, because
you

00:53:14.970 --> 00:53:18.260
always do and so those are the three questions
I'd

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:25.310
suggest. Others? Yes.
&gt;&gt; Male #9: [inaudible]

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:29.080
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: So you disagree with it.
&gt;&gt;Male #9:Yeah.

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:34.390
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Ah, sometimes I think it's
wrong. So here's the tricky part now. So we're

00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:37.079
right
now talking about today how to be a good coachee

00:53:37.079 --> 00:53:40.930
-- I
don't know if that's a word -- but first of

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:44.880
all, you got
to make sure first question, am I open to

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.770
hearing things
I don't want to hear. So you're trying to

00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:49.520
encourage
people to tell you things you don't want to

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.720
hear who
care about you to do it, and are open to it;

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.440
and then
second, given if I say yeah, I am open, I

00:53:56.440 --> 00:54:00.100
just think
that's wrong. Yeah. Some of the things you

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:02.780
hear in
coaching are wrong, but that shouldn't stop

00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.510
you from
going and asking for it. So I would then get

00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:10.180
five other
opinions and check it out. You know what I

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:14.230
mean? The
biggest problem I see with people is not that

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:17.040
they're
not able to improve. The biggest problem I

00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.300
see when
people don't improve is because they don't

00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:22.010
know what
they need to improve on. They're not open

00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:24.470
to thinking
about what they need to improve on, and they're

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:27.950
not
going out and finding out. It's awareness;

00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:32.320
it's not
ability. This is my experience and my belief.

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.350
99 percent of the time, if people know what
they need to

00:54:35.350 --> 00:54:37.730
improve on, they're going to figure out a
way to do it.

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:39.780
God only knows how, but they'll figure out
a way. I've

00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:46.321
seen it. It amazes me. So why don't they improve?
Because they don't know. They don't have two

00:54:46.321 --> 00:54:48.440
or three
things that they know they need to work on.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.200
So the
trick is, if you think that one feedback is

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:54.450
wrong, fine.
Find the two or three things that are right

00:54:54.450 --> 00:54:58.760
that you're
going to work on, and go after those. Okay?

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:04.390
Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Male #10: [inaudible]

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:13.390
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Is this your boss? If it's not
your boss, you don't need to communicate that

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:15.210
they're
wrong, [chuckles] and in fact I might suggest

00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:17.750
don't do that because
they're not going to feel like you're not

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:20.390
willing to
listen. If it's your boss, you might have

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:23.090
to
communicate that. If say if people give me

00:55:23.090 --> 00:55:24.820
advice,
sometimes I don't always agree. I say thank

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:27.040
you because
sometimes they might come back and give you

00:55:27.040 --> 00:55:28.940
advice on
something else later that you do think is

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:32.460
right and so
you don't want to shut them off. Now, if you're

00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:34.890
a
senior person, you really need to say thank

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:37.970
you because
what I want is people to tell five of their

00:55:37.970 --> 00:55:44.100
friends "he
or she is willing to receive advice. If you

00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.690
got
something to say, go in there; he likes it."

00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:49.960
So I want
to train people and create a culture where

00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:58.060
people are
not afraid. Okay. Yes. Yes.

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:09.350
&gt;&gt;Male #11: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: Right.

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:21.090
&gt;&gt;Male #11:[inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Rob Kaplan: All right. So let's take the

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:23.100
second one first, then I'll go to the first,
which is a

00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:25.830
profound question, the first one. We talk
about this

00:56:25.830 --> 00:56:28.490
all the time. So how do you ask for feedback?
If

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:31.731
you're sincere, I think it'll come through.
Okay? So

00:56:31.731 --> 00:56:34.000
as long as you're doing it for the right reasons,
if

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.590
someone's cynical and thinks you're just doing
it

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:42.910
whatever, kiss up to them, you can't do anything
about

00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:45.420
that. I think if you're sincere, you'll be
perceived as

00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:49.250
sincere. Now, the bigger question is, how
authentic can

00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:52.410
I be? I teach a class called the authentic
leader, in

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:55.020
the fall. In fact, I just got done this week
teaching,

00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:59.930
and this is the big enchilada, as they say,
in that you

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:04.270
need to be--, disclose enough about yourself
so that you

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:07.980
feel comfortable, and if you're a leader,
I would argue

00:57:07.980 --> 00:57:10.230
you have to disclose about -- enough about
yourself to

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:12.530
encourage others to feel comfortable about
you and to

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:16.570
know you. We're always making a judgment about
where to

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:19.980
draw that line. There's certain things about
me I could

00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.810
tell you that would make you laugh, would
make you

00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:26.240
understand me better a little bit, but you
don't need to

00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.930
know this. There's other fundamental things
about me

00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:31.660
that I really should tell you if you're working
with me

00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:34.191
because you'll understand me better. The trick
is, find

00:57:34.191 --> 00:57:37.670
out which ones those are and the problem is
that some

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:40.400
people get them all mixed up. They disclose
all sorts

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:44.470
of personal information that don't help anybody
understand anything about where they're coming

00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:47.890
from, and
they don't disclose the most important things.

00:57:47.890 --> 00:57:50.590
So you
just have to use your judgment. And what makes

00:57:50.590 --> 00:57:53.910
you feel
comfortable I would argue also is important.

00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:58.010
Okay? I'm
sensitive to the time. Okay. Thank you, everybody.

00:57:58.010 --> 00:57:59.390
I
enjoyed talking with you. Thanks for coming.

00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.480
