1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.373
Okay.

2
00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:02.031
<v 1>Hey,</v>

3
00:00:02.031 --> 00:00:05.140
what's going on it's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast from

4
00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:05.974
Monday,

5
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.050
June 30 2016 what's going on? How the fuck are you?

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.680
Um, I'm hanging out here Sunday night.

7
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:19.780
There's 30.2 seconds left in game six. And

8
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.880
<v 2>barring the actual love miracle out,</v>

9
00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.170
bare on the ice worthy of a lake placid sake. Whoa.

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.640
<v 1>I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the fucking Pittsburgh Penguins are</v>

11
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.310
going to win. Their Fifth Cup is just the fifth one that's fucked.

12
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.470
You realize how successful that is. They've only been around since 67.

13
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:43.830
The Bruins been around forever. We only got six. You mother fuckers.

14
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.030
Congratulations to the Pittsburgh Penguins, man. That's fucking great.

15
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.420
And a really happy fulfilled castle. I,

16
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.050
there's actually a good one for me as a Bruins fan because Joe Thorton was, uh,

17
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.200
you know, another former Bruins. Sweet. The way I was going to say,

18
00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:01.670
and I'd like both those fucking players, you know, I mean, because of,

19
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.970
for the Phil Kessel Trade to Toronto, we want a cup. Granted,

20
00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:08.930
we then traded everybody the fuck away, but we did want a cup, you know,

21
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.830
so I can't say some shit to fucking Montreal fence. Finally,

22
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.060
20 seconds to go. 98. I'll tell you this.

23
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.370
<v 2>Joffrey's Trofeo when a fucker go professional sports,</v>

24
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.613
<v 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.620
<v 0>okay,</v>

26
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.950
<v 1>this gotta be one of the most, what the fuck was that icing?</v>

27
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.420
That goalie played it. Ah, Jesus Christ. What does this, the fucking NBA,

28
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.350
um, by the way, I kind of,

29
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:38.470
I guess I understand now why it's not as physical in the NBA.

30
00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:40.750
I actually looked up some of the rules. The uh,

31
00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.350
obviously the three second rule and isn't even as like an offensive player.

32
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.540
Are you allowed to be that or know

33
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.050
the one of these guys can go down the fucking lane.

34
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.220
A defensive player can't be in the fucking painted area for longer than three

35
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:56.110
seconds or it's an illegal defense.

36
00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.620
He is allowed to stand there fees within arm's length of the guy that he's

37
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.031
garden.

38
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:03.250
So all the guys gotta to do is just fucking run out to the three point land and

39
00:02:03.251 --> 00:02:06.250
they just clear it, clear the path. Right?

40
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.610
And it comes the honor roll student or right down the fucking lane,

41
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.560
like Jack Day, his quickness. Yeah. Yeah. As his first step. Yeah.

42
00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:17.830
And the fact that there's now a fucking rule that says you can't have some giant

43
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:21.040
fucking guy standing there. Oh, look it up going crazy.

44
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.993
<v 0>Okay.</v>

45
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.230
<v 1>Wow. Another one in the</v>

46
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.463
<v 3>books.</v>

47
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.930
<v 1>You know something, I'm not claustrophobic, but yeah.</v>

48
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.490
One of the worst things you want to be after winning the championship is that

49
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:38.250
person on the bottom of the fucking pile. You know,

50
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.870
you literally go from like celebrating that you want to not even being able to

51
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.470
breathe. You're like, yeah, you get tackled. You just like,

52
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.223
get up

53
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.510
with that shit. Do you know that?

54
00:02:54.511 --> 00:02:58.030
There's been times people have scored big fucking, uh,

55
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.280
touchdowns and they get tackled by the teammates.

56
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.800
They get like the fucking leg broken. It's unbelievable. Um, anyways,

57
00:03:05.801 --> 00:03:09.730
congratulations to the Pittsburgh Penguins, uh, and Pittsburgh. Great,

58
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:13.360
great fucking hockey town. I know we've had a rivalry in that thing,

59
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:16.270
but I've just been there too many times. I've got too many friends there and uh,

60
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.520
congratulations to Joe Bartner. He's gotta be going fucking crazy right now. Um,

61
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.990
if I didn't have shit to do tomorrow,

62
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:25.270
I would've gone over to his place and watch the game. Um,

63
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.990
San Jose sharks though, man, you know, you never made it to the final.

64
00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.040
See got over that Hump and now you're gonna have that bitter taste in your mouth

65
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:34.510
and hopefully you'll come back. And when one,

66
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:39.240
unless my fucking Bruins get their shit together and then we fucking finally won

67
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.140
one. So anyways, um, let's get on with the podcast here.

68
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.340
Uh, I had a a, yeah. Had my birthday weekend.

69
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.450
Wonderful birthday weekend. Oh, Billy Booz bag was fucking throwing them down.

70
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.020
Oh, Billy Po's bag was acting a clamp. Right.

71
00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.940
And fucking Joey roses was over right. Came over on my birthday to my house.

72
00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:05.410
When I say Joey, you say browses. Um, he came over.

73
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.870
Fucking guy was hilarious. He came over with like a bottle of gin, something,

74
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:13.090
some, a fucking lemon. And then he had those,

75
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:16.690
those fucking Red Cherries that might or might not cause cancer

76
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.150
to Phil Castle. Looks like he fucking war. He's like works with wood,

77
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.990
doesn't he? Like some weird guy that never married, but he could fucking,

78
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:30.010
you know, make a Davin poured out of a fucking tree stump.

79
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:38.230
You can't hate Phil Kessel though. How's your breath? Pretty bad. A, um,

80
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.780
oh, and the wonderful traditional, the NHL,

81
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.500
the shaking of the hands and the shell of mutual respect that,

82
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.090
um, anyways, uh, yeah, so I fucking went,

83
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.750
I went way too hard on my birthday, you know, cause I didn't think any,

84
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:57.940
you know, I didn't really do anything. I worked all fucking day.

85
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.210
And then I came home, I had a course light and I was just like, you know what,

86
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:04.570
it's my birthday. I'll fucking have a scotch. Right.

87
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:09.040
Pick up my big giant fucking cube of ice.

88
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.920
And I threw down two scotches and next thing you know,

89
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.100
fucking roses was coming over and I already had three in the fucking three in

90
00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:21.640
the wind column. So, um, I don't really remember most,

91
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.560
probably the third, last third of the fucking night. And uh,

92
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:28.361
I don't know why. And I was,

93
00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:31.310
I got a bunch of dirty looks in my wife the next day. So, uh,

94
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.370
last night I went out again and I only had like a couple of beers and a,

95
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.440
and then that's it. That's it. I'm shutting it down again.

96
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.490
That's how I stay in control. You know the thing about your livers,

97
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.030
you don't want to spoil it. You know, I've slapped it around enough.

98
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:49.750
So now I give it a break. And then just when it starts to think, hey,

99
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.140
you know what? Everything is beautiful.

100
00:05:53.141 --> 00:05:57.530
I give it the Oh fucking right there Fred. That's what I do. Um,

101
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.370
I had a, I was actually a great weekend. I did do any stand up either.

102
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:04.430
I gotta get my fucking Shit together if some of you didn't want a couple shows

103
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:09.050
this week around la cause I got 'em I got new work,

104
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.650
Atlantic City in Baltimore coming up this weekend.

105
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.620
So I gotta make sure the act is ready to go. Nice and fucking tight there.

106
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:18.260
And uh, but this weekend, you know,

107
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.110
obviously celebrating my birthday Friday night and, uh, let's see,

108
00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:28.090
what did I do? Say I went to somebody else's fucking birthday party. So,

109
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.130
uh, and that one,

110
00:06:30.131 --> 00:06:33.670
that was the one that I actually didn't really drink at,

111
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.700
but I still felt horrible because at one point I had a tequila and after that I

112
00:06:40.091 --> 00:06:44.020
had birthday cake and then I smoked a cigar and then my body was just like,

113
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.860
all right, can we, can we fucking pick a road here? Which, which,

114
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.240
which way is the abuse going tonight? You know? But uh,

115
00:06:52.241 --> 00:06:53.440
I was so hung over Saturday,

116
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:56.410
I couldn't even fucking walk the 10 feet to my gym and I was,

117
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.890
that's when I know was like, all right to, yeah. Yo, what, what are you doing?

118
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.030
So I shut it down. It's over. Put a padlock on it.

119
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.213
Um,

120
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:07.360
<v 4>okay.</v>

121
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.500
<v 1>I don't know how long I'm going to go.</v>

122
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:10.773
<v 4>Okay.</v>

123
00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.040
<v 1>I know you don't want it. Is this,</v>

124
00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:14.530
this is actually once the fucking playoffs are over, it's kind of easy,

125
00:07:14.531 --> 00:07:16.270
but I'm also going to be starting peaky blinders,

126
00:07:16.271 --> 00:07:19.030
so that might be hard the way those fucking guys drink.

127
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.150
I don't understand how you watch your show.

128
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:24.610
Everybody's boozing and you don't fucking drink any alcoholics out there. Like,

129
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:26.650
how the fuck do you watch that stuff and just be like,

130
00:07:26.651 --> 00:07:30.010
well everybody else is drinking. I feel like I'm being rude right now.

131
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:34.413
<v 5>Okay.</v>

132
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.780
<v 1>Um, I'm thinking maybe I'm going to shut it down until I go to Europe,</v>

133
00:07:37.781 --> 00:07:41.650
but even then I can't really drink cause I got to show every fucking night. But,

134
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:43.870
uh, I did set myself up in, um,

135
00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:45.440
<v 4>okay.</v>

136
00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.130
<v 1>In a hotel, uh, on one of those dates that there's actually a,</v>

137
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:51.410
a cigar bar right around the corner.

138
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:56.150
So I might have my one for July. Um,

139
00:07:56.660 --> 00:07:58.210
I don't know. I feel like I'm just fucking babbling.

140
00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.590
This is just me just trying to keep my bad habits at bay. This is a deal.

141
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:05.160
Either I'm not drinking at all or I'm smoking too many cigars or I cut down the

142
00:08:05.161 --> 00:08:07.560
cigars and I drink like a fucking lunatic. You know what I mean?

143
00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:08.490
Like I've said before,

144
00:08:08.491 --> 00:08:12.030
I literally think the reason why people have kids is so they won't fucking drink

145
00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:12.811
themselves to death.

146
00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:16.620
Because once you fucking get yourself going in your career and you've got some

147
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:20.280
free time, why wouldn't you? Why wouldn't you walk over?

148
00:08:20.281 --> 00:08:22.660
What are you going to fucking do? Huh?

149
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.070
After that fucking horrible tragedy down there in Orlando,

150
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.960
which I, I will never fucking understand. Lunatic religious people.

151
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:39.020
I just never understand how you get so fucked up in your head that you feel like

152
00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:43.980
that's your last act on earth. Okay. That's the last thing you're going to do.

153
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.290
And you think that you're going to go somewhere good.

154
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.300
That there's somebody after this.

155
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.630
If there is somebody after this that judged you,

156
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.780
that he's going to be sitting there going like, all right, wait a go.

157
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.620
They again, that was the right thing to do.

158
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.730
Make millions of people sad. You know, it's just,

159
00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.470
it's still fucking worst thing ever. And I'm,

160
00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:12.780
I'm actually gonna take a break here from TV probably for other than sports.

161
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.290
It's a great thing about sports is you can get away from that stuff because, uh,

162
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.470
I can't handle when something like this happens. How quickly, Oh God,

163
00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:24.190
is he getting booed? Is he getting,

164
00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:26.680
<v 2>uh, you know what?</v>

165
00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:28.103
<v 0>Hello?</v>

166
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.540
<v 2>It's plugged bastard every fucking year.</v>

167
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:36.750
This is the funniest shit ever in hockey.

168
00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.200
<v 1>Every fucking year.</v>

169
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:42.400
The commissioner of the League comes out and he just gets fucking,

170
00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.140
I don't know why he's still getting booed. Let's see this here.

171
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:52.450
<v 2>We're handing it off. Hang on a second. Steve Somers wrote those words.</v>

172
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.260
Slave Somers wrote those words and now it's engraved on the side of the Stanley

173
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:56.561
Cup lab.

174
00:09:56.561 --> 00:10:00.730
Rub my balls on it right before one of the greatest trophies and owes for look

175
00:10:00.731 --> 00:10:04.570
at Mario Lemieux looking sharp. Huh? He's got his anchor sport coat on.

176
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.150
Dumb Bird, Tom Burgundy. Fucking the Fox. His name.

177
00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:12.123
Oh, here it comes.

178
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.980
He's complimenting him is one of the loudest buildings I've ever heard that bow

179
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.943
and huh?

180
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.310
His children must cry every fucking year.

181
00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.510
<v 1>So anyways, back to the tragedy. Sorry. Um,</v>

182
00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:40.020
I can't handle whenever something like that fucking happens.

183
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.190
And then you got to sit there and listen to all of these fucking people trying

184
00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:48.840
to shoehorn their agendas in there. They're uh,

185
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:50.423
you know,

186
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.830
the fucking theories and then somehow it always becomes Democrat, liberal,

187
00:10:55.831 --> 00:11:00.270
fucking conservative, Republican, Muslim,

188
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:04.830
Christian fucking gun control and Ra and all that shit.

189
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.130
And you know, it's fucking, it's so stupid. You know, it's funny,

190
00:11:08.131 --> 00:11:11.820
if you look at the daily news and, um,

191
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.440
New York City, right? They are anti gun, which you know,

192
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.390
that's what you want to be. That's what you want to be.

193
00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:21.360
But if you anti gun and you really want,

194
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:26.280
you know that to work, wouldn't you? Uh, you need,

195
00:11:26.281 --> 00:11:29.220
what you need to do is persuade the other side to come over.

196
00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.230
Their headline is thanks a lot NRA or some stupid shit like that.

197
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:38.610
All it does is just get people's fucking back up. All I'm saying,

198
00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.070
it's just going to be a bunch of people screaming and yelling.

199
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.930
There's going to be a couple of actors and actresses that are going to say

200
00:11:45.931 --> 00:11:50.310
something stupid. Right? I don't know what, but you know,

201
00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.570
we're always good to do something like people in the fucking people who forget

202
00:11:55.571 --> 00:11:58.420
that they're a dancing monkey and think that they could solve the country's

203
00:11:58.421 --> 00:11:59.254
problems

204
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.790
for the fucking life of me. I mean, I know I fucking talk about this shit,

205
00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:11.290
but I never try to offer solutions. You know, maybe we'll my,

206
00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:15.620
I tell Dick and shit jokes and fucking strip moss. Um, but I,

207
00:12:15.621 --> 00:12:16.780
I gotta tell you though,

208
00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:22.020
I just wish people out of respect for the amount of fucking paint that was just

209
00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:26.380
inflicted on s I can't even imagine what that number of 50 people,

210
00:12:26.381 --> 00:12:30.010
how many people right now? I just never going to be the same.

211
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.820
You would think that people could go 24 fucking hours.

212
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:35.590
<v 4>Okay.</v>

213
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:39.790
<v 1>Without making it about their cause and screaming and yelling as much as they're</v>

214
00:12:39.791 --> 00:12:43.180
trying to fucking help. Can you just kind of about just, you know,

215
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:48.210
can you go 20 fucking minutes before we got to listen to people saying that it's

216
00:12:48.521 --> 00:12:51.760
Obama's fault and fucking this and that and everything. You know what?

217
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.270
I don't know whose fault. It's nobody's fault. You know what it is, dude,

218
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.050
unfortunately we're fucking, we're animals. That's what it is.

219
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:02.380
Most of us are decent enough not to do that, but it's just a,

220
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:04.180
what are you going to do? It's just fucking horrible.

221
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.180
Why would I talk about this shit? You know, why?

222
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:11.800
Cause it's cause why are you not, how do you not mom. Anyways,

223
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.930
so Sidney Crosby got the MVP,

224
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:19.060
got that little shiny house with the fucking, I dunno, disco hat on top of it.

225
00:13:19.061 --> 00:13:23.140
All right. When's he given it to Phil Castle? When's he given it to Phil Kessel.

226
00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:27.850
Who's he handed off to first? Who is he headed off to first?

227
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:31.960
What are the great traditions of all sports? I'll tell you ways.

228
00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:36.961
Fucking 9,000 pubs till you put it over your head then it feels like a baby.

229
00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:41.050
You're worried about dropping? Yeah,

230
00:13:41.051 --> 00:13:43.350
we hear all the stories about the Stanley Cup. All the fucking,

231
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:45.390
I can't believe they drink out of that thing every year.

232
00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.920
The amount of fucking stripper ass that has been sitting in that thing,

233
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.220
people pissing in it and all kinds of shit.

234
00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.530
At least it ends up with a bottom of a pool. A couple times.

235
00:13:55.531 --> 00:13:56.490
You get some chlorine

236
00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:01.170
and I'm exposing myself to the fact I don't know who anybody is on the fucking

237
00:14:01.171 --> 00:14:03.840
penguins. Alrighty. He handled it.

238
00:14:03.841 --> 00:14:08.250
He just handed the cup to not Phil Kessel, not Phil Castle,

239
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.620
not Phil Kessel holding it up, holding it up, turning,

240
00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:17.790
spinning. What number is he? Number six, not Phil Kessel.

241
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.830
Jesus Christ. He should've fucking skated around a little more daily.

242
00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.740
Dude, I would fucking take off with that thing.

243
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.550
I swear to God if I haven't gotten it, we've got to do that thing. Be like when,

244
00:14:31.551 --> 00:14:36.050
what's his face a, it's one of his fucking shots at the end of his practice,

245
00:14:36.051 --> 00:14:37.670
speaking of which Jesus Christ.

246
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:42.560
I was hoping for at least at least a fucking six game series with the Cavaliers.

247
00:14:42.561 --> 00:14:46.430
I may guess that's not going to happen. Right? Um, anyways,

248
00:14:46.431 --> 00:14:48.820
let's plow ahead here with the podcast. I'll stop watching the,

249
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:52.390
I gotta keep this on until at least I'll get to watch castle. Oh,

250
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:56.480
he's the fucking cup here. Huh? The woodworker here. Um,

251
00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:02.210
anyways, you don't have to watch this, uh, sports this morning is I watched the,

252
00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.540
uh, the Formula One race, the one up in Montreal,

253
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.670
kind of getting into that sport. You know,

254
00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.530
cause I never know what to do once hocking in basketball ends. You know,

255
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:16.370
what am I going to do, Reed? God knows I'm not going to fucking do that. Right.

256
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.430
Um, I'm just filibustering hey, can you just fucking,

257
00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:29.180
I dunno if he's been waiting that long. Come on. You gotta give it to Phil.

258
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.040
He's fucking adorable.

259
00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.593
<v 0>Okay.</v>

260
00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.590
<v 1>Okay, here we go. Phil Kessel. Phil Castle. Nope.</v>

261
00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:43.450
Some assistant captain. Oh, Jesus said smoking.

262
00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.760
I didn't recognize him with a hat on.

263
00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:50.230
He's not one of those guys who's fucking mustache and beard doesn't connect.

264
00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:55.000
You know Jesus, he's got a terrible patchy fucking, I don't know what now,

265
00:15:55.001 --> 00:15:59.140
what he's got going on there. That's really the thing. People can either,

266
00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:01.660
you know, you know what's the worst is the fucking neck beard.

267
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.760
You know those people in fucking,

268
00:16:03.761 --> 00:16:07.240
it starts off all right by the ear and then it just fucking goes,

269
00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.510
does a nosedive.

270
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.880
And you guys like the Chinstrap goes right up and under and they got like five

271
00:16:12.881 --> 00:16:15.010
hairs in their upper lip and he's just like, well what are you doing?

272
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.830
You know Tang has it now. All right, this has to be excruciatingly boring.

273
00:16:20.831 --> 00:16:22.750
I'm going to hit pause here until Phil Kessel gets it.

274
00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:24.253
<v 0>Okay.</v>

275
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:27.490
<v 1>And of course they cut it off before he fucking hoists the thing.</v>

276
00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.030
Cause they had a cut immediately to a get you a championship tee shirts and

277
00:16:31.031 --> 00:16:35.110
fucking hats. All right, I'll, I'll find a fucking clip of it. Um, all right.

278
00:16:35.111 --> 00:16:38.770
With that, I'm going to shut the TV off so I can actually focus here. Um, yeah,

279
00:16:38.771 --> 00:16:43.150
so shutting down the booze, I can shut down the booze.

280
00:16:43.151 --> 00:16:45.310
Hit My little fucking gym out there. You know what I mean?

281
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.750
Get myself a fucking man sports bra and fucking get after it. You know,

282
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:54.190
not smoke cigars. I will be the most in shape and board I've ever fucking been.

283
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:56.403
Um,

284
00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:01.890
I've got to correct a couple of things from, um,

285
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:06.810
the last podcast I did on Thursday, uh, John, Sally is not dead.

286
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.530
I meant to say Anthony Mason. I don't know. I was half a fucking sleeper. Right.

287
00:17:14.190 --> 00:17:18.970
And uh, so I want to thank all you comments on Twitter too that like you,

288
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:22.290
you, you couldn't just write to me. Hey Bill, John, Sally isn't dead.

289
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:26.070
You had to put at John Sally so he could have potentially saw it.

290
00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:29.850
Why the fuck would you do that to you know why? Cause you're fucking bored.

291
00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:34.780
That's why we'll help in some fucking Twitter. Dustup would happen.

292
00:17:34.890 --> 00:17:39.570
I guess I just don't understand this whole fucking generation. A Yolo Douche is,

293
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.910
they're all about filming people get them in trouble,

294
00:17:41.911 --> 00:17:44.280
Hashtag and shit adding people on stuff.

295
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:48.590
Just trying to constantly cause these fucking fights. It's unbelievable.

296
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.050
Can't you go outside and pick up a stick and pick cowboys and Indians?

297
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:55.270
Like we used to get to walk around with your fucking iPad and your,

298
00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:01.710
your GoPro. Oh Shit. I got a GoPro for my birthday. I'm such a hypocrite.

299
00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.300
Um, I wanted to get one of those things and uh,

300
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.560
you know, I might, I'm, I'm toying with the idea of doing that show.

301
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:12.330
The how long can he go,

302
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.510
which is basically me pulling out of the driveway at my house and then you see

303
00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:19.260
how long I can go without snapping on people. Um,

304
00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:22.950
but I just don't want to make myself look like a fucking lunatic, you know,

305
00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.400
cause I feel like I've built up a great reputation for being even keeled on this

306
00:18:26.401 --> 00:18:30.430
podcast. Um, all right, let's do, let's do a little fucking, um,

all right. Ready? Yeah. Okay. MVMT watches everybody.

309
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.990
When you're in your early twenties and thirties,

310
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.510
money can be tight if you're not careful.

311
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:48.030
Dressing well can quickly drain your bank account.

312
00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.210
Like spending 400 to 500 bucks on a department store.

313
00:18:51.211 --> 00:18:55.500
Watch there's some brands out there charging insane prices for watches that

314
00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:59.070
aren't even worth it. Well, if you want to look great when you go out,

315
00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:03.540

This feminist agenda kicks up. Is that happening out there?

318
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.650
You're really going on a date and she buys the fucking drink. Is that,

319
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:17.970
is that what's happening? Is that why Bruce became Katelyn?

320
00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:21.960
He was so much of a man. He goes, oh, no, no, no.

321
00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.040
I buy a drinks by all life. Nobody's buying me a drink.

322

325
00:19:38.910 --> 00:19:41.490
Jesus fucking Christ. I fucking hate that when people do that.

326
00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:44.850
Just just give me the spiel and I'll read it.

327
00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.560

well. If you are broke, how the fuck did you start the company? No,

332
00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:04.980
this doesn't add up. All right.

337
00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.300

408
00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.910
Anthony Show in 2005 11 years ago. They showed me that come up.

409
00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:54.770
Somebody sent me that too. And they, I had absolutely no recollection of that.

410
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:58.520
How would I forget that? Cause it was 2005 it was a long time ago.

411
00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.170
I know, but this is like no mats. That's, I still remember.

412
00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:06.890
You know you're late. We're late, Charlie. Bit My finger. We're not late.

413
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.410
Oh, did all these fucking assholes. You just seen it now it's like, yeah,

414
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:15.830
I haven't had time to see everything on the Internet. You fucking asshole.

415
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:19.670
That's so stupid. I, the more I'm on this,

416
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.700
I like just talking into the abyss. I got to stop fucking reading Twitter.

417
00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:27.710
I fucking hate people. Twitter, you are truly addicted to Twitter. No,

418
00:25:27.711 --> 00:25:30.080
just my phone. I'm not doing that either. I was looking today,

419
00:25:30.081 --> 00:25:31.670
I was looking at both Formula One drivers.

420
00:25:31.671 --> 00:25:33.440
I watched two formula one races in a row.

421
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:35.510
Now I need to know everything about this sport.

422
00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:38.840
You're so rain man like that though. You like, that's what you like to do.

423
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.940
Get to know everything. You got to find out everything. Yeah.

424
00:25:40.941 --> 00:25:44.360
And I get it all in there and then I forget it and then I move on to something

425
00:25:44.361 --> 00:25:48.200
else. And that's probably why I fucking forgot that. That video. Yeah, probably.

426
00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.960
Do you know there's a red bull team in Formula One and I'm just sitting,

427
00:25:50.961 --> 00:25:54.920
I don't know that because I've just seen people wearing their jackets and

428
00:25:54.921 --> 00:25:58.550
jumpsuits and it's on the side of cars. How did you not see it? If I know this?

429
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:59.960
Well, I was thinking, well there's,

430
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:03.260
there was a Mercedes team and then there was the Ferrari team and then there was

431
00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:06.020
like red bull. I'm like, they were fucking drink. So I was like,

432
00:26:06.021 --> 00:26:09.200
well who made their engine? Who paid, who made the car?

433
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:13.940
And then they said it was, they said it was tag hoyer. Renault.

434
00:26:14.150 --> 00:26:16.190
It's like tag or he is a fucking watch.

435
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.190
Well when I type in who makes you fucking engines,

436
00:26:19.191 --> 00:26:20.930
I don't want to hear about the watch people.

437
00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:25.660
Maybe you should leave out the fucking part. All

438
00:26:28.610 --> 00:26:32.810
right to shake. I didn't know that. That's how you get into tag hoyer.

439
00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:38.750
But no, red bull is a huge brand. So of course I sponsor stuff like this.

440
00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.900
No, but they was saying, you know the Ferrari, the Mercedes,

441
00:26:41.901 --> 00:26:43.980
and then they would never say what kind of fucking,

442
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.900
<v 1>they never said the Renault.</v>

443
00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:51.150
It's a French company making the fucking engine and I think it's a British team

444
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:55.260
and then they're talking about a fucking energy drink where the other guys got

445
00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:58.110
to be like Mercedes, Ferrari and you got to be like, yeah man.

446
00:26:58.111 --> 00:26:59.250
Of course those guys are like,

447
00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:03.330
they've been doing it forever and all of a sudden red bull shows up.

448
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.810
The Yolo Douche is a fucking Formula One and they don't even tell me who makes

449
00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:11.430
Sarah engine. I mean I used to be like a big fucking thing back in the day.

450
00:27:11.431 --> 00:27:14.940
The reason why you want it was you proven you the best car company and then

451
00:27:14.941 --> 00:27:17.580
everybody's like, well shit, Ferrari won the last five.

452
00:27:17.581 --> 00:27:20.580
I'm going to buy a Ferrari. We're not everybody people could afford it.

453
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:24.600
So I'm still confused. What's your problem with Red Bull? I didn't,

454
00:27:24.601 --> 00:27:27.750
I didn't like how I look. I want to know who's making that engine.

455
00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:31.890
That's when in the fucking race I don't give a fuck about the drink. Okay,

456
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:36.360
so you're haven't been able to figure out who makes the engine in this one

457
00:27:36.361 --> 00:27:39.390
particular race car? No, I had to look it up. Okay.

458
00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:41.580
This fucking young punk kid was not letting the guy,

459
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.970
one won the first three or four get past him to get into fourth place and the

460
00:27:44.971 --> 00:27:48.120
guy got in patient and I knew we was gonna cause that's what I would've done.

461
00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.220
And I knew he was a little bit older. I'm like,

462
00:27:50.221 --> 00:27:51.510
oh he doesn't have time for this kid.

463
00:27:51.511 --> 00:27:54.930
And he fucking tried to go around the right and then he locked up the brakes and

464
00:27:54.931 --> 00:27:59.310
he spun out and he fucked himself out at like two spots on the last lap and

465
00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:03.510
everybody in the crown went, oh, it's exciting.

466
00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:07.140
So at the end of the day you got the information that you wanted.

467
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:10.350
It was just the fact that red bull was in there.

468
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:15.310
You are annoyed by it. It's really hard to follow you sometimes like, Whoa,

469
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:20.760
okay, Mercedes is a maker of cars. Yes. Yes.

470
00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:24.780
So when I know it's a Mercedes team, I know that the engineers,

471
00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:28.890
the mechanics wouldn't fuck you. Call them that. That's their car. Okay.

472
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:31.590
When they talk about the Ferrari team, I know that that's their car.

473
00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.680
I know who built the fucking thing. When you say red bull,

474
00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.920
who built the red bull car? It's harder to figure out, hey you want to hit?

475
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:43.680
Oh my God, what the fuck did that? What the fuck? I already forgot.

476
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:47.070
Are you onto another topic already know cause that just remind me how I always

477
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.960
feel. It just reminded me of a drink.

478
00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:56.810
What my dad called Greg Goose one time. He goes, hey bill, he goes,

479
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:58.740
are you still drinking that Blue Swan

480
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:03.860
<v 2>know? You know what just occurred to me? That's where you get it from.</v>

481
00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:07.070
That's where you get all that stuff. The last days of Dracula,

482
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:11.320
two whores and a pool. You know where'd the bitch go?

483
00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.190
Like you get that from him.

484
00:29:13.191 --> 00:29:16.180
Like you guys have a vague idea of what it is at you're,

485
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:17.810
when I'm doing the movie thing,

486
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:21.650
so you're just like throwing out like lets signifiers like you know that there

487
00:29:21.651 --> 00:29:25.970
is the, there is a girl and she's being slutty and there was a pool. So yeah,

488
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:27.043
two whores. Annabelle,

489
00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.520
it's a vampire buyer and they're doing some sort of an interview. So it's, yeah,

490
00:29:31.521 --> 00:29:33.350
the last days of Dracula, it's just,

491
00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.940
well I know I'm doing the more like the $10,000 pyramid.

492
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.980
Like I'm throwing out clues for the listener and then they just go,

493
00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.010
do you mean that I go, yeah,

494
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.090
<v 1>I mean, because if I don't do that, I'm going to sit there going, ah, ah,</v>

495
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.340
and I'm not gonna remember. And then they going to be tortured.

496
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:49.780
So it becomes like a little [inaudible]

497
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:53.830
<v 2>game. You know what I mean? I wonder how you would do on that pyramid show,</v>

498
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.920
cause you know they're bringing it back. I would do horrible on that show.

499
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:01.870
You would just give them, if I was giving you, let's glue ever.

500
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:05.290
Right when you, all right, you know what? Let's play right now.

501
00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.710
I'm going to get a fucking word. Okay. And we're going to,

502
00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:09.760
we're going to play right now. All right.

503
00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.310
And I will see if I can guess what it is based on your head.

504
00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.540
<v 1>All right, we'll do the couple of these. Get out of here. Get up.</v>

505
00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.920
You got to get a microphone. Go get a microphone.

506
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.300
And when I'm finished reading this fucking advertising here. Jesus Christ,

507
00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.510
they started this like 20 minutes ago. Hey guys,

508
00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:28.740
remember way back in the day when I was talking about stamps.com, guess what?

509
00:30:28.741 --> 00:30:29.730

Yes, she had dinner. Uh, important. Uh, keeps your operations going.

511
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:39.690

512
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.540
But if you're making constant trips to the post office,

513

Be given a taken. Yeah,

568
00:33:52.271 --> 00:33:55.840
I don't do they think giving a risk fucking is something like that.

569
00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.030
They don't see me given the password or they're already taking the fucking

570
00:33:59.080 --> 00:33:59.600

Okay. Ready? Ready? Are we on the clock here? Yes.

573
00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:11.420
But add the tension. Can we get it fucking clock timer here.

574
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:14.940
I'm going to get one of these on youtube right now. No,

575
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:16.160
we don't need to do that. All right, here we go.

576
00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:19.160
Use the stopwatch thing on the computer. Oh, the people at home,

577
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:23.900
the fans at home got to hear a fucking clock going. All right. Okay. We're back.

578
00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.080
And uh, there's only 33 seconds on this clock.

579
00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:31.930
So there's four things you gotta get. Okay. They're a topic or I'm just just,

580
00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:35.390
no, there's nothing. This is just random shit that came out of my head. I,

581
00:34:35.391 --> 00:34:40.250
you got, you got 33 seconds. Let's see how many you can get. Okay. All right.

582
00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:43.970

It's all true. Everything.

595
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:40.110
I pick this up by Swat and that was supposed to be a glue.

596
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:41.610
I was thinking she did a porno.

606
00:36:17.851 --> 00:36:18.810
This is a,

607
00:36:18.811 --> 00:36:23.070
this is something that you say and people get mad and it's because it can smell

608
00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.210
sometimes, but if it's a fresh one, it's great. And if you fucking stick it,

609
00:36:27.211 --> 00:36:28.960

610
00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:37.110
It's between your legs. It's between your legs. Keep going. Let's see.

611
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.460

614
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:55.860
Be asked to be on the rooted pyramid show.

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:34.060
We'll do it on Thursday. Okay. We'll do one on Thursday. All right.

624
00:37:34.061 --> 00:37:37.240
You come up with you guys. We got the quick little timer there.

625
00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:40.700
<v 1>I know. Stick it up. My twat.</v>

626
00:37:43.050 --> 00:37:47.280
<v 2>Actually I probably disqualified the last one because I used the word twice when</v>

627
00:37:47.281 --> 00:37:49.680
I was trying to get the Kardashians, right? Yeah. Mary around.

628
00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.560
Hey look [inaudible] what we're doing over here.

629
00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.740
Keep it up with the card bed sheets. It worked though.

630
00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.280
<v 1>It did work. What do you want from me? All right,</v>

631
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:05.700
come on off of bender here. Hey, it's a rough one. You know. Alright,

632
00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:10.590
you talk about your birthday. Uh, yes I did. I had a great time. I,

633
00:38:10.591 --> 00:38:13.660
it was a whole birthday weekend. Yes it was. It was.

634
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:18.670
I had my own little sad alcoholic one night of mine where you were stone sober

635
00:38:19.891 --> 00:38:23.220
and you watched me and Joe to Rosa just fucking, we were having fun.

636
00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:27.870
You were having fun. That's true. But eventually I had to leave. Yeah.

637
00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.730
Well you weren't partying so you know, what are you gonna do? Um, and then,

638
00:38:32.731 --> 00:38:36.070
you know, last night was phenomenal also. And then I went down to the Improv.

639
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:40.000
Ben Bailey was in town, the Great Ben Bailey. Yeah. We hung out.

640
00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:43.030
We had a couple of drinks. Just fucking laugh and tell the stories and uh,

641
00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:46.240
de Rosa was down and we had, it was a great time, you know,

642
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:49.240
and I got to go to work tomorrow, so let me read these things and uh,

643
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:53.620
I'm going to go, this was fun. I'm going to go have a, a Taco. Um, all right.

644
00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:56.290
I'll see you in a little bit. Okay. Thank you for playing.

645
00:38:56.830 --> 00:39:00.160
We have a wonderful edition of our home game for you. I think you got it.

646
00:39:00.161 --> 00:39:04.090
I think you actually got to too, right in the end. Um,

647
00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.870
all right, here's somebody else. I'm late to the party with on Youtube,

648
00:39:07.871 --> 00:39:11.110
but I'm sure I'm not the only one. Right. Isn't that a song?

649
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.270
I'm not the you,

650
00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:18.190
I'm not the only one with mixed emotions.

651
00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:22.910
Um, you guys seen this kid that just, it's,

652
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:26.530
it's fucking hillier I feel bad cause he's, he's got some sort of issue,

653
00:39:26.531 --> 00:39:27.760
but like he just,

654
00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.810
he just fucking goes around and he tells people this, this Charlie, uh,

655
00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:34.030
is it Zell enough,

656
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:39.460
he just fucking goes into gyms and tells people that he's the greatest.

657
00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:43.610
And he goes, let's spar. And they have no fucking clue. You know,

658
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:46.630
he just goes in and he fights in accounting and accounting just kind of puts his

659
00:39:46.631 --> 00:39:47.560
gloves on in this kid,

660
00:39:47.561 --> 00:39:51.070
swings for the fences and fucking knocks out an account and then turns around

661
00:39:51.071 --> 00:39:54.940
and you see that one punch knocked down an accountant deck. And he was like,

662
00:39:54.941 --> 00:39:56.770
that guy was a marine. He talked all this shit.

663
00:39:56.771 --> 00:40:00.790
He actually started calling up professional fighters and I was surprised that

664
00:40:00.791 --> 00:40:04.270
some of them actually took time out of their day to fight the guy. And, uh,

665
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:08.980
I mean at some of the most compelling shit I've ever seen.

666
00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.670
And granted they have like 74,000 hits, 219,000 hits,

667
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:18.370
105,000 hits. So once again, I'm sure you're just finding out about it now.

668
00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.840
Yes. Yes I am.

669
00:40:19.841 --> 00:40:23.020
Have you watched the youtube video that just shows how the fucking differential

670
00:40:23.021 --> 00:40:25.750
works? How the fuck did you miss that? Oh, that's right.

671
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:30.130
Cause you don't have time to watch all of it. Alright. So if you get a chance,

672
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:34.360
watch this kid Charlie Zellen off. Um,

673
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.200
oh my God, he's got the flip phone and he just calls.

674
00:40:38.201 --> 00:40:40.210
This guy keeps calling this guy a fucking clown.

675
00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.570
I don't know a lot about like people's like names and shit,

676
00:40:43.571 --> 00:40:47.980
but I will say this about the kid. He's got the fucking balls to go in there.

677
00:40:47.981 --> 00:40:52.180
Man. I wouldn't do that. Anybody can call up a professional boxer.

678
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:57.220
It talks shit. But to actually show up for the fucking match, um,

679
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.300
I dunno. He fought like he flood.

680
00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:05.650
Fuck Floyd Mayweather senior and then he was losing.

681
00:41:05.651 --> 00:41:08.950
So he stepped out of the, uh,

682
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:14.910
stepped out of the fucking ring and then step back in and tried to suck a punch

683
00:41:14.981 --> 00:41:17.800
the guy and then somebody jumped in like bare knuckle, beat him down.

684
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.740
It was just, it's insane. Anyways, you got it. You got to watch it.

685
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.040
Charlie Zellen off. I'll spell it. I'll spell it for you. Uh, z.

686
00:41:25.041 --> 00:41:27.370
E. L. E. N. O. F. F.

687
00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:32.050
I hope he doesn't get hurt and I hope he doesn't hurt anybody and uh, but he's,

688
00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:36.710
he talks shit like who is that fucking will forte character.

689
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.890
Um, Calhoun. What the fuck was his first name? W will forte

690
00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:49.010
Calhoun. Tim Calhoun. Um, Tim Calvin. I,

691
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.550
Tim Calvin think that we should sell the statue of Liberty.

692
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.760
He talks shit like that. He's on the phone going, you're fucking clown.

693
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.860
I'm going to come down there. I'm the greatest of all time.

694
00:41:58.010 --> 00:42:01.550
You've been ducking me for years. You fucking clown. He never raises it up.

695
00:42:01.551 --> 00:42:01.881
It's like,

696
00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:05.630
it's some of the best shit talking I've heard just as far as like you a unique

697
00:42:05.631 --> 00:42:07.670
style. So I've got to give it up for that.

698
00:42:07.671 --> 00:42:11.690
But it's definitely some of the more bizarre shit that you're gonna Watch. Um,

699
00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:16.190
[inaudible] which of course sent me down a rabbit hole of watching people fight.

700
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:20.030
And I saw the bus driver that throws the uppercut at that girl who's fucking

701
00:42:20.031 --> 00:42:23.090
screaming at him. And, uh, I know you're not supposed to hit a woman,

702
00:42:23.091 --> 00:42:25.460
but in defense of him, he led with an uppercut.

703
00:42:25.461 --> 00:42:28.460
And I watched what happened when Buster Douglas did that. So in a way,

704
00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:32.480
I thought that that was a gentlemanly move before he grabbed her by her hair and

705
00:42:32.481 --> 00:42:33.560
threw her off the bus.

706
00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.460
I know the things that I find entertaining. I know I'm out of my mind.

707
00:42:40.530 --> 00:42:44.930
All right. Poland, everybody. I got, I got, I got a letter from Poland. Hey,

708
00:42:44.931 --> 00:42:46.880
you freckled face fucker.

709
00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:52.100
Why I want you to come to Poland is beautiful and we have great alcohol. Um,

710
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:57.500
I would love to go there. You know what the fuck I live on,

711
00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.280
cause I live on the other side of the world. And a year,

712
00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:00.800
the first guy that's asked me to go there,

713
00:43:00.801 --> 00:43:03.920
maybe I've had like maybe three emails. I'll go there.

714
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:07.280
I'll stand there in front of five five-year, Charles Bronson. Look,

715
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.410
motherfuckers, I'll stand over there in front of you. You know,

716
00:43:09.411 --> 00:43:10.800
I don't give a shit urged.

717
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:13.760
You got nice beaches up north and there's a nice town down south.

718
00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.120
I Dunno about Warsaw. I don't know what's going on there.

719
00:43:18.370 --> 00:43:21.560
You guys still have horses in your army of you fucking updated your shit.

720
00:43:21.561 --> 00:43:23.780
You know you'd still, they live next to Germany.

721
00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:27.890
You know you got to watch out for those cuts. I was, that was a cheap shot.

722
00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:30.470
Alright. It's beautiful. We have alcohol. All right, just a question.

723
00:43:30.471 --> 00:43:35.420
When will you come to the fucking Saudi or to the fucking Saudi Arabia or Dubai

724
00:43:35.421 --> 00:43:39.830
or Kuwait? Um, I dunno. When they like us.

725
00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.370
I'm not going over there and getting kidnapped and get my head sod off on

726
00:43:46.371 --> 00:43:47.360
fucking youtube.

727
00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.280
Aids built bird just checking in on you and they fucking, you know,

728
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.210
you'd have to see,

729
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:56.810
you'd have to say something now you couldn't because they need to worry that

730
00:43:56.811 --> 00:43:58.100
they do something even worse to you.

731
00:43:59.210 --> 00:44:03.770
I wait till ready as they got through the juggler. Oh man, I would find. Yeah.

732
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:05.930
Do a quick little Philly set on, on uh,

733
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:10.640
just say everything that would piss him off, which I would say what I know,

734
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:14.420
you know what I would be, I'd be rocking and crying. I'd be, I'd be a bitch.

735
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:16.440
How the fuck do you just sit there? Wait in front of me.

736
00:44:16.441 --> 00:44:19.370
Saw Your fucking head off. Like I know that doesn't happen in Saudi Arabia,

737
00:44:19.371 --> 00:44:21.440
but you know, if you steal something in Saudi Arabia,

738
00:44:21.620 --> 00:44:25.130
they chop your fucking arm off. You know, I don't need that pressure.

739
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.040
You know, I don't fucking need that.

740
00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.730
Somebody just could just throw something in your bag cause they stole it.

741
00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:36.510
Next thing you know, I'm going to Chop Chop Square right? Granted,

742
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:39.500
I don't know shit about any of these countries. All I know is that we've,

743
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:41.970
we've thrown enough rocks at the beehive over there.

744
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:46.020
I don't feel like going over there and getting stung. It said alright Dubai.

745
00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.450
Yeah, I'd love to go to Dubai. Where they got to four,

746
00:44:48.451 --> 00:44:52.740
they got slave labor that built the whole fucking thing and they confiscated

747
00:44:52.741 --> 00:44:55.830
their passports. And the number one cause of death with them is suicide.

748
00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.790
I can't go there and support that shit. That whole fucking city,

749
00:44:59.791 --> 00:45:03.840
it looks like a, like the Kardashians designed it. It's beyond fucking cheesy.

750
00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:08.460
We've got the tallest building in the world, Delia, Kuwait.

751
00:45:08.461 --> 00:45:11.400
I got no problem with that. Saudi Arabia scares me. Dubai,

752
00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.640
when you start paying the people that build the skyscrapers, I'll go there.

753
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:19.770
And uh, Kuwait, uh, you know, I don't know. I mean,

754
00:45:19.771 --> 00:45:22.800
you guys should kinda like us, right? We helped you out in the early nineties.

755
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:27.810
Well, didn't we? I Dunno. I have no idea that part of the world scares me.

756
00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:32.310
I've connected in Dubai when I was coming back from Mumbai, India,

757
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.910
but I just hear all these horrible stories that they promise all these people,

758
00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.980
I'm in Asia, you're going to come over there, there's all these jobs.

759
00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:41.940
You're going to make all this money.

760
00:45:41.941 --> 00:45:44.430
And then they come over and they confiscate their passports and they don't let

761
00:45:44.431 --> 00:45:48.720
them fucking leave. And, uh, they see no way out and they kill themselves.

762
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:50.791
I don't know if that's true.

763
00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:54.150
I don't know if it was that or if that was at Walmart. I forget. All right. Hey,

764
00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:58.010
Billy funk face. There's no guitar on that. Herbie Hancock album, uh,

765
00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.100
the bass player,

766
00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:04.040
the bass is played by Herbie on a synth and Paul Jackson, the basis,

767
00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.990
uh, plays the guitar line on the Higher Register of the base.

768
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:11.040
I never fucking knew that. Love the podcast and stand up. Let's jam some.

769
00:46:11.041 --> 00:46:15.840
See that I made funny. And then what did you do? You taught me something. Um,

770
00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:21.480
all right. X men and sexism, Hey B is for bill.

771
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:25.020
I haven't seen the billboard Rose McGowan is upset about,

772
00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:27.660
and I agree with your assessment on the situation,

773
00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.460
but I think you mischaracterize the effect of displays of male dominance over

774
00:46:32.461 --> 00:46:35.760
women. I mischaracterized it.

775
00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:39.180
Is that a word? Um,

776
00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.630
it's not that someone sees a picture of a man choking out a woman that thinks

777
00:46:42.631 --> 00:46:46.530
it's okay and then goes and does it himself rather.

778
00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:50.820
It's like a piece of a puzzle. It's just one of these fucking agenda people.

779
00:46:50.821 --> 00:46:54.720
Again, a guy sees a picture of a man choking out a woman.

780
00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.630
Then he sees a picture of a man yelling at a woman.

781
00:46:57.870 --> 00:47:02.490
Then he sees a picture of a woman being backhanded by a man. You get the point,

782
00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:03.780
you see how they do this.

783
00:47:03.781 --> 00:47:07.110
You see how he just led me across the fucking river to his side?

784
00:47:07.111 --> 00:47:10.380
Like I'm that fucking stupid. Now I don't get your point.

785
00:47:11.490 --> 00:47:16.110
This is what I understand. A kid fucking sees his parents. Okay?

786
00:47:16.111 --> 00:47:19.680
If the dad beats the shit out of his mom his entire fucking childhood,

787
00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:24.630
I understand that. He'll either not do it or totally fucking do it.

788
00:47:24.631 --> 00:47:25.560
I understand that.

789
00:47:25.561 --> 00:47:28.740
But this whole fucking thing that you see images and then you do shit.

790
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:34.010
Okay, I watched the fucking racing car was red bull on it all day today. I,

791
00:47:34.011 --> 00:47:35.990
there's no fucking way I will ever drink. It.

792
00:47:35.991 --> 00:47:38.750
Certainly would not put it in with some vodka ever.

793
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.330
I have no desire to ever drink that fucking drink.

794
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:46.340
A human beings are way more fucking complex. Then the, uh,

795
00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.310
the, the, the cartoon version, you know what I mean? Like when,

796
00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:54.240
when people have meltdowns and people film it and then like,

797
00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:58.730
you know, people just, Oh, he did that then therefore he is that.

798
00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.890
It's just people are way more complex than that.

799
00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:04.400
And you don't just see a picture of this and then see somebody yelling at this

800
00:48:04.401 --> 00:48:06.300
person and blah blah blah. Oh, that's all it,

801
00:48:06.301 --> 00:48:10.150
it just takes billboards and TV B shows. And then all of,

802
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:13.690
all of the way that I was raised goes out the window.

803
00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.020
I can tell you this, sir. All right.

804
00:48:17.021 --> 00:48:22.021
With the little fucking Fisher price fucking point here that you're making is

805
00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:24.820
when I was a kid,

806
00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:28.780
the amount of violent fucking movies I watched all the Friday the 13th,

807
00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:33.000
I watched all the fucking, uh, nightmare on elm streets.

808
00:48:33.001 --> 00:48:35.010
I watched all the Halloween's Halloween three,

809
00:48:35.011 --> 00:48:37.590
one of the worst fucking movies ever season of the witch.

810
00:48:37.591 --> 00:48:41.170
I watched all of those things. I saw scar face when I was like, what a,

811
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:44.970
how well the fuck Aldo 15. I saw all of that shit.

812
00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.970
Okay. And I can tell you this, I never went out and killed somebody.

813
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.870
So explain that to me. I never hit a woman. I never did any of that,

814
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:54.543
so,

815
00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:56.160
<v 0>okay.</v>

816
00:48:56.160 --> 00:48:59.670
<v 1>I just, it's, I don't agree with that. I don't agree with that.</v>

817
00:48:59.850 --> 00:49:03.150
Having said that, I agreed with them saying that, you know,

818
00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:06.750
you could have picked a better picture. You know what I mean?

819
00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.070
I just looked at the picture. I was like, I don't want,

820
00:49:08.071 --> 00:49:12.360
I don't want to see a woman getting choked. I don't want to see that,

821
00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:14.700
you know, I don't want look at that.

822
00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:19.440
Fast forward to where she breaks out of the choke hold. I'd like to see that.

823
00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:24.070
Um, anyways, let's continue on with this. You get the point. Ugh,

824
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:28.980
I fucking, I can't, I can't, I can't stand people. All right. After a while,

825
00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:34.220
the man sees the overall picture that our culture condones dominance over women.

826
00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:38.010
It's a piece of the larger cultural trend.

827
00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:43.440
This is literally paint by numbers like this.

828
00:49:43.441 --> 00:49:44.940
Is this all the shit that you see on TV?

829
00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.130
This type of thing happened a lot in old movies. Just watch any Humphrey,

830
00:49:50.131 --> 00:49:55.131
good Bogart movie movies can play a huge part in reinforcing gender inequality

831
00:49:55.990 --> 00:50:00.330
in co in a culture. Can I ask you a question dude or lady,

832
00:50:00.331 --> 00:50:04.440
whoever the fuck this is. Do, do you ever see anything else in movies?

833
00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.070
<v 0>Okay.</v>

834
00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:07.600
<v 1>Do you ever see anything else in movies?</v>

835
00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.720
Do you just see what the man does to the woman?

836
00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:15.010
So what about now all these other movies, you know,

837
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:20.640
so then I guess you would then agree that the latest Mad Max was an anti man

838
00:50:22.241 --> 00:50:24.580
movie because I didn't see the movie.

839
00:50:24.581 --> 00:50:28.730
But Evan definitely the Mad Max guy doesn't do and the woman takes the reigns.

840
00:50:28.731 --> 00:50:31.940
So judging that this is the way that you view x men,

841
00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.650
then you must certainly see that the last mad max was obviously,

842
00:50:38.020 --> 00:50:38.260
<v 4>yeah.</v>

843
00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:40.990
<v 1>You know, uh, whatever. Reverse misogynistic.</v>

844
00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:43.810
What is that fucking word for someone who hates men?

845
00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:47.740
I always forget it because it's never used. It's never brought up.

846
00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:50.050
It's just called being a strong woman.

847
00:50:52.810 --> 00:50:54.490
Hatred of men.

848
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:56.573
<v 4>Okay.</v>

849
00:50:56.970 --> 00:51:01.850
<v 1>Misandry I don't know if I'm saying it right. Am I s a. N. D. R. Y. Um,</v>

850
00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:05.160
do you, do you see it as that?

851
00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:09.000
I just don't think people are that simple.

852
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:13.380
I think I really believe that when someone is a little kid,

853
00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:17.880
okay, if they're a little kid and they're in your house and your their parents,

854
00:51:17.881 --> 00:51:22.881
I really believe that whole thing that your words become their thoughts 100% I

855
00:51:23.431 --> 00:51:28.410
don't believe that people like you're with your kid every fucking day of your

856
00:51:28.411 --> 00:51:30.480
kid's life up until when?

857
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:34.740
I don't know the first time they go away for the first 10 12 years before they

858
00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:38.010
ship them off to camp. Or even if you don't do that,

859
00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.630
you could basically be with them almost every fucking day of their life for the

860
00:51:42.631 --> 00:51:45.030
first 15 years of their life. Okay.

861
00:51:45.031 --> 00:51:48.330
And you're telling me that movie,

862
00:51:48.331 --> 00:51:52.170
billboards and movies and that type of shit will undo

863
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:56.740
all of your parenting? I could look,

864
00:51:56.741 --> 00:52:00.040
I can see some shit that you'll see a movie and it makes you want to go out and

865
00:52:00.041 --> 00:52:03.400
fucking, you know, play cowboys and Indians like we did. You know?

866
00:52:03.401 --> 00:52:08.290
But I never really went out and fucking killed anybody. Right.

867
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:13.120
I don't know. I, I don't, I don't agree with that. I don't,

868
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.800
I understand that the images are bad and that type of shit.

869
00:52:15.830 --> 00:52:17.270
I definitely get all of that.

870
00:52:17.271 --> 00:52:21.380
But the fact I can't make that leap that then it's all floating around in my

871
00:52:21.381 --> 00:52:22.490
head. And next thing you know,

872
00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:27.640
I punched my wife in the face and it's not because I'm a bad guy and had a bad

873
00:52:28.011 --> 00:52:29.270
father. It's,

874
00:52:29.620 --> 00:52:33.620
it's because I saw too many movie billboards in scenes in movies.

875
00:52:33.621 --> 00:52:38.480
I t this to make, to give movies that level of fucking power.

876
00:52:38.481 --> 00:52:42.530
I, you know, I don't know. You want to fucking make me go get a beer? Okay.

877
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:46.790
I'll go buy a candy bar, but I just don't see myself, you know,

878
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:50.720
upper cut and some old lady in the food line because I saw the wrong movie.

879
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:54.320
Fucking billboard. I, I disagree with you. Agree to disagree, sir.

880
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.670
Or ma'am. Alright. Fiance's parents are evil.

881
00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:01.773
<v 4>Um,</v>

882
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:05.810
<v 1>but I can't do anything about. All right. Uh, so I'm getting married this month.</v>

883
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:07.670
Super excited to marry the love of my life.

884
00:53:07.671 --> 00:53:10.160
Congratulations by the whole experience.

885
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:13.760
But the whole experience is going to be awkward and weird because their parents

886
00:53:13.761 --> 00:53:18.380
don't like me. Uh, in fact they hate me. Oh Jesus.

887
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:21.620
Uh, I'll not give you the whole what is, she comes from money and you're the,

888
00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:25.440
you're fucking Billy Joel. You an uptown girl. Huh?

889
00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:29.430
You sing it in your garage. Ah, let's see.

890
00:53:29.431 --> 00:53:31.740
I'll not give you the whole convoluted story,

891
00:53:31.741 --> 00:53:34.680
but the upshot is that they're conservative upper class,

892
00:53:34.681 --> 00:53:37.680
highly successful Latin American business types.

893
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:41.100
While I'm in Australian middle-class, lefty arts graduate.

894
00:53:41.101 --> 00:53:43.470
I knew they came from money. Anyway,

895
00:53:43.471 --> 00:53:45.480
we've been together for almost a decade now.

896
00:53:45.481 --> 00:53:50.190
And even though I know they've said horrible things about me behind my back and

897
00:53:50.191 --> 00:53:52.530
tried to talk her into leaving me numerous times,

898
00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:57.000
they've always been pleasant to my face. Oh, that's even worse. That said,

899
00:53:57.001 --> 00:54:00.300
there were a few years there where they didn't talk to either of us after we

900
00:54:00.301 --> 00:54:04.740
told them we wouldn't baptize the hypothetic or children. We still don't have,

901
00:54:06.850 --> 00:54:08.260
uh, but we, we don't mention that.

902
00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:10.393
<v 4>Okay,</v>

903
00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.740
<v 1>so you guys are agnostic or something? I don't know. Basically,</v>

904
00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:19.810
it's going to kill me to have to look at their stupid fucking heads on my

905
00:54:19.810 --> 00:54:23.680
wedding day and we only invited them out of a sense of obligation,

906
00:54:23.830 --> 00:54:26.950
but now it's hitting home. Then I'm actually going to be part of this family.

907
00:54:26.951 --> 00:54:29.620
Now. What I need is a longterm plan of attack.

908
00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:32.410
Just survive the next few decades until they shuffle,

909
00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:34.420
shuffle off this mortal coil.

910
00:54:35.110 --> 00:54:38.830
I know living a happy life with their daughter should all should be all the

911
00:54:38.831 --> 00:54:41.800
revenge I need. But if you saw our father's face,

912
00:54:41.801 --> 00:54:43.980
you'd want to give him the old right there, Fred too.

913
00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:49.480
Guess I need some kind of middle ground. Any advice? Uh, Fanton nuts.

914
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:52.420
I don't even know what that means. Go Fuck Yourself. Come to Australia.

915
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.960
You mentioned that some sort of red nut over there. I have no idea.

916
00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:57.980
<v 4>Um,</v>

917
00:54:57.980 --> 00:55:01.640
<v 1>oh, Joe Barnett just texted me, said smiling like the butcher's dog.</v>

918
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:08.420
Um, good for him. All right. Uh, any advice,

919
00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.510
uh, the most important thing that you said there is that you're realizing that

920
00:55:11.511 --> 00:55:14.330
you're marrying into this family and, uh,

921
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:19.390
that is something that you never really fucking think about enough.

922
00:55:19.670 --> 00:55:23.660
I don't think enough people do until you've got you just picture this person is

923
00:55:23.661 --> 00:55:28.280
going to hold your child someday and want to take the kid to a ballgame.

924
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.820
<v 4>Um,</v>

925
00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:33.940
<v 1>you know, or whatever. So there's there, there is that, but uh,</v>

926
00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:37.650
I dunno if the only way to do it,

927
00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:42.540
I w there's one way you could just try to kill the guy with kindness or he could

928
00:55:42.541 --> 00:55:45.600
just sit down and look at the guy and just say, look man, who's kidding?

929
00:55:45.601 --> 00:55:50.490
Who I know you don't like me. I know you're just being polite, alright.

930
00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:54.630
Out of you know, respect for your daughter or whatever, but you don't,

931
00:55:54.631 --> 00:55:57.360
you don't have to be nice to me anymore. You know,

932
00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:00.090
we can see each other on the holidays or whatever.

933
00:56:00.091 --> 00:56:02.710
Anytime you want to come over. What I don't say that don't say, you know,

934
00:56:02.820 --> 00:56:05.640
when I'm coming over Jesus.

935
00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:07.030
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

936
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:09.460
<v 1>That would drive me nuts. If the guy was being phony nice to me,</v>

937
00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:13.030
I would at some point, you know, have to say to the guy that, listen,

938
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:14.650
you didn't, you don't, maybe it's just say that.

939
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:16.750
Go out golfing with the guy and just say, listen man,

940
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:20.470
I don't want to be any more of a thorn in your side than I already am.

941
00:56:20.471 --> 00:56:24.490
Just know that you don't have to pretend to me. Okay?

942
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:27.070
Then you just fucking walks off the first tee.

943
00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:33.430
Um, I gotta be honest with you, dude, I don't know what to tell these.

944
00:56:33.431 --> 00:56:35.860
These are tough ones, man. This is really fucking,

945
00:56:35.890 --> 00:56:39.700
how close do you live to them? That's another one.

946
00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:45.220
You know, if you guys live a state away and you only see them three,

947
00:56:45.221 --> 00:56:49.510
four times a year, you can tough out a couple of weekends. You know what I mean?

948
00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:54.490
However, if I'm, you know,

949
00:56:54.491 --> 00:56:58.090
if they live right down the fucking street, you know,

950
00:56:58.091 --> 00:56:59.560
and then they don't approve of you.

951
00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:02.860
And then you have a kid and then they're going to question how you bringing it

952
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:04.630
up and they're already getting info. They're already,

953
00:57:04.631 --> 00:57:08.530
I can tell you this sorority way too fucking involved. All right,

954
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:09.491
this is the deal.

955
00:57:09.491 --> 00:57:13.330
You can say whatever the fuck you want about whoever your kids dating until they

956
00:57:13.331 --> 00:57:16.870
get married. Once they get fucking marriage. You've got to back off, you know,

957
00:57:16.871 --> 00:57:18.400
unless it's obviously something horrible,

958
00:57:18.401 --> 00:57:22.000
the person's one person's abused in the other person,

959
00:57:22.001 --> 00:57:23.830
but like they got to back the fuck off.

960
00:57:23.831 --> 00:57:26.800
So maybe you've got to have that conversation. Just be like, listen,

961
00:57:27.220 --> 00:57:28.150
I know you don't like me,

962
00:57:28.151 --> 00:57:32.830
but I love your daughter and she loves me and we got married so you need to deal

963
00:57:32.831 --> 00:57:37.480
with that. Yeah. Fuck him. Yeah, you need to deal with it. We got married.

964
00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:38.200
All right,

965
00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.470
so I don't need any coming over here giving me the fucking stink face in my own

966
00:57:41.471 --> 00:57:45.910
house. All right. You already did it once you do it again.

967
00:57:45.911 --> 00:57:48.100
I'm going to take your head on my stick it right in the fucking ice box.

968
00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.830
All right. And if I fucking had enough of you, yeah. Fuck this guy.

969
00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:55.000
I have no good advice for this for you, sir. I don't know what to tell you.

970
00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:59.260
I just hope it works out, but uh, don't take any shit from the guy.

971
00:58:00.490 --> 00:58:05.080
And when it comes to you and your wife, I would just make jokes about it. Um,

972
00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:07.510
you know, I'd be like, Hey, you know,

973
00:58:07.511 --> 00:58:10.390
I'm going to go hang out with your dad today. She'd be like, really? No,

974
00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:15.220
he hates me. Remember whatever. You know, just keep it light. Um,

975
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:17.890
but don't joke about it too much. Cause then she'll say,

976
00:58:17.891 --> 00:58:18.850
but it really bothers me.

977
00:58:21.260 --> 00:58:22.550
<v 6>Everybody likes each other. Yes</v>

978
00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:26.770
<v 1>sir. Um, I think you're going to be okay, but I'm not,</v>

979
00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:28.460
I'd be lying to you if it's like said,

980
00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:32.710
if I didn't tell you that 17% of me thinks that you're really fucking stepping

981
00:58:32.711 --> 00:58:34.780
into some shit here. But you know what?

982
00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:39.730
Everybody who gets married does so good luck to you. Good luck to you,

983
00:58:39.731 --> 00:58:43.350
but don't take any shit from that guy. I think he can get to the month.

984
00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:46.950
You can get something, you can charm her, right? I bet you can charmer.

985
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:50.500
And once women have more forgiving, right? Until they're not,

986
00:58:50.501 --> 00:58:53.170
and then they'll fucking kill you in your sleep. But generally speaking,

987
00:58:53.171 --> 00:58:55.130
they're fucking more forgiving. And I think if they just,

988
00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:58.300
if she really sees the love between the two year, she could back off.

989
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:01.570
And then that's what you do. You is what you do. You divide and conquer.

990
00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:05.410
Fuck him. All right. I think I'm on his son. Fuck that guy. Make,

991
00:59:05.411 --> 00:59:08.620
make her mom love you. All right. That's it.

992
00:59:08.770 --> 00:59:11.980
And then she'll start nagging at him and he'll either go one or two ways.

993
00:59:11.981 --> 00:59:15.460
He'll either given and eventually like year or two, he'll,

994
00:59:15.461 --> 00:59:18.550
it'll fucking eat him up. It'll die sooner. All right.

995
00:59:18.551 --> 00:59:22.150
Jesus had to go all the way to their building. It was evidently a dead.

996
00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:26.770
All right, last one. Here we go. Dating an older guy. Oh, geesh.

997
00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:32.210
Um, hey bill. I'm a 22 year old female from Slovenia, Slovenia, modal.

998
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:35.830
Thank you for the podcast. It makes me laugh out loud. Uh,

999
00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:38.570
which not many things can do. That's fucking great.

1000
00:59:38.870 --> 00:59:42.860
I would love to go over there at some point also that eastern European tour is

1001
00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:47.270
gonna fucking happen. I just have to have time in my schedule. Um,

1002
00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:52.520
cause all of those countries I've never been to from fucking Lithuania and

1003
00:59:52.521 --> 00:59:56.300
fucking historia whatever the fucking that other one is up there all the way

1004
00:59:56.301 --> 00:59:58.820
down through Romania and back up.

1005
00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:04.300
All I know is if I can fucking somehow get over in and see all those countries,

1006
01:00:04.731 --> 01:00:08.000
get a bunch of different stamps on my passport, I'm into that shit.

1007
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:11.750
Plus every one of those places like Prague or something has all those a art

1008
01:00:11.751 --> 01:00:15.170
deco, all that art deco furniture that all places over here.

1009
01:00:15.171 --> 01:00:19.610
They order it from for nothing and then Jack it up over here. What do I do?

1010
01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:22.430
Buy a desk over there and then ship it fucking around the world.

1011
01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.330
Like I'm going to save any money. That's a stupid idea. Anyways,

1012
01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:29.690
I'm 22 years of, okay. I would love to hear you taking my situation.

1013
01:00:29.691 --> 01:00:34.460
I'm a university student and I play sports professionally here in Slovenia.

1014
01:00:35.030 --> 01:00:37.160
Uh, keeping busy, working out about eight times a week.

1015
01:00:37.161 --> 01:00:41.900
My first coach since I was like 12 years old is now my really close friend.

1016
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:46.160
Oh my God, his name is in woody. Is it? Uh,

1017
01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:51.170
he since moved onto cow coach internationally. I almost said coach,

1018
01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:53.810
coach internationally, but we still keep in touch.

1019
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:57.380
He knows me from when I was a little girl and he used to always tell me I was

1020
01:00:57.381 --> 01:01:02.240
like his younger sister, but I, but recently I noticed he switched his approach.

1021
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:07.670
Gross. He's a 35 year old single guy. Uh, my God,

1022
01:01:07.671 --> 01:01:10.520
the fucking red flags, I can barely see the type here anymore.

1023
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:15.590
And he only comes to Sylvania and July through August's we were always able to

1024
01:01:15.591 --> 01:01:16.670
talk for hours,

1025
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.900
tell failed attempts at dating to each other and generally get along better than

1026
01:01:20.901 --> 01:01:23.510
I have ever gotten along with anybody in my life. So far.

1027
01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:27.650
He's always makes me laugh, complements my personality and how good I look,

1028
01:01:27.770 --> 01:01:30.950
but never in a creepy or disturbing way. Okay. All right.

1029
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.840
My experience with guys my age was never like that.

1030
01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:38.330
I'm not trying to say I'm too mature for them,

1031
01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:42.860
but I would always compare them to him and they would mostly bore me and

1032
01:01:42.861 --> 01:01:45.830
connection was never there as much as it is with him.

1033
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:48.290
I feel like boys my age are pushovers.

1034
01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:52.860
At least those I had experiences with and I feel they couldn't offer me in a

1035
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:57.270
relationship more than this older guy offers me and just a friendship. Uh,

1036
01:01:57.710 --> 01:02:00.830
yeah. And also when you're 35, this guy's going to be 50,

1037
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:05.110
so there's also that and then you're still gonna want to go out and he's going

1038
01:02:05.111 --> 01:02:08.000
to be ready for nap time. So, uh,

1039
01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:13.250
no. That too. You know, he's 35. He's almost out of the league.

1040
01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.020
If you're an athlete, you know what I mean? 35,

1041
01:02:15.021 --> 01:02:17.990
that's when you're going to start taking the illegal drug drugs, you know,

1042
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:22.860
to hang around for an extra couple of seasons. Right. Anyways, she says.

1043
01:02:22.861 --> 01:02:23.221
Anyways,

1044
01:02:23.221 --> 01:02:27.090
we are hanging out a lot during this summer and I feel more and more vibes and

1045
01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:30.420
attempts from him. He takes me out to eat and drink.

1046
01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:35.730
He is always asking me somewhere. I, I know he's putting the moves on me.

1047
01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:40.110
My issue is that I, now I know we are in different stages of our lives.

1048
01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.110
I know he wants to get married and have children to fuck this guy.

1049
01:02:43.111 --> 01:02:45.480
Fuck this guy. Fuck this guy yet.

1050
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:48.120
22 you got the whole life ahead of you.

1051
01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:52.440
When the fuck did he start hitting on you then? Now this isn't fair.

1052
01:02:52.441 --> 01:02:55.080
This is like shooting fish in a barrel. You've known him since he was,

1053
01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:59.370
you were 12 no, no, no. Stay away from this guy.

1054
01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:06.510
This is how I know this guy's a creep. Cause even I wouldn't do this.

1055
01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.280
Okay. Fucking walk away sir.

1056
01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:15.850
Stand down. I most certainly am not ready for anything like that. Uh, children,

1057
01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:18.420
all that shit. She's saying, I like to go. I like to drink.

1058
01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:23.310
Go out my friends getting compliments from guys all to soothe my self esteem,

1059
01:03:23.311 --> 01:03:25.680
which is not fully developed yet. Exactly.

1060
01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.000
I'm still finding myself and I know you will interpret this as I want to fuck

1061
01:03:30.001 --> 01:03:32.910
around. No I don't, but this is not really the case.

1062
01:03:32.911 --> 01:03:37.020
I actually want to find a right person and fall in love. Well,

1063
01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:38.520
you're very mature for your age. Actually.

1064
01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:43.290
22 I'm dodging his attempts and usually laugh him off when he puts the moves on

1065
01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:45.770
me. Get away from this guy. I don't want to read this.

1066
01:03:45.771 --> 01:03:50.700
This is making me uncomfortable, Yada, Yada, Yada, Yada, Yada, Yada.

1067
01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:53.160
I don't give a fuck. Fuck this shit. Fuck this. She said,

1068
01:03:53.161 --> 01:03:55.500
sorry if that was hard to read. My English is a little rusty.

1069
01:03:55.501 --> 01:03:59.700
Your English is tremendous. Um, yeah. Stay away from this guy. All right.

1070
01:04:00.610 --> 01:04:01.770
Um, I can't even,

1071
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:07.190
that was so disturbing to me that I can't remember if he's still currently your

1072
01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:12.360
coach. Um, anyways, a film of vines. Wait a minute, wait.

1073
01:04:12.361 --> 01:04:15.420
Where the fuck is this thing? I gotta find my first coach since I was 12.

1074
01:04:15.570 --> 01:04:18.450
He sends, move on to coast internationally, but we still keep in touch.

1075
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:23.490
All right. I don't know when the fuck he moved on. Uh, but w was he, he's,

1076
01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.780
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Fuck that. All right. Listen,

1077
01:04:27.870 --> 01:04:30.000
this is what you got to hold onto. Okay.

1078
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:32.760
The fact that you feel the way that you do when you're 22 years old,

1079
01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.760
there is somebody out there your age that is like you.

1080
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.680
And if it was easy to go out and find love, everybody would find it.

1081
01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:43.920
All right? But the problem is, is you know, you gotta,

1082
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:48.480
you gotta go through a bunch of mistakes first. All right?

1083
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:52.050
So, um, I don't know you, I don't know him,

1084
01:04:52.051 --> 01:04:55.200
but this is not the person you're going to settle down. Don't,

1085
01:04:55.201 --> 01:04:58.380
don't fucking do this. Don't do it. Alright.

1086
01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.810
He's got way,

1087
01:05:00.811 --> 01:05:04.980
way too much of a mental advantage on you at 35 and 22 and he could really

1088
01:05:04.981 --> 01:05:06.720
fucking hurt you. Um,

1089
01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:11.750
I say you deal with the fact that you find guys your age are not mature and um,

1090
01:05:12.750 --> 01:05:16.410
you're gonna run to somebody who is, you sound like you're really good looking.

1091
01:05:16.411 --> 01:05:19.810
You're into sports, right? You're getting these compliments when you go out.

1092
01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:23.770
So you probably have like these fucking a Yolo Douche is hitting on you.

1093
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:28.240
What you need. You know what you need. You need a nerd. I think you need a nerd.

1094
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.990
Go find some fucking kid that likes to read. You know,

1095
01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:34.300
cause he probably has an idea to build an app.

1096
01:05:34.330 --> 01:05:37.330
Whatever these fucking kids are doing, that's what you want to do. You know?

1097
01:05:37.450 --> 01:05:42.030
And I go fuck around with your 35 year old. Creepy. He are.

1098
01:05:42.031 --> 01:05:45.280
I really want to get married and have kids. Oh, Delia though.

1099
01:05:45.281 --> 01:05:49.030
Yet that's why you hitting on a 22 year old you piece of shit are fuck that guy.

1100
01:05:49.150 --> 01:05:53.410
Fuck that guy. All right. Uh, I would uh, yeah,

1101
01:05:53.411 --> 01:05:55.720
stick with people your own roughly your own age. All right.

1102
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:58.450
That's coming from an older creep like me. So you know what's good advice.

1103
01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:02.570
All right. That's the podcast for this week. I hope you guys enjoyed it. And uh,

1104
01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:05.740
congratulations to a Pittsburgh penguins fans and you know what?

1105
01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.510
Also the San Jose sharks fans. I know,

1106
01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:11.740
I've been there plenty of times seeing the Bruins lose and finals to all those

1107
01:06:11.741 --> 01:06:16.510
great Edmonton teams. Um, so my condolences,

1108
01:06:16.511 --> 01:06:19.510
but hey, you actually got to the finals and you've got a great team to build on.

1109
01:06:20.170 --> 01:06:24.850
Um, and that's it. One down, one to go, the NBA ends. And uh,

1110
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.550
I guess I'll start watching a little bit of baseball, but um,

1111
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:30.610
I think I'm going to stick with the Formula One racing until I get to football

1112
01:06:30.611 --> 01:06:33.530
season. We'll see what's up. All right, that's it. Go fuck yourselves.

1113
01:06:33.640 --> 01:06:35.230
Then I'll check ed audio on Thursday.
