so when the android framework goes to

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120
so when the android framework goes to
 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.150
so when the android framework goes to
start your application from launcher

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160
start your application from launcher
 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.000
start your application from launcher
icon or an app shortcut or what you see

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010
icon or an app shortcut or what you see
 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.190
icon or an app shortcut or what you see
when you're doing multi window those are

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200
when you're doing multi window those are
 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.430
when you're doing multi window those are
all activities right so they really are

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440
all activities right so they really are
 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.040
all activities right so they really are
kind of the entry point into your apps

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050
kind of the entry point into your apps
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.740
kind of the entry point into your apps
UI right when the user goes to launch

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750
UI right when the user goes to launch
 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.900
UI right when the user goes to launch
your app they're launching an activity

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910
 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.160
what you actually want is you want to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170
what you actually want is you want to
 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.980
what you actually want is you want to
build the layering you actually need so

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
build the layering you actually need so
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.430
build the layering you actually need so
in this case we can have multiple things

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440
in this case we can have multiple things
 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.080
in this case we can have multiple things
multiple destinations within an activity

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
multiple destinations within an activity
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.420
multiple destinations within an activity
right and share information across each

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430
right and share information across each
 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.450
right and share information across each
of these destinations by using the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
of these destinations by using the
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.340
of these destinations by using the
activity scope as an actual useful

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350
activity scope as an actual useful
 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.500
activity scope as an actual useful
element now so for example you could

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510
element now so for example you could
 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.709
element now so for example you could
have a shared view element or view model

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
have a shared view element or view model
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.250
have a shared view element or view model
that both destinations talk to so one

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
that both destinations talk to so one
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.350
that both destinations talk to so one
destination could put data in and the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
destination could put data in and the
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.150
destination could put data in and the
other one could observe changes to that

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
other one could observe changes to that
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.880
other one could observe changes to that
data right you don't need to work at the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890
data right you don't need to work at the
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.850
data right you don't need to work at the
application scope level for this to work

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860
 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.590
what we're thinking about this like if

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600
what we're thinking about this like if
 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.890
what we're thinking about this like if
we're moving from this activity world to

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900
we're moving from this activity world to
 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.600
we're moving from this activity world to
a destination role we really want to

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610
a destination role we really want to
 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.789
a destination role we really want to
make that world as easy as possible

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
make that world as easy as possible
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.410
make that world as easy as possible
right otherwise why it would be moved

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
right otherwise why it would be moved
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.020
right otherwise why it would be moved
and we focused on kind of two things one

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030
and we focused on kind of two things one
 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.320
and we focused on kind of two things one
was the global UI kind of thing like how

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330
was the global UI kind of thing like how
 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.810
was the global UI kind of thing like how
can we make that part easy right like

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
can we make that part easy right like
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.670
can we make that part easy right like
it's something that every app kind of

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680
it's something that every app kind of
 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.069
it's something that every app kind of
has the same kind of patterns and we

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079
has the same kind of patterns and we
 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.899
has the same kind of patterns and we
really don't want that to be something

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
really don't want that to be something
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.260
really don't want that to be something
that takes a lot of effort to do

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
that takes a lot of effort to do
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.010
that takes a lot of effort to do
also the navigating between destinations

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
also the navigating between destinations
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.560
also the navigating between destinations
right that start activity activity

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
right that start activity activity
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.929
right that start activity activity
compat thing can we make that even

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939
compat thing can we make that even
 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.440
compat thing can we make that even
easier so we started the navigation

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
easier so we started the navigation
 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.600
easier so we started the navigation
architecture component and we introduced

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610
architecture component and we introduced
 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.480
architecture component and we introduced
it to you all in IO this last year in

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
it to you all in IO this last year in
 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.340
it to you all in IO this last year in
2018

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350
 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.200
if you have arguments to something how

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210
if you have arguments to something how
 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.460
if you have arguments to something how
do we make this nice so we built a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470
do we make this nice so we built a
 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.710
do we make this nice so we built a
cradle plugin called safeguards which

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720
cradle plugin called safeguards which
 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.200
cradle plugin called safeguards which
for every destination in your graph such

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210
for every destination in your graph such
 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.720
for every destination in your graph such
as this main fragment we generate a

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
as this main fragment we generate a
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.270
as this main fragment we generate a
directions object which has a nice

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280
directions object which has a nice
 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.330
directions object which has a nice
simple show profile method which gives

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340
simple show profile method which gives
 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.570
simple show profile method which gives
you a directions object with typesafe

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580
you a directions object with typesafe
 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.580
you a directions object with typesafe
arguments that you define in your

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590
arguments that you define in your
 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.320
arguments that you define in your
navigation graph and then you just call

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330
navigation graph and then you just call
 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.290
navigation graph and then you just call
a navigate and that's it will take care

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300
a navigate and that's it will take care
 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.150
a navigate and that's it will take care
of all of the fragment transaction and

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160
of all of the fragment transaction and
 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.000
of all of the fragment transaction and
all of that sort of stuff for you so

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010
all of that sort of stuff for you so
 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.250
all of that sort of stuff for you so
this makes a lot easier so rule number

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260
this makes a lot easier so rule number
 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.680
this makes a lot easier so rule number
one of testing things at the destination

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690
one of testing things at the destination
 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.830
one of testing things at the destination
level is don't test the destination

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840
level is don't test the destination
 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.449
level is don't test the destination
level it's really the number one thing

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459
level it's really the number one thing
 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.910
level it's really the number one thing
with testing right is making things nice

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920
with testing right is making things nice
 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.550
with testing right is making things nice
and separate and extracting some of that

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560
and separate and extracting some of that
 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.949
and separate and extracting some of that
business logic out of a destination and

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959
business logic out of a destination and
 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.260
business logic out of a destination and
into something you can test in isolation

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270
into something you can test in isolation
 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.840
into something you can test in isolation
so how can we do this

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850
so how can we do this
 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.040
so how can we do this
so last this Monday we released fragment

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050
so last this Monday we released fragment
 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.490
so last this Monday we released fragment
1.1 the first alpha and with this became

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500
1.1 the first alpha and with this became
 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.710
1.1 the first alpha and with this became
a new artifact called fragment testing

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720
a new artifact called fragment testing
 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.340
a new artifact called fragment testing
which is about like six years overdue

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350
which is about like six years overdue
 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.670
which is about like six years overdue
and it's really around being able to

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680
and it's really around being able to
 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.810
and it's really around being able to
test your Android X fragments in

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820
test your Android X fragments in
 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.640
test your Android X fragments in
isolation right separate from an

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650
isolation right separate from an
 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.380
isolation right separate from an
activity separate from everything else

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390
activity separate from everything else
 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.720
activity separate from everything else
but being able to test and verify that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730
but being able to test and verify that
 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.210
but being able to test and verify that
that fragment is doing the right thing

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220
 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.509
we have unlockable layer right one of

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519
we have unlockable layer right one of
 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.340
we have unlockable layer right one of
the things that we found when building

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350
the things that we found when building
 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.759
the things that we found when building
navigation is that most companies once

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769
navigation is that most companies once
 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.620
navigation is that most companies once
they got to a certain point and they're

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630
they got to a certain point and they're
 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.180
they got to a certain point and they're
like wow we should add some testing and

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190
like wow we should add some testing and
 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.039
like wow we should add some testing and
they're like wow we can't really test

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049
they're like wow we can't really test
 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.750
they're like wow we can't really test
start activities so they built their own

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760
start activities so they built their own
 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.539
start activities so they built their own
navigator which just provides a layer to

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549
navigator which just provides a layer to
 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.120
navigator which just provides a layer to
mock out the start activity calls

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130
mock out the start activity calls
 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:01.150
mock out the start activity calls
well that that layer is handled for you

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160
well that that layer is handled for you
 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.370
well that that layer is handled for you
it's called nav controller we test nav

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380
it's called nav controller we test nav
 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.190
it's called nav controller we test nav
controller so now what we can do in our

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200
controller so now what we can do in our
 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.800
controller so now what we can do in our
activities is just mock out that nav

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810
activities is just mock out that nav
 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.200
activities is just mock out that nav
controller and

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210
controller and
 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.210
controller and
confirm that yes you're calling the

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220
confirm that yes you're calling the
 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.950
confirm that yes you're calling the
right navigate pulse you can't actually

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:17.960
right navigate pulse you can't actually
 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.790
right navigate pulse you can't actually
do constructor injection into fragments

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:20.800
do constructor injection into fragments
 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.860
do constructor injection into fragments
right you no longer need to only have a

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:23.870
right you no longer need to only have a
 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.130
right you no longer need to only have a
no arcs constructor to use fragments you

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140
no arcs constructor to use fragments you
 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.990
no arcs constructor to use fragments you
can use a fragment factory to

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000
can use a fragment factory to
 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.570
