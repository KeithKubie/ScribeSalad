The next question we had was about internationalization and localization.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
A lot of our students are all across the world. How do we support something on that scale?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's actually not that hard. The hardest part is doing the translation.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
There's a package you can use called gettext,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and this is built into Python in most major languages.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Basically what you do is in your templates, you either put all of your strings in one place,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in one module, and in your templates, and in that module you--

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I think in Python, the function that we use looks like an underscore,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and you just put all your strings inside this underscore function.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Then you just have a separate file that's a database of all of the--for in our case,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
English language strings to whatever language and then your website just kind of works.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Well, you'll basically say, "Here's the language I want to use,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and here is where I store all my translation files."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And then everything will just kind of translate on its own.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Basically, Google for gettext Python,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and you will see a whole bunch of information.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And we'll include some links on that in the office hours instructor comments

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
just to help you guys out. &gt;&gt;Great. Great. That's why he's here.
