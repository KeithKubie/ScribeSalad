00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.164
[MUSIC]

00:00:02.164 --> 00:00:02.709
I read the letter.

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:04.173
[MUSIC]

00:00:04.173 --> 00:00:05.926
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
[LAUGH]

00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:07.032
[MUSIC]

00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:07.847
&gt;&gt; I think I started screaming.

00:00:07.847 --> 00:00:11.133
&gt;&gt; As soon as I read the word,
congratulations, I just stop reading.

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.883
&gt;&gt; My mom was with me,
we were both cheering.

00:00:12.883 --> 00:00:14.280
&gt;&gt; It was just like dream come true.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.998
&gt;&gt; For me personally,
I wanted to study business but

00:00:16.998 --> 00:00:18.819
with a more technological edge.

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:23.205
&gt;&gt; I'm learning industry level skills,
that's a headstart, that's an advantage.

00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:27.223
&gt;&gt; My parents were with me on Move-In day.

00:00:27.223 --> 00:00:29.009
&gt;&gt; I still miss them everyday and
my brother.

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.024
I can't forget you.

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:33.415
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; They got to see where I was going and

00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:34.528
they could have faith that
I was at a good place.

00:00:34.528 --> 00:00:36.053
&gt;&gt; Orientation week
definitely helped a lot.

00:00:36.053 --> 00:00:37.601
&gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to explore.

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:38.719
&gt;&gt; Ask questions.

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:40.401
&gt;&gt; Meet as many people as you can.

00:00:40.401 --> 00:00:42.495
&gt;&gt; My best friends were
from orientation week.

00:00:42.495 --> 00:00:44.898
&gt;&gt; I had to tell myself
to just soak it all in.

00:00:44.898 --> 00:00:46.055
Just embrace the awkward.

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:50.591
&gt;&gt; My best advice to you is-
&gt;&gt; Go to an event as soon as you find one.

00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:52.418
&gt;&gt; Work hard but also play hard.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:55.285
&gt;&gt; If you want to try something new go for
it, if that doesn't work out then try for

00:00:55.285 --> 00:00:55.945
something else.

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:57.193
&gt;&gt; There's so many possibilities.

00:00:57.193 --> 00:00:58.493
&gt;&gt; Build Hackathon.

00:00:58.493 --> 00:00:59.711
&gt;&gt; Fraternities and sororities.

00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:00.848
&gt;&gt; B Flat Singers.

00:01:00.848 --> 00:01:03.223
&gt;&gt; Even the ballroom dance
team if you're interested.

00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:05.630
&gt;&gt; Community service is a way for
me to take a step back,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.007
look at what's going around
me not just at myself.

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:11.271
&gt;&gt; What I really get my memories
from are these extracurriculars and

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.763
the friends that I've made.

00:01:12.763 --> 00:01:13.987
&gt;&gt; You're among the brightest people.

00:01:13.987 --> 00:01:16.660
&gt;&gt; We're all driven and
we're also passionate.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.191
There's just really a sense
of cooperativeness.

00:01:19.191 --> 00:01:21.383
&gt;&gt; There are always people around
who are gonna support you.

00:01:21.383 --> 00:01:23.477
&gt;&gt; The faculty have always been there for
me.

00:01:23.477 --> 00:01:25.969
I can go to them after class and
just talk to them.

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.172
Not even just about class, but about life.

00:01:28.172 --> 00:01:29.544
&gt;&gt; That's the culture of CNU.

00:01:29.544 --> 00:01:30.578
I'm an advocate.

00:01:30.578 --> 00:01:31.753
&gt;&gt; I'm an entrepreneur.

00:01:31.753 --> 00:01:34.233
&gt;&gt; I'm a code breaker,
because I break all my code.

00:01:34.233 --> 00:01:36.832
&gt;&gt; If you're afraid of making mistakes,
don't be.

00:01:36.832 --> 00:01:39.270
&gt;&gt; All of my successes come after failure.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.478
How you pick yourself up
is what's really important.

00:01:41.478 --> 00:01:43.300
&gt;&gt; CNU has made me
a completely different person.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.748
&gt;&gt; When I walk across campus,
I feel like I'm at home.

00:01:45.748 --> 00:01:49.665
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of space here for
creativity, for excitement.

00:01:49.665 --> 00:01:51.265
&gt;&gt; People are building, creating.

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:52.344
&gt;&gt; Anything is possible.

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:54.307
&gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to
diverge from you path.

00:01:54.307 --> 00:01:57.771
&gt;&gt; Whatever you do, just give your all,
no matter what the outcome might be.

00:01:57.771 --> 00:01:59.291
My heart is in the work.

00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:00.532
&gt;&gt; My heart is in the work.

00:02:00.532 --> 00:02:02.527
&gt;&gt; My heart is in the work.
