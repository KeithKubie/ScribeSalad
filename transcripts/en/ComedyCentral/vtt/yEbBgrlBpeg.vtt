Hey, welcome back.
Now, earlier we were talking

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:08.841
about the continuing
water crisis in Flint, Michigan,

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:11.411
and how the governor has been
completely blowing the response.

00:00:11.444 --> 00:00:13.212
In fact, he's been
screwing up so bad,

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.782
Beyoncé just released a
concept album about what he did.

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:18.451
(laughter, groans)

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:21.854
But here's the thing.

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:23.389
<i> Lemonade?</i>
 Couple of<i> Lemonade</i> fans?

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:25.391
Okay, yeah.
But here's the thing.

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.393
Despite the continued
incompetence from the top,

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.195
the story does have
a few heroes.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:32.598
We might still be in the dark
about Flint if not for the work

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.834
of a few committed scientists
and doctors. For example...

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.370
NEWSMAN:<i> Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha,
 Director of Pediatrics</i>

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.372
<i> at the Hurley Medical Center
 in Flint,</i>

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.407
<i> was one of the first
 to sound the alarm.</i>

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.042
<i> But when she released
 her findings</i>

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.444
<i> in September of 2015...</i>

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.212
HANNA-ATTISHA:
<i> Right away we were attacked.</i>

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:47.980
We were told we were wrong,

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:49.982
that we were
"unfortunate researchers."

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.151
"Unfortunate researchers"?

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.053
That's a terrible thing
to be called.

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:56.856
But it will be an awesome name
for her eventual Oscar-winning

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.592
<i> -biopic. </i>
-(laughter)

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:02.228
<i> You gonna crush it!</i>

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.564
Yeah! But in covering
this story,

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.566
I have to say
I've been so impressed

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.601
by the work that
Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha has done

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:11.437
for her community, and I just
had to have her on our show.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.140

for all your dedication

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:39.198
Um, uh, tell me how
you first started to realize

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:41.134
that something was wrong there.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.668 line:0%
Well, we were hearing reports

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:44.670 line:0%
that there was lead
in the water,

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:46.305 line:0%
-Mm-hmm.
-so an amazing researcher,

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:48.674 line:0%
Marc Edwards from Virginia Tech,
drove up to Flint

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:50.877 line:0%
-Uh-huh. -from Blacksburg,
Virginia, to research the water,

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.212 line:0%
and he was telling us that
there was lead in the water.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:55.615 line:0%
And when pediatricians hear
about lead anywhere,

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:57.617 line:0%
-Right.
-we kind of freak out.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.785
-Yeah. -It's
an irreversible neurotoxin.

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:02.555
You don't mess with lead,
and you don't mess with kids.

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:04.957
Right. It's like, there's lead
in those Band-Aids! What?!

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.125
(laughter)

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:08.828
-So, um, so we decided
to do the research -Mm-hmm.

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.596
to see if that lead in the water

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.698
-was getting into the bodies
of our children. -Right.

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.000
Um, and it was.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:16.068
-Yeah. -So, uh,
we looked back on our records,

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.638
and we noticed that
after that water switched,

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:20.773
the percentage of kids
with elevated levels

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.875
-doubled in the city of Flint.
-Wow.

00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:24.977
And when you
first saw those results,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.646
what was your first reaction?

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.648
You know, I...
I wasn't surprised,

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.650
-Mm-hmm.
-because it didn't take a doctor

00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:33.352
-or a rocket scientist
to figure this out. -Yeah.

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:36.923
General Motors had stopped using
this water in October of 2014

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.925
-'cause it was corroding
engine parts. -Hmm.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.827
-(audience groaning) -So...
it's corroding engine parts,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.563
but okay for our kids.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.831
-Yeah. -Uh,
so all the clues were there.

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.067
So we weren't surprised
but we were sad,

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.069
-because it's 2016...
-Right.

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:52.071
Flint is in the middle 
of the Great Lakes.

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:54.006
It's, like, the largest source
of fresh water

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:56.075
-in the world. In the world!
-Yes. Thank you.

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:57.977
-In the world.
-(applause)

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.345
And, uh...

00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:01.914
and-and how did you... how
did you release those findings?

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:03.849
Didn't you have, like,
a press... a press conference...

00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:05.618
-Yeah. So, you know...
-You couldn't just send

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.919
the memo, I guess, right?

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:08.921 line:0%
No. So, yeah, medical research
is always released

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:10.423 line:0%
-in press conferences.
-Yes, I know.

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.158 line:0%
No, no. You see,
we publish journals,

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.759 line:0%
-publish articles in journals.
But... -Sure.

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:16.629 line:0%
we had a professional,
a moral and ethical obligation

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:18.664 line:0%
to share this
as soon as possible,

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:21.167 line:0%
to alert our families,
our pregnant moms, our babies,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.702 line:0%
-Yeah.
-to stop using this water.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.770
So we had a press conference
in last September.

00:03:24.803 --> 00:03:26.739
What was the reaction to you,
uh, after that?

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:28.808
-You know, I felt good for,
like, two minutes. -Good?

00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:30.843
For two minutes I felt good,
I'm like, "Yeah,

00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:32.211
-Right.
-we saved our city!" You know?

00:03:32.244 --> 00:03:34.780
-But the haters...
-But hey, yeah, so just like

00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:38.884
the amazing citizens of Flint
were dismissed for 18 months,

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:41.153
just like the researchers
were dismissed, the moms,

00:03:41.186 --> 00:03:42.822
the pastors, we were dismissed.

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:44.557
So I was called
an "unfortunate researcher,"

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.026
-Yeah. -which is a great title
for my new book.

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.127
-(laughter)
-Um...

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.563
-Exactly. We said the movie,
too. Yeah. -Yeah.

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:51.998
-(cheering, applause)
-It is.

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:54.033
-Um, so...
-"Unfortunate Researcher"!

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:55.434
What did they mean by that?

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:57.436
-So, uh...
-Did they have an explanation?

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.572
Yeah, the direct quote, I think,
was, uh, you know,

00:03:59.605 --> 00:04:01.374
"She may not be irresponsible,

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.376
but she's
an unfortunate researcher."

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.378
Uh, I was ca...
they said I was...

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:07.346
they said I was causing
near hysteria,

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.815
-Uh-huh. Oh, my God. -that I was
splicing and dicing numbers,

00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:12.084
and that the state's numbers
were not consistent

00:04:12.117 --> 00:04:13.586
with my numbers.

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:15.221
And when you proved them wrong?

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:18.024
-Uh... -Did you get a...
did you get a, "Oh, we're sorry,

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.992
-unfortunate researcher"?
-(laughter)

00:04:20.025 --> 00:04:22.461
So yeah, I got many apologies,
and I don't...

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:23.763
-Uh-huh.
-I don't care about that.

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:25.831
-So I don't care about what
happened. -Sure, sure, sure.

00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:27.867
You know, I care about...
I care about the kids

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.769
-Right. -in our community
and what's gonna happen next.

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:31.537
Okay, yeah, I know...
That's great.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.106
-(cheering, applause)
-Right. Uh...

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:36.709
What do you think... uh,
what do you think should happen

00:04:36.742 --> 00:04:38.144
to Governor Snyder?

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:40.279
-So.. -Or let me put it
a different way.

00:04:40.312 --> 00:04:42.515
-Which type of execution...
-(laughter)

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:44.083
No, no, no. Horrible thing.

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.585 line:0%
So, you know,
I was tortured as a child.

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:49.221 line:0%
-Yeah. -So, my brother made me
watch a lot of<i> Star Trek.</i>

00:04:49.254 --> 00:04:50.790 line:0%
-And, uh...
-That was your torture?

00:04:50.823 --> 00:04:53.926 line:0%
-That was my torture. -That's
a fun kind of torture, actually.

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:55.928
-So, Dr. McCoy on<i> Star Trek,</i>
 -Yes.

00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:58.331
he has a line-- he's like,
"I'm not a prosecutor,

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:00.766
I'm a doctor." So I have
to work with this governor,

00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:03.235
-Yes. -and I have to work
with the next five governors.

00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:04.904
-Yes. -When you understand
the consequences of that...

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:07.406
But if I were to give you
a large sack of nickels

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.976
-and he were unconscious...
-(laughter)

00:05:12.144 --> 00:05:14.113
-(applause, shouts)
-All right, one more question.

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:16.382
All right, uh, you know, now...

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:19.385
