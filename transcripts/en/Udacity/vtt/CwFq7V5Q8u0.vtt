00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.350
The answer is 1.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.022
Since the prototype object does have the property,

00:00:04.022 --> 00:00:05.930
the lookup ultimately succeeds.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.010
It falls through rose and then is satisfied on the gold object.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.880
And passed out as if the rose object had the property the whole time.
