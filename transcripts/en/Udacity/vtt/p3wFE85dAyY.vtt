00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.710
Now, it would be great to see for

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.590
yourself that these embeddings
are clustering together as you'd expect.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.360
One way to see it,
is by doing a nearest neighbor lookup

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.800
of the words that are closest
to any given word.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.820
Another way is to try to reduce the
dimensionality of the embedding space

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.280
down to two dimensions, and to plug
the two dimensional representation.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.670
If you do that the native way, for

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.000
example using PCA,
you basically get a mush.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.780
You lose too much
information in the process.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.390
What you need is a way of projecting
that preserves the neighborhood

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.260
structure of your data.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.850
Things that are close in the embedding
space should remain close to the ends,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.020
things that are far should
be far away from each other.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.310
One very effective technique that
does exactly that is called t-SNE.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.250
You'll get to play with this
visualization technique in

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.820
the assignment
