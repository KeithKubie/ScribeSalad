00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.340
”There's a book called
‘A Dictionary of Angels’.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.040
No one has opened it in fifty years,
I know, because when I did,

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.830
The covers creaked, the pages
Crumbled.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.070
There I discovered

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.750
The angels were once as plentiful
As species of flies.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.490
The sky at dusk
Used to be thick with them.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.990
You had to wave both arms
Just to keep them away.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.320
Now the sun is shining
Through the tall windows.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.930
The library is a quiet place.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.780
Angels and gods huddled
In dark unopened books.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.370
The great secret lies
On some shelf Miss Jones

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.860
Passes every day on her rounds.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.190
She's very tall, so she keeps
Her head tipped as if listening.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.280
The books are whispering.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.400
I hear nothing, but she does.“
 [–Charles Simic, “In the Library”]
