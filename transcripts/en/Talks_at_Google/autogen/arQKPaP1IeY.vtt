[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.200
LAURA MURPHY: Rebecca comes
to us live from Standby.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.460
Quick show of hands--

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.730
who in this room has actually
been to the Standby yet?

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.230
It's so--

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.480
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.930
LAURA MURPHY: Oh.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:15.610
Oh my gosh.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.890
Overwhelming.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:16.170
REBECCA LAMALFA: Thank you.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.570
LAURA MURPHY: Me too.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.950
Me too.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.480
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yay.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.900
LAURA MURPHY: Love it.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.650
It's so good.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.700
It's unbelievable.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.950
Thank you so much for
being a part of sort

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.310
of the revitalization that's
happening with all of Detroit

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.610
and the eateries as well.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.005
Big, as you can tell--

00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:29.630
crowd favorite.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.570
I didn't even realize that many
people had been there already.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.120
But a couple more
cool and interesting

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.170
facts about Rebecca.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.150
And then, I promise
I'll stop talking

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:39.410
and let you do more talking.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.540
So she's California native.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.400
I think probably the
most notable thing

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.230
we'll talk a lot about
today is that you

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.355
were a contestant on the
12th season of "Top Chef."

00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:48.313
REBECCA LAMALFA: I was.

00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:49.790
LAURA MURPHY: Amazing.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.200
So exciting.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.170
She has moved here to--

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.715
recently, this summer sometime?

00:00:55.715 --> 00:00:57.359
REBECCA LAMALFA:
Yeah, I moved in June.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.150
LAURA MURPHY: In June,
from Chicago, right?

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.024
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yes.

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:01.640
LAURA MURPHY: So
you were in Chicago.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.075
You were head chef
at the Virgin Hotels.

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:06.080
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yes.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.040
LAURA MURPHY: And you came
here with your husband,

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.581
who is also working in Detroit
as a chef at The Apparatus

00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:15.080
Room--

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.425
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yes.

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:16.220
LAURA MURPHY:
--Foundation Hotel.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.780
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yes, he's the
chef at the Foundation Hotel.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.620
LAURA MURPHY: Tom is his name?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.960
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yup.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.710
LAURA MURPHY: Yup.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.340
And you have a
couple fur babies--

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.040
REBECCA LAMALFA: I just
collected another one.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.900
LAURA MURPHY: --from
what I understand?

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.640
Oh, you have another one?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.620
Last I heard you had
three fur babies.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.490
Now, you're at four?

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.120
REBECCA LAMALFA: I have four.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.495
And I have a very
small apartment

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:33.530
right now, especially when
you have four creatures.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.477
But that happens.

00:01:36.477 --> 00:01:37.310
He's used to it now.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.680
He used to get so mad at
me for bringing stuff home.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.350
LAURA MURPHY: So wait, it was
two dogs and a cat before.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.070
What is it now?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.990
REBECCA LAMALFA: Now, I
have three dogs and a cat.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.740
LAURA MURPHY: Wow.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.241
That's--

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:48.698
REBECCA LAMALFA:
It's a good story.

00:01:48.698 --> 00:01:50.030
Like, I think it's funny.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.050
LAURA MURPHY: Well,
can we hear it?

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.966
REBECCA LAMALFA: Sure.

00:01:51.966 --> 00:01:54.290
So we have another
restaurant, or bar,

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.020
called The Skip in
the Belt. And we only

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.200
serve the Mexican-style
Coke, the small ones

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.590
in the glass jars.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.900
And we got completely
slammed one weekend.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.870
We had a big DJ
set, and Adidas had

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.910
taken over the whole Beltway.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.285
And so they're
like, Chef, you're

00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:10.618
one of the only ones with a car.

00:02:10.618 --> 00:02:12.880
Can you please go to Honeybee
and get some more soda?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.340
And I was like, sure.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.750
So I go to Honeybee
at like 8:00 at night.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.710
And a big, giant puppy dog
is running around the roads

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.267
like freaked out.

00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:27.350
And I was like, oh, he got
out of somebody's yard.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.294
So I pull over.

00:02:28.294 --> 00:02:29.960
And these other people
tried to get him.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.876
He ran away from them.

00:02:30.876 --> 00:02:32.750
And I was like,
come here, puppy.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.340
He was huge.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.090
Jumped in my car.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.884
He was beat up pretty good.

00:02:36.884 --> 00:02:39.050
But it was a Saturday night,
and none of the rescues

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.370
could take him.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.230
So I was like, OK,
you're either going

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.960
to like fit in this
weekend with the dogs,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.715
or you're going to
try to kill my Doxen.

00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:49.048
Because I didn't know if he
was a fight dog or anything.

00:02:49.048 --> 00:02:50.690
I was just like, all right.

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.392
So I gave him a bath
and fed him and kind of

00:02:53.392 --> 00:02:55.850
hung out with him for a little
bit, and he never went away.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.050
LAURA MURPHY: Aww.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.860
He adopted you.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.859
REBECCA LAMALFA: He did.

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.907
So now I have a 90-pound baby.

00:03:00.907 --> 00:03:02.615
LAURA MURPHY: And what
kind of dog is he?

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.740
REBECCA LAMALFA: He is a
lab, Mastiff, Pit bull mix.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:06.830
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, wow.

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:07.430
That's--

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.820
REBECCA LAMALFA:
But he is just--

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.319
and we should have
named him Stimpy.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.050
Because he's totally sweet but
kind of stupid and like just

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.550
happy.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.680
He just wants to
play all the time.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.097
He just has no
idea how big he is.

00:03:17.097 --> 00:03:18.596
LAURA MURPHY: What
did you name him?

00:03:18.596 --> 00:03:20.190
REBECCA LAMALFA:
His name is Busby.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.023
LAURA MURPHY: Busby.

00:03:21.023 --> 00:03:24.170
REBECCA LAMALFA: Which is like
totally not a normal name.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.110
But my husband has been amassing
the Manchester United greatest

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:31.010
hits--

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.610
players of all time history
with all of my pets.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.700
So my cat's name is
Giggs after Ryan Giggs.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.704
My American Bulldog's name
is Rooney from Wayne Rooney.

00:03:42.704 --> 00:03:43.870
LAURA MURPHY: Oh yeah, sure.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.610
REBECCA LAMALFA: And then, now I
have, Sir Busby, who is their--

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.719
I don't know-- he's some
like Hall of Famer manager

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:51.510
something or other.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:52.692
And I was like, OK, perfect.

00:03:52.692 --> 00:03:54.140
LAURA MURPHY: That's so funny.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:55.990
That's one of our
clients, actually.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.910
Chevrolet sponsors Manchester
United, so we do a lot of work

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.510
with them.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.550
That's so interesting.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.315
REBECCA LAMALFA: Their
hugest fan lives downtown.

00:04:02.315 --> 00:04:03.740
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, can
we tell them that?

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.860
We might--

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.901
REBECCA LAMALFA: Totally.

00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:06.510
He'd be so excited,
like freak out.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.930
LAURA MURPHY: We will.

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:07.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:08.491
Small world.

00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:09.740
It's a small world in Detroit.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.100
I think you're probably
realizing that,

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.530
that you can't walk down the
street and not know someone,

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.110
or someone knows someone
from high school or college.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.140
REBECCA LAMALFA: I went
to brunch the other day.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.810
And I was like,
OK, everybody is--

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.060
like, everybody-- all the
five people I know are here.

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.917
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:23.917 --> 00:04:25.500
LAURA MURPHY: Well,
let's start there.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.400
So we are going to have a
lot more about "Top Chef"

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.444
and your fur babies.

00:04:29.444 --> 00:04:30.360
But let's start there.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.520
Let's-- very, very
interesting to us--

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.101
and there's some timely
news happening right now.

00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:37.100
Because I don't know if
you saw, but Google just

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.641
announced a couple
of weeks ago we're

00:04:38.641 --> 00:04:41.150
making the move officially
down to Detroit next year.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.254
REBECCA LAMALFA:
I'm excited, yeah.

00:04:41.254 --> 00:04:42.837
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah,
we're excited too.

00:04:42.837 --> 00:04:46.220
So tell us, having not
been-- being a California

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.280
native and not necessarily a
Michigander or Detroit native,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.500
tell us what being a part
of the Detroit rebirth

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.985
has been like for you.

00:04:52.985 --> 00:04:54.110
REBECCA LAMALFA: I love it.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.330
I have been coming to Detroit
for the past four years.

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.340
Actually, what's pretty
funny-- four years ago,

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.590
we stayed at The Cadillac,
because my bridal shower

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.305
was here.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:08.357
Because we have-- my husband
has relatives in Michigan.

00:05:08.357 --> 00:05:10.440
And so I had never gotten
to meet a bunch of them,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.700
so that was how I
met all of them.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.491
And that was the first
time I'd ever really

00:05:13.491 --> 00:05:14.610
been downtown Detroit.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.820
And at that point, it
was a little bit scary.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.380
And it wasn't bad.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.107
Like, I think the guy--

00:05:21.107 --> 00:05:22.440
we went and had dinner at Roast.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.830
And we were like, where
can we go over cocktails?

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.996
And the guy was like, you
shouldn't leave the hotel.

00:05:25.996 --> 00:05:28.731
And I was like, well, OK.

00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:29.230
Fine.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.030
He's like, no, it's
really a bad idea.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.660
LAURA MURPHY: And that's
just four years ago.

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.576
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah.

00:05:32.576 --> 00:05:35.460
And now, I recognized the
church that I drove by,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.830
and it's completely like--
it's right across the street

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.370
from Little Caesar's Pizzarena.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.580
And nothing was there.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.122
And now, it's like Woodward
has grown up and all

00:05:47.122 --> 00:05:48.330
of these beautiful buildings.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:49.996
It's completely
unrecognizable from what

00:05:49.996 --> 00:05:51.360
it was four years ago.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.040
And right after
the show, I started

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.900
doing dinners at Revolver.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.430
And steadily,
every six months, I

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.930
have done a dinner at Revolver.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.840
So I've been coming and
kind of watching it grow up.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.305
And I tried to get Tom to
move here like two years ago.

00:06:04.305 --> 00:06:05.930
And you guys probably
didn't know this,

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.780
but Michigan is
huge horse country.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.230
And I grew up showing horses.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.360
So I know a lot of breeders
and trainers are here.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.126
And I was like,
cool, I can like--

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:19.470
I can still show horses
if we move to Detroit.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:19.950
LAURA MURPHY: That's funny.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.420
You did an interview
with someone

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.000
recently where you said
that a big part of moving

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.550
to downtown Detroit meant that
you could stable your horses

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.250
or you could have your
horses, which I didn't

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:30.780
think that that would be--

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:32.080
it doesn't seem realistic.

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.860
And I live here.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:33.760
I'm from here.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.207
So where do you stable them?

00:06:35.207 --> 00:06:36.540
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.206
REBECCA LAMALFA: Not
quite Metamora, but

00:06:38.206 --> 00:06:40.772
like up right before--

00:06:40.772 --> 00:06:42.480
I always forget where
his family's from--

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.440
Port Huron.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.851
There is two of the top Arabian
horse trainers in the US

00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:49.350
up there.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.890
So it's literally a
45-minute drive from downtown

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:54.720
if it's not traffic time.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.820
LAURA MURPHY: Did you have
your horses in Chicago?

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.653
REBECCA LAMALFA: No.

00:06:57.653 --> 00:07:00.095
Most of my horses are in
Arizona and in California.

00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:02.220
So I had Western Pleasure
horses and [? Reiners. ?]

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.303
And they are with my best--
one of my best friends

00:07:04.303 --> 00:07:05.457
down in Scottsdale.

00:07:05.457 --> 00:07:08.040
LAURA MURPHY: And are you-- do
you do shows with them as well?

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.450
REBECCA LAMALFA: Mm-hmm.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.970
LAURA MURPHY: Oh,
that's so interesting.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:09.886
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah.

00:07:09.886 --> 00:07:12.180
So but up here, there's
a lot of English horses.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.230
And I love English
and riding hunt.

00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:18.300
So I'm going to get myself
a half Arabian and--

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.300
LAURA MURPHY: Very cool.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.240
REBECCA LAMALFA: --hunt.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.490
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah, very cool.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.480
Well, that's really interesting.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.070
We do hear that a lot
when we get people--

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.310
transplants, as we call
them-- from other cities who

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.390
have given up a swanky
life in New York

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.340
or given up a lot of property
out west to come to Detroit,

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:37.270
that there are some sort
of creature comforts

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.920
that this city does offer
someone of your stature.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.974
And so I think that that's
really interesting that horses

00:07:43.974 --> 00:07:45.390
is your passion,
and Detroit seems

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.894
to be still a good fit for you.

00:07:46.894 --> 00:07:48.310
REBECCA LAMALFA:
Yeah, it's great.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.980
You get the best of both worlds.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:51.690
Like, we can't really
live too far away

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.470
from a major
metropolitan area that's

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.060
just-- our jobs don't translate
well to that, the kind of food

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:57.900
that both of us do.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.380
So it works out really well
that we can have a property

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.240
and have animals.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.070
And I have always had cows
and pigs and horses and all

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:06.570
that stuff.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.730
And now I can actually
do that and afford

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:10.980
to buy a house that isn't
the size of a postage stamp.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.699
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:14.490
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah,
it's a little expensive

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.790
down there right now.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:16.706
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah.

00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:20.780
LAURA MURPHY: Well, OK, so in
that same theme of Detroit,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:21.980
let's talk about Standby.

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.800
Standby, James Beard
Award nominee right now.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.710
It's typically known
as a bar that leads--

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.770
or a restaurant
slash bar that leads

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.210
with really well-known strong
alcoholic drinks, bar drinks.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.980
That's kind of how you guys
have your reputation building

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.630
right now.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.770
Tell us, as a chef coming
into a restaurant with a bar

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.660
with that type of
reputation, how

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.160
it's been challenging
for you or how

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.410
you've been able to
either complement that

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.117
or what you see from a negative
and a positive standpoint?

00:08:53.117 --> 00:08:55.200
REBECCA LAMALFA: I thought
it was a great project.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.180
And I came from having
five restaurants

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.540
under my hat to having
one that was really

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.850
focused, was really nice.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.430
And I could bring the
food to the same level

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.260
as the cocktails.

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:11.637
And my job was to get it
there, get us more organized

00:09:11.637 --> 00:09:13.470
so we can continue to
work on other projects

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.170
and expand the company.

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:16.260
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.820
What are you most proud of
that you've done at Standby?

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.820
REBECCA LAMALFA: Just
the consistency, I

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.700
think-- consistency
and that we don't

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.320
have a disparity between
the food and the cocktails.

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.780
Before, we had-- we have
a $20 drink on the menu.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.310
But it's like everything
is a lot snackier.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.560
And that's just-- they just
hadn't found the right fit

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.310
of person to kind of do that.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:46.080
And to me, Standby is a cocktail
bar that has great food.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.070
It's not a restaurant
that has great cocktails.

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:51.330
So that's something that I try
to keep in everybody's mind,

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:53.370
that I'm there to
complement the food

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:56.130
and to help us do other things.

00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:58.830
LAURA MURPHY: Yet, you have
quite an extensive background

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:00.180
as a chef.

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:01.980
Let's talk a little
bit about "Top Chef."

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.640
So "Top Chef," I think
it's what all of us

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.200
know, it's how you
got your chops.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:09.296
But is there some
other way that--

00:10:09.296 --> 00:10:11.670
do you think "Top Chef" kind
of has outshadowed something

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:14.040
else in your life you're
really proud of that got you

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.960
to where you are now?

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.869
Or would you credit
"Top Chef" for that?

00:10:16.869 --> 00:10:19.410
REBECCA LAMALFA: I think I did
"Top Chef" because it was just

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:21.395
an easy point in my life
to be able to do that.

00:10:21.395 --> 00:10:22.770
We were really
fortunate to where

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.250
my-- the company that I was
working with, Trencherman

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:29.346
and the Heisler Group were--
was like, yes, do it, please.

00:10:29.346 --> 00:10:30.720
And I was like,
oh, I don't know.

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.928
I'm like, that's not my deal.

00:10:31.928 --> 00:10:33.480
I don't really do that stuff.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.110
But I think what I had kind
of done to get there before

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.604
was a good lead up to it.

00:10:38.604 --> 00:10:41.020
It certainly wasn't my favorite
thing that I've ever done.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.020
But I don't regret it.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.885
I never wanted to
regret doing it.

00:10:43.885 --> 00:10:46.260
And they asked me, like they
begged and begged and begged

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:46.770
me do it.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.455
And I was like, all right.

00:10:48.455 --> 00:10:50.490
I'm just not a very
good social person.

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:51.489
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:51.489 --> 00:10:53.280
LAURA MURPHY: Well,
you could've fooled us.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.321
REBECCA LAMALFA: Aw, man.

00:10:54.321 --> 00:10:55.830
I kept my mouth
quiet a lot, which

00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:58.560
is one of the reasons why they
were like, you're very quiet.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.970
I'm like, well, because some
of the things that come out

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:01.000
of my mouth aren't very nice.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.645
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:01.645 --> 00:11:03.375
And like, I just like--

00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:04.750
LAURA MURPHY: I
feel you, sister.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.220
[LAUGHS]

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.970
REBECCA LAMALFA: Well,
you're just like--

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:07.677
you're stuck in a
weird situation.

00:11:07.677 --> 00:11:10.260
And I think the most frustrating
thing for me was I was like--

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.550
and the same thing with James.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.674
We both agreed on this one.

00:11:12.674 --> 00:11:15.644
We were like, good
food takes time.

00:11:15.644 --> 00:11:17.310
And that's what they
take away from you.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:19.270
They take away the two
most important things

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.270
about being a really good
chef that really cares

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:23.439
about your food is
time and the ability

00:11:23.439 --> 00:11:24.480
to pick your ingredients.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.010
One of the biggest
things about our job

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:28.260
is sourcing the best ingredients
and local ingredients

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.460
that we can.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.085
So it's a little bit like--

00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:35.010
you never feel like you're
putting your best foot forward

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.840
for somebody that you
completely admire.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.700
Like you're cooking for Jacques
Pepin, and you're like, wow,

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.590
I just ran through
Whole Foods that were

00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:41.770
ravaged like three days ago.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:42.590
It's a three-day weekend.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.070
We know they didn't
get any fresh orders,

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:45.570
because we know how
everything flows

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:48.180
in and out of these places.

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.810
And I'm going to put this in
front of seven million people.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:54.930
And I'm cooking on a stove in
like an apartment near you.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.600
And this is like, awesome.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.421
Here you go.

00:11:58.421 --> 00:11:58.920
Thank you.

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.590
It's just like, ugh.

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.090
LAURA MURPHY: But
for the most part,

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:05.790
you were given some really
positive feedback on that show.

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:06.831
REBECCA LAMALFA: Oh yeah.

00:12:06.831 --> 00:12:07.650
I had a good time.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:09.690
I mean, I met so
many amazing people.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:11.550
It's definitely
like nobody knows

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.370
what you go through, except
for like the 15 of you that

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:15.370
are there.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.860
So we're all pretty close.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:17.370
LAURA MURPHY: Pretty tight.

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:18.090
REBECCA LAMALFA: Which was fun.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.570
LAURA MURPHY: Well, you
met some amazing people.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.690
There's a lot of
celebrity chefs and a lot

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.160
of celebrities,
really, in general

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.920
that you came across
with on that season.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:26.940
Who was your favorite?

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.940
Who stands out to you
as someone you were most

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:31.906
glad to meet or network with?

00:12:31.906 --> 00:12:33.780
REBECCA LAMALFA: I think
I was pretty over it

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.196
by the time we had
to meet people.

00:12:35.196 --> 00:12:35.966
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:35.966 --> 00:12:38.340
LAURA MURPHY: Would you say
one of the other contestants?

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:40.839
REBECCA LAMALFA: It was really
fun to be in the "Cheers" set

00:12:40.839 --> 00:12:42.894
and do-- and meet Norm
and do all that stuff.

00:12:42.894 --> 00:12:44.310
And then, he came
to my restaurant

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.760
like four months later.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:47.426
And we weren't allowed
to talk about it,

00:12:47.426 --> 00:12:48.990
because we-- it
hadn't aired yet.

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:51.635
And he was like, I love
your chicken wings.

00:12:51.635 --> 00:12:52.500
I was like, thanks.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.502
That was super funny.

00:12:55.502 --> 00:12:57.210
LAURA MURPHY: Oh my
gosh, that's awesome.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:57.918
That's very cool.

00:12:57.918 --> 00:12:59.171
Yeah, that was a great one.

00:12:59.171 --> 00:13:00.420
REBECCA LAMALFA: That was fun.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.870
LAURA MURPHY: So
post life "Top Chef,"

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.520
was there one of the
other contestants

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.990
that you stayed in touch with?

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.170
I think we know
the answer to this.

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.840
You already mentioned
a couple of names,

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.339
but someone who stayed in touch
with that you've really felt

00:13:12.339 --> 00:13:13.804
you built a network around?

00:13:13.804 --> 00:13:15.970
REBECCA LAMALFA: Well, James
and I are really close.

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:17.270
LAURA MURPHY: James, yeah.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.790
REBECCA LAMALFA: May and I
talk pretty much all the time.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.748
Carrie-Ann and I are
still really good friends.

00:13:21.748 --> 00:13:24.300
We were roommates.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.835
George and I were really close.

00:13:25.835 --> 00:13:27.960
We hung out together a lot
after we got eliminated.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.460
It was really fun
to get eliminated,

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.280
because you're
stuck in this house.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.696
And you're like,
wow, I don't have

00:13:32.696 --> 00:13:34.470
to do anything besides
entertain myself.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:36.010
LAURA MURPHY: What would you
do once you got eliminated?

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:37.260
I've always wanted to know this.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.640
When you get eliminated,
then what happens?

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.420
REBECCA LAMALFA: I'm probably
gonna get in a ton of trouble

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:39.930
for telling you this.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:40.750
But I don't really care.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.550
I'm like, what are
going to do to me?

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.400
I've got nothing.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.960
They basically rented
out like a Residence Inn,

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.880
and we all got
our own apartment.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.050
And you get like--

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:51.180
you get so much money a
week for food and stuff.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:56.230
So we took over the pool,
and we barbecued every day,

00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:57.970
like way too much.

00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:58.470
Yeah.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.430
And then we would--
yeah, it was awesome.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:01.000
We had a great time.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:01.750
And it was summer.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.690
It was like none of
us have ever been

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.829
able to be off-- have this
much time off in our life

00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:09.120
and to not have to like run
and check on the restaurant

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.570
or do something else.

00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:14.070
As a chef, you're
always just on.

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.920
So it was really awesome to be
like, wow, this is like what

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.420
actual vacation feels like.

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:21.000
LAURA MURPHY: It's like
celebrity chef adult Spring

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.770
Break.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:22.160
REBECCA LAMALFA: Totally.

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.360
[INAUDIBLE] we
were like, you guys

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.734
should have had
the cameras here.

00:14:24.734 --> 00:14:27.300
Like we one time snuck
out and went to karaoke.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.900
And James was a
huge karaoke-aholic.

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:31.987
That was hysterical.

00:14:31.987 --> 00:14:32.820
We had a great time.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:33.430
LAURA MURPHY: How fun.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.346
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah.

00:14:34.346 --> 00:14:36.110
We had a great time.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.570
LAURA MURPHY: Well, OK.

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.760
So "Top Chef," the
rebirth of Detroit,

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.146
you have so many
interesting layers to you.

00:14:43.146 --> 00:14:44.520
I don't even know
where to start.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.330
But one of the other
things I do want

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.770
to talk about because
you're at Google,

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:51.520
and there's a number of things
that we prioritize here.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.500
Work-life balance
is one of them.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.630
Hearing that you
have your horses here

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.640
with you, which affords
you a better life

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.890
is awesome, because we
can all relate to that.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:04.030
But talk to us a little bit
about something else that's

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:06.050
very important here at Google.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.380
And have a group called Women @.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.520
And part of our initiative
behind that is just

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.640
to kind of uncover
truths and do a lot

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.190
of sort of sharing of
our lives and things

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.520
that make being a woman
in a technology field

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.760
at a very large corporation
with a big reputation--

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:26.590
it's not always easy.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:31.510
I cannot imagine almost a
tougher industry than being

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:33.970
a chef, a professional
chef in the industry that

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:37.060
you're in and being
female and leading that.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.120
So talk to us a little bit
about some of the challenges,

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.100
or if there's one big
one that stands out

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.380
for you and in your
journey as a female chef

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.250
amongst what I think is probably
a pretty big boys' club.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.260
REBECCA LAMALFA: It
is a huge boys' club.

00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:54.320
I just never put up with it.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.320
And I didn't ever
realize that I wasn't

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.840
going to put up with it
until I was at Michael Mina.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.360
And I always just
kind of focused

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.540
on doing a really good job.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.370
And if I knew--

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:04.600
I knew I needed to
get better, and I

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.070
was looking over at what
other people were doing.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:06.986
And I just made sure--

00:16:06.986 --> 00:16:10.595
I just made sure I worked
harder than everybody else.

00:16:10.595 --> 00:16:12.220
But there was a couple
of people that--

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:16.252
you always run across some
guys that don't want you there,

00:16:16.252 --> 00:16:18.460
especially-- this is going
to sound really terrible--

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:20.080
but there's a lot
of foreign chefs

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.230
that we work with that is
not- that's not a big women

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:27.200
crossover into their workforce.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.390
So they were like, get out.

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:32.440
And you're not conforming to
whatever cultural program is.

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.270
And I was like, dude,
if you want to go toe

00:16:34.270 --> 00:16:36.760
to toe back here, fine.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.530
LAURA MURPHY: Bring
it on, chef style.

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:39.780
REBECCA LAMALFA: I don't care.

00:16:42.174 --> 00:16:44.590
You're not going to get in the
way of me not doing my job.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.050
But I'm also not going to
let you treat me like garbage

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:48.910
or throw my stuff away or--

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:50.470
LAURA MURPHY: Oh,
would they do that?

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:51.553
REBECCA LAMALFA: Oh, yeah.

00:16:51.553 --> 00:16:52.920
Kitchen sabotage is huge.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.946
LAURA MURPHY: Oh my god.

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:54.290
REBECCA LAMALFA: Huge.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.940
Yeah.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:55.690
I need that pot.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:59.074
[PFFT] Oh yeah, completely.

00:16:59.074 --> 00:17:00.490
LAURA MURPHY: Oh,
that's horrific.

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:01.670
I'm sorry.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.550
REBECCA LAMALFA:
Oh, not a big deal.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:04.925
LAURA MURPHY: I
love that you say

00:17:04.925 --> 00:17:06.996
that you just-- that you
just won't stand for it.

00:17:06.996 --> 00:17:07.829
REBECCA LAMALFA: No.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:10.370
Dude, like if you touch my shit
again, I'm going to burn you.

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:11.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.880
It's like prison rules, man.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.839
Like you get there early,
get all of your stuff.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.952
And if you continue to
try to take my stuff,

00:17:17.952 --> 00:17:19.660
I'm going to put a
spoon on the flat top,

00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.980
and I'm going to
hold it to your hand.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:21.480
Don't.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.920
But as soon as you like--

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.829
they figure out that you're
not going to put up with it,

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:27.839
the stuff stops.

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.630
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:29.350
Wow.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:34.330
So that's amazing and
actually even more

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.850
terrifying than the way I
thought you would describe it.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:37.630
So good for you.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:41.397
I love-- again, I just love that
you have the balls to just say,

00:17:41.397 --> 00:17:42.730
I'm not going to stand for this.

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.240
And I'll sabotage
you right back.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:44.805
So it's--

00:17:44.805 --> 00:17:46.180
REBECCA LAMALFA:
Yeah, I'm also--

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.763
LAURA MURPHY:
[INAUDIBLE] belong here.

00:17:47.763 --> 00:17:49.310
REBECCA LAMALFA: Like, don't.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:50.976
LAURA MURPHY: You're
good for this city.

00:17:50.976 --> 00:17:51.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.605
REBECCA LAMALFA: I'm not
going to put up with that.

00:17:53.605 --> 00:17:55.840
LAURA MURPHY: So then,
the next obvious question

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.410
is, two chefs in one family--

00:17:59.410 --> 00:18:02.680
incredibly difficult. Back to
the work-life balance thing.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.087
But how do you and
Tom make it work?

00:18:05.087 --> 00:18:05.920
Because it's nights.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.503
It's weekends.

00:18:06.503 --> 00:18:08.140
It's early mornings.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:11.920
Do you find that that
presents itself a challenge,

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.330
or is it easier?

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.320
REBECCA LAMALFA: It was
probably a little harder

00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.528
when we were first together,
because we didn't really

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:18.130
have super control
over our schedules.

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:20.380
But now, we both kind
of make the schedule.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.995
And we both really understand
that if something happens,

00:18:22.995 --> 00:18:25.120
if you have something going
on on Sunday, of course

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.245
you have to work on Sunday.

00:18:26.245 --> 00:18:28.690
That's OK.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.240
But we try to make sure that
we have Sunday or Monday

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.820
or both days off a week, so
we actually see each other.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.280
I feel like it makes us
appreciate each other more,

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.570
because we are not on
top of each other at all.

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:41.641
Like we leave by 9:30,
10:00 in the morning.

00:18:41.641 --> 00:18:43.390
One of us will come
home and walk the dogs

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.973
and hang with the
dogs during the day.

00:18:44.973 --> 00:18:48.700
And then, we don't
get home until 12:00.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:49.990
LAURA MURPHY: Wow.

00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.920
And then repeat.

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:51.460
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.876
LAURA MURPHY:
Rinse, wash, repeat.

00:18:52.876 --> 00:18:54.220
REBECCA LAMALFA: Absolutely.

00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:55.907
LAURA MURPHY: Who's
the better chef?

00:18:55.907 --> 00:18:57.490
REBECCA LAMALFA:
That totally depends.

00:18:57.490 --> 00:18:59.380
We do totally different
styles of food.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.754
LAURA MURPHY: Tell
us about that.

00:19:00.754 --> 00:19:03.410
REBECCA LAMALFA: So he's like
ultra fine dining all the time.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:04.947
And I did that for a long time.

00:19:04.947 --> 00:19:07.030
And I was just like, I
don't need this in my life.

00:19:07.030 --> 00:19:09.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.810
I remember a pinnacle moment.

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:13.750
We were actually here two
years ago doing Savor Detroit.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:17.342
And Tom was paired up
with Luciano from Bacco.

00:19:17.342 --> 00:19:19.425
And I was like just because
your restaurant's name

00:19:19.425 --> 00:19:22.780
is 16 does not mean
you need 16 garnishes.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:23.765
Whoa.

00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:25.390
I think I'm one of
the only people that

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.130
can get away with saying that.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:27.820
And I was like sometimes--
like, you know,

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:29.320
Chanel says when you
look in the mirror

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.030
before you go out the
door, take something off.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:31.840
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, yeah.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.080
Yeah.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:32.700
Very true.

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.190
REBECCA LAMALFA: Applies here.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.760
LAURA MURPHY: But
that's his style.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.270
So your style, then,
is a little bit

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.844
more simplistic I would guess.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:39.760
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah.

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.645
And that's kind of how
I take Standby is--

00:19:42.645 --> 00:19:44.020
I'm like, well,
what tastes good?

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:49.480
What's going to-- to
me, it doesn't have to--

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.290
I don't want to-- it to be more
complicated than it has to be.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.865
To me, kind of less is more.

00:19:54.865 --> 00:19:57.074
Let the stuff speak for itself.

00:19:57.074 --> 00:19:58.990
LAURA MURPHY: So you
didn't answer us, though.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.230
Who do you think is the better--

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.260
the better--

00:20:02.260 --> 00:20:03.680
REBECCA LAMALFA: I don't know.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.470
I mean, he's 10
years older than me.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.760
So technically, he would be.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.850
But like, if you ask who
makes dinner every day.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:09.850
LAURA MURPHY: Is it you?

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:11.970
Actually, that was on
my list of questions.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.062
So what-- what's your
go-to recipe home?

00:20:15.062 --> 00:20:17.020
You're not home, really,
ever at the same time.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.820
But if you had to cook something
or you had friends coming over,

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.220
what's your go-to?

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.129
REBECCA LAMALFA: If we
have friends coming over--

00:20:24.129 --> 00:20:24.920
that's a tough one.

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.500
It's usually a holiday,
so whatever holiday food.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.041
I totally nerd out
over the holidays.

00:20:28.041 --> 00:20:29.470
So I go crazy that way.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.810
And we both love Thanksgiving,
so Thanksgiving becomes

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.220
like a giant raucous of stuff.

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:36.091
I'm like, who are
we going to feed?

00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:38.090
We have like five friends
between us and every--

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:38.350
LAURA MURPHY: I'll come over.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.750
REBECCA LAMALFA: I was
gonna say, and we have--

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:40.450
and everybody's working.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:41.825
LAURA MURPHY: I'm
free this year.

00:20:41.825 --> 00:20:42.484
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:42.484 --> 00:20:44.650
REBECCA LAMALFA: But we
could really simply at home.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:46.194
Tom loves meatloaf
and pot roast.

00:20:46.194 --> 00:20:47.860
So that's basically
what I make at home.

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:50.320
It's completely not
what people think.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.190
LAURA MURPHY: So he's
more of like a fluffy,

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:57.970
luxurious 16-course
meal or 16 sort of--

00:20:57.970 --> 00:20:59.000
[INAUDIBLE] big.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.700
But he likes your-- he likes
just good home cooked--

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:02.770
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah.

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:04.780
He cooks breakfast
every Sunday morning.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.890
And that's the most
cooking he does at home.

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:09.606
And then, I usually do
dinner and stuff like that.

00:21:09.606 --> 00:21:11.230
But yeah, we're
totally simple at home.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:12.396
We cook like everybody else.

00:21:12.396 --> 00:21:16.620
LAURA MURPHY: Do you use
any social media channels

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:21.257
or YouTube, maybe, for any kind
of recipe guidance or cooking?

00:21:21.257 --> 00:21:22.090
REBECCA LAMALFA: No.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:24.910
My Instagram is full
of dog pictures,

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:27.729
which [INAUDIBLE] totally
disappointing for some people.

00:21:27.729 --> 00:21:29.770
But yeah, I have a Doxen,
and I think he's funny.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.270
So I post pictures
about him all the time.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:36.910
But no, generally YouTube,
I watch makeup tutorials

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:38.872
and get out of chef world.

00:21:38.872 --> 00:21:39.580
LAURA MURPHY: OK.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:42.170
So you actually are
not using YouTube

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:44.500
to sort of perfect
your culinary craft.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.530
You're using it more for
your personal [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.660
REBECCA LAMALFA: I do point
my sous chefs and stuff

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.750
to a channel called ChefSteps.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.130
And they are awesome.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:56.920
So if you're like, OK,
I suck at boiling eggs,

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.450
they will show
you like four ways

00:21:58.450 --> 00:22:00.760
to hardboil and peel an egg.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.530
And they also do a lot
of molecular gastronomy.

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:06.080
And they do some
really high-end things.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.945
But they have some
really fun stuff.

00:22:07.945 --> 00:22:09.820
Like if you're like,
OK, I want to figure out

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.490
how to make hollandaise sauce
and put it in an iSi gun

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.410
and blow it up, like, OK, cool.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:15.160
There's the video.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.210
LAURA MURPHY: Very cool.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:19.030
Well then, who is your-- you
said you use makeup tutorials.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.460
Who's your favorite
YouTube creator for that?

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.918
REBECCA LAMALFA: Oh my god, I
have like a million of those.

00:22:23.918 --> 00:22:25.130
I like to watch them all.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:26.830
LAURA MURPHY: And no one stands
out more than the others?

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:28.960
REBECCA LAMALFA: I watch
Bailey Sarian a lot.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:30.340
LAURA MURPHY: Bailey.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.810
Michelle Phan maybe?

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:32.840
REBECCA LAMALFA: I don't
watch Michelle Phan very--

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.620
I used to.

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:35.950
But Jaclyn Hill does a good job.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:38.702
And a couple of girls over
in the UK I really like.

00:22:38.702 --> 00:22:40.410
It's a little bit more
of a natural look.

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:41.140
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:41.640
Yeah.

00:22:43.099 --> 00:22:45.640
REBECCA LAMALFA: There's a lot
of makeup going on these days.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.348
And I'm like, I don't
have time for that.

00:22:47.348 --> 00:22:48.910
I also don't want to feel like--

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.180
we sweat a lot in the kitchen.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.350
And nobody feels good
by like hour ten,

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.237
and you look like you've
jumped out of a swimming pool.

00:22:56.237 --> 00:22:58.570
And you're like, wow, I just
went upstairs to the dining

00:22:58.570 --> 00:23:00.700
room, and I look like I
have either been crying

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.860
or at a Marilyn Manson concert.

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.370
It's not a good
look for anybody.

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.740
LAURA MURPHY: Well, you
look beautiful in everything

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.410
I've ever seen on TV.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:10.990
So that's--

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:12.520
REBECCA LAMALFA: One of my best
friends is a makeup artist.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.710
So she always does my--
fixes me before I have

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.550
to go on [INAUDIBLE] public.

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.120
LAURA MURPHY: Is she in town?

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.994
REBECCA LAMALFA: She
travels all of the time.

00:23:17.994 --> 00:23:20.590
She is the lead makeup
traveling artist for the UFC.

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:24.370
So she covers up bruises mostly
and makes the girls beautiful.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.931
But yeah, she's the one who's
always like, OK, hold on.

00:23:26.931 --> 00:23:27.430
[CLICKS]

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.350
LAURA MURPHY: You
mentioned you and Tom,

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.900
when you are together--
maybe Mondays or Tuesdays--

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.370
you have date nights.

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:35.440
Is there-- outside
of the Foundation

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.560
Hotel or Standby-- is there a
favorite hotspot you guys like

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.000
to go to in Detroit?

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.690
REBECCA LAMALFA: We always
try to go someplace different.

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.024
Because there's like everybody--

00:23:45.024 --> 00:23:45.939
LAURA MURPHY: So many.

00:23:45.939 --> 00:23:48.670
REBECCA LAMALFA: So many
friends have restaurants and so

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:50.630
many places to go,
which is really awesome.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.770
It's kind of nicer to go out
here than it was in Chicago,

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.420
because it's just less like--

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.314
everybody here has a purpose.

00:23:57.314 --> 00:23:58.730
And instead of
like, oh, I decided

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:00.771
I'm gonna open a Chinese
restaurant, that's cool.

00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:02.770
Like, mm, all right,
that's now what you do.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:08.340
So we basically try to hit
all of our friends' places.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.840
And then anything
that's been around

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.609
for more than 50 years, like we
totally love restaurants that

00:24:13.609 --> 00:24:15.150
have been around
for a million years,

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:19.640
even if they're like funny and
like totally old and nostalgic.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.992
The funnier, the better.

00:24:20.992 --> 00:24:22.950
LAURA MURPHY: Mm-hmm,
like Clawson Steak House.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:23.480
REBECCA LAMALFA: Totally.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.540
I can't wait to go there.

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:25.460
It's totally on our list.

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:26.250
LAURA MURPHY: You haven't there?

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.870
REBECCA LAMALFA: No, because
they close on one of the things

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:28.740
that we're always off.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:28.960
LAURA MURPHY: Aww.

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.120
REBECCA LAMALFA: So yeah, like--

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.440
LAURA MURPHY: It's
the best place ever.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.231
REBECCA LAMALFA: We
loves places like that,

00:24:33.231 --> 00:24:34.650
anything that's kind of funny.

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:36.870
One of our first dates
was at Bucca di Beppo,

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:38.660
because it was funny.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.880
And this is like
the weirdest goal,

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.240
but we were like, we want
to go someplace and order

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.955
the nicest Chianti on the
menu and have it be one

00:24:47.955 --> 00:24:50.270
of those stupid basket ones.

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:52.290
LAURA MURPHY: That's
the place to do it.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:53.600
REBECCA LAMALFA: And
then, so this is like--

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:54.840
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, Roma Cafe?

00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:55.480
REBECCA LAMALFA:
Yeah, that was--

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.700
well, and-- where were we?

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.250
We were in Vegas, so there
wasn't a Roma Cafe there.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:01.350
And we didn't realize they put
us downstairs in the basement,

00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:02.590
because we must have
looked like trouble.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.900
But there was this private
party of deaf people.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.990
So we were like, it is
really quiet in here.

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.237
What is going on?

00:25:08.237 --> 00:25:10.570
And then, it dawned on us
like halfway through our meal.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:12.300
And we were like, oh,
they're a private party,

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.530
and they stuck us in their room.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.580
And they're all signing.

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.620
No wonder there's no
music or anything.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:18.656
We were [INAUDIBLE]
sitting, like, shh,

00:25:18.656 --> 00:25:19.890
something's going on.

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:20.760
LAURA MURPHY: This
was your first date?

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.968
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah, it
was one of our first dates.

00:25:22.968 --> 00:25:24.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.919
LAURA MURPHY: That'd be
tough, tough to connect

00:25:26.919 --> 00:25:27.585
when it's quiet.

00:25:27.585 --> 00:25:28.950
REBECCA LAMALFA:
It was hysterical.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:30.900
We had been-- had plenty
to drink before that.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.670
So yeah, it was--
that was super funny.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.510
LAURA MURPHY: What
about in Detroit?

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:34.740
I said Clawson Steak House.

00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.800
But what's your favorite old
place, 50-plus years old--

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.777
anywhere that you
could name off?

00:25:39.777 --> 00:25:42.360
REBECCA LAMALFA: We loved going
to the London Chope House that

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.190
has been opened and redone.

00:25:44.190 --> 00:25:45.410
That was really, really good.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:46.140
And it's fun.

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:48.180
And going up to the
cigar bar is really cool.

00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:52.650
And so so far, that's been
kind of the number one--

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:55.804
we love to go to Jacoby's
because it's funny.

00:25:55.804 --> 00:25:57.880
Sweetwater Tavern we live
across the street from,

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.046
so I've had enough for them.

00:25:59.046 --> 00:26:01.670
Every day I walk my dogs,
and I have to fight them

00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:02.699
for chicken wing bones.

00:26:02.699 --> 00:26:03.490
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:06.360
That's a kind of a nasty
corridor down there sometimes

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.530
when there's--

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:11.039
after a Lions game or
St. Andrew's Hall concert

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:11.580
or something.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.950
REBECCA LAMALFA: So
if you can imagine--

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.190
my Doxen is feisty.

00:26:15.190 --> 00:26:17.260
So I'm trying to like--

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.140
and he's growling at me.

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:20.932
He's like, I want
that chicken bone.

00:26:20.932 --> 00:26:22.470
[INAUDIBLE] You've
got to let it go.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:23.490
LAURA MURPHY: We
spend a lot of time

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.080
down there with--
some of us have

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.821
clients and such around General
Motors and around the ad

00:26:27.821 --> 00:26:28.320
agencies.

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.690
So we're always looking
for good recommendations.

00:26:30.690 --> 00:26:32.970
What do you think is
the best lunch place

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:34.220
around that same area?

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.140
REBECCA LAMALFA:
Lunch is tough, man.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:37.348
LAURA MURPHY: Lunch is so
tough, besides the Standby.

00:26:37.348 --> 00:26:39.100
Well, Standby doesn't
open until 4:00.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.080
REBECCA LAMALFA: We don't 5:00.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:40.590
LAURA MURPHY: 5:00, yeah.

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:42.923
REBECCA LAMALFA: So yeah,
we're late-- we do late night.

00:26:42.923 --> 00:26:44.280
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:45.404
Desserts till 2:00 AM.

00:26:45.404 --> 00:26:46.320
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah.

00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.330
And we do like-- we do
chicken and dumplings

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.777
from 12:00 to 2:00.

00:26:49.777 --> 00:26:51.600
LAURA MURPHY: Oh,
I didn't know that.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.170
That's cool.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:53.790
REBECCA LAMALFA: There's
like nice, hot something

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.810
to get at 2:00 AM.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.220
Because there's
really not a lot.

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:57.470
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:58.760
But lunch?

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.700
REBECCA LAMALFA: Go Sy
Thai is really good.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:05.370
I don't-- like, I like the
salads that they have at Grand

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:06.270
Trunk.

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:06.780
LAURA MURPHY: We do too.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.100
REBECCA LAMALFA:
[INAUDIBLE] Grand Trunk.

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.470
LAURA MURPHY: We spend
a lot of time there.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:11.803
REBECCA LAMALFA: It's one of
the few places that's open.

00:27:11.803 --> 00:27:14.250
The Apparatus Room, if you
can get in, has great lunch.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:15.590
I sit at the bar.

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:18.912
[INAUDIBLE] But
yeah, there's just

00:27:18.912 --> 00:27:21.120
not a whole lot of places
to have lunch downtown yet.

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:22.310
We're working on it, but--

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:23.101
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:27:23.101 --> 00:27:25.890
We think that's a big
opportunity, especially

00:27:25.890 --> 00:27:28.200
with companies like
Microsoft and hopefully,

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.050
Amazon, and obviously,
Google moving down there.

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:32.997
Definitely an
improvement for lunch.

00:27:32.997 --> 00:27:34.830
REBECCA LAMALFA: It's
all in the works, man.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.262
All that stuff is coming.

00:27:36.262 --> 00:27:37.470
LAURA MURPHY: Are you gonna--

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.230
is there anything you want to
reveal today here at Google

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.890
in that same vein around--

00:27:41.890 --> 00:27:42.106
REBECCA LAMALFA: Not yet.

00:27:42.106 --> 00:27:43.770
We just know that we never have
plans that we want to do that.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:45.330
Like, that's in the--

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.190
because there's--
they're literally--

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:49.500
we all go to the Dessert--

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.210
Dessert Oasis--
Desert Oasis Coffee--

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:53.030
LAURA MURPHY: Desert
Oasis Coffee, yeah.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:54.530
REBECCA LAMALFA:
--to have meetings.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:56.779
And we're like, this would
be great if there was food.

00:27:56.779 --> 00:27:58.040
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.250
REBECCA LAMALFA: And
there's only so many times

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.780
you can eat at the little
Mexican [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:01.517
on the corner.

00:28:01.517 --> 00:28:02.391
LAURA MURPHY: Mm-hmm.

00:28:02.391 --> 00:28:03.430
It is good, though.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:04.030
REBECCA LAMALFA: It is good.

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:04.976
But when you've had--

00:28:04.976 --> 00:28:06.600
I'm like, OK, we've
all had their menu.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.280
And we all are totally lazy.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.207
And we get delivery at
Standby like all the time.

00:28:11.207 --> 00:28:13.290
So I'm like, oh my god,
you guys, we have to stop.

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:15.623
There's nothing healthy about
anything that we're doing.

00:28:15.623 --> 00:28:16.619
[LAUGHS]

00:28:16.619 --> 00:28:18.660
LAURA MURPHY: Do you think
when Google moves down

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.210
to Detroit you might come
over and celebrity guest

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:22.890
chef for us one day?

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:22.960
REBECCA LAMALFA: I could.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.200
LAURA MURPHY: Is there a way
we could get you to do that?

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:25.420
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:26.350
How many people do
you have to serve?

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:27.433
LAURA MURPHY: OK, awesome.

00:28:27.433 --> 00:28:29.820
It'll be about, what,
120 at some point,

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.000
but 80 maybe at first?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.400
REBECCA LAMALFA:
Oh, that's not bad.

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.575
LAURA MURPHY: We'll figure
that out afterwards.

00:28:32.575 --> 00:28:33.630
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah,
I can only do that.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:34.170
That's easy.

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.253
LAURA MURPHY: OK, awesome.

00:28:35.253 --> 00:28:36.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:37.030
REBECCA LAMALFA:
That's totally easy.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.230
LAURA MURPHY: Great, so I think
that concludes the interview.

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:38.860
No, just kidding.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:39.283
REBECCA LAMALFA: OK, perfect.

00:28:39.283 --> 00:28:40.552
We got what we wanted.

00:28:40.552 --> 00:28:41.400
Leave.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.270
LAURA MURPHY: Right.

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:44.370
So why don't I stop talking?

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.840
There's a microphone over here.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.940
Is there anyone with any
questions for Rebecca?

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.840
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
maybe expanding a little bit

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.520
outside of the Standby.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.290
Are you looking to
just kind of stay

00:28:55.290 --> 00:28:57.060
in that sort of
midtown/downtown area?

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.825
Or are you looking at any
of the other neighborhoods?

00:28:59.825 --> 00:29:01.950
For example, West Village
has some good development

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.440
going on there.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:05.670
So just curious, what
areas are you looking at?

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:09.570
REBECCA LAMALFA: We just bought
a house over in that area,

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:10.600
over in Indian Village.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.850
We're super excited about it.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:15.120
And there is no room
right now in West Village.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.800
Everything is rented.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.820
So West Village is going to
blow up here really soon with--

00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:23.490
I know there's at least three
or four restaurants opening.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:29.030
My buddy, Anthony Lombardo,
is opening his restaurant.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:31.226
I can't remember the
name of it right now.

00:29:31.226 --> 00:29:35.260
But he actually moved
over to Midtown,

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:40.480
because he couldn't get
in in West Village, which

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.360
is-- it's exciting.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.067
LAURA MURPHY: It's a big deal.

00:29:43.067 --> 00:29:45.400
REBECCA LAMALFA: There's still
plenty of space downtown.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.960
And I don't mind
staying downtown.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.600
I like it down there.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.460
And I think downtown needs it.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:54.066
I'm not a super
huge suburb person.

00:29:54.066 --> 00:29:55.690
I like to come out
here to go shopping.

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.330
But I feel like there's lots
of amazing stuff out here.

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:01.900
And there's a lot of
call for new things.

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:04.270
So we're focusing--
both of us are focusing

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:08.130
all of our energies downtown.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.130
LAURA MURPHY: Thank you.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:09.629
That's good.

00:30:09.629 --> 00:30:10.370
We need that.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:11.480
You're absolutely right.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:13.060
If we could just
figure out a way

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.130
to get some of that
shopping downtown

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:16.760
and get people to
stay down there.

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.390
REBECCA LAMALFA: If we convince
Nordstrom's to move downtown,

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.608
that would be great.

00:30:19.608 --> 00:30:20.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.070
LAURA MURPHY: OK, on it.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:23.870
We had another question here.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.170
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
that you're out the door

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.770
at around 9:30 until 12:00.

00:30:29.770 --> 00:30:31.300
Can you talk a
little bit about what

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:35.230
you do in your typical day,
from when you start to finish?

00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:38.890
REBECCA LAMALFA: So my day
starts with making sure that

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:40.805
my sous-- my morning
chef has like--

00:30:40.805 --> 00:30:42.430
all the orders have
come in, it was all

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:47.670
the stuff I actually ordered,
everybody is on the same page,

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:52.129
that we have on prep projects
with, OK, burger meat is here.

00:30:52.129 --> 00:30:54.670
We patty those fresh every day,
making sure that that's done,

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:57.220
fries are blanched by a certain
time so by the time the cooks

00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.890
come in, they're kind
of out of their way.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:02.890
And then by that time, my other
two sous chefs have made it in.

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:06.310
And normally at that
point, I have meetings.

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.380
And then, I have meetings
in and out of the city.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:10.780
So I'm kind of out and
around all the time.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.390
And the past couple
of months, we

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:16.030
have opened a cart
out in the alley

00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:18.400
that we brought you
guys some snacks from.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.412
But we're just-- some
simple little fun things.

00:31:20.412 --> 00:31:21.370
LAURA MURPHY: Biscuits?

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:22.870
REBECCA LAMALFA:
Yeah, biscuit cart.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:23.950
LAURA MURPHY: Biscuits?

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:25.360
REBECCA LAMALFA:
So we-- it was--

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.264
I was focusing a lot on like,
OK, we need equipment for that.

00:31:28.264 --> 00:31:29.680
We need to get
bids for equipment.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.920
We need to figure out what
we're going to serve it in.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.390
How many people does
Jesse need to run that?

00:31:36.390 --> 00:31:37.920
So I spent a lot
of time doing that.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.980
And we are also in the works
of opening another bar down

00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.370
the way, down at the
end on Library Street.

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:46.750
So that's been another focus.

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.060
Because I'm going to do soft
serve ice cream in there.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:49.985
So I'm [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:49.985 --> 00:31:50.950
LAURA MURPHY: Oh yay.

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:51.380
That's exciting.

00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:52.740
REBECCA LAMALFA:
That will be fun.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.790
LAURA MURPHY: Have you
announced the name of that,

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:55.780
or is it still in the works?

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.850
REBECCA LAMALFA: I think it's
called Deluxe Flux of Deluxe

00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:58.730
Luxe or something like that.

00:31:58.730 --> 00:31:59.560
LAURA MURPHY: Deluxe Luxe.

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.210
REBECCA LAMALFA: But that will
be open sometime in March.

00:32:01.210 --> 00:32:02.890
That's going to be really fun.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:06.700
LAURA MURPHY: You mentioned
meetings outside of the city.

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.000
I know you do a lot of
sourcing from local farms.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.760
Is it usually related to that?

00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:12.010
REBECCA LAMALFA: So I do that.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.767
I help-- I consult
for a couple of people

00:32:14.767 --> 00:32:17.350
that I'm just helping them get
their restaurants up and around

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:19.460
and menus and things like that.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:23.440
I have a couple of
meetings with people that

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.000
want to do private dinners.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.160
And then, every doctor's
appointment in the world

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.300
is over out here.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.450
And then anybody-- the one thing
that needs to come downtown

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:33.665
desperately is a grocery store.

00:32:33.665 --> 00:32:35.290
LAURA MURPHY:
Nordstrom's and a grocery

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.426
store-- a non-- a non-Whole
Foods grocery store.

00:32:37.426 --> 00:32:39.550
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yeah,
because Whole Foods is tiny.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:41.380
And it gets picked
over immensely quickly.

00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.820
So if you need like
Ziploc bags, you're hosed.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:49.045
And CVS closes really, really--
and that gets picked over

00:32:49.045 --> 00:32:49.670
really quickly.

00:32:49.670 --> 00:32:53.170
So if you're like, OK, I need
to get actual staples of life,

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.524
you have to drive
out to Eight Mile.

00:32:55.524 --> 00:32:57.940
LAURA MURPHY: You mean City
Market doesn't have everything

00:32:57.940 --> 00:32:58.640
that you need?

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.682
[LAUGHS]

00:32:59.682 --> 00:33:02.140
REBECCA LAMALFA: Well, it's
also picked over quite quickly.

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:05.350
Those people know us very well.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.100
They love my dogs.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.392
[LAUGHS]

00:33:08.392 --> 00:33:10.180
LAURA MURPHY: Oh, that's great.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.550
Well, I don't know if
there's any other questions.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:14.050
But what I'd love
to have Rebecca do

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:16.860
is talk a little bit about what
she brought for us today, what

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:18.070
you guys are going to enjoy.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:19.390
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yes.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:22.630
So we just changed the
menu, the dessert menu.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:23.820
Julie and I love dessert.

00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.677
So that's Juliette.

00:33:24.677 --> 00:33:26.010
That's my sous chef in the back.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:26.496
Hi.

00:33:26.496 --> 00:33:27.496
LAURA MURPHY: Hi, Julie.

00:33:27.496 --> 00:33:30.925
REBECCA LAMALFA: So we brought
you what our latest dessert

00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:32.050
that we put it on the menu.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.790
It is a sour cream
old-fashioned donut

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:38.710
with dried cranberries, pumpkin
cheesecake, and apple butter.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:39.460
LAURA MURPHY: Wow.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.100
REBECCA LAMALFA: And we brought
some of the snacks that go out

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.270
on the skip cart, which is
some spiced pecans with milk

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:48.280
and dark chocolate rolled
[INAUDIBLE] around it.

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:50.770
LAURA MURPHY: Are there any
local companies or farms

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:53.246
in this-- that go
into this recipes

00:33:53.246 --> 00:33:55.870
that you brought today that you
could hype up or tell us about?

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:57.453
REBECCA LAMALFA:
Yes, so Seedling Farm

00:33:57.453 --> 00:34:01.540
has been a farm that I use
in Chicago quite a bit.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:06.084
And Pete was a tech guy
that bought this farm from--

00:34:06.084 --> 00:34:07.750
that has been around
for over 100 years.

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:10.239
But I think the
gentleman that owned it,

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:12.130
his family didn't want
to keep it in the--

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:15.190
I don't know, I don't think
he had anybody to leave it to.

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.750
So Pete bought it.

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:18.250
And they live in Chicago.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.190
And they drive all the way up
to Grand Haven every weekend

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:23.659
to make sure that this
farm continues to run.

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:27.760
And it has heirloom
pears and like

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:32.010
six different-- no, like 15
different varieties of apples,

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:34.199
ground cherries, cherries, figs.

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:35.710
He has all sorts of fun stuff.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.590
So we get all of our
apples from those guys,

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:40.173
and they ship them-- they truck
them in from across the state.

00:34:40.173 --> 00:34:41.639
LAURA MURPHY: That's cool.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:43.335
REBECCA LAMALFA:
We also buy from--

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.000
I think it's called
Grow Detroit.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.730
And it is a company that goes
around and helps little farmers

00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:55.800
get their product
to restaurants.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.600
So we have one
place to order from.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:01.396
And they make sure
that we get to use

00:35:01.396 --> 00:35:02.520
some really awesome things.

00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.644
And some of these guys only
grow one or two things.

00:35:04.644 --> 00:35:07.200
But they grow-- like this
guy grows amazing beets.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:10.830
Or he has really
awesome zucchini.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:13.560
So we'll buy the flowers
and all that stuff.

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:14.980
But it will come
from one person.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.254
The guy's name is Eton.

00:35:16.254 --> 00:35:16.920
It's really fun.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.780
LAURA MURPHY: Aton?

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.410
Eton?

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.350
Eton.

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:22.000
It's interesting, because
Chicago's not too far away.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.560
So you can kind of share
and stay with the same farm.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.400
Seedlings sounds like
maybe one of the ones

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.515
that you did that with.

00:35:27.515 --> 00:35:27.820
REBECCA LAMALFA: Yes.

00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:29.400
And what was annoying
when we moved

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:34.270
here is a lot of those farmers
on the west end of Michigan,

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:37.970
it's so much easier to go to
Chicago that they're like,

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:39.240
oh, we don't drive to Detroit.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.190
I'm like, well, can you?

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.981
LAURA MURPHY: Yeah.

00:35:40.981 --> 00:35:42.732
You're in Michigan, right.

00:35:42.732 --> 00:35:44.940
REBECCA LAMALFA: Which is
working out really awesome,

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.040
like they are, which is great.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.570
LAURA MURPHY: Has
there been any--

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:51.450
like a Michigan
staple or product

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:53.580
that's changed the
way that you cook,

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:57.210
because you were so surprised
by the cherries or the apples

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:57.990
or something?

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.550
REBECCA LAMALFA: I didn't
realize that Michigan had nuts.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.810
LAURA MURPHY: Oh.

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:01.390
I didn't either.

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:02.730
REBECCA LAMALFA: So
in southern Michigan,

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:05.320
there's quite a few pecans and
stuff, which is interesting,

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.270
my dad's a nut farmer.

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:09.450
So that was awesome.

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.960
But not really-- I mean,
growing up having a ton of stuff

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.190
at my disposal I was super--

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.080
I'm always super
excited about cheese.

00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:20.732
So I'm always finding local,
small, artisanal cheese people.

00:36:20.732 --> 00:36:22.690
LAURA MURPHY: There's a
million good ones here.

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:24.148
REBECCA LAMALFA:
I know, I love it.

00:36:24.148 --> 00:36:28.582
One of the local farm people
goes around and picks up

00:36:28.582 --> 00:36:29.790
cheese from all those places.

00:36:29.790 --> 00:36:31.800
So I'm like, I'll be on
a two-week waiting list.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:32.410
I don't care.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:36.090
I just want like one or
two of those things that

00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:36.850
are available.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:39.560
LAURA MURPHY: Share with us,
who is the best artisinal cheese

00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.270
distributor around here.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:41.830
REBECCA LAMALFA: I can't
remember the name of his farm.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.770
They're right
outside of Ann Arbor.

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.050
And they literally
have like 20 goats.

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:46.825
LAURA MURPHY: Wow.

00:36:46.825 --> 00:36:48.050
We'll have to figure that one--

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:48.520
REBECCA LAMALFA:
Yeah, I'll find--

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.539
I'll figure it out.

00:36:49.539 --> 00:36:51.330
But I was super excited
to get their stuff.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:52.288
But yeah, I ordered it.

00:36:52.288 --> 00:36:54.107
And they're like, it's
a two-week pre-order

00:36:54.107 --> 00:36:55.065
And I was like, dammit.

00:36:55.065 --> 00:36:56.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.230
I'll wait.

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:58.090
LAURA MURPHY: Yup.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:00.440
Good cheese is worth
the wait, for sure.

00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:01.606
REBECCA LAMALFA: Absolutely.

00:37:01.606 --> 00:37:02.362
I love cheese.

00:37:02.362 --> 00:37:04.320
LAURA MURPHY: Well, thank
you so much, Rebecca.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.870
Can we get a big round of
applause for Rebecca coming?

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:10.220
[APPLAUSE]
