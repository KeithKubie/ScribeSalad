00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.510
 

00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.630
Let's review a little bit of
what Napoleon was up to going

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.960
into the war of the Third
Coalition, which really does

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.340
establish Napoleon as the
dominant figure in Europe.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.300
So in 1799, he takes power.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.770
First with two other consuls,
but then he declares himself

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.595
First Consul.

00:00:23.595 --> 00:00:25.500
So he takes power.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.260
He becomes First-- let me put
that in capital letters--

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.820
First Consul.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.610
Then in 1802, actually
before I get to 1802.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.640
Let me say what he
did in 1800.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.710
Remember when he took power,
we were still in the war of

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.560
the Second Coalition.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.610
We talked about that
a little bit.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.580
France had lost ground, they
had lost a lot of what they

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.780
had gained in the First
Coalition in Italy.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.820
The Austrians had
taken it back.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.120
So Napoleon decides to take
charge, cross the Alps.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.465
This is a picture of Napoleon
crossing the Alps.

00:01:03.465 --> 00:01:09.610
 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.290
Leading the troops into the Alps
to take back what he felt

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.700
needed to be taken back
from Austria.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.040
And then we learned in the
last video that that

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.785
essentially is what ended
the First Coalition.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:30.330
So in 1800 he takes back or
leaves to take back Italy.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:40.280
 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.120
And when we talk about Italy,
we're really talking about the

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.500
Kingdom of Italy, which
was northern Italy.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.920
We're not talking about the
Kingdom of Naples, which was

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.090
southern Italy.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.270
Or the Papal States.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.610
Actually let me show you that.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.690
If we go all the
way down here.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.220
You'll see when people talk
about the Kingdom of Italy in

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.550
this period of time, they're
really talking about this

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.470
region up here, which is
really northern Italy.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.030
The Papal States
are right here.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.650
And you had your Kingdom
of Naples down there.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.900
Compared to modern Europe,
the two countries that we

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.120
associate with Europe today that
really didn't exist in a

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.940
unified form in the early 1800s
were Italy and Germany.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.840
They were really just broken up
into a bunch of kingdoms.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.530
And as I mentioned before,
Germany at this point, that

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.550
confederation of kingdoms was
kind of referred to as the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.130
Holy Roman Empire where the King
of Austria had the title

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.210
of Holy Roman Emperor.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:39.790
But he didn't control the Holy
Roman Empire in a very

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.930
centralized fashion.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.930
It was actually controlled by
a bunch of smaller kings.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.990
But anyway, let's go
back to Napoleon.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.850
So that's him crossing
the Alps in 1800.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.170
That ends when he
takes it back.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.630
He defeats Austria.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.950
That is essentially the end
of the Second Coalition.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.900
We learned that in
the last video.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.320
1801.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.165
You had your Treaty
of Luneville.

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:09.590
End of Second Coalition.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.470
They don't have a treaty with
Great Britain until the next

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.800
year, really just out
of attrition.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.760
But that doesn't matter, it was
a very short-lived treaty.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.030
And then in 1802, before we
start talking about the Third

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:31.160
Coalition, Napoleon gets
the Constitution

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.790
of the Year X passed.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.030
And why do you say year 10?

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.820
Remember, they had this whole
revolutionary calendar going.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.640
So in the revolutionary calendar
this was the 10th

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.930
year of the Revolution.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.310
But what's really relevant from
Napoleon's point of view

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.390
is article one.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.890
It says, the French people name
and the senate proclaims

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.655
Napoleon Bonaparte First
Consul for life.

00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:06.060
 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.350
So, if you want to view this
is kind of legally giving

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:18.670
Napoleon almost a king-like
status, it writes it in words

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.750
that he will rule France for
the rest of his life.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.020
Then we get to 1803.

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.720
And actually, before I get
to 1803, remember what's

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.060
happening at the
same time here.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:39.150
You had your Revolution in
Haiti, which, if you remember

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.700
from those videos, Haiti was
the most profitable slave

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.210
colony in the world.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.030
Once the slaves revolted, got
their freedom, all of a sudden

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.310
not as profitable to France
as it was before.

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.600
And remember, the whole French
Revolution started off because

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.290
France was broke.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.200
So Napoleon tries to
reinstate slavery.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.140
That essentially backfires
on him.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.330
Dessalines catches wind of
it, him and the other

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.190
revolutionaries.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.540
So they essentially
start antagonizing

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.350
Leclerc even more.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.750
Leclerc and the French occupiers
get ravaged by

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:18.530
yellow fever.

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.230
And Dessalines is a very
aggressive general.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.010
So he starts losing Haiti.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.510
You have Rochambeau, if you
remember from those videos,

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:29.400
he's this hugely brutal figure
who takes over after Leclerc.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.230
But we have this revolution
in Haiti.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.140
And you can kind of say they're

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.680
starting to lose Haiti.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.470
 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:42.200
And at the same time, and this
is 1802, and as we're entering

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:50.370
into 1803, Napoleon begins to
realize that Great Britain

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.410
controls the seas.

00:05:52.410 --> 00:06:02.580
Great Britain dominant navy.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.900
And because they're losing
Haiti, which is really their

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.890
main profit center, and Great
Britain is dominant, Napoleon

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:11.190
essentially gives up
on North America.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:23.210
 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.830
So outside of Haiti, which was
this major profit center for

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.630
the French Empire, they also
had the territory of

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:32.780
Louisiana, which is essentially
the middle 1/3 of

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.580
what we now consider to
be the United States.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.120
And Napoleon figures out,
gee, Great Britain

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.530
has a dominant navy.

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.190
I'm giving up on Haiti.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.030
I'm probably going to lose
it anyway to Dessalines.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:47.080
Let me just give up on
the entire continent.

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.540
If I don't sell Louisiana,
either Great Britain or the

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.020
United States will probably
be in a good position to

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.770
take it from me.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.585
So he decides to
sell Louisiana.

00:06:59.585 --> 00:07:06.560
 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.540
So just as someone, or as an
American, and especially an

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.480
American who was born in
Louisiana, it's fascinating

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.450
the chain of events that
led up to this.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.320
Because when you learn it from
an American history point of

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.700
view, you just say hey Thomas
Jefferson, he was able to get

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.800
Louisiana for $15 million.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.250
Why would someone sell,
all of a sudden, this

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:26.470
huge amount of territory?

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.985
And the reason is because
Napoleon figured he was going

00:07:28.985 --> 00:07:30.210
to lose it no matter what.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.005
Great Britain had this
dominant navy.

00:07:32.005 --> 00:07:34.810
And at the same time, he
had nothing else to

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:35.800
protect in the area.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.340
The other major valuable
asset there was Haiti.

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.710
So a combination of Great
Britain having this navy and

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.300
of the slave revolt in Haiti
ends up within the United

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.780
States being able to acquire
what's now the middle 1/3 of

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.570
the continent.

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.610
You can kind of wonder, if they
never did that, would

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:59.480
they have ever a gone on to
capture the entire west coast?

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.890
So these small little
things in history.

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:04.630
And I wouldn't necessarily call
these little things, but

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:09.040
they lead to very tremendous
changes in our modern world.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.390
Anyway, enough about that.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.490
So he sells Louisiana.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.890
Great Britain has
a dominant navy.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:20.380
At first, Napoleon was amassing
troops up here, he

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:22.780
was thinking about an invasion
of Great Britain.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.430
But more and more it dawns on
him that Great Britain has a

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.310
dominant navy.

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:28.360
Great Britain, I think, starts
to feel a little

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.190
self-confident.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:32.669
And they don't like all of the
gains that Napoleon has gotten

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.429
in the last two wars.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:45.780
So, Great Britain declares
war in 1803, in May 1803.

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.180
Or I could say United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Ireland,

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:49.955
the same thing.

00:08:49.955 --> 00:08:52.425
U.K.

00:08:52.425 --> 00:08:54.320
declares war.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.450
And you could view this as the
beginning of the war of the

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.270
Third Coalition.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.570
But it's not a coalition yet.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:01.120
It's just the United Kingdom.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.120
Or it's just Great Britain.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:08.540
And it really gets
heated in 1805.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.240
Everyone else jumps in.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.880
And now we're talking about
a real coalition.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:26.320
Now Great Britain is joined
by Austria and Russia.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:29.180
And Austria, all the time in
every one of these coalitions,

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.780
they lose territory to France
and especially Napoleon.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.140
They just want to get revenge.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.630
United Kingdom kind of senses
that they control the water,

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.050
they want to get revenge.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.400
Russia doesn't like this
upstart Napoleon.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.150
And so they all jump in.

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:46.380
And so there's two interesting
angles of the War

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.260
of the Third Coalition.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:49.510
Let me write this right here.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:52.080
This is the Third Coalition.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.110
And there were other people who
jumped in, but these were

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:56.050
the major powers.

00:09:56.050 --> 00:10:02.420
So this right here is
the Third Coalition.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:05.960
So the first thing that happens,
or really the two

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:08.150
almost happen simultaneously.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:16.650
In October of 1805, the French
navy gets destroyed by the

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.230
British in the Battle
of Trafalgar.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.010
This is Trafalgar, it's
actually written here.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.700
 

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.900
And they get destroyed by
Napoleon's good old friend,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:31.500
Admiral Horatio Nelson.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.190
So this guy was definitely a
thorn in Napoleon's side.

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.000
 

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.510
He destroyed Napoleon's ships in
the Battle of the Nile that

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.930
stranded their troops
in Egypt.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.530
And now he comes and essentially
destroys the

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:52.550
French navy at the Battle
of Trafalgar.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.155
And this is an image of it.

00:10:54.155 --> 00:10:59.620
And I guess the only redeeming
fact of this battle for

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.370
Napoleon was that near the end
of the battle, Horatio Nelson

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.940
actually gets stricken
by a bullet

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:08.190
and he dies at Trafalgar.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:14.260
 

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:20.300
So the Royal Navy, the British
navy was already dominant,

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.080
destroying the French navy,
which was the only navy that

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:26.500
could in some way compete
on any level.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.470
Destroying them at Trafalgar
really established British

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:31.010
domination of the seas.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.540
This is actually an image of
the Battle of Trafalgar.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.780
This is the battle
right there.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.840
A bunch of ships just shooting
at each other, you can't

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.980
really make out what's
happening.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.350
And just to connect that to
modern day Great Britain, or

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:48.590
the modern day London, this
right here is an image of

00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:49.320
Trafalgar Square.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.960
It is named after the Battle
of Trafalgar, which

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.910
established Britain is
dominant in the seas.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.890
That is Trafalgar Square
in London.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:00.800
 

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:04.050
And if you go there, you will
see Nelson's column.

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:07.090
This is Nelson's column
right there, named

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:10.650
after Horatio Nelson.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.170
And at the very top of it,
there's a little figure, or

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:16.390
it's probably pretty large,
but little relative to the

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:19.060
column, of Horatio
Nelson himself.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.840
So that was a bit of an aside,
but this occurred during the

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.720
war of the Third Coalition.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.930
So Napoleon's navy
is destroyed.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:27.920
But he doesn't give up.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:30.910
He's just like, OK, oh well, I
can't do much beyond Europe,

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.300
but in Europe I can still
do a lot of damage.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.640
So what he does is he
takes his troops.

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.120
He had given up on actually
attacking Britain by sea.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.670
He realized that he could never
realistically do that.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.320
Let me show you the troop
movements that were going on

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.780
at this time.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.850
So he had troops here that he
had given up on actually

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.090
attacking Great Britain.

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.750
And what he does is he
meets the Austrians.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.480
So the Austrians are amassing
their troops here.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.610
They actually thought that there
was a possibility that

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.110
the main campaign would
go in Italy.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.830
So they actually focused most
of their troops there, that

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.830
we'll see as a major mistake.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:11.940
But they have troops in what is
now southern Germany near

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.360
the Black Forest. And then they
also amassed some troops

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.190
near Italy.

00:13:16.190 --> 00:13:18.240
And then the Russians were
coming up behind.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.840
They weren't able to meet.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.000
And we're dealing with the fall,
this is now September,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.840
October of 1805.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.180
And the Russians were back here
trying to bring their

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:34.060
troops to assist the Austrians
in meeting Napoleon.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.120
And all of these, it's always
unclear on how much of it was

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.640
tactical genius versus
pure luck.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.496
Because they didn't have
satellites, they didn't know

00:13:42.496 --> 00:13:43.250
where the other troops were.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.880
They didn't necessarily know
exactly what's happening on a

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.510
minute-by-minute basis,
like armies do today.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:54.750
But what happened, and it's one
of the pivotal battles in

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.480
European history, is that
Napoleon meets the

00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.220
Austrians at Ulm.

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:03.980
Let me draw it on this
map right here.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:07.290
So on this map they just do
a very general-- This is

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:10.670
Napoleon meeting the Austrians
right here at Ulm.

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:11.880
There's actually a
whole campaign of

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.330
Ulm, several battles.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:15.940
But it was a decisive
victory at Ulm.

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:21.270
And the crux of that victory was
that Napoleon was able to

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.030
fool the Austrians.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:27.760
So this is a zoomed-in version
of what was going on here.

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.110
This is France.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.730
This is the Black Forest. This
is Austria right there.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:37.720
Blue is Napoleon troops, red
are the Austrian troops.

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.860
And you saw, Austria had amassed
most of their troops

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:42.480
on the Italian front.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.410
So here in Black Forest, you
have your Austrian troops.

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:50.570
What Napoleon did is he had
General Marat make it look

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:54.720
like the main force of the
French were coming straight

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.210
from the West. And they did
that by having cavalry

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:01.740
essentially giving the
appearance of a major force

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.830
coming in from here.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:06.110
So the Austrians were thinking,
OK, this is the

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:12.780
direction that we're going to
face our main antagonism from.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.860
But at the same time, the bulk
of the Napoleon's army--

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.340
remember he doesn't see exactly
how many people are

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:18.950
here, they just made it
look like this is

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:19.670
the bulk of the army.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.810
But the bulk of the army
actually did what they call a

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:29.760
wheeling manoeuvre, where they
went around the Austrian army.

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.440
And they were able to do it much
faster and in a much more

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.480
nimble way than anyone
would have predicted.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.320
Because they essentially
didn't have to

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.680
carry as many supplies.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.940
They were doing this during
the harvest season.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:42.450
And this was by design.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:47.060
If you capture enemy territory
during the harvest season, and

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.140
these are things that you
usually don't think about when

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:51.150
you learn about military
battles.

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.890
But you've got troops, you've
got to feed the troops.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:58.570
If they can't capture food from
the land, then you've got

00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.800
to carry supplies with you.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.190
And supplies are heavy it
slows down your army.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.080
But if you do the attack during
the harvest season, you

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.460
don't have to carry food.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:12.080
 

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.810
You can just take it from the
farmers that you pass by.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:18.230
They're harvesting food as you
pass by, you just take it, you

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:19.600
can be fast and nimble.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.750
And he essentially went around
the army and was able to

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.210
attack the Austrians from
this direction.

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.920
And then essentially
destroy them.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.780
And this is why I hinted in the
last video that Napoleon

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:32.570
starts to view himself
as invincible.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:35.830
And this was before the
Russians could come to

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:38.350
actually reinforce
the Austrians.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.990
So they did it-- by being able
to do it so quickly, they were

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:44.650
able to just only tackle
the Austrians.

00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.890
So it was a decisive
victory at Ulm.

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.640
Let me go to the painting
right there.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.550
This is a painting of the
surrender at Ulm.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:57.140
 

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:02.420
And then the combined Russian
and Austrian forces, they

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:07.960
essentially regrouped, but
they re-met Napoleon's

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.540
forces after Ulm.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:14.849
In another several weeks,
at Austerlitz.

00:17:14.849 --> 00:17:18.450
And once again, Napoleon
just routed them.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:19.579
And there's always a debate.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:22.829
Some of it might have been
tactical genius, some of it

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:24.990
might have been pure luck.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:30.390
But after routing them at
Austerlitz-- so this is

00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:36.660
Austerlitz-- and taking so much
I guess both in terms of

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:42.110
casualties and prisoners from
the enemy without incurring so

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:45.680
much themselves, this really was
the high point in terms of

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.680
a battle for Napoleon.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.010
Austerlitz is what really
convinced Napoleon that he is

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.910
truly, truly a military
genius.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:55.220
And that's not saying
that he's not.

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.520
But it was such a rout that
he started to imagine that

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:00.860
he's on some level invincible.

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.600
And so the outcome, this
essentially ends the war of

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.850
the Third Coalition.

00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:11.530
 

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:16.610
And with that ending, Austria
had to give its territory that

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.740
it had gotten in Italy.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:23.210
So Austria had to cede the
territory that it had in

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.510
Italy, some of the territory
that it had in Bavaria.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.230
And from, I guess just a general
point of view, this

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.550
was historically significant.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.130
Because until this point in
time, this whole area was

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:38.470
called the Holy Roman Empire,
with the King of Austria

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.300
calling himself the Holy
Roman Emperor.

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:43.520
Even though he didn't have
direct control over all of

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.120
these Germanic regions.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.030
 

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:49.340
Let me go back up here.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:53.890
This is in 1805, or we can even
say we're entering 1806,

00:18:53.890 --> 00:19:00.300
but in late 1805, with the end
of the Third Coalition, now

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.130
the Austrian King no longer
calls himself

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.050
the Holy Roman Emperor.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.340
He gives up the title.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:12.000
And this region right here is
no longer called the Holy

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:12.840
Roman Empire.

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.905
It is called the Confederation
of the Rhine.

00:19:14.905 --> 00:19:23.910
 

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.390
And it's essentially under the
protection of Napoleon.

00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:29.990
And this is the first time--
we're starting to get to a

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.720
point, Germany won't
be unified for

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.930
another 60 or 70 years.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.490
But we're starting to get to
the point that the German

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.610
nation is escaping from
the bounds of being

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.920
the Holy Roman Empire.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.670
And so it's getting
in that direction.

00:19:44.670 --> 00:19:49.190
So the Holy Roman
Empire is gone.

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:52.230
France gets significant
territory from

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.120
Austria, once again.

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.810
Russia on some level is just
humbled a little bit.

00:19:57.810 --> 00:20:00.200
And then we end in 1806,
or at the end of

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.060
1805, with France dominant.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.370
And while all of that was
happening, it was really in

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:10.050
1804 when France was only at
war with Great Britain.

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.040
The whole alliance hadn't
formed yet.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.950
It 1804, in December-- and this
is relevant that it's a

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.140
peek into his ego.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:22.690
So this is the year
before Austerlitz.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.800
In 1804, Napoleon declares
himself, or he

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.095
crowns himself Emperor.

00:20:29.095 --> 00:20:39.340
 

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.550
And this is a picture
of him as Emperor.

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.380
And after this point, instead
of being called Napoleon

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.920
Bonaparte, he is called
Napoleon I.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.560
 

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.850
And the idea of crowning
yourself Emperor, you might

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:52.780
say, what's the point?

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.800
You already were Consul for
life, you have power for your

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:55.550
whole life.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:59.020
But other than you get this
neat title emperor, which

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.610
probably feeds your ego quite
well, but beyond that, this

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:05.200
essentially establishes
a dynasty.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.080
It now says, I'm not
just a First

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.510
Consul, I am the emperor.

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:10.590
I'm Napoleon I.

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:14.950
And it implies that his
descendants will continue to

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:17.710
reign over the French Empire.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:19.590
So on some level, he
kind of destroys

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:21.260
the notion of a republic.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.020
So we're ending the Third
Coalition with France is

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:29.470
dominant in Europe.

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:34.270
It has gotten all of this
territory mainly from Austria.

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:37.210
The Holy Roman Empire
no longer exists.

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.380
It's now the Confederation
of the Rhine.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:44.110
Napoleon, after Austerlitz,
thinks that he is invincible.

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.580
And he also is now Emperor.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:51.120
So all of his visions of
grandeur are coming true.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:51.333
