00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.060
For this exercise, you need to create a similar scatter

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.850
plot that had friend count mean against age with months. We'll

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.320
use ggplot to create our figure. I'll pass age with months

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.570
to x, and I'll pass friend count mean to y. And

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.360
then I just need to remember to wrap this in AES.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.900
Now comes the data frame. I need to be careful that

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.590
I don't use pseudo Facebook users, since I really want this

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.380
data frame that we just created. Now that I've got my

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.310
data frame, I need to subset it. I'll only take the users

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.598
whose age with months is less then 71. Then, I'll tell ggplot

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:35.372
what type of geom I want, in this case geom live. So

00:00:35.372 --> 00:00:39.540
here's our much nosier plot, a friend count mean versus age with months.
