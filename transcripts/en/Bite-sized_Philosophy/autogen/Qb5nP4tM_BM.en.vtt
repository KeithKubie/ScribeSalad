there's some food at the end of the maze
you<00:00:37.710><c> can</c><00:00:38.640><c> tie</c><00:00:38.969><c> a</c><00:00:39.000><c> little</c><00:00:39.180><c> spring</c><00:00:39.660><c> to</c><00:00:39.930><c> his</c><00:00:40.050><c> tail</c>

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
you can tie a little spring to his tail
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.500 align:start position:0%
you can tie a little spring to his tail
and<00:00:40.649><c> see</c><00:00:40.829><c> how</c><00:00:40.980><c> hard</c><00:00:41.219><c> he</c><00:00:41.340><c> pulls</c><00:00:41.610><c> when</c><00:00:41.969><c> you</c><00:00:42.120><c> open</c>

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 align:start position:0%
and see how hard he pulls when you open
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.090 align:start position:0%
and see how hard he pulls when you open
the<00:00:42.600><c> door</c><00:00:42.750><c> to</c><00:00:42.870><c> the</c><00:00:42.960><c> maze</c><00:00:43.140><c> so</c><00:00:43.440><c> that's</c><00:00:43.649><c> because</c>

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
the door to the maze so that's because
 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.950 align:start position:0%
the door to the maze so that's because
that's<00:00:44.190><c> how</c><00:00:44.370><c> much</c><00:00:44.520><c> rat</c><00:00:44.789><c> work</c><00:00:45.300><c> the</c><00:00:45.570><c> route</c><00:00:45.719><c> is</c>

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's how much rat work the route is
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.690 align:start position:0%
that's how much rat work the route is
willing<00:00:46.230><c> to</c><00:00:46.350><c> do</c><00:00:46.469><c> so</c><00:00:46.649><c> you</c><00:00:46.710><c> can</c><00:00:46.829><c> measure</c><00:00:47.010><c> that</c><00:00:47.250><c> or</c>

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
willing to do so you can measure that or
 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.220 align:start position:0%
willing to do so you can measure that or
you<00:00:47.820><c> can</c><00:00:47.969><c> see</c><00:00:48.090><c> how</c><00:00:48.180><c> fast</c><00:00:48.420><c> he</c><00:00:48.629><c> skitters</c><00:00:49.050><c> down</c>

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 align:start position:0%
you can see how fast he skitters down
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.350 align:start position:0%
you can see how fast he skitters down
the<00:00:49.410><c> maze</c><00:00:49.559><c> and</c><00:00:49.890><c> you</c><00:00:50.370><c> can</c><00:00:50.579><c> get</c><00:00:50.850><c> an</c><00:00:50.969><c> estimate</c>

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
the maze and you can get an estimate
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.990 align:start position:0%
the maze and you can get an estimate
about<00:00:51.480><c> the</c><00:00:51.719><c> rats</c><00:00:51.899><c> motivation</c><00:00:52.620><c> and</c><00:00:52.890><c> so</c><00:00:53.789><c> then</c>

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
about the rats motivation and so then
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
about the rats motivation and so then
you<00:00:54.090><c> might</c><00:00:54.210><c> say</c><00:00:54.270><c> well</c><00:00:54.480><c> how</c><00:00:55.110><c> motivated</c><00:00:55.829><c> is</c><00:00:55.949><c> a</c>

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 align:start position:0%
you might say well how motivated is a
 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 align:start position:0%
you might say well how motivated is a
hungry<00:00:56.879><c> rat</c><00:00:57.059><c> and</c><00:00:57.390><c> the</c><00:00:57.449><c> answer</c><00:00:57.719><c> would</c><00:00:58.079><c> be</c>

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
hungry rat and the answer would be
 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
hungry rat and the answer would be
depends<00:00:59.070><c> on</c><00:00:59.219><c> how</c><00:00:59.280><c> hungry</c><00:00:59.430><c> is</c><00:00:59.789><c> but</c><00:01:00.180><c> there's</c>

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 align:start position:0%
depends on how hungry is but there's
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.170 align:start position:0%
depends on how hungry is but there's
another<00:01:00.570><c> answer</c><00:01:01.250><c> it</c><00:01:02.250><c> also</c><00:01:02.430><c> depends</c><00:01:02.910><c> on</c><00:01:03.000><c> what's</c>

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
another answer it also depends on what's
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.759 align:start position:0%
another answer it also depends on what's
chasing<00:01:03.719><c> him</c><00:01:03.840><c> when</c><00:01:04.019><c> he's</c><00:01:04.140><c> going</c><00:01:04.350><c> after</c><00:01:04.589><c> the</c>
