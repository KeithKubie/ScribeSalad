00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.380
SPEAKER: Thank you all so
much for being here today.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.270
This year, to
celebrate Pride, we

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.520
wanted to create spaces to have
some really meaningful dialogue

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.900
about our identities.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.210
And we're so excited that
BGN, Black Googlers Network

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.230
and Gayglers partnered up to
bring DeRay Mckesson for you

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.110
today.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.340
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.200
SPEAKER: I'm going
to read DeRay's bio.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.040
DeRay is a protester, and he's
dedicated to ending police

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.670
and state violence, notably
through Campaign Zero

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.840
and as a civil rights
activist both at the local

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.340
and the national level.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.500
He previously worked at
the Harlem Children's Zone

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.350
and TNTP, opened an
academic enrichment

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.930
center in West Baltimore, and
with Baltimore City Public

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.060
Schools and Minneapolis
Public Schools

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.120
is leading systemic
human capital change.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.240
He was recently named as one of
the 50 World's Greatest Leaders

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.120
by "Fortune Magaine" and
as one of the 30 Most

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.952
Influential People on the
internet by "Time Magazine."

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:56.535
Please help me welcome
DeRay Mckesson.

00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:59.326
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.420
DERAY MCKESSON: Appreciate it.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.461
It's an honor to be here.

00:01:12.461 --> 00:01:17.534
It's good to see some familiar
faces and so many new faces.

00:01:17.534 --> 00:01:18.950
This is embarrassing
for you, Ben,

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.250
but I went to college with Ben!

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.231
I saw Ben in the hallway
and was like, oh my god!

00:01:23.231 --> 00:01:24.602
I haven't seen Ben in forever!

00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:26.560
So most people know that
I wear belt every day,

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.440
but I also wear my
Bowdoin-- I mean,

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.273
most people know I wear
this vest every day,

00:01:30.273 --> 00:01:32.100
but I wear a Bowdoin
belt every single day,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.720
which you don't see.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:33.930
And Ben and I want to Bowdoin.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.515
So if you don't know Ben, you
should meet him afterwards,

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:36.700
because he's great.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.130
So I know we're going to do
a moderated conversation.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.170
I'm most excited about
these questions, which

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.182
I've not heard, and also your
questions which are going to be

00:01:45.182 --> 00:01:46.390
probably the freshest things.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.355
I worry sometimes
that I tweet so much,

00:01:48.355 --> 00:01:50.730
and I talk so much, that you've
probably heard everything

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.460
I could possibly say.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.180
So your questions
make me most excited.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.140
But I will say on
August 16th, 2014,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.550
I was sitting on my
couch in Minneapolis.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.610
I was a senior director
of human capital,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.332
and I was looking
on Twitter to see

00:02:01.332 --> 00:02:02.540
what's happening in Ferguson.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.980
I was looking at TV to see
what's happening in Ferguson,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.417
and they were not
the same stories.

00:02:07.417 --> 00:02:09.250
And I was like, I want
to go see for myself.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.791
And I just wanted
to go bear witness.

00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:11.890
So I got in the car.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.380
I drove nine hours to St. Louis.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.910
I put on Facebook that
I am going to St. Louis.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.460
I didn't know anybody in
the state of Missouri.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.250
I wanted to find somebody who
knew somebody who knew somebody

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.680
whose couch I could sleep on.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.160
Seven hours in, I
get a call in Iowa,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.980
and there's some
rough roads in Iowa.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:29.680
I got a call.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.681
And, you know, it
was-- Google Maps.

00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:33.180
If you work on the
Google Maps team,

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.390
Google Maps almost got me
in Iowa, let me tell you.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.510
Because there was no
reception, so I took this call,

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.410
and then it was like
my GPS was like, wahh.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:42.909
So there was a lot
of faith in Iowa.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.960
But I got a call, and
they were like, DeRay,

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.080
we found somewhere
for you to sleep.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.130
And that was my story.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.080
So I showed up in the middle
of the street in St. Louis

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.760
like so many other people
in those early days.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.176
You know, Mike got
killed the 9th.

00:02:53.176 --> 00:02:54.597
I was there on the 16th.

00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:56.180
The second day that
I was in St. Louis

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.120
was the first day of the
curfew-- if any of you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.601
remember the curfew,
back in those early days.

00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:03.850
And it was also the first
night that I got teargassed.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.600
And it was in that
moment that I said,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.920
I will do whatever
I can to make sure

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.878
that this is not a world
that other people have

00:03:08.878 --> 00:03:10.040
to experience like this.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.760
Before that, my work
was all about kids.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.444
I was a teacher.

00:03:12.444 --> 00:03:13.860
I opened up after
school programs.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.670
I was the number two in human
capital in Baltimore City

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.962
Public Schools and Minneapolis.

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:18.628
But I had this moment
that was like, you

00:03:18.628 --> 00:03:19.715
gotta be alive to learn.

00:03:19.715 --> 00:03:20.430
Right?

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.888
And I've done all
this work to make

00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:23.930
sure kids have a great
teacher every single day.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.968
And Tamir will never know
a high school teacher.

00:03:25.968 --> 00:03:27.926
Mike Brown will never
know a college professor.

00:03:27.926 --> 00:03:30.080
Aiyana, Rekia, so many people.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.730
And that changed
the world for me.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.300
One of the things
I worry about when

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.350
I think about the
last 20-ish months,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.270
I worry that people think
of protesters or protests

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.390
as only those of us who
stood in streets, only

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.080
those of us who put our bodies
on the line in that way.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.210
But what I know to be true today
is that protest, at its root,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.040
is this idea of telling
the truth in public.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.340
We stood in streets to tell
the truth with our bodies,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.920
that Mike should be alive,
and Rekia should be alive,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.720
and Aiyana, that we disrupted
board meetings and commissions

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.660
to tell the truth,
that they should

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.120
be using their
power in ways that

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.578
benefited the lives
of black people

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:06.840
and other marginalized people.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.006
And in that sense, there
are many ways for all of us

00:04:09.006 --> 00:04:11.930
to tell the truth in this
work, that you are not

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.040
absolved from your
commitment to social justice

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.790
just because you have
not been in streets,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.510
but we all have a role to play.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.600
And that has to be how
we think about what comes

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.934
next in the movement space.

00:04:21.934 --> 00:04:23.600
I'm excited to talk
about the questions.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.800
I do have many worries
about where we go next,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.759
but I'm hopeful because I
know that so many people

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.800
over the last 20 months
have done so much to make

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.091
this a nationwide conversation.

00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:36.809
That we are talking about
race and justice and identity

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.850
in ways that we have never
talked about in public

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.630
in our generation.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.702
And that is really powerful.

00:04:41.702 --> 00:04:43.470
And there's a real
onus on all of us

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.025
to make sure that we turn
this into more than a moment--

00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:48.342
that this is not just a
really cool conversation we've

00:04:48.342 --> 00:04:49.800
been having for
the last 20 months,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.700
but that we actually
change the world

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.880
in some demonstrable ways.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.463
And I think that
that part of the work

00:04:54.463 --> 00:04:57.360
is potentially less sexy
than the beginning part

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.584
of the work for some people.

00:04:58.584 --> 00:05:00.750
But that work is really
important, that if all we do

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.480
is change the conversation,
we have not done enough.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.843
But changing the conversation
is unbelievably hard work.

00:05:05.843 --> 00:05:07.592
And I say that as
somebody who-- you know,

00:05:07.592 --> 00:05:09.570
we were in the street
for 300 plus days.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.730
I'm just one of many people who
did that across the country.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.370
And it has been
powerful to see people

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.560
own their voices in
new and incredible ways

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.134
every single day.

00:05:18.134 --> 00:05:20.300
DERAY MCKESSON: And I do
think that the conversation

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.794
about identity is something
that we didn't know

00:05:22.794 --> 00:05:24.460
was going to happen
in those early days.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.920
Like we just had no clue.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.170
But it's been powerful to see.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.266
I remember the first
time in St. Louis

00:05:29.266 --> 00:05:31.390
that there was ever a
conversation about sexuality.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:32.400
There was a protest.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.360
So the police killed Mike,
and then they killed 10 people

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.760
after Mike Brown in St. Louis.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.918
So it was like just
continuous trauma.

00:05:37.918 --> 00:05:40.690
And they killed
VonDerrit in Shaw,

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.239
which is in St. Louis city.

00:05:42.239 --> 00:05:43.280
And I'll never forget it.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.420
It was like the police had
circled in this intersection,

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:48.360
and they were like
pepper spraying people.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.944
It was a mess.

00:05:48.944 --> 00:05:50.443
And this guy walks
up to the police,

00:05:50.443 --> 00:05:51.920
and he's like, you
fucking faggots!

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.500
That's like what he
yells at the police.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.410
Then he turns around.

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.623
This other protester looks
at him, and it's like chaos.

00:05:56.623 --> 00:05:57.016
Right?

00:05:57.016 --> 00:05:57.720
The whole night is chaos.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:58.600
And this guy looks at me.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.141
He was like, that
really offended me.

00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:01.487
And the guy's like, I'm sorry.

00:06:01.487 --> 00:06:02.320
And I was like, wow!

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.210
Look at that!

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.990
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.109
And it was in that
moment that I was like, I

00:06:07.109 --> 00:06:08.150
think we'll be all right.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.160
Like I think that we
will figure this out,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.620
and that we will
continue to push

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.370
the boundaries of what
people have thought

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.524
community looked like.

00:06:14.524 --> 00:06:16.440
And that moment is
something I refer to often,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.154
because he was like, you
offended me, I was like,

00:06:19.154 --> 00:06:20.320
oh, this is about to be bad.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.511
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:21.511 --> 00:06:22.880
And then he was like, I'm sorry.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.230
And I was like, yes.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.080
So, you know, I think
about those small moments

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.740
often, because I
think that they have

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.781
larger implications about
how we build community,

00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:33.040
how we come together,
what that means,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.120
and how we learn to love
each other differently.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.360
So excited to be here.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.510
That was just a beginning.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.759
I'm excited for [? Rebecca ?].

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.570
She's been a great
wrangler of me

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.150
over the last couple of weeks.

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.030
And I'm most excited
for your questions.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.085
Thank you so much, y'all.

00:06:45.085 --> 00:06:49.739
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:50.456 --> 00:06:52.830
SPEAKER: So I want to start
the conversation on the point

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.330
that you made about our
different identities

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.230
or our identity categories.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:00.650
At the GLAAD Gala, you had
a quote that's so beautiful.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.550
It says, there is beautiful
complexity in our identities,

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.659
and that there is
danger in the either/or.

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:09.450
I know you talked about
it now, but can you

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:12.087
touch on intersectionality,
and why is it so important

00:07:12.087 --> 00:07:13.920
that we continue to
have these conversations

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.020
and actually drive
them with action?

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.280
DERAY MCKESSON: Yeah, I
was somewhere recently

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.730
and somebody said, DeRay, you
are like black first or gay

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.130
first?

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:24.213
And I was like, well, ehh?

00:07:24.213 --> 00:07:26.830
You know?

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.172
And in the end what I said was
that you see my blackness first

00:07:30.172 --> 00:07:31.630
before you see
anything else, but I

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.180
like live in all
of my identities

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.610
at the same time, every moment.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.010
And part of our
work is how do we

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.880
make sure that people are safe
living in their identities

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.770
at every moment whether
you see it or not.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.270
Right?

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:44.280
And just because you don't
know doesn't mean I'm hiding.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.796
Just because you don't know I'm
gay doesn't mean I'm not gay.

00:07:46.796 --> 00:07:48.796
And it also doesn't mean
that I need to tell you

00:07:48.796 --> 00:07:49.980
every two seconds about it.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.180
But it is about how do we
make sure we do our part

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.820
to make sure that people are
safe in every part of the world

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:56.670
they live in.

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.410
The thing about the
either or was not

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.600
necessarily about identity
as much as it was-- I

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.760
think in some of
these places that we

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:07.180
are so passionate
about the work,

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.820
we take these camps, right?

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.780
We're either reformists
or revolutionaries.

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.510
We either live in
community or we don't live

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:15.180
in-- it becomes so [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.652
The camp speak
becomes so intense.

00:08:17.652 --> 00:08:20.564
And people, I think, don't
often do the work of saying,

00:08:20.564 --> 00:08:22.730
here's how we can actually
do both at the same time.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:25.610
So you think about Congress, the
sit-in that Congress just did.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.520
I have my concerns with it.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.015
But overall, I support it.

00:08:29.015 --> 00:08:31.630
And people are-- it's
like this either/or.

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:35.679
Either you hate the no-fly
list and you hate everything.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:38.520
You know, it's like people
aren't allowing for people

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.059
to say like, I believe in
the sit-in that they did,

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:44.350
and I think the no-fly
list is a bad thing.

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.052
I think those are both real.

00:08:46.052 --> 00:08:48.010
People are sort of camped
out, where either you

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:51.900
hate John Lewis and
the other congressmen,

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.310
or you completely
support the no-fly list.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.930
And I think that
that isn't a fair way

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.590
to think about the world.

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.420
And I think that the way
we show up in the world

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:01.128
is much more complex
than this either/or,

00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:04.700
that the both/and takes a little
more work to think through.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.356
But I think that's the most
honest way to be in the world.

00:09:08.356 --> 00:09:10.480
SPEAKER: I know we were
talking a little bit before

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.620
on your talk about the quiet.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:17.660
So DeRay had a comment that
says, I wasn't in the closet,

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.499
I was in the quiet.

00:09:18.499 --> 00:09:20.040
The quiet is a place
where you're not

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.437
supposed to make noise.

00:09:21.437 --> 00:09:23.520
Can you tell us more about
the quiet and anything,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.353
like the pressures that
you might have felt,

00:09:25.353 --> 00:09:27.762
or that we feel about
staying in the quiet?

00:09:27.762 --> 00:09:29.220
DERAY MCKESSON:
Yeah, I got worried

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.220
about people
talking-- like I don't

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:32.480
think I was in the closet.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.250
I just think I wasn't
talking about being

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.440
gay, which wasn't me hiding.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.584
The closet, to me, is
this idea that I'm hiding,

00:09:39.584 --> 00:09:42.250
and I don't want people to know,
and I'm putting something away.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.410
And that wasn't how I
thought about it myself,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.486
but I didn't have the language
to think about it differently.

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:49.860
So I was like, you know, I
think I'm in the quiet, right?

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:53.250
Just because you didn't know
doesn't mean that I was hiding.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:55.820
And it was like this image
of the library as a place

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.950
where people are supposed
to be quiet because quiet

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.060
is how you learn, right?

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.910
Quiet is the best way
to access information.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:05.792
It is what keeps you
safe, in a certain sense.

00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:07.750
But what we know about
libraries is that people

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.075
whisper all the time.

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.450
And it is that
collective whisper

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:13.380
that actually makes noise.

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:17.600
And it is the
whispers that I think

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.319
we need to honor in many ways.

00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:21.610
I think the movement-- it
was a lot of whispers, right?

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.710
It was people all
across the country,

00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.150
definitely all across
St. Louis, saying,

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:25.420
we think something is wrong.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:26.830
We don't know what
to do, and we don't

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.163
know who believes with us,
but we think something is up.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.920
The corollary I see between
identity and the movement

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.360
was all these people
coming together saying,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.240
I think we want to
talk about something.

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.910
It's a little quiet right
here, but let us come together

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.590
and make a louder noise.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.822
When I think about identity,
I do think a lot of people

00:10:46.822 --> 00:10:47.530
are in the quiet.

00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:49.404
And then our part as
organizers is, how do we

00:10:49.404 --> 00:10:53.370
help people feel comfortable
moving out of that quiet space

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:56.260
and not shaming people
for being in the quiet?

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.640
But taking as our responsibility
that some people feel

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.389
like that is the only
way they can be safe

00:11:00.389 --> 00:11:02.810
or that is the most honest
way that they can be

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.640
who they are and also be safe.

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.506
I remember, you know, growing
up in Baltimore and people--

00:11:07.506 --> 00:11:09.630
like I remember the sting
of being called a faggot.

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:11.070
I remember that as a kid.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:12.487
And there are some
places as a kid

00:11:12.487 --> 00:11:14.153
that I made a choice
whether I was going

00:11:14.153 --> 00:11:16.500
to talk about identity a
certain way, because I just

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.510
didn't want to be traumatized
like that anymore.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.660
And how do we
build a world where

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.880
people can be who they
are in the way they want

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.660
to be that is safe every time?

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:25.380
You think about
that when we think

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:26.310
about the bathrooms, right?

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.601
Like when I was in the
Breakfast Club with Charlemagne,

00:11:28.601 --> 00:11:30.920
and Charlemagne, he said
some problematic things

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.320
about a whole host of issues.

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.214
But we talked about the bathroom
bill in the trans community.

00:11:35.214 --> 00:11:37.630
And I'm like, Charlemagne,
what do you do in the bathroom.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.920
Like what are you
doing in the bathroom?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.630
When I go to the bathroom,
I'm like going in, going

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:41.310
to the bathroom, coming out.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:42.420
I'm not having a party.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:44.570
I'm not passing out
business cards, right?

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.840
Like what is--

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.780
People should be able to--
what you do in the bathroom,

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.740
people should be able
[? to be safe ?] doing that,

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:49.960
right?

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.470
And he's like, I
mean, I guess, DeRay.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.261
And I'm like, yeah!

00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:54.960
So how do we help
people complicate

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:59.130
the way we think about identity
and especially complicate

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.870
the way we think about
what safety means?

00:12:01.870 --> 00:12:03.274
SPEAKER: Is there
an added stigma

00:12:03.274 --> 00:12:05.190
to being queer in black
and brown communities?

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:12.054
DERAY MCKESSON: You know, I
worry about-- it in my head,

00:12:12.054 --> 00:12:13.470
I think about this
in the same way

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.261
that I think about
black on black violence.

00:12:15.261 --> 00:12:17.630
I don't want to
stigmatize blackness

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.090
as being like more homophobic
than anything else.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.840
I am black, and there
are definitely a lot

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.270
of black homophobic people.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.390
That is real.

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:28.670
I believe that there
are the same number

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:30.464
of homophobic people
in all communities.

00:12:30.464 --> 00:12:32.880
I have a different proximities
to black homophobic people,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.234
because I grew up
around black people.

00:12:35.234 --> 00:12:37.150
So I do think there is
something about the way

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.040
that masculinity
functions, especially

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.470
in marginalized communities
as a signifier of power

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:43.214
when you don't have power.

00:12:43.214 --> 00:12:45.880
What it means to be marginalized
is that you are on the margins,

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:46.380
right?

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.040
And on the margins, you
are unseen and unheard.

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.560
And I think that
there are moments

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.455
when you can perform a certain
way to be heard and seen

00:12:54.455 --> 00:12:55.580
in a way that's acceptable.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.170
And I think
masculinity functions

00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:59.150
like that, that
people can perform

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.410
a way to sort of mask
some of the things

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.070
that they struggle with about
being marginalized in general.

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:09.560
And I think that that encourages
a very subtle, though still

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:12.590
insidious form of
homophobia that is, I think,

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:14.620
particular because
of its manifestations

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:18.230
in marginalized communities,
but not unique in impact.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.847
SPEAKER: When you talk about on
these margins, the people who

00:13:21.847 --> 00:13:23.930
are marginalized and from
different angles because

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:26.320
of their identity, what
are some of the needs

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.292
that someone at these
intersections has?

00:13:29.292 --> 00:13:33.506
DERAY MCKESSON: When I think
about the intersectionality--

00:13:33.506 --> 00:13:35.880
I've started to talk about my
worries more publicly, just

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.135
because I want everybody
to push forward.

00:13:39.135 --> 00:13:41.010
But what I worry about
with intersectionality

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.680
is that people really only
care about their intersection,

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.565
right?

00:13:43.565 --> 00:13:45.670
That people are like,
intersectionality!

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:46.801
But here's where I stand.

00:13:46.801 --> 00:13:47.783
And you're like, eh?

00:13:47.783 --> 00:13:48.765
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:48.765 --> 00:13:50.850
I don't know.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.630
I think, at the simplest
level, it's this understanding

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.470
that we have complex identities,
and we are all of them

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.290
at the same time,
and that we, again,

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.305
build a world where
people get to do that.

00:14:00.305 --> 00:14:01.974
And it is true
that people should

00:14:01.974 --> 00:14:03.640
be able to speak for
their own, and they

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.310
should be able to talk
about their experience

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.690
in a way that is authentic,
to help people understand.

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:09.224
I'm an ally to the
trans community.

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:11.140
There are so many things
that I need to learn,

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.780
and I'm not the best spokesman.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.500
I definitely try to be the
best ally that I can be,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.397
which means that I have to
listen more than I talk, right?

00:14:18.397 --> 00:14:19.980
And I think that is
a key part of what

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.586
it means to stand
at the intersection,

00:14:21.586 --> 00:14:25.160
especially intersections
that are not ones you claim.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.000
But it is also about making
sure that you actually

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.500
believe in everybody's
intersections

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.416
and not just your own.

00:14:30.416 --> 00:14:31.960
And I think that
as the conversation

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.420
has become more and more
public that people really

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.220
are camping out in
the spaces that they

00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:37.620
feel the most comfortable.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:39.225
And I get it in the
sense that like,

00:14:39.225 --> 00:14:40.630
I try to be a really good ally.

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:41.880
I think I have a big platform.

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.129
I want to push these messages.

00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:45.770
I have to own, though, that
there are so many identities

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:47.780
that I don't know
intimately, that I'm still

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.010
learning and growing.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:50.642
And we have to
continue that mindset

00:14:50.642 --> 00:14:52.600
as we push forward in
the work, because I think

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.630
that is like the most honest.

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:55.802
I think that's the most
impactful and the most true.

00:14:55.802 --> 00:14:56.510
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.430
I want to shift
gears a little bit.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:01.770
You know, you talked about how
you got involved with the Black

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:02.740
Lives Matter movement.

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:04.729
But I want to hear more
about the great work

00:15:04.729 --> 00:15:06.270
that you're doing
with Campaign Zero,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.160
and if you could just give
us some background on how

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.130
that got started.

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.200
DERAY MCKESSON: So when I
think about the movement,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.580
I think about four phases.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.860
The first was like--
the first nine months,

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.010
we were helping people
understand that there was

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.730
a crisis across the country.

00:15:17.730 --> 00:15:20.120
So if you remember like
August 2014, people were like,

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.422
St. Louis is screwed up.

00:15:21.422 --> 00:15:22.380
Ferguson is screwed up.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.213
People were not like,
America has a problem.

00:15:24.213 --> 00:15:26.340
They were like, the police
in St. Louis are crazy.

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.480
And the police in St.
Louis are definitely crazy,

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.400
so that was true.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.400
But it was not only the
police in St. Louis.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.972
So it took until the death of
Sandra Bland, Walter Scott,

00:15:35.972 --> 00:15:37.680
Freddie Gray for people
to be like, OK, I

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.638
think there's like a
crisis across the country.

00:15:39.638 --> 00:15:40.390
And it's like, OK.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.140
And the second phase
of the work, I think,

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.540
is about helping people
understand and appreciate

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:46.450
that there are real
solutions out there.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:48.324
And that's where
Campaign Zero came in.

00:15:48.324 --> 00:15:49.990
So Campaign Zero is
modeled on this idea

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.615
that we can live in
a world where there

00:15:51.615 --> 00:15:52.780
are zero deaths by police.

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:55.660
In 2016 alone, there have
been nearly three people

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.290
killed by the police every day.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.370
In 2015, the police
killed somebody every day

00:15:59.370 --> 00:16:00.546
but 18 days in all states.

00:16:00.546 --> 00:16:01.046
Right?

00:16:01.046 --> 00:16:02.770
And we just didn't
know-- I didn't

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:05.020
know that was happening
before Mike Brown got killed.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.970
And we wanted to think about
what are the real policy

00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:10.664
solutions that we can put
forward to structurally end

00:16:10.664 --> 00:16:11.330
police violence.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:13.496
We believe that we can
change structures and systems

00:16:13.496 --> 00:16:14.670
in ways that change culture.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.124
That is a core belief.

00:16:16.124 --> 00:16:17.540
So it's everything
from the things

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.720
you've heard about--
select body cameras,

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.720
independent investigators--
to some stuff

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.180
that we did for the first time.

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.804
So we created the
first public database

00:16:24.804 --> 00:16:26.520
of police union contracts.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.180
Some Googlers helped
us out with that.

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:29.680
We created the first
public database

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.295
of use of force policies
around the country.

00:16:31.295 --> 00:16:33.620
And what we've come to believe
is that the police are actually

00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:34.750
hiding in plain sight.

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.480
So the Freddie Gray
verdict came down today.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.744
This officer was acquitted.

00:16:38.744 --> 00:16:41.410
And what I said to the newspaper
is like, this is disappointing,

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.320
but it is not surprising given
that we have a shadow justice

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.172
system for the police
that will protect

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:47.380
their behaviors at all costs.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.100
And what we're saying
is that the things

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.380
that actually protect the
police are public documents.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.289
So you look at the
police union contracts--

00:16:54.289 --> 00:16:55.830
I mean, in cities
across the country,

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:59.300
police can only be interrogated
for 30 minutes, hour chunks.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:02.310
And then they get a
legally obligated bathroom

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.980
break, phone calls, meals--
stuff that private citizens

00:17:05.980 --> 00:17:07.540
never get.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.800
Or you look at some of
the more insidious things.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.859
So there are clauses
around the country that

00:17:12.859 --> 00:17:14.440
will say like, the
police chief is

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.111
the final arbiter of discipline,
which most people are

00:17:17.111 --> 00:17:19.569
like, that make sense because
it's the police chief, right?

00:17:19.569 --> 00:17:22.740
So you're like, that's
a harmless clause.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:24.890
It is that clause that
prevents civilian oversight

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:27.119
boards from having any power.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:29.710
And the police have just
been amazing negotiators

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:32.940
in cities across the country,
putting this language

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.540
like so deeply embedded
that looks innocuous

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.610
but has huge consequences on
how we hold people accountable.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.650
So we've been trying to lift
that work up and expose that.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:44.030
And then the use
of force policies,

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:47.320
in cities across the country,
it is still OK to hogtie people.

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.900
Like Baltimore, you can still
hogtie and chokehold people.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.169
It's not against policy.

00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:52.210
It's not against the law.

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:53.972
It is totally acceptable.

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:55.180
And that's wild to us, right?

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.500
We don't think that makes sense.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.840
So we would say the
stuff that we're pushing

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.230
for is not very controversial.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:01.150
We think this is
really common sense.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:03.995
The police have done
an incredible job

00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:05.210
of systematizing it.

00:18:05.210 --> 00:18:06.635
So you think about
places like LA.

00:18:06.635 --> 00:18:08.510
The protections for the
police union contract

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.830
are in the charter
of the city itself.

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:14.662
So undoing it becomes this
crazy organizing battle.

00:18:14.662 --> 00:18:16.620
And there is some
disagreement about some stuff

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.920
about Campaign Zero race.

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:20.060
So we come out in
support of body cameras.

00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.226
There are a lot of organizers
around the country who

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:24.150
don't believe in body
cameras for reasons that

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:26.960
make complete sense, this
idea that if you believe

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.230
in community policing, which
is this notion that the police

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.395
should be in community.

00:18:31.395 --> 00:18:33.770
We think that that is a really
race-based way of thinking

00:18:33.770 --> 00:18:36.404
about the police, that if you
put police in the Upper West

00:18:36.404 --> 00:18:38.820
Side, and they were high-fiving
white kids as they got off

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:40.940
the bus and as kids
were playing basketball,

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:42.720
people would lose their minds.

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.400
But in black communities, it's
like the police should just

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.100
be everywhere, right?

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:46.700
They should be there
when you get off the bus.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.920
They should be on the corner.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.878
So we worry about that
with community policing.

00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:52.360
But if you believe in community
policing and body cameras,

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.680
you might create like a second
surveillance state, right?

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:58.910
If the police are ever present,
they have cameras on them,

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:02.247
they could amass this
wild batch of footage that

00:19:02.247 --> 00:19:04.330
could be used against
people for a host of things,

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:06.530
especially because,
for most crimes

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:09.100
the statute of limitations
it's pretty long, right?

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:11.770
So you like hit
somebody on the cheek,

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.390
three months later you're
arrested for assault.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:16.650
And we've seen the
police, even in St. Louis,

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:17.560
do things like that.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:20.370
They'll take footage of
somebody throwing something.

00:19:20.370 --> 00:19:22.430
Four weeks later,
they arrest you.

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:24.000
So we worry about those things.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.020
We believe, though,
that there are

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.560
structures that you can
put in place to hold

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.120
people accountable.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.286
The White House-- Megan,
who is the Chief Technology

00:19:29.286 --> 00:19:31.940
Officer in the country, they're
doing some really interesting

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.620
things around body cameras.

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.460
One of them is
looking at the audio

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:40.030
to see if we can use the audio
as a predictor of aggression

00:19:40.030 --> 00:19:42.680
in officers, to
identify officers

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.340
who are more likely
to abuse people

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:46.140
before there's actually trauma.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:48.050
Right now, the video
is all post-trauma.

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.270
It's like, you kill somebody,
we look at the video.

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:52.460
But could we use the audio in a
way that's really interesting?

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:54.460
And there's another partner
with the White House

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.390
that's looking at, can
we create a program

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:58.680
to trigger the
parts of the video

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.870
that a human eye should
look at and then delete

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:03.260
everything else, so the
government is just not

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.420
amassing footage
on people, which

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.630
we think is like an
interesting thing, too.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.520
So we love Campaign Zero,
met with Obama about it--

00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.530
and Valerie Jarrett, and
Bernie, and Hillary, and Loretta

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.840
Lynch-- to talk
about how we actually

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:18.851
make these things real.

00:20:18.851 --> 00:20:20.850
The reality, though, is
that most of the changes

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:22.080
happen at the local level.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:23.538
At the federal
level, we're working

00:20:23.538 --> 00:20:26.130
with the domestic-- Cecilia,
who runs the Domestic Policy

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:27.920
Council around the FBI.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.480
If an FBI agent kills you
today, you're screwed.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.750
Not only because you'll
be dead, but because there

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.480
is almost no way
that any activist can

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.849
hold them accountable.

00:20:39.849 --> 00:20:41.390
They don't release
the names, there's

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.470
nothing-- we don't know
anything about them.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:44.960
And what people
often don't realize

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:49.290
is that if you've heard any
number about police killings

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:51.910
at all, it is all from
newspaper clippings.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.180
That is the source of truth.

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.401
That is the most robust
status that we have.

00:20:55.401 --> 00:20:57.650
And we think that we've
actually been under-reporting.

00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:59.025
That if you get
killed in America

00:20:59.025 --> 00:21:01.130
and our newspaper
does not pick it up,

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:02.610
you are not in the data set.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.230
You literally are--
you don't exist.

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:09.170
And that is wild, and that has
huge consequences for how we

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:10.390
think about demographic data.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:12.080
So there are some
places in Texas

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.900
where the data looks like
white people are being

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.100
killed disproportionately.

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:17.849
We think that they are
Latino, but they're

00:21:17.849 --> 00:21:20.780
being miscoded because
it's newspaper clippings.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.310
So we are working with people
to do some backend cleansing.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:25.620
But that's even like the
"Washington Post" database,

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.145
the "Guardian's"
database, like all of it

00:21:27.145 --> 00:21:28.103
is newspaper clippings.

00:21:28.103 --> 00:21:29.940
If you get killed
in America, it's

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:32.400
not picked up by a newspaper,
you are not in the data set.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.070
And that is wild.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:37.290
SPEAKER: You brought
up a point about-- we

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:40.010
think about cops hanging
out, playing basketball

00:21:40.010 --> 00:21:41.250
in neighborhoods.

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:43.310
If that is not what's
providing safety,

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.110
then how can we change
the conversation

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.642
about what safety really means?

00:21:46.642 --> 00:21:48.600
DERAY MCKESSON: Yeah--
and I'm not against cops

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.891
potentially playing basketball.

00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:51.890
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.040
But there is a
notion of policing

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.070
that is like, they
should be ever present.

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.810
And then basketball becomes like
a proxy for the ever presence,

00:21:58.810 --> 00:21:59.310
right?

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.500
It doesn't become a way
to build community or as

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.801
a part of a larger strategy
about government and community

00:22:05.801 --> 00:22:06.300
building.

00:22:06.300 --> 00:22:07.690
It's like, well, the police
should be here anyway.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:09.065
They should pick
up a basketball.

00:22:09.065 --> 00:22:10.092
You're like, OK.

00:22:10.092 --> 00:22:11.550
I think that what's
real is that we

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:12.966
know the safety
of our communities

00:22:12.966 --> 00:22:15.119
is not predicated on
the presence of police.

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:17.160
That if I asked you where
you feel the most safe,

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.490
it's probably not in
a room full of police.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:21.530
It's probably in a
room where there's

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.820
family, where there's friends,
where people love you,

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:24.740
where there's food and shelter.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.960
That's what safety means.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.270
And then the question
for us becomes, how

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:28.510
do you scale that for people?

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.384
How do you make that
something that everybody

00:22:30.384 --> 00:22:31.560
can be a part of?

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.520
When we think about the police,
people often think about them

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.228
in three buckets.

00:22:36.410 --> 00:22:38.000
The first is crime prevention.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.208
And crime prevention really
isn't police work, right?

00:22:40.208 --> 00:22:42.300
That's like schools,
families, jobs.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.050
The second is about
the response to crime.

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:49.157
And the response to crime
is more of police work.

00:22:49.157 --> 00:22:51.490
But we know that one in four
people killed by the police

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:53.198
are people who have
mental health trauma.

00:22:53.198 --> 00:22:55.698
And the response to all trauma
can't be somebody with a gun.

00:22:55.698 --> 00:22:57.156
So you think about--
you know, I've

00:22:57.156 --> 00:22:59.970
talked to people who called for
help when their friend might

00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.309
threaten to commit suicide.

00:23:01.309 --> 00:23:03.100
And like somebody with
a gun isn't probably

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.557
the best responder
in that situation.

00:23:05.557 --> 00:23:07.140
So we have to start
thinking about how

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.247
do we not have a police
first response to all trauma.

00:23:10.247 --> 00:23:12.330
And then the third bucket
is around solving crime.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:15.267
And that is more police
work than not police work.

00:23:15.267 --> 00:23:16.850
But that can't happen
when there's not

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:18.014
trust and accountability.

00:23:18.014 --> 00:23:19.680
And the trust and
accountability doesn't

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.640
come when the police get
off on every single thing

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.210
that they do.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.270
That's why people won't call.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:29.552
That's why people don't
give them tips, right?

00:23:29.552 --> 00:23:31.010
That doesn't work
when you're like,

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:32.718
well, they're going
to beat up my cousin,

00:23:32.718 --> 00:23:34.200
or they beat up somebody I know.

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.750
That doesn't work.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:39.100
SPEAKER: So at Google, we love
data and measuring success

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.230
with numbers.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.735
You're tackling issues that are
so just large and important.

00:23:44.735 --> 00:23:46.860
When you go home, how do
you measure whether or not

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.440
you're successful, your
campaigns are successful?

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.000
And is there an end point?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.175
At what point do we say,
check, we did our job?

00:23:54.175 --> 00:23:55.050
DERAY MCKESSON: Yeah.

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.564
So I'm mindful about
a couple things.

00:23:57.564 --> 00:23:58.980
One is that the
movement is young,

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:02.840
that we won't undo 400 years of
oppression in 400 days, right?

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.760
That is not real.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.480
I'm also mindful
that so much of this

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.380
is about lifting
data sets and stories

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.890
and making them as
public as possible.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.120
So at Campaign Zero, we
have these huge data sets.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.350
And we're about to
launch a new way

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:16.740
to look at police
union contracts that

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.140
is a little easier
for people who

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.390
are about to launch a
new project around use

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:21.714
of force policies and laws.

00:24:21.714 --> 00:24:23.880
And we've been working with
a lot of people in tech.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:27.320
A lot of Googlers have been a
part of our Slack group about,

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.269
how do we actually just
make this simpler for people

00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:32.310
to access and understand?

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:34.500
Because we believe that the
truth is so damning that

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.100
it should radicalize people.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.040
But we have to get
the truth to people.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:38.930
How do we do that?

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:40.429
In terms of what
success looks like,

00:24:40.429 --> 00:24:42.734
I think that one
real part of it is

00:24:42.734 --> 00:24:44.400
changing the conversation,
which I think

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.300
we did and continue to do.

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:48.250
And then the next part
is like, how do we

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.590
continue to organize and build
power and coalitions as we

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.710
move forward?

00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:53.710
I believe two things.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:55.293
One is that there
are more people that

00:24:55.293 --> 00:24:57.210
want to do the work
than know what to do

00:24:57.210 --> 00:24:57.980
and there are more
people that want

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.780
to do the work than
want to be members.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.070
I think we're in
this unique moment

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:05.149
where people have this
aversion to membership.

00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:06.440
Like they want to do good work.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:07.960
If you told them like,
do these three things,

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.930
they're like, yes.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.590
If you say, like, will
you be a member of this?

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:11.464
They're like, eh, no.

00:25:11.464 --> 00:25:13.629
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:13.629 --> 00:25:15.170
Which doesn't mean
there's not a role

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.530
for membership-based
organizations.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:17.260
I think there is.

00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:18.570
I think there will always be.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:21.820
I think there's also a challenge
and a role for organizers

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.910
to think about how to
mobilize and activate people

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:26.640
with whom you share the
same values and beliefs

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:28.400
but don't want to be members.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.750
My belief about
that, my hypothesis,

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.730
is that there is a
generation of us who grew up

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:33.820
being members of everything.

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:35.278
You were a member
of this and this.

00:25:37.637 --> 00:25:39.470
you still carry a little
bit of that around.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:40.982
So you're a little gun shy.

00:25:40.982 --> 00:25:43.440
Or you just don't want to sit
in the basement of a whatever

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.280
every Wednesday, right?

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.440
That just isn't how you think
about being in the world today.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.850
But if somebody said, will
you do these three things,

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.524
you would totally do them.

00:25:50.524 --> 00:25:51.940
And we're trying
to figure out how

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.260
to continue to mobilize people
around those sort of issues.

00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.560
That we don't care if
you're a member or not,

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.930
as long as you do the work.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:25:57.990
And how do we do that?

00:25:57.990 --> 00:25:59.832
And how do we
demystify organizing?

00:25:59.832 --> 00:26:02.040
I think that there are some
people who have organized

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.295
for 30 years and da, da, da.

00:26:04.295 --> 00:26:07.715
You know, I grew up in
Baltimore as an organizer in '99

00:26:07.715 --> 00:26:08.870
and when I was a teenager.

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.804
So I'm one of the people
who organized before.

00:26:11.804 --> 00:26:14.220
But I do think that there are
people in the movement space

00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:15.910
that sort of make
organizing out to be

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.220
this mythical thing, right?

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.330
You've got to call the
ancestors and get a conversation

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:21.830
with them.

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.332
You've got to read 15 books.

00:26:23.332 --> 00:26:25.665
And I think organizing at its
root is this idea of like,

00:26:25.665 --> 00:26:27.080
I believe the work
can be better.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:27.650
Here's how.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.300
Let me find other people
who believe that with me.

00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:30.850
Like that is what organizing is.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:33.224
That's how it starts.

00:26:33.224 --> 00:26:35.140
And that's how I think
about measuring it now.

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.556
I think that at
some point we will

00:26:36.556 --> 00:26:39.910
need to be honest about whether
police violence is decreasing

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:40.990
or not.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:43.030
So once we actually
institutionalize change,

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.790
if there is no change
in the outcomes,

00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:46.300
then we haven't done it right.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:47.570
And I think the third
phase of the work

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:49.028
is about
institutionalizing change.

00:26:49.028 --> 00:26:50.510
So we change the
conversation, we

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.200
help people believe
in solutions,

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.520
we institutionalize the change.

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.728
And the fourth bucket is
around protecting the change

00:26:55.728 --> 00:26:56.580
once we make it.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.750
So you think about
the Voting Rights Act,

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.700
as a great example
of the protect phase,

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.620
wasn't done well.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.570
That like the rollbacks happened
in a really intense way.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.324
They got incredible traction
with the Voting Rights Act,

00:27:08.324 --> 00:27:09.990
and now it's been
repealed a little bit.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.531
So how do we put these changes
in and then actually make sure

00:27:12.531 --> 00:27:15.490
that they are livable things
that we see the fruit of?

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.367
SPEAKER: So I want to
change topics a little bit.

00:27:18.367 --> 00:27:19.950
There was a really
interesting article

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:23.340
that came out last year on
"People Magazine" entitled

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.790
"Dear Black Men, You Are
Not Pro-black if You Are Not

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.310
Pro Black Women."

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:28.620
Do you see this?

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.130
Is that something
is present-- like

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:33.170
do you see the erasure of women
in black and brown communities?

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:34.420
And how could we address that?

00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:34.715
DERAY MCKESSON: Yeah.

00:27:34.715 --> 00:27:37.000
And I think erasure often
manifests in two ways.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.875
One is that either our
stories are never told

00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:40.670
or they're told by
everybody but us.

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:42.420
And what's been powerful
about this moment

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:44.390
is that everybody gets
to be a storyteller.

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:46.380
So I think about so
many incredible women

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.896
of color who are leading,
who are organizing,

00:27:48.896 --> 00:27:50.270
who are telling
their own stories

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.560
and not waiting for
somebody-- they don't have

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.480
to wait for somebody
else to tell their story,

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:54.938
because there's
not a barrier there

00:27:54.938 --> 00:27:57.379
in terms of who gets to
be storytellers anymore.

00:27:57.379 --> 00:27:58.670
I think that's really powerful.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.630
I think that there
is so much more work

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:05.580
to be done around
sexism in that space,

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:09.900
and I do think that it is better
and hard that we are having all

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.730
these conversations in public.

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.200
I think that people are learning
from these conversations

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.460
about sexism and misogyny
because they essentially

00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.980
get to participate
as viewers first.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.237
And I think that that is
easier for some people

00:28:21.237 --> 00:28:22.070
before they step in.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:23.653
I know a lot of
people who are worried

00:28:23.653 --> 00:28:25.100
about saying the wrong thing.

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:28.310
But they are well-intentioned,
but the way they approach it,

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.564
you're like, that was not it.

00:28:30.564 --> 00:28:32.730
But because of social media,
it has really opened up

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:34.350
space for them to like watch.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.234
They can participate
by viewing first,

00:28:36.234 --> 00:28:37.650
and then they can
sort of dive in.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:38.941
I think that's really powerful.

00:28:38.941 --> 00:28:41.820
But I do think the movement
is important in the sense

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.970
that there are men and women
working together-- women

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.380
leading in new ways, and
being present and visible,

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:49.690
and not having to be in
the background in the way

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:52.620
that they might have
been in the past.

00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:56.310
And the people of complex
identities around sexuality

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:59.090
get to be present
in a way, and be

00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.790
open about those
identities in ways

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.170
that they couldn't be before.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:04.170
SPEAKER: Something that
is personally really sad

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.730
to me is we live in a country
where one in five women

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:07.900
will be sexually assaulted.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:11.280
And the average life expectancy
of a black trans woman

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.420
is 35 years.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.289
You've brought some really
challenging things to light,

00:29:16.289 --> 00:29:18.580
and you've created a platform
where we can successfully

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.163
highlight the way
that our society has

00:29:20.163 --> 00:29:21.390
failed these communities.

00:29:21.390 --> 00:29:24.690
What advice can you give
us to create platforms

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:27.435
where we can continue
to address the issues?

00:29:27.435 --> 00:29:29.820
DERAY MCKESSON: Yeah,
I think that-- so I'm

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:30.710
a Twitter evangelist.

00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:31.390
I love Twitter.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:32.440
Twitter's great.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.730
Twitter.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.050
I know you work at Google.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:35.550
Twitter.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:36.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:38.700
SPEAKER: Do you post on G+ ever?

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:38.820
DERAY MCKESSON: Huh?

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:39.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.700
SPEAKER: Do you
have a G+ account?

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.827
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:41.827 --> 00:29:42.910
We've got to get you a G+.

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.260
DERAY MCKESSON: Awkward,
awkward, awkward.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.666
I search all day long.

00:29:46.666 --> 00:29:48.034
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.170
I say that because I do
think that storytelling is

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.490
one of our most powerful tools.

00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:57.240
And at the root of
every story is an idea,

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.150
and ideas matter because
they inform the way

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:00.070
we think about the world.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:01.569
And the way we think
about the world

00:30:01.569 --> 00:30:03.411
is the way we act in the world.

00:30:03.411 --> 00:30:06.892
And when I think about
the trans community--

00:30:06.892 --> 00:30:09.100
when I think about what is
the next part of the work,

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.600
it's like, how do we tell these
complex stories in ways that

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.770
are simpler for people
and allow them to think

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:15.590
about things they can do?

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:18.030
So we are about to
work on a project that

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:21.730
is going to catalog all the
laws that have been introduced,

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:23.660
that are damaging to
the trans community,

00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.236
and put them in a
really cool space

00:30:25.236 --> 00:30:26.860
and help people see
so that we can tell

00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.660
this story about-- like the
people we're fighting against

00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:29.890
are actually really
organized, right?

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:31.320
There's something common
about all these pieces

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.270
of legislation.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:34.331
And then here is actually
how you can combat it.

00:30:34.331 --> 00:30:35.330
Here are talking points.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:37.850
Here's how we equip you,
in a very visceral way,

00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:41.035
with things to do.

00:30:41.035 --> 00:30:43.410
Having been so close to the
work over the last 20 months,

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:45.910
I think that sometimes
that people on the fringe,

00:30:45.910 --> 00:30:50.582
like the most insider of us, we
start to think that everybody

00:30:50.582 --> 00:30:52.540
thinks the way we do, or
everybody sort of sees

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.123
the world the way
we do, or everybody,

00:30:54.123 --> 00:30:56.010
like, obviously they
know that talking point,

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:57.560
and they obviously
know it's wrong.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:59.435
And I will never forget
the first nine months

00:30:59.435 --> 00:31:01.477
of the movement where
there were black people who

00:31:01.477 --> 00:31:03.393
were like, I don't think
the police are crazy.

00:31:03.393 --> 00:31:05.630
And we're like, the police
literally just killed him.

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:06.850
And they're like, but that
wasn't my neighborhood.

00:31:06.850 --> 00:31:08.150
And you're like, what?

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:13.220
So it took us mobilizing our
own community a long time

00:31:13.220 --> 00:31:17.072
to help people actually believe
that this was close to them.

00:31:17.072 --> 00:31:19.030
And I think that with
the work around identity,

00:31:19.030 --> 00:31:21.488
we can't take for granted that
there are people who we love

00:31:21.488 --> 00:31:24.662
and who love us who still
don't get it but want to.

00:31:24.662 --> 00:31:26.120
And then it's like,
how do we equip

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.310
them to get it on
their own and to get it

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:31.034
with more data and information?

00:31:31.034 --> 00:31:33.200
And I think about some of
the things about identity,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.260
we haven't-- there's just not
a public space yet to learn

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.290
the right things to say.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:40.400
I think about "love is
love" as a great example.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.120
So when Orlando
happened, people offered

00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.560
really interesting
push-back on love is love.

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.500
And what they were saying is
that like, yes, love is love,

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.220
but my identity--
like my sexuality

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.591
is not just based on whether
I'm in a relationship or not,

00:31:53.591 --> 00:31:55.840
which I think is an interesting
way to think about it.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.170
And that language,
I don't know if I

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:01.170
would have been exposed
to that if I just hadn't

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.360
been on Twitter that day.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.200
How do we help
people be in places

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.610
or go places to like
complicate the way they

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:09.199
think about the world so they
can be better in the world.

00:32:09.199 --> 00:32:10.990
Because I think that
is-- you're like, yes,

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:13.830
"love is love" sort of
reinforces this idea that you

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:17.500
are gay as long as you like
visibly love somebody else

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.600
who is also same gender.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.570
How do we say that
that is a part of it,

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:24.990
but that is-- I'm gay whether
I'm single or not, right?

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.580
And I think that we have to do
more of that storytelling work

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.496
and be really
intentional about it.

00:32:29.496 --> 00:32:31.870
And I think that sometimes we
take for granted that part.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:33.320
We're like, we're just
going to put the data out,

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.528
and we're going to do da, da.

00:32:34.528 --> 00:32:36.600
And we miss the simple
truths that people

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.065
can repeat over and over.

00:32:38.065 --> 00:32:40.360
And "love is love" is a
great simple truth, right?

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.177
It's simple, repeated
over and over.

00:32:43.177 --> 00:32:44.760
It's like, how do
we complicate those,

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:46.468
and how do we create
new ones that people

00:32:46.468 --> 00:32:49.880
can do that really push
the work, you know?

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.885
SPEAKER: I feel like
sometimes I can physically

00:32:51.885 --> 00:32:54.260
see people getting uncomfortable
when we talk about race.

00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.960
Why are we so uncomfortable
having these conversations?

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.376
DERAY MCKESSON: I
think some of it

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:00.240
is there's still
a lot of trauma,

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:03.230
and people haven't dealt
with their own trauma, which

00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:04.290
is no indictment of them.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:06.830
Because you shouldn't live
in a world where you were

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.700
traumatized.

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.890
Some of it, too,
is that-- there are

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:13.140
a lot of people who are
afraid of the outcome, right?

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:16.051
They think that there's going
be a lot of loss that comes.

00:33:16.051 --> 00:33:18.050
So you think about the
privileging of whiteness.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:21.060
I know white people
who totally get

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.950
white privilege, who
are like, it is bad,

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:24.870
and don't want it to end.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.230
Like they want to
dismantle white privilege

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.940
but can't imagine
a world without it.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:31.217
And I think that is real.

00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:33.800
And it's like, how do we have a
public conversation about what

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:35.220
that looks like?

00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.430
You will not have the
privilege once it's gone.

00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.940
Right?

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.650
That is a condition of the
end of white privilege.

00:33:40.650 --> 00:33:43.310
And I think there are people
who conceptually don't get that

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:43.810
yet.

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:44.370
They're like, yeah, that's bad!

00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:45.560
And you're like, you're
not going to have it,

00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.310
and they're like, no!

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:47.310
And you're like, no, no.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:48.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.340
So how do we talk about that?

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.990
And then I think that there
is a real thing-- you know,

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.540
I've come to understand
that my role is not always

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:59.575
to be the person giving lectures
to people about ending racism,

00:33:59.575 --> 00:34:00.380
right?

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:02.251
That some of this
work is about asking--

00:34:02.251 --> 00:34:04.250
being the person sitting
with people asking them

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.791
the question.

00:34:04.791 --> 00:34:07.302
That if I'm trying to get
you to change your mind,

00:34:07.302 --> 00:34:09.510
and I know you approach it
from a problematic space--

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.020
like me lecturing
you for 20 minutes

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.250
probably isn't going to do that.

00:34:12.250 --> 00:34:14.541
But if I say to you, like,
should Freddie Gray be dead?

00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:16.860
And we start from there,
like a real honest space,

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.818
and then you say something,
and then I respond,

00:34:18.818 --> 00:34:20.902
that actually is probably
better at converting you

00:34:20.902 --> 00:34:22.359
than me being like,
I can't believe

00:34:22.359 --> 00:34:24.110
you think that Freddie
Gray killed himself

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:25.570
and six people watched him.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:26.212
You know?

00:34:26.212 --> 00:34:28.420
You enter the conversation
not believing that, right?

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.004
So me yelling at you about
it isn't going to do that.

00:34:31.004 --> 00:34:32.420
And I think that
there's something

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.750
that we do as much as
marginalized people who

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:36.270
live this every
day, that we hear

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:37.936
people say problematic
things, and we're

00:34:37.936 --> 00:34:40.250
like, argh, which makes
sense to me, because it

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:41.587
is emotional and real.

00:34:41.587 --> 00:34:43.420
I think that, in terms
of converting people,

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.290
sometimes our approach
can be like the really

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:48.949
thoughtful, incisive question
that puts the onus back

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:49.929
on them.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:51.389
They actually have
to do the work.

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:53.722
Because sometimes we get so
riled up doing all the work,

00:34:53.722 --> 00:34:55.219
we're over-processing things.

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:56.790
And they walk away
still believing

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:58.740
the same thing, totally chill.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.030
You're worked up.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.750
You need a nap!

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:02.519
You're like, I'm done today!

00:35:02.519 --> 00:35:04.810
And they actually haven't
thought anything differently.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.018
And I think that that's real.

00:35:06.018 --> 00:35:08.700
And also white people
have to figure out

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:11.292
how to organize white people
and challenge white people.

00:35:11.292 --> 00:35:13.000
So think about there
are white people who

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.459
are going to say and do things
about race around each other

00:35:15.459 --> 00:35:16.916
that they would
never do around me,

00:35:16.916 --> 00:35:18.610
which is probably
better for both of us.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:21.667
But it is about, how do we get
white people in those spaces

00:35:21.667 --> 00:35:23.250
to hold other white
people accountable

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:26.120
and truly push them to
think about the stories

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.770
that they allow other people to
tell, the truth that they allow

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.861
other people to
disseminate over and over,

00:35:30.861 --> 00:35:32.860
and then how they use
their resources and skills

00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:34.540
and abilities in this work.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.190
You know, I met a lot of
people, and we rarely, if ever,

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.350
ask people for money.

00:35:39.350 --> 00:35:42.080
And we met a lot of
really interesting people.

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:44.661
We always ask people for
their time and talent.

00:35:44.661 --> 00:35:46.910
Because that is a conversation
about resources, right?

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:48.640
If I'm in a room
with a billionaire,

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.680
I don't need a gazillion--
if money alone could fix it,

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.650
we would have fixed it.

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:55.180
I need to figure out how we
can use your time and talent

00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.200
to create new something, right?

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.040
And if you-- who
can I pick on that

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.450
won't be-- so I think about
like there's some people,

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:05.630
it's like, skip the street.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.710
We don't need you in the street.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:07.660
Don't come to the street.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:09.060
But you calling
the governor means

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.601
something very different than
me calling the governor, right?

00:36:11.601 --> 00:36:13.710
And how do we be really
clear with people

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:16.000
about how you use your
access and privilege in ways

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.890
that change people's
lives for the better?

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:20.390
SPEAKER: So with
that point, there's

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.014
people here that have
incredible skills

00:36:22.014 --> 00:36:24.450
and have a lot of access, and
we have a lot of privilege.

00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:27.950
How do we identify what
to do with that access

00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:30.350
to really drive social
and economic change?

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:32.850
DERAY MCKESSON: I think that--
so there are a couple things.

00:36:32.850 --> 00:36:35.391
One is you can join people who
have already made a commitment

00:36:35.391 --> 00:36:37.590
to doing the work, right?

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:41.610
I'm sensitive, though, that
you also-- you probably

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:44.620
have an idea of that cool
thing that should exist,

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:46.120
that you're like,
I think it exists,

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.510
but I don't want to create
it, because it might exist.

00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:50.590
Like most of us have those ideas
when we think about this work.

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:52.926
And you can actually
start that right now.

00:36:52.926 --> 00:36:54.550
And you don't need
permission to do it.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.510
You don't need a huge
platform to do it.

00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:58.124
I think about some
of the cool-- Sam,

00:36:58.124 --> 00:36:59.790
who built Mapping
Police Violence, which

00:36:59.790 --> 00:37:02.110
is one of the projects
in Campaign Zero.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:03.660
Sam lived in San Francisco.

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.590
He randomly tweeted
me one day and was

00:37:05.590 --> 00:37:07.090
like, DeRay, I want
to do something.

00:37:07.090 --> 00:37:10.020
I DM'd him back my phone
number, and we had a good call.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:10.990
He made this website.

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:12.850
We pushed it out to everybody,
and it was like a thing,

00:37:12.850 --> 00:37:13.370
you know?

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:14.932
And now Sam's a
part of our team.

00:37:14.932 --> 00:37:16.390
But he was somebody
who was like, I

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:18.290
think we should map police
violence in a different way.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:20.081
And I was like, build
it, and we'll totally

00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:20.970
help people see it.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.050
I think there are
a lot of-- I think

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:26.330
there's this myth that people
have to join these existing

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:27.780
structures or da da da da.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.990
And if you want to,
you should, right?

00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:32.440
Because there are a lot of
great organizations out there.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.900
But I think about the
movement as a space,

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.205
that no organization that
got us together in Ferguson.

00:37:36.205 --> 00:37:36.770
Right?

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:39.230
This infrastructure
emerged, and there's

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.709
a difference between
organizations

00:37:40.709 --> 00:37:41.500
and infrastructure.

00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:42.450
The infrastructure is there.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:43.110
I was a tweeter.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:44.780
There were people who
were live streamers.

00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:45.696
There was a bail fund.

00:37:45.696 --> 00:37:47.860
Like we all worked
together, and there

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:51.024
was like some sort of unwritten
rules about how we'd interact.

00:37:51.024 --> 00:37:52.440
But there was no
like organization

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:55.270
that we had to join to
be in the movement space.

00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:57.130
And I think now
people sort of feel

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.255
like they got to join
something to be a part of it.

00:37:59.255 --> 00:38:01.560
But you probably already
know that really cool thing

00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.660
that should exist.

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:05.490
I think about, somebody
used Twilio last week

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:07.674
to make a phone number
that if people dialed it--

00:38:07.674 --> 00:38:09.840
you dial the phone number,
you put in your zip code,

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:12.080
and it automatically
called your two senators

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.580
and representatives
around gun control.

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:15.500
Really simple.

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.440
It would have taken me
like 10 years to make.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:19.770
Took this guy like 10 seconds.

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:20.530
He made it.

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:21.680
He had no platform.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.180
We found out about it because
we know some people at Twilio.

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.010
We blasted it out to
like all these people.

00:38:27.010 --> 00:38:30.070
And like Russell Simmons,
he put it in his networks.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.699
We pushed it out
really wide and far.

00:38:31.699 --> 00:38:33.490
And he just made it on
his own time, right?

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:35.600
Like I don't know
him, but we totally

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.640
made that thing a bigger
thing than it was on its own.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:41.150
And he didn't need
to join anybody.

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:42.770
He just thought it was
the right thing to do.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:43.750
And now we love Twilio.

00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:47.070
We're like, Twily everything!

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:48.703
But yeah, so if
you want to do some

00:38:48.703 --> 00:38:51.230
of the stuff we're doing, like
we have a Slack group of just

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:54.070
tech people, people who
are committed to building

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:58.554
new platforms that help
people think about the problem

00:38:58.554 --> 00:38:59.970
differently, and
most importantly,

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:01.150
think about the
solutions differently.

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.570
Because I worry in
the movement space

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.695
that it's easier to talk
about the problems than it

00:39:04.695 --> 00:39:05.510
is the solutions.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.070
That like there's this
addiction to being like,

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:07.850
the world is bad.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:09.602
And it's like, got
it, got it, got it.

00:39:09.602 --> 00:39:10.810
And it's like, what do we do?

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:12.060
People are like, I don't know!

00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:13.360
Well, that's not helpful.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.920
So we'd much rather
at least keep

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.590
failing around the
solutions than only

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:18.396
talking about the problems.

00:39:18.396 --> 00:39:20.830
And there's an easy way
to be a part of our team

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:22.882
but, again, you can
be a part of-- you

00:39:22.882 --> 00:39:24.840
being in the work will
make you better at this.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.840
And I know a lot of people
in the tech community

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.270
specifically who have
joined and been in spaces,

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.610
and they might be quiet
in them, but they go home

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:33.330
and they're like, oh my god,
I heard a person say that.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:34.788
We should totally
think about this.

00:39:34.788 --> 00:39:35.590
And it's like, yes!

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:37.124
That's often how
this work starts.

00:39:37.124 --> 00:39:38.540
And I worry sometimes
that there's

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.460
this myth that like-- I don't
know, again, you get this phone

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.460
call from the ancestors.

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:43.793
It's like, please do this today.

00:39:43.793 --> 00:39:46.520
And that's not what happens.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:49.800
SPEAKER: So what
about #activism?

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.920
Is it better that we're
talking about the problem?

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.920
You say we like to talk
about problem, solution.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.230
Is #activism helping?

00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:58.420
Or is it just like
procrastinating people

00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.462
actually making a change?

00:39:59.462 --> 00:40:01.753
DERAY MCKESSON: Yeah, I think
that I'll never criticize

00:40:01.753 --> 00:40:02.970
people for telling the truth.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:05.159
And I think that truth
telling is such a hard thing,

00:40:05.159 --> 00:40:07.450
especially for people of
color and marginalized people.

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.825
And if Twitter is like the
space that you tell the truth,

00:40:09.825 --> 00:40:11.420
then I'm all about it.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:15.869
Truth telling has been
such a difficult thing,

00:40:15.869 --> 00:40:17.910
has been a thing that this
country has prohibited

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:20.170
black people from organizing
around and doing it

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:23.050
that I will always honor
the fact that people use

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:26.110
digital spaces to tell the
truth in. [? That is ?] real,

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:29.910
knowing that that
is, again, not always

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.160
the end of the work, right?

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.154
That that is often the
beginning of the work.

00:40:33.154 --> 00:40:34.320
But that has a role to play.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:37.109
And if it were not for Twitter
in St. Louis in August 2014,

00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:39.400
Missouri would have convinced
you that we didn't exist.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:39.590
You know?

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:40.500
They literally would
have been like,

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.350
those people aren't there!

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.770
And it was like, that is crazy!

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:44.186
So when you think
about Baltimore,

00:40:44.186 --> 00:40:46.120
what makes Baltimore
stand out is not only

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.760
the circumstances of
Freddie's death and sort

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.120
of Baltimore's proximity to
DC and all this other stuff.

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.210
It is that it was the
first big city in protest

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:56.050
that you saw aerial footage of.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:58.630
Because you didn't see
any of that in St. Louis.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:41:01.430
Because they put a no-fly
zone on like August 11.

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.090
They got the game down.

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:05.690
So if it wasn't for social
media, like literally

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:06.910
you wouldn't have seen it.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:08.910
I get frustrated now
talking about the protests,

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:10.284
because people
think that we like

00:41:10.284 --> 00:41:11.850
marched in solidarity
with the '60s.

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.240
And we were like
marching because that was

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.525
what we thought protest was.

00:41:14.525 --> 00:41:17.740
It was illegal to stand still
in August of 2014 in St. Louis,

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:18.410
right?

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:22.040
We marched because we literally
could not stand still.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.700
It was called the
five-second rule.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:26.660
And it was like, you can't
stand still, and you can't pace,

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.510
and you can't return
to the same spot.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:30.597
So you couldn't
like walk down there

00:41:30.597 --> 00:41:31.930
and then come back to this spot.

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:33.370
It was wild, you know?

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:35.200
And that was the
world we lived in.

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.930
And you didn't necessarily see
all of that on TV and stuff

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:41.170
because they had put such
an effective blackout

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:42.780
on the media.

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.660
But again, the fact
that you saw anything

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.670
was because we had social media.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:50.880
And I'll never criticize
social media for that.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.570
I do think that this
has to be a combination

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.330
of the online and offline,
that that has to be real.

00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.301
It is always funny
to me that people

00:41:58.301 --> 00:42:00.550
take to Twitter to talk about
how much Twitter doesn't

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:01.455
matter.

00:42:01.455 --> 00:42:05.390
And you're like, if it didn't
matter, why are you posting?

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:06.912
But yeah, no, so
I think that most

00:42:06.912 --> 00:42:09.120
of the critiques that people
offer about social media

00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.900
are disingenuous, or
it's people who loved it

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.320
when they had a big platform.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.550
And now that people
aren't listening to them,

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.258
they're like, oh my
god, Twitter's awful.

00:42:16.258 --> 00:42:17.537
And you're like, meh.

00:42:17.537 --> 00:42:18.120
SPEAKER: Well.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:19.400
I'd love to open up the floor.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.950
If anyone has questions,
we have a mic over here.

00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:23.430
We'd love to hear your thoughts.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:26.014
AUDIENCE: I have a question
as a black straight male,

00:42:26.014 --> 00:42:28.180
like how you said about
white people should organize

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.130
other white people
about issues, how can I

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:32.460
organize other black males?

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:34.340
Because there was like
an issue at our school

00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.965
where some people-- like some of
the black [INAUDIBLE] students

00:42:36.965 --> 00:42:39.120
[? that have ?] woke were
unaware of the sexism

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.984
and homophobia they
projected on the people

00:42:40.984 --> 00:42:42.150
they're trying to fight for.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:45.130
They still would say some
of the very sexist things

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:47.320
behind in our group meetings
and stuff like that.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.840
So how can I have it where I
can have an open conversation

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.170
with them and tell them,
beware of their microagression

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:53.837
stuff they have?

00:42:53.837 --> 00:42:55.294
Because some of
them are just like,

00:42:55.294 --> 00:42:56.710
I can't be sexist
and homophobic.

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:59.487
Or like, they think they
don't have certain privileges,

00:42:59.487 --> 00:43:02.070
because they don't think what's
happening in America with them

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:03.525
as a black male,
they don't think

00:43:03.525 --> 00:43:04.900
they have any
privileges of being

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:06.025
a straight male in America.

00:43:06.025 --> 00:43:08.149
So how can I have the open
discussion or activities

00:43:08.149 --> 00:43:10.170
to make them aware of
these sort of things

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.170
and make them more inclusive
of the other people

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:13.878
we're supposed to
represent and help out?

00:43:13.878 --> 00:43:15.075
DERAY MCKESSON: That's real.

00:43:15.075 --> 00:43:16.740
I'm mindful that we
aren't born woke.

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.657
Something wakes us up.

00:43:17.657 --> 00:43:19.656
And there's like a real
difference between being

00:43:19.656 --> 00:43:21.140
woke and staying woke.

00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:24.295
And I think about myself.

00:43:24.295 --> 00:43:26.295
There are people who are
like, I like you DeRay!

00:43:26.295 --> 00:43:27.970
And they hate gay people, right?

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:28.820
But they're like, I like you!

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.910
And you're like,
eh, I don't know.

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:30.460
I don't know [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:31.348
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:32.624 --> 00:43:33.290
A couple things.

00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:35.700
One is that this work
is often slow for people

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:39.080
to own their growth areas around
these sort of deep things,

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.860
right?

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:43.310
I also think that some of
the most effective ways

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:45.770
to change individual
people's hearts and mind

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:48.150
is in private
sometimes, and then

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:50.806
using examples that are
not necessarily about them,

00:43:50.806 --> 00:43:52.430
that they don't
realize are about them,

00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:53.890
but that are about them.

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:56.560
So I think about people who say
some really problematic stuff.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.330
And if I say to them,
you just said that thing

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:00.810
that is really
crazy, then we'd be

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:02.129
fighting for the next whatever.

00:44:02.129 --> 00:44:03.670
But if I say to
them, I can't believe

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:06.680
that person said that, which
is really what they just said.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.044
And then we use that as
a launching pad and then

00:44:09.044 --> 00:44:11.460
sort of, at the end, get back
to like, you said that, too,

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.710
and that was really problematic.

00:44:14.710 --> 00:44:18.110
I think that people need
to process this stuff.

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:20.980
And I say that because I've
seen people try and beat people

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:22.060
over the head about it.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:23.255
Like you are homophobic,
and da, da, da,

00:44:23.255 --> 00:44:25.532
which I think there's a
place for sometimes, right?

00:44:25.532 --> 00:44:27.240
Because some people
just say wild things,

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:29.370
and you've got to
check it real quick.

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:34.010
But there are some people
who are trying but need

00:44:34.010 --> 00:44:36.530
a different space to try.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:39.140
I know a lot of straight men
who are really transphobic

00:44:39.140 --> 00:44:40.290
and don't know it.

00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:43.110
They think they are
standing in solidarity

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:46.675
with the trans community
but are super problematic.

00:44:46.675 --> 00:44:48.050
And it's like,
how do we actually

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.410
have those conversations
with people

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:54.362
like in really honest, closed
spaces that allow them to grow?

00:44:54.362 --> 00:44:56.320
I think about my conversation
with Charlemagne.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.790
Charlemagne said some
really problematic things

00:44:57.790 --> 00:44:59.340
about the trans community.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:01.160
But if I had gone
in being like, you

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.500
said this, like I don't
think we would have

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:03.640
had a productive conversation.

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.660
As opposed to like,
Charlemagne, let's

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:06.120
just talk about
this a little bit.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.490
And he moved much further
than he had before publicly

00:45:09.490 --> 00:45:10.740
and when we talked afterwards.

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.490
And I think that that has
to be some of how we do it.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:17.972
But it is important to have
people see that they have

00:45:17.972 --> 00:45:19.180
done some of this too, right?

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.060
That you said "faggot"
and that was really--

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:22.893
me and Azealia Banks
had that back and forth

00:45:22.893 --> 00:45:25.350
on Twitter about her
saying "faggot," right?

00:45:25.350 --> 00:45:26.850
And she was like,
DeRay, da, da, da.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:28.935
And she texted me being
like, da, da, da, da.

00:45:28.935 --> 00:45:30.460
And then last week,
she's like, I will never

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:31.251
say "faggot" again.

00:45:31.251 --> 00:45:33.200
It's like, oh, OK,
thanks Azealia.

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.440
This took a long time coming.

00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.356
But it was about how
do I say like that

00:45:37.356 --> 00:45:38.480
is just problematic, right?

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:40.980
And we can talk about it, but
I want to say to you publicly,

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.580
this is not OK.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.690
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:44.160
DERAY MCKESSON: Yep.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.035
AUDIENCE: I'm Marnie.

00:45:45.035 --> 00:45:50.460
I identify as transgender and
have done training sessions

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.640
here at Google called
[? Trans at ?] Google.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:55.850
And some of it is
definitely dumbed down.

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:57.210
Like it's kind of a 101.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:00.070
And there's a really interesting
conversation happening

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:03.304
within the trans Google
community about, you know,

00:46:03.304 --> 00:46:07.580
how much of this is
our responsibility

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:12.390
and why are we having to
justify our existence?

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:16.410
And I'm kind of the
mind, well, there

00:46:16.410 --> 00:46:19.120
are people out there who aren't
malicious, and we need allies.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:19.900
That's important.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.290
But I think a part
of me is like, oh,

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:24.180
is this just
internalized transphobia,

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:27.190
that that's the reason I'm out
here justifying my identity?

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:30.000
And so I guess I was wondering
what your thoughts are,

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.240
and I think that's a debate
in a lot of different places.

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.430
DERAY MCKESSON: Yeah.

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:35.080
That's real.

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:35.660
That's a real question.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.170
I think about, there are
a lot of black people

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:39.336
who are like, it's not my
work to teach white people

00:46:39.336 --> 00:46:40.330
about blackness, right?

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.260
They're like, go read.

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:42.940
There are a lot of
things out there.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.320
I think the reality is that it
is not everybody's work, right?

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.986
That there are some
people who are like,

00:46:46.986 --> 00:46:48.560
this is not how I
plan to show up.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:50.476
This is not what I think
it means to organize,

00:46:50.476 --> 00:46:53.170
and that is real, and
we should honor that.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:56.632
We shouldn't force people to
teach people other things.

00:46:56.632 --> 00:46:58.090
The other thing,
though, is that is

00:46:58.090 --> 00:46:59.600
how some people think
about their work,

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.590
and that is also real.

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:03.860
And we should allow
them to do that.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:06.845
And I would rather me help
you think through something

00:47:06.845 --> 00:47:10.770
than you like read some crazy
thing from some crazy person,

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.520
and then you think
that that is the truth,

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:15.360
and then we're fighting.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.860
So I am one of the
people, like you,

00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:18.250
who is like, I think that
we can talk about it.

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:20.660
I don't think that it is
internalized anything,

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.800
but I do think that
we have to always

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.260
be mindful of our
motivations in it.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:27.940
There are some people
who are teaching

00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:31.374
because they want the validation
from that crowd, right?

00:47:31.374 --> 00:47:33.790
There are some people who are
teaching to answer questions

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:37.312
and to be somebody
who helps people think

00:47:37.312 --> 00:47:38.520
about a different experience.

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.422
And I'm somebody who
still is learning

00:47:40.422 --> 00:47:42.380
about the trans community,
for instance, right?

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.430
And if people wouldn't talk
to me about their experience,

00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:45.096
I wouldn't know.

00:47:45.096 --> 00:47:46.805
And I would think I'm
a really good ally,

00:47:46.805 --> 00:47:48.679
and then I say something
crazy, and I'm like,

00:47:48.679 --> 00:47:50.720
well, I tried to ask,
but people-- you know?

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:53.430
So I'm in that space
of like I need--

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:57.897
like how do we help
people understand

00:47:57.897 --> 00:47:58.980
this work a little better?

00:47:58.980 --> 00:48:00.210
And that doesn't
actually always mean

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:01.850
that it has to be
a person, right?

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:05.330
There are some amazing texts
and things like that out there.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.860
But I do think that it is some
people's real work to help

00:48:07.860 --> 00:48:09.700
other people think about
the world a little deeper,

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.600
but it's not everybody's.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.516
I think that, again,
it's like this either/or.

00:48:12.516 --> 00:48:14.730
It's either like nobody's
work or it's everybody's

00:48:14.730 --> 00:48:16.210
is how people often paint it.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:18.210
As opposed to saying,
it might not be yours,

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:21.280
but it might be mine, which I
think is probably a little more

00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:25.030
honest and real, while we make
sure that the people who think

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:27.410
that this is their work
always check their motivations

00:48:27.410 --> 00:48:28.904
for being in the work.

00:48:28.904 --> 00:48:31.070
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
you're a big fan of Twitter,

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:34.060
and Twitter has been a great
platform for a lot of people

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.129
to sort of be able
to have conversations

00:48:36.129 --> 00:48:37.420
that they couldn't have before.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.060
At the same time,
Twitter has also

00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.850
come up in various
contexts and it

00:48:42.850 --> 00:48:46.350
has an interaction
method that often

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:47.774
enables harassment and abuse.

00:48:47.774 --> 00:48:49.440
And so I'm wondering
about your thoughts

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.980
on navigating the line
between both opening up

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:57.740
conversations but also opening
up vulnerable populations

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:58.695
in interactions.

00:48:58.695 --> 00:48:59.570
DERAY MCKESSON: Yeah.

00:48:59.570 --> 00:49:01.782
I think it's a good question.

00:49:01.782 --> 00:49:04.240
You know, I've blocked 19,000
people personally on Twitter.

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.698
So I completely
get the harassment.

00:49:05.698 --> 00:49:07.072
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:08.965 --> 00:49:10.090
SPEAKER: Like individually?

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:11.298
DERAY MCKESSON: Individually.

00:49:11.298 --> 00:49:12.136
One at a time.

00:49:12.136 --> 00:49:18.670
And I did a screening of
the Panthers documentary

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:22.520
in Baltimore at The Charles,
this independent movie theater.

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.207
And people tweeted
in death threats.

00:49:24.207 --> 00:49:26.290
The police came, they shut
down the movie theater.

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:27.270
So I get it, right?

00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:28.150
I get their recipes.

00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:29.816
And my Twitter account
got hacked the other day.

00:49:29.816 --> 00:49:31.274
My phones got hacked
the other day.

00:49:31.274 --> 00:49:35.290
Somebody called Verizon
impersonating me,

00:49:35.290 --> 00:49:38.420
got the SIM number
changed, so my phone

00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:40.480
was bricked for a little bit.

00:49:40.480 --> 00:49:42.490
And then they used
2-Factor to hack

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:46.380
into my Gmail and
my Twitter account.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.377
So I get the harassment piece.

00:49:48.377 --> 00:49:49.460
There are a couple things.

00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:52.050
One is I think that Twitter
just recently changed

00:49:52.050 --> 00:49:53.880
the blocking feature.

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.500
You know, I know the
people at Twitter well.

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.995
I don't always know why they
make the decisions they do.

00:49:59.995 --> 00:50:02.120
There's no blog post about
this change in blocking,

00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.604
but I think it is a real change.

00:50:03.604 --> 00:50:05.770
So when you block people
now, they are very blocked.

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:07.940
Whereas before, if somebody
blocks you and you block them,

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:08.850
there were like
these workarounds

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:11.290
that you could still interact
with them, essentially.

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:13.570
And now that is gone, and I
think that's a real thing.

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:16.200
The thing that people
talk about the most

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:18.884
is the sheer volume, right?

00:50:18.884 --> 00:50:21.425
So you'll get people who flood
your-- if somebody targets you

00:50:21.425 --> 00:50:23.591
on Twitter, and then all
of a sudden like 100 people

00:50:23.591 --> 00:50:26.370
are tweeting you, it's a pretty
not fun experience, right?

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:29.120
I don't know what the
quick solution is for that.

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:30.096
I don't know.

00:50:30.096 --> 00:50:31.470
As somebody who
gets it, I'll get

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:36.580
people who will put-- you
know, when I got hacked,

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:40.374
somebody spoofed these fake
DMs about me and Netta.

00:50:40.374 --> 00:50:42.040
And they put them all
over the internet.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.950
So for two days, my mentions
were like just people

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:46.020
upset about that.

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.564
Because the DMs
are like, you want

00:50:47.564 --> 00:50:49.480
to put martial law in
the country or whatever.

00:50:49.480 --> 00:50:51.010
So literally, it's
like hundreds of like,

00:50:51.010 --> 00:50:52.330
why do you want martial law?

00:50:52.330 --> 00:50:54.460
And I'm like, get
these out of here!

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:56.420
I don't know what
Twitter would have done.

00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:00.820
I don't know what the solution
looks like in that space.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.360
I do think Twitter is really
slow around the harassment

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:03.880
stuff.

00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:07.497
So you submit a
thing saying you've

00:51:07.497 --> 00:51:09.830
been harassed or whatever,
and it's like 10 hours later.

00:51:09.830 --> 00:51:11.650
And they've got to
figure that out, right?

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:14.630
There's a volume issue there
I think is tough for them,

00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:17.040
because people abuse
the report function too.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.410
People will mass report somebody
they hate as being hacked,

00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.167
and then they'll
freeze their account.

00:51:22.167 --> 00:51:23.750
And they need to
figure that part out.

00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:26.486
I think that they have not
figured out the speed part.

00:51:26.486 --> 00:51:28.110
And when my Twitter
account got hacked,

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:30.462
it took me a while to get
back in, and I know them.

00:51:30.462 --> 00:51:31.554
Right?

00:51:31.554 --> 00:51:33.220
And the speed piece
I think is like what

00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:36.440
actually-- which is what I worry
about more than anything else.

00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.944
I do think it's
unique in the sense

00:51:37.944 --> 00:51:39.610
that it's the most
open platform, right?

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:40.705
Facebook is your friends.

00:51:40.705 --> 00:51:42.080
So when they say
something crazy,

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.286
you'll unfriend
them or something

00:51:44.286 --> 00:51:46.070
and then maybe block
them or report them,

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:46.927
but it's different.

00:51:46.927 --> 00:51:48.510
Twitter is like
standing on the corner

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:50.634
and it's like the world
is right there, right?

00:51:50.634 --> 00:51:52.050
And there's this
question of like,

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:54.682
do you put up these [? cones ?]
so the world can't see you,

00:51:54.682 --> 00:51:56.140
which fundamentally
changes what it

00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:57.500
means to stand on the corner.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:00.440
Or do you make sure that
people can't run you over?

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.584
It's like what are the
two pendulant swings?

00:52:02.584 --> 00:52:04.750
And I think that Twitter
is still finding its space.

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:06.620
But I do think it
doesn't get credit

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:10.709
for how hard it is to keep the
commitment it has while making

00:52:10.709 --> 00:52:12.000
sure that the platform is safe.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.755
I do think that they've been
really slow on user names,

00:52:13.755 --> 00:52:14.470
though.

00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:16.261
You shouldn't be able
to have a name that's

00:52:16.261 --> 00:52:17.280
like I hate the N word.

00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.620
That doesn't make sense to me.

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.236
And they have been
slow on there.

00:52:20.236 --> 00:52:21.860
I have no insider
knowledge about this,

00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:26.060
but I think that they also have
not moved away from the rat

00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.240
race around users, right?

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.140
They're in this user
race with Facebook.

00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:31.530
And I think that Twitter's
real story is about impact,

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:34.015
and they have not figured out
a metric around impact yet.

00:52:34.015 --> 00:52:35.890
And if they did, I think
that they would win.

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:38.930
Like they'd win that fight, but
they are still fighting people

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:39.900
around this user thing.

00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:41.816
And you think about
yesterday with the sit-in.

00:52:41.816 --> 00:52:45.340
And it's like, when Paul
Ryan cut off C-SPAN,

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:46.620
it was Periscope.

00:52:46.620 --> 00:52:47.400
That was it.

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.840
It was an immediate-- like
this is an impact thing.

00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:52.100
And they are still fighting
people in this user thing

00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:53.240
that I think is a loss.

00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:55.800
I think they will not
win the user fight.

00:52:55.800 --> 00:52:56.730
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:52:56.730 --> 00:52:58.480
So my question is
about something

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.520
you were talking about
earlier, calling out

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.100
comments that people make.

00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:04.450
This is something I
really want to do more.

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:08.260
And I think I'm kind of getting
better and better at doing it.

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.260
I think it's a lot
easier though, for me,

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:11.930
when it's in a context
when, you know,

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:13.240
I'm talking to
another white person,

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.530
or there are only
white people there.

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.196
Where it's been a lot
more difficult is,

00:53:16.196 --> 00:53:18.830
there are people of
color in the group who

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:21.992
don't respond to the comment,
or even sometimes seem

00:53:21.992 --> 00:53:22.700
to agree with it.

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.240
And I think where this has
come up for me in particular

00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:28.490
is with older gay men in the
city, which a lot of people

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:32.130
will know that the gay
community in San Francisco does

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:33.720
tend to skew older.

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.650
So I've come across
older gay men of color

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:40.540
who don't seem to want to
respond to these comments.

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:44.270
And I don't know if it's because
this is like a way of survival,

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:46.540
having been in this community
for so long, that they

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:47.717
kind of-- I don't know.

00:53:47.717 --> 00:53:49.800
I guess I'm wondering if
you have noticed anything

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:52.924
like that, if you have
any advice for how

00:53:52.924 --> 00:53:53.965
to address the situation.

00:53:53.965 --> 00:53:54.350
DERAY MCKESSON: Yeah.

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:56.190
Sometimes it is real that
people-- sometimes people

00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:58.273
stay stuff around me that,
I should say something,

00:53:58.273 --> 00:54:00.165
but I'm like, I'm
too tired today.

00:54:00.165 --> 00:54:01.712
We're going to go
back and forth,

00:54:01.712 --> 00:54:02.920
and I just can't do it today.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.450
I think about the woman-- and
this woman worked on the Amtrak

00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.710
train.

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:07.250
And she said something
crazy the other day.

00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:08.791
And I just had to
tweet like, I'm not

00:54:08.791 --> 00:54:11.365
going to let the devil get
me, because [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:11.365 --> 00:54:12.220
So that is real.

00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:14.970
So some people are
tired, and that's real.

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:19.487
Confrontation, though, the
word sounds harsher than it is.

00:54:19.487 --> 00:54:20.820
I think there are simple things.

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.194
Like, "What did
you mean by that"

00:54:22.194 --> 00:54:25.000
is totally a way to start
a conversation with people

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.340
that gets you on the
path of either holding

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.770
people accountable or
changing people's minds

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:33.100
but is a very simple entrance.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.529
And I think with people that
you have seen not address things

00:54:36.529 --> 00:54:38.820
that you think are sort of
problematic, I think there's

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:41.220
a way to say like, I thought
that was really troubling,

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.260
what did you think about that,
as a way to sort of get to the,

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.250
why didn't you say anything?

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:45.990
So that you can learn
a little better.

00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:48.610
I do think that
people, unfortunately,

00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:50.660
start to think about
confrontation as this like

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:53.034
you need to have a billboard
that's like, I can't believe

00:54:53.034 --> 00:54:55.750
you let your community down,
which is a not helpful way

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:57.345
to think about this work.

00:54:57.345 --> 00:54:58.720
But I think there
are simple ways

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:02.220
to create the entrance that
then allow you to build,

00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:04.510
which is like, what
made you say that?

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:07.239
What did you mean by that?

00:55:07.239 --> 00:55:09.030
I think those questions,
I've seen those be

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:11.040
super effective entry points.

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.510
And then you just need to be
thoughtful about continuing

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.830
that.

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:15.955
And that puts, again, the
onus on the other person.

00:55:15.955 --> 00:55:17.250
Like you're not doing the work.

00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:18.541
They're doing the hardest work.

00:55:18.541 --> 00:55:20.800
You're doing the work
of asking the question.

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:24.256
AUDIENCE: I love the policy
proposals and the platform

00:55:24.256 --> 00:55:25.810
on Campaign Zero.

00:55:25.810 --> 00:55:28.980
It looks amazing, and I'm
really interested in seeing

00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:31.940
how it can be brought in
the local and state level

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.110
and national level.

00:55:33.110 --> 00:55:36.100
One thing I'm wondering about,
though-- particularly because

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:40.990
in San Francisco we've had
a huge increase in property

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:43.120
crimes recently.

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:46.940
There have been two stabbings
within a block of my apartment.

00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:51.620
And I know that the
constituency in my neighborhood,

00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:55.560
which is the Castro, which is
generally whiter, wealthier,

00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:59.080
even if gay, would have--
like their instinct would

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:05.000
be to demand even more
enforcement of these loitering

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.879
laws and those kind of things.

00:56:07.879 --> 00:56:10.170
And then at the same time,
I see from my parents living

00:56:10.170 --> 00:56:13.500
in New Orleans, which has also
been going through a crime

00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:17.610
wave, their instinct is
to have more police that

00:56:17.610 --> 00:56:20.370
are intervening more.

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:23.380
So I guess what I want to know
is, from your perspective,

00:56:23.380 --> 00:56:27.470
when you're having conversations
with people whose instinct is

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:31.030
driven by fear, and who
look to the police as a way

00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.870
of assuaging that fear, and
you want to say to them,

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:36.300
hey, no, this is a
longer term solution,

00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:40.950
and we need to actually get here
so that everyone feels safe,

00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:43.302
how do you approach
that and what works?

00:56:43.302 --> 00:56:44.760
DERAY MCKESSON:
People's proclivity

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.020
to call for the police
makes total sense to me.

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:49.100
In a world where
we have made people

00:56:49.100 --> 00:56:50.970
believe that police
equals safety.

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:53.830
I get it, whether I
agree with it or not.

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:56.730
I think that when we think
about community violence--

00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:59.560
if you think about
the legal economy,

00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:01.060
there's a way to
deal with conflict.

00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:02.665
If I don't like you,
I call your boss.

00:57:02.665 --> 00:57:03.619
I file a lawsuit.

00:57:03.619 --> 00:57:04.410
I file a complaint.

00:57:04.410 --> 00:57:05.890
There's a whole apparatus.

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:07.790
In the illegal economy,
there's only one way

00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:10.070
to deal with conflict,
and there's violence.

00:57:10.070 --> 00:57:13.930
So if the solution to community
violence, all that stuff,

00:57:13.930 --> 00:57:16.710
is not about getting people
out of the illegal economy,

00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:18.480
I think we will always
spin our wheels.

00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:24.160
Any solution that isn't about
like jobs, education, housing,

00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:27.620
those are the actual solutions
that will change the needle.

00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:29.810
In the absence of those,
the police, I think,

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:32.210
will always be
people's best solution.

00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:35.000
So when you think about
Baltimore, 40% of adults

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.440
can't functionally read.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:37.530
It's a crisis, right?

00:57:37.530 --> 00:57:39.370
So we could bring
every industry we

00:57:39.370 --> 00:57:40.940
want in America to Baltimore.

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:42.930
People can't read, not
going to matter, right?

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:45.820
It's going to matter
significantly less.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:48.980
People are going to wake up
being like, I need money.

00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:50.690
How do I get it?

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:53.850
And if that is selling drugs
or doing whatever, people are

00:57:53.850 --> 00:57:55.900
going to get their needs met.

00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:59.790
And again, I think the work
around getting people out

00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:04.379
of the illegal economy is
like the not sexy, super dull

00:58:04.379 --> 00:58:06.670
but like the work that actually
changes people's lives.

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:07.800
If you think about the
homeless populations,

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.570
it's like, we know that it
is better for homeless people

00:58:10.570 --> 00:58:13.140
to be in homes than not,
which sounds really simple.

00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:15.570
But there are people who
will see a homeless person

00:58:15.570 --> 00:58:17.846
and will take them to
drug treatment first.

00:58:17.846 --> 00:58:19.220
And we actually
know the outcomes

00:58:19.220 --> 00:58:21.910
if you do that are worse
than if you actually

00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:23.724
just put the person in a home.

00:58:23.724 --> 00:58:25.557
And it's called the
"housing first" strategy

00:58:25.557 --> 00:58:29.330
that people need homes before
they need anything else.

00:58:29.330 --> 00:58:31.500
But it's easier to be like,
we're going to put you

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:32.666
in drug treatment for today!

00:58:32.666 --> 00:58:35.720
And then you actually didn't
solve any of the problems.

00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.590
So I don't know a great
response to people

00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:40.670
who call the police like
that, because I get it.

00:58:40.670 --> 00:58:42.790
I get why older people
do it specifically,

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:44.500
my grandmother
being one of them.

00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:46.545
But I also believe
that the way to get out

00:58:46.545 --> 00:58:48.670
of that is to really think
about community violence

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:52.030
in a completely different way
that is very structural, very

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:52.880
not sexy.

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.402
It's about jobs,
literacy, access,

00:58:55.402 --> 00:58:57.360
those sort of things,
transportation, you know?

00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.214
I know people in
Baltimore who can only

00:58:59.214 --> 00:59:00.880
work in parts of the
city because that's

00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.340
where the buses go, right?

00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:05.312
So they physically cannot get
to another part of town in less

00:59:05.312 --> 00:59:07.520
than three hours, and they're
not going to get a job.

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.070
They just won't.

00:59:08.070 --> 00:59:10.278
They're not going to make
that choice, which severely

00:59:10.278 --> 00:59:12.950
limits the opportunities they
have, which is a crazy thing.

00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:14.160
That's real, though.

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.080
AUDIENCE: My question
is-- well, first of all,

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:19.650
we know that change is
not happening fast enough.

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:22.930
And you were talking about sort
of the stages of organizing

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:25.850
and how only the third
one, the third step,

00:59:25.850 --> 00:59:27.730
is being able to see outcomes.

00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:30.490
And that's obviously
not fast enough

00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:33.260
because people's
lives are on the line.

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:37.040
And I'm just curious about how
you personally stay patient,

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:41.130
and how you stay sane, and how
you bear witness and organize

00:59:41.130 --> 00:59:44.390
around all these things when
you put so much effort in

00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:46.637
and things are
still so very slow?

00:59:46.637 --> 00:59:47.470
DERAY MCKESSON: Yep.

00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:50.010
So I know I'm not alone,
and that's important to me,

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:53.140
that I'm one of many people
who are doing this work.

00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:56.020
I have great friends,
which is helpful.

00:59:56.020 --> 00:59:57.599
And I was a teacher.

00:59:57.599 --> 00:59:59.390
You know, I used to
teach sixth grade math,

00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:01.540
and I feel a
responsibility to make sure

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:03.300
that those kids
live in a world that

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.160
is not the world I grew up in.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.020
And that keeps me
hopeful, you know?

01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:09.937
I'm like, I got
it, we can do it.

01:00:09.937 --> 01:00:12.520
And all across the country, I've
seen people find their voices

01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.699
and step up in ways that give me
incredible-- like if I had not

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:17.240
been in Ferguson,
I think I would not

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.380
be an organizer in
this way right now.

01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:22.380
But I saw all these people who
never, ever would be together.

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:26.540
Like doctors, lawyers,
unemployed people, [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.540
We were all of one
community in a way

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:30.394
that all those other
labels didn't matter.

01:00:30.394 --> 01:00:31.810
We were people
with shared values,

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:33.920
and that really changed me.

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.630
And that gives me
this immense hope.

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:37.470
And again it is, I
believe, two things--

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:38.880
there are more people that want
to do the work than know what

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:40.310
to do, and more people
that want to good work

01:00:40.310 --> 01:00:41.680
than want to be members.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.550
And, for me, there's
this huge challenge of,

01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:45.469
how do we organize those people?

01:00:45.469 --> 01:00:46.510
And I think we can do it.

01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:48.400
I think tech will be a
part of how we do it.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.670
I think we've been trying
to figure out slowly--

01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:52.160
partly because people have
been dealing with the day

01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.840
to day trauma, so they
haven't pulled back

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:55.340
to think about sort
of macro spaces.

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.993
But that keeps me
really hopeful.

01:00:57.993 --> 01:00:58.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.959
AUDIENCE: And along
with Andy and many,

01:01:00.959 --> 01:01:03.500
many other medical students who
are part of this organization

01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:05.200
called White Coats
for Black Lives.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.590
And it focuses on
bringing attention

01:01:08.590 --> 01:01:11.960
to structural racism and gun
violence and other issues that

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:14.140
are public health
issues but historically

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.870
haven't been thought of as so.

01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:21.140
And my question is throughout
my year and a half or so

01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:22.910
being involved with
this, I've come

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:26.520
across many people whose hearts
and minds are already one.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.950
But because of the structure,
or because of things

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:30.920
they have on the line,
or because of things

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.295
they don't have
on the line, they

01:01:32.295 --> 01:01:36.101
don't feel motivated
to either effect change

01:01:36.101 --> 01:01:37.100
or to join the movement.

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:41.710
And so I guess my
question is, how do you

01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:45.760
get people to contribute more
once you've already convinced

01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.330
them of what you're doing?

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:48.580
DERAY MCKESSON: Good question.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:51.309
I met with the people who
run Doctors for America,

01:01:51.309 --> 01:01:52.850
and I think they're
doing great work,

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:54.140
and I think y'all
are doing great work.

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.056
With the health care
thing, I think some of it

01:01:56.056 --> 01:01:56.860
is messaging, too.

01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:59.640
Like I think we should
talk about healthcare--

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.850
our health beyond hospitals.

01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:04.640
That's a simpler way to
think about it, that health

01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.410
is about so much more than
when you go to the doctor,

01:02:07.410 --> 01:02:09.146
that health is a
broader thing, and we

01:02:09.146 --> 01:02:10.770
need a public
conversation, and doctors

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.061
need to lead that conversation.

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:13.089
So that's one piece.

01:02:13.089 --> 01:02:15.130
What do you do after you've
won hearts and minds?

01:02:15.130 --> 01:02:17.796
Hearts and minds is hard to win,
so that's like you pat yourself

01:02:17.796 --> 01:02:19.270
on the back for two seconds.

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:23.280
And then I think it's about
being as explicit as possible

01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.190
about what the ask is.

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:27.292
Because I think that
sometimes we figure out,

01:02:27.292 --> 01:02:29.250
we got this community,
we're like, people care.

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:30.250
And then we're like,
go do the work!

01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:31.300
And people are like,
well what does that mean?

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.425
And they're like, the work.

01:02:32.425 --> 01:02:34.340
And you're like, I
don't really know.

01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:36.173
And I think that that
actually doesn't help.

01:02:36.173 --> 01:02:38.639
I think that's how we lose
people really quickly,

01:02:38.639 --> 01:02:40.680
is that they feel like
it's like a lot of hot air

01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:44.130
when, in reality,
I think that making

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:46.180
the choice around what
the discrete thing to do

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.860
is actually really hard,
and organizers always

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:49.950
feel really pained.

01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:52.917
Because there's a million
things that people should do.

01:02:52.917 --> 01:02:54.750
So saying to people
like, here are the three

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:55.850
things we want you
to do right now

01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:58.340
is something I've seen even
the most incredible organizers

01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:59.600
really shy away from.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.620
Because they're nervous
that they're forgetting

01:03:01.620 --> 01:03:02.620
something or da, da, da.

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.110
But I think that that is
actually what keeps people.

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:06.859
Just like when I was
a teacher-- you know,

01:03:06.859 --> 01:03:08.095
kids want to feel success.

01:03:08.095 --> 01:03:09.470
They want to walk
into a building

01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:11.280
and feel successful every day.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.084
And so do adults.

01:03:12.084 --> 01:03:13.500
Adults want to
feel like the thing

01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:17.080
that they devoted their time
to is part of a success story.

01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:18.894
And some of that we
have to be like-- we

01:03:18.894 --> 01:03:20.310
have to be
manufacturing the sense

01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:22.230
that we have to be really
thoughtful about it.

01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:25.130
It's like when I give the
first test in-- when I taught,

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:27.465
first test, every kid
was going to pass it.

01:03:27.465 --> 01:03:28.840
I wasn't giving
them the answers,

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:31.360
but it was like
just hard enough,

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.070
but we would do enough
prep right before

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:36.230
that I knew that you had
to sleep through the test

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.730
to fail it.

01:03:36.730 --> 01:03:38.521
Everybody was going to
pass the first test.

01:03:38.521 --> 01:03:39.600
Second test, super hard.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.350
It was like all this
content that I needed

01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:43.130
them to really, really grasp.

01:03:43.130 --> 01:03:46.090
But I needed to set up a system
where they felt successful

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:47.600
when the challenges came.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.190
And I think that
in organizing work,

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:53.284
we have to make sure that people
can experience success early,

01:03:53.284 --> 01:03:55.200
or they know that they've
experienced success.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.340
And then we offer things
that they can actually do.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.625
So even when it might
be a loss, the success

01:04:00.625 --> 01:04:03.000
is like, it's a new community,
and it's a new da, da, da.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.370
That we are always thinking
about how we make people

01:04:05.370 --> 01:04:07.000
feel like they're
doing something.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.190
Because you know
as well as I know

01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:09.780
there are a million things that
are competing with your time,

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.280
right?

01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:13.700
You could be watching "Game of
Thrones"-- great last episode.

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.240
Or you could be
organizing, right?

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.970
And you want people to choose
the thing that you're doing.

01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:18.803
But I do think it's
about how are you really

01:04:18.803 --> 01:04:21.990
discrete with what the ask is.

01:04:21.990 --> 01:04:23.110
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:24.570
AUDIENCE: I was
interested in you

01:04:24.570 --> 01:04:26.770
were talking about the
issues of homelessness

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:28.820
and earlier about
the issues dealing

01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:32.260
with the police contracts.

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:34.940
And I found, in a
lot of cases, it

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:38.300
looks like theoretically there's
a program to help someone.

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:40.700
But when you really
dig into it, there's

01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:46.300
so much paperwork and
so much unsexy barriers.

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:49.540
What can you do as
advocates to try

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:54.150
to get attention around those
issues and to deal with them?

01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:58.430
Like, my uncle is pretty
much nonfunctional,

01:04:58.430 --> 01:05:01.910
and it took six months
of constant work

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:05.790
from multiple relatives just
to get him basic Medicaid.

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:09.410
And they still have
to administer it.

01:05:09.410 --> 01:05:13.940
There's no program to actually
give him the help he needs.

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:15.140
DERAY MCKESSON: Yeah.

01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.950
I mean, I think this is where
tech people come in, too.

01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:18.650
And this is why I
think it's important

01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:20.983
that we do keep talking about
the problems, but not only

01:05:20.983 --> 01:05:23.370
the problems, is that-- I
think that some people who have

01:05:23.370 --> 01:05:25.828
incredible skill that can help
us organize differently just

01:05:25.828 --> 01:05:28.104
don't know what parts
of the world look like.

01:05:28.104 --> 01:05:29.520
And then it's like,
how do we help

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.439
people be exposed
to those experiences

01:05:31.439 --> 01:05:32.480
so they can do something?

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.830
Like there's this great Twilio--
I know a lot about Twilio

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:35.496
all of a sudden.

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:38.070
But these people have
created this way--

01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:40.700
so food stamps go
unclaimed in communities

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:41.835
all across the country.

01:05:41.835 --> 01:05:43.210
And one of the
problems is people

01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:44.820
don't want to go sit at the
Social Security building

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:46.062
and then type in [INAUDIBLE].

01:05:46.062 --> 01:05:47.270
Who wants to do that all day?

01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:49.480
So they've created
a text-based way

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.355
to figure out if you
qualify for food stamps.

01:05:51.355 --> 01:05:52.610
So you text this number.

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:54.770
You fill out the whole
questionnaire on text.

01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:57.050
It pops out at the end,
like you do qualify or not.

01:05:57.050 --> 01:05:58.591
So by the time you
get to the office,

01:05:58.591 --> 01:06:00.400
you already know,
yes or no, right?

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.000
Fascinating tech solution.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.370
Totally simple.

01:06:03.370 --> 01:06:06.416
I don't know anybody who
knows the number, right?

01:06:06.416 --> 01:06:07.540
But it is a great solution.

01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:10.320
And it's like how do we have
people build the solutions

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:12.100
and then put them out there?

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:13.850
When I was running for
mayor of Baltimore,

01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:16.390
I did a visit to
Meals On Wheels.

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:18.420
Did you know the average
age of a volunteer

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.350
at Meals On Wheels in
Central Maryland is 70?

01:06:20.350 --> 01:06:23.240
And I was like, which is
great for the 70-year-old.

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:27.096
Y'all need a new strategy
around volunteers, you know?

01:06:27.096 --> 01:06:30.260
And I will bet
you that there are

01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.480
people who would totally
deliver a meal every morning

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.355
before going to work.

01:06:33.355 --> 01:06:35.040
They would do it, right?

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.350
But they need a different
way of thinking about how

01:06:37.350 --> 01:06:39.180
people sign up and da, da, da.

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:42.170
They clearly don't-- they
just don't get it, right?

01:06:42.170 --> 01:06:44.670
I think that there are people
in marketing who would totally

01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:47.060
donate a couple hours
to help them come up

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.875
with a different
volunteer strategy.

01:06:48.875 --> 01:06:50.250
And it's like,
how do we actually

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:54.130
put those sort of like cases
that are relatively simple,

01:06:54.130 --> 01:06:57.500
but have a huge
impact on people--

01:06:57.500 --> 01:06:59.670
how do we create
space where people

01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:01.999
with different kinds of
skills can meet them?

01:07:01.999 --> 01:07:03.540
So I don't have a
great answer, but I

01:07:03.540 --> 01:07:05.652
do think that some
of this is helping

01:07:05.652 --> 01:07:07.360
people think about
the problems and being

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:08.550
exposed to the problems.

01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:11.340
I think the solutions, there's
enough good energy out there

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:12.340
that can deal with them.

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:13.807
And then there's
a responsibility

01:07:13.807 --> 01:07:15.890
for people who have platforms
to really push them.

01:07:15.890 --> 01:07:17.640
Like, I'm all about
this food stamp thing.

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.140
I saw it.

01:07:18.140 --> 01:07:19.740
I was like everybody
should-- I mean,

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:20.948
only if you need food stamps.

01:07:20.948 --> 01:07:22.750
But people should
totally know this number,

01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.900
because it does
really good work.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.696
It just isn't being-- people
don't know about it yet.

01:07:27.696 --> 01:07:29.570
SPEAKER: Well, DeRay,
thank you so much for--

01:07:29.570 --> 01:07:29.790
DERAY MCKESSON: Thank y'all.

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:30.140
I appreciate it.

01:07:30.140 --> 01:07:31.890
SPEAKER: --coming and
educating and having

01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:32.890
this dialogue with this.

01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:33.835
Really appreciate it.

01:07:33.835 --> 01:07:38.480
[APPLAUSE]
