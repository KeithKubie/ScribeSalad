1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:06,480
We'll conclude our discussion of mismatch
by looking at the impact of hygiene on

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,010
our microbiota and its consequences
for health and disease.

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,270
The idea is here we're stimulated by
seeing certain patterns both in space and

4
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:24,431
in time that signaled the changes in
our microbiota might be effecting the

5
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:26,780
incidence of autoimmune disease.

6
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,490
There may be particular roles for worms
in this relationship and therefore we're

7
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:39,380
going to look at a bit more detail than
how worms might be interacting with the

8
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:40,214
immune system.

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:47,050
It is possible that some autoimmune
diseases might be treatable with worms,

10
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:52,241
but it is a risky trade off and evidence
so far is mixed on how effective it

11
00:00:52,491 --> 00:00:56,390
might be. The clinical trials
have not yet been successful,

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:02,350
so let's return for a moment to the
industrial revolution in that second

13
00:01:02,351 --> 00:01:06,580
epidemiological transition.
At that point,

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,900
when we went through
urbanization into modern cities,

15
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,370
we entered an environment with soap,
with washed food, with less mud,

16
00:01:15,371 --> 00:01:16,660
and with chlorinated water.

17
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,060
We have less oral fecal transmission
and less contact with farm animals.

18
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,920
At the same time,

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,960
antibiotics reduced our exposure to all
kinds of bacteria and anti hill Mythics.

20
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:35,651
That is drugs against worms and clean
water have reduced our exposure to

21
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:36,920
parasitic worms.

22
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,360
We encounter less helicobacter
mycobacterium Salmonella
toxoplasma and Hefei

23
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,960
than we did previously.
So our Microbiota has been simplified,

24
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,180
is less varied
because our environment is cleaner.

25
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:56,890
Okay.

26
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,120
Now what are the consequences?

27
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,500
If we look at a map of the world where
we have good information and we contrast

28
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:10,600
the postindustrial countries here
in blue with large populations,

29
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:14,650
countries where most people are
living outside of cities in red.

30
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:19,840
What we find is the post industrial
countries have high rates of type one

31
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:21,820
diabetes and a few parasites,

32
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:26,710
and these countries in red that have
large rural populations and poor access to

33
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:31,711
antibiotics have low rates of type one
diabetes and high rates of diseases that

34
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:33,310
are caused by worms.

35
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:40,350
If we look in time over the
last half of the 20th century,

36
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:47,020
infectious diseases declined
rapidly in incidents.

37
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:52,270
So this is hepatitis a, tuberculosis,
mumps, measles, rheumatic fever,

38
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:56,890
all declining at the same time.
The immune disorders,

39
00:02:56,891 --> 00:03:00,160
rose, multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease,

40
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:05,161
type one diabetes and asthma all rose
dramatically in the last half of the 20th

41
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,784
century.

42
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,010
So there's an inverse relationship between
the incidents of infectious disease

43
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,780
and immune pathology.

44
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,430
Yeah.

45
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:21,430
This prompted the idea that autoimmune
diseases and the other immune pathologies

46
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:27,490
could be mediated by worms and people
began to do experiments on worms.

47
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,500
Here we have the particular kind of warm
and the auto immune disease that was

48
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:35,240
investigated experimentally.

49
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,840
So just a soma has been shown to reduce
the risk of autoimmune encephalomyelitis

50
00:03:43,671 --> 00:03:46,200
and graves thyroiditis.
True Cure.

51
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:50,960
A Sueess has been shown in mice to reduce
the incidence of inflammatory bowel

52
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:52,250
disease and so forth.

53
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,280
So there has been some
experimental evidence in mice
showing the treatment with

54
00:03:57,591 --> 00:04:01,730
worms or with worm eggs can reduce
the risk of autoimmune disease.

55
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:08,170
So these experiments were stimulated
by those patterns in space and time.

56
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,783
Now

57
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,340
that suggests that one could carry out
therapy with pig whipworms in humans.

58
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:26,380
The choice of the pig whipworm was led
by the idea that you needed something

59
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,560
that would not be a itself,
a pathogen in humans,

60
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:38,561
but might produce enough interaction
with the immune system to trigger the,

61
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,090
uh,
protective response.

62
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,920
So preliminary trials of
a cocktail of Pickwick,

63
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,490
whipworm eggs produce some mixed results
in people with ulcerative colitis.

64
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:54,140
Then large scale clinical
trials were implemented.

65
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,210
They were called off in 2013 when those
who are on the treatments were not doing

66
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:02,000
any better than those
who are on the placebos.

67
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,650
A case control study of people with and
without naturally occurring pierce a

68
00:05:10,651 --> 00:05:10,921
team.

69
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:15,921
He has indicated that having parasites
in your body slowed the progress of

70
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:19,080
multiple sclerosis and treating the PR.

71
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:22,380
The parasites accelerated it here.

72
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:26,100
All we have on the x axis time in months.

73
00:05:26,101 --> 00:05:27,930
So this whole period here,

74
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,960
it's five years to there and then it's
about another on two and a half years out

75
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:40,320
to here. The black line is
people who are uninfected.

76
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,520
The red line is people who are infected.

77
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,540
The Blue Line is people who have been
treated for their infection and the y axis

78
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,210
is the number of lesions detected in
the brain that are characteristic of

79
00:05:56,311 --> 00:06:00,440
multiple. So there are really
two things to see here.

80
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:05,470
One is that the patients entering
where either uninfected are infected,

81
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:10,250
but they all had the preliminary
symptoms of multiple sclerosis.

82
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,660
Those who are uninfected
rapidly developed symptoms.

83
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,700
Those who were infected were much slower.

85
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:23,140
They hardly developed any further symptoms
at all of multiple sclerosis. However,

86
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:27,280
these are natural worm infections.
These are not therapeutic egg, uh,

87
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,750
treatments with cocktails.

88
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,980
And so some of the patients really began
to suffer from their worm infections.

89
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:34,690
They were pathogenic and serious.

90
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,930
They were treated for
their worm infections here.

91
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,450
And as soon as the worms were cleared out,

92
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:44,500
you can see that are symptoms of multiple
sclerosis rapidly rose to about the

93
00:06:44,501 --> 00:06:48,310
same level of those people who had
lacked worms right from the beginning.

94
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:50,930
Okay.

95
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:55,930
So there is some suggestion that worms
are providing protection against the auto

96
00:06:58,471 --> 00:06:59,360
immune disease.

97
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,650
That leads to the issue of how they might
be interacting with the immune system.

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,800
It might be simple homeostasis.

99
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,070
So the immune response produced by
the worm infection might simply be

100
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:13,580
overlapping with something like
the tissue repair response.

101
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,240
Okay.

102
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,680
It could be a downregulation of the
immune response by the host to avoid

103
00:07:19,681 --> 00:07:21,060
inflammatory damage.

104
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,860
In a sustained infection in such a
broad way that allergic and autoimmune

105
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:27,450
reactions are also dampens?

106
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,730
Yeah,

107
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:33,150
it could be that by elevating
circulating antibody levels,

108
00:07:33,151 --> 00:07:38,151
both specific and nonspecific antibodies
in response to the worm infection would

109
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:42,330
dilute the allergen specific
antibodies and saturate reception.

110
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:45,240
Oh at receptors on mast
cells and eosinophils.

111
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,520
Okay.

112
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,990
And it could also be that
there was interference with
specific signals by worms

113
00:07:51,991 --> 00:07:56,991
to evade and suppress the immune system
with reduction of immune pathologies is

114
00:07:57,361 --> 00:07:58,890
an unintended byproduct.

115
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:04,020
That is the one that I think that is
most likely because worms have been under

116
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:08,100
strong natural selection to be able to
suppress the immune system so that they

117
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:11,670
can stay in the body of the
host and continue to reproduce.

118
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,300
All four processes are possible.
They have not yet been ruled out.

119
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,610
The fourth seems to be the most likely.

120
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,723
However,

121
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:29,910
worm therapy is a risky kind
of trade off in the tropics.

122
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:34,270
Worm infections increased susceptibility
to the Berkey losis, AIDS,

123
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:36,610
malaria and other infectious diseases.

124
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:42,040
So giving people worms in the tropics
is a bad idea because it could very well

125
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:44,020
make them die for other reasons.

126
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:45,850
Okay.

127
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:50,110
Worm infections also reduced the
protection protection offered by vaccines.

128
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:52,220
Okay.

129
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,850
The symptoms of worm infections
themselves can cause distress and they may

130
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:57,930
become life threatening.

131
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,620
So although some individuals have reported
improvements in the symptoms of an

132
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:08,430
inflammatory bowel disease when infected
by hookworms hookworm infections

133
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:11,010
themselves can produce serious pathology.

134
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,520
So worm infection is a risky trade off.

135
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,540
Clinical trials have not
yet been successful to phase
two clinical trials that

136
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:21,721
we're using.

137
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:26,400
Pig whipworm eggs to treat Crohn's disease
were discontinued when the treatments

138
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,320
were not doing any
better than the placebos.

139
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,230
It might be that worms really are
mediating auto immune disease,

140
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:38,700
but that warm therapy is only effective
when the worms can establish and during

141
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:43,350
infections and cause pathogenic
effects themselves. Now,

142
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:44,280
if that's the case,

143
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:49,281
the cost benefit balance
of warm treatments must be
looked at very carefully and

144
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,970
it may be that we are going to have to
do something like domesticate worms or

145
00:09:53,971 --> 00:09:58,971
put them through a program as we would
with the virus to try to produce an

146
00:09:59,941 --> 00:10:04,290
attenuated live virus. If we could
produce an attenuated warm treatment,

147
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,330
then that might be effective.
So to summarize,

148
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,810
our bodies coevolved with a diverse
Microbiota with which we've had both

149
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,400
positive and negative interactions.

150
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:20,940
When those commensals are removed,

151
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,800
our immune systems respond
inappropriately and we get allergy,

152
00:10:25,801 --> 00:10:27,690
asthma,
and autoimmune disease.

153
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,380
Some mechanisms are now understood,

154
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:36,180
but the search for therapies
using biological agents has

So to conclude on the
general problem of mismatch,

156
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:47,490
our bodies are clearly mismatched
suit to a sedentary lifestyle,

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,650
to a post industrial diet,

158
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,720
to a lack of exposure to parasitic
worms and to altered exposure to other

159
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,700
microorganisms. Some of the
resulting diseases, obesity,

160
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:02,220
high blood pressure,
cardiovascular disease,

161
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:06,480
and type two diabetes can be
improved with Diet and exercise.

162
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,800
That should be the first
line of defense for others.

163
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:14,880
The immune fatalities effective
therapies are desperately needed,

164
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:19,500
but they are not yet available. Insights
from mismatch may help to find them.
