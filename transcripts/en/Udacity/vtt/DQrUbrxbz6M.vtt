00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.250
Up to now you've built your
first mapping applications

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.610
where you saw how to set up
the Google Maps API and integrate and

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.090
authenticated map into your application.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.540
You saw the map fragment and
user interface.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.370
And you saw how to use that
to get a Google Map object

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.690
that you could then manipulate and code.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:19.660
In the last lesson we modified
a lot of properties of the map.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.850
And it's often helpful to think of
them as being properties of a camera

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.690
floating over the landscape.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.510
You could look at it as the cameras on
an aircraft that's flying over the map.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.930
So as well as setting latitude and

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.390
longitude of the location
you want to look at.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.930
There's also cool stuff like setting the
direction of the cameras looking in and

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.890
the angle at which it looks at the map.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.350
The camera doesn't always
have to point straight down

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.670
as well as having the ability to
animate the movement of the camera

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.000
giving the impression of
flying over a landscape.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.470
In this last end,
we'll do a lot of work with the camera.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.510
And we'll see how it can be used
to build better maps for your apps
