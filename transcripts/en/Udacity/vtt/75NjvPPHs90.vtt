00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:01.850
In thinking about this example,

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.400
it's pretty clear that we made some poor
choices for picking the augmenting path.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.760
But how can we be sure
to pick better ones?

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.880
One idea is to prefer heavier paths,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.920
push flow along paths that
have larger bottlenecks.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.215
Another idea is to prefer shorter paths,

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:23.520
note that we were choosing longer
paths here to create this bad case.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.240
We'll explore both of these ideas and
some refinements to the Ford-Fulkerson

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.570
algorithm that will give
us better running times.
