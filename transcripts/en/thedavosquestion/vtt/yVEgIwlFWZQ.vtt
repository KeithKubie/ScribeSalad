I'm Michelle Guthrie. I'm at Providence Equity
based in Hong Kong. I'm very interested in

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.230
this Davos question about in the geo political
issues will outweigh the economic crisis in

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.680
east Asia, and I don't agree with that. I
think that ultimately what matters to most

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.820
people in east Asia is their security in terms
of employment opportunities, in terms of growth

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:41.040
for their economy. And I think that they--,
I'm probably overwhelmingly optimistic that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:51.440
the geo political conflicts will be sorted
out because of the intermingling of countries

00:00:51.440 --> 00:01:01.760
and the, ultimately, the fact that everyone
wants security. So I'm convinced that as a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.850
practical matter, even though we'll have bumps
along the way, that frankly everybody is going

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.500
to do the right thing. And, you know, that
the geo political conflicts will be sorted

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:23.799
out. But I think that the most pressing need
in east Asia is really setting the path for

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.000
future continued growth and integration of
east Asia into global economy. Thank you.
