00:00:00.364 --> 00:00:02.130
- [Voiceover] Over here
we have the graph of

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.451
y is equal to g of x.

00:00:04.451 --> 00:00:05.997
What I wanna do is I wanna figure out

00:00:05.997 --> 00:00:07.580
the limit of g of x

00:00:09.398 --> 00:00:11.981
as x approaches positive six

00:00:14.457 --> 00:00:18.040
from values that are
less than positive six

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.498
or you could say from the
left, from the, you could say

00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:23.422
the negative direction.

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:25.121
So what is this going to be equal to?

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:26.711
And if you have a sense
of it, pause the video

00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:28.852
and give a go at it.

00:00:28.852 --> 00:00:30.651
Well, to think about this,

00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:33.726
let's just take different
x-values that approach six

00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:36.357
from the left and look at what the values

00:00:36.357 --> 00:00:37.727
of the function are.

00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:41.187
So g of two, looks like it's
a little bit more than one.

00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:43.939
G of three, it's a little
bit more than that.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.809
G of four, looks like
it's a little under two.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.576
G of five, it looks
like it's around three.

00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:52.743
G of 5.5, looks like it's around five.

00:00:53.924 --> 00:00:55.674
G of, let's say 5.75,

00:00:57.685 --> 00:00:59.852
looks like it's like nine.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.758
And so, as x gets closer and closer to six

00:01:03.758 --> 00:01:07.083
from the left, it looks like
the value of our function

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:11.451
becomes unbounded, it's just
getting infinitely large.

00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:13.995
And so in some context,
you might see someone

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:17.037
write that, maybe this
is equal to infinity.

00:01:17.037 --> 00:01:19.199
But infinity isn't, we're not talking

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:20.828
about a specific number.

00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:23.957
If we're talking technically about limits

00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:26.888
the way that we've looked at it, what is,

00:01:26.888 --> 00:01:29.285
you'll sometimes see this in some classes.

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:31.187
But in this context,
especially on the exercises

00:01:31.187 --> 00:01:34.845
on Khan Academy, we'll say
that this does not exist.

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:35.678
Not exist.

00:01:36.783 --> 00:01:39.327
This thing right over here is unbounded.

00:01:39.327 --> 00:01:41.129
Now this is interesting because
the left-handed limit here

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:43.944
doesn't exist, but the
right-handed limit does.

00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:46.876
If I were to say the limit of g of x

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:51.577
as x approaches six from
the right-hand side,

00:01:51.577 --> 00:01:52.786
well, let's see.

00:01:52.786 --> 00:01:56.313
We have g of eight is
there, go of seven is there,

00:01:56.313 --> 00:01:58.396
g of 6.5, looks like it's

00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:01.665
a little less than negative three.

00:02:01.665 --> 00:02:05.280
G of 6.01, little even
closer to negative three.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.197
G of 6.0000001 is very
close to negative three.

00:02:12.487 --> 00:02:14.601
So it looks like this
limit right over here,

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.115
at least looking at it graphically,

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:18.608
it looks like when we approach six

00:02:18.608 --> 00:02:20.495
from the right, looks like the function

00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:21.855
is approaching negative three.

00:02:21.855 --> 00:02:23.787
But from the left, it's just unbounded,

00:02:23.787 --> 00:02:25.864
so we'll say it doesn't exist.
