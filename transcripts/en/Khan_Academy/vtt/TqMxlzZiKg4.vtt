00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.116
- [Voiceover] Given that
the definite integral

00:00:02.116 --> 00:00:03.987
from negative one to three of f of x dx

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:05.641
is equal to negative two

00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:07.863
and the definite integral
from negative on to three

00:00:07.863 --> 00:00:10.876
of g of x dx is equal to five,

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:14.052
what is the definite integral
from negative one to three

00:00:14.052 --> 00:00:17.552
of three f of x minus two g of x dx?

00:00:19.103 --> 00:00:21.066
All right, so to think
about this what we could use

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.341
is some of our integration properties.

00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:26.297
And so the first thing
that I would want to do

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:29.121
is we could split this
up into two integrals.

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:31.048
We know that the

00:00:31.048 --> 00:00:34.145
and this is true of definite
or indefinite integrals,

00:00:34.145 --> 00:00:36.395
that the integral of f of x

00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:42.339
the integral of f of x
plus or minus g of x dx

00:00:44.556 --> 00:00:48.723
is going to be equal to
the integral of f of x dx

00:00:50.096 --> 00:00:53.679
plus or minus the integral of g of x dx.

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.321
If this is a plus, this
is gonna be a plus.

00:00:56.321 --> 00:00:58.738
If this is a minus, this
is going to be a minus.

00:00:58.738 --> 00:01:01.034
So we could split this up in the same way.

00:01:01.034 --> 00:01:03.731
So this is going to be equal
to the definite integral

00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:07.731
from negative one to
three of three f of x dx

00:01:10.199 --> 00:01:11.784
minus the integral

00:01:11.784 --> 00:01:15.701
from negative one to
three of two g of x dx.

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.543
Notice, all I did is I split it up.

00:01:19.543 --> 00:01:22.541
Taking the integral of the
difference of these functions

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:24.200
is the same thing as taking

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.446
the difference of the
integrals of those functions.

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:29.812
Now the next thing we can do
is we can take the scalars,

00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:31.706
we're multiplying the
functions on the inside

00:01:31.706 --> 00:01:34.040
by these numbers, three and two,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.195
and we can take those
outside of the integral.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:37.615
And that comes straight
out of the property

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:40.975
that if I'm taking the
integral of some constant

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:44.591
times f of x dx, that
is equal to the constant

00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:47.508
times the integral of f of x dx,

00:01:48.694 --> 00:01:51.111
and so I can rewrite this as,

00:01:52.327 --> 00:01:54.460
so, let's see, I could
rewrite this first integral

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.156
as three times the definite integral

00:01:57.156 --> 00:02:00.656
from negative one to three of f of x dx

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:09.084
minus two times the definite integral

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:12.167
from negative one to three of g of x,

00:02:13.304 --> 00:02:16.252
actually let me do the second
one in a different color.

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:19.752
Minus, minus, this is gonna be in magenta.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.772
Minus two times the integral

00:02:22.772 --> 00:02:26.355
from negative one to three of g of x dx.

00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:30.482
And so what is this going to be equal to?

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:33.612
Well they tell us, they tell
us what this thing is here

00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:35.990
that I'm underlining in orange,

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.640
the integral from negative
one to three of f of x dx,

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.519
they tell us that that
is equal to negative two.

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.186
So that thing is negative
two, and likewise,

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.802
this thing right over
here, the definite integral

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:52.040
from negative one to three of g of x dx,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.965
they gave it right over
here, it's equal to five.

00:02:54.965 --> 00:02:56.635
So that's equal to five,

00:02:56.635 --> 00:02:59.376
and so the whole thing is going to be

00:02:59.376 --> 00:03:03.543
three times negative two,
which is equal to negative six

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:08.322
minus two times five minus 10,

00:03:08.322 --> 00:03:10.822
which is equal to negative 16.

00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:12.934
And we're done!
