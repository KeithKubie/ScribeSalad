00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.760
Hello.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.230
I will now introduce you to the
concept of similar triangles.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.210
Let me write that down.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.350
So in everyday life what
does similar mean?

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.470
Well, if two things are similar
they're kind of the same but

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.620
they're not the same thing or
they're not identical, right?

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.650
That's the same thing
for triangles.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.960
So similar triangles are
two triangles that have

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.270
all the same angles.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.350
For example, let me draw
two similar triangles.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.543
I'll try to make them look kind
of the same because they're

00:00:59.543 --> 00:01:02.350
supposed to look kind of the
same, but just maybe

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.980
be different sizes.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.350
So that's one, and I'll draw
another one that's right here.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.900
I'm going to draw it a little
smaller to show you that

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.120
they're not necessarily the
same size, they just are

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.980
same shape essentially.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.020
One way I like to think about
similar triangles are they're

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.080
just triangles that could be
kind of scaled up or down in

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.260
size or flipped around or
rotated, but they all have

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.500
the same angles so they're
essentially the same shape.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.470
For example, these two
triangles, if I were tell you

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.240
that this angle -- and this is
how they do it in class.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.270
If I were to tell you this
angle is equal to this angle

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.640
and I told you that this angle
here is equal to this angle.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.010
Well, a couple of things.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.020
You already know that this
angle's going to be equal to

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.430
this angle, and why is that?

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.170
Well because if two angles
are the same, then the third

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.400
has to be the same, right?

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.540
Because all three
angles add up to 180.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.870
For example, if this is x,
this is y, this one has to be

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.060
180 minus x minus y, right?

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.550
That's probably too
small for you to see.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.300
But that's the same thing here.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.420
If this is x and this is
y, then this angle right

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.200
here is going to be 180
minus x minus y, right?

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.880
So if we know that two angles
are the same in two triangles,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.712
so we know that the third one's
also going to be to same.

00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:38.270
So we could also say this angle
is identical to this angle.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.160
And if all the angles are the
same, then we know that we are

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.970
dealing with similar triangles.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.590
What useful thing can we
now do once we know that

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.320
a triangle is similar?

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.150
Well, we can use that
information to kind of figure

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.690
out some of the sides.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.210
So, even though they don't have
the same sides, the ratio

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.550
of corresponding side
lengths is the same.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.750
I know I've just confused you.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.340
Let me give you an example.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:15.970
For example, let's say that
this side is -- this side is 5.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.167
Let's say that this side is,
I don't know, I'm just going

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:21.370
to make up some number, 6.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.630
And let's say that this
side is 7, right?

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.840
And let's say we know that, I
don't know, let's say we know

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.970
that this side here is 2.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.180
So we know the ratio
of corresponding

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.950
sides is the same.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.990
So, if we look at these two
triangles, they have completely

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.400
different sizes but they
have corresponding sides.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.010
For example, this side
corresponds to this side.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.130
How do we know that?

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.560
Well, in this case, they
just happen to have

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.340
the same orientation.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.330
But we know that because
these sides are opposite

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:00.940
the same angle, right?

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.940
This is opposite angle y,
and then this side is

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.350
opposite angle y again.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.850
This whole triangle might be
too small for you to see, but

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.650
hopefully you're getting
what I'm saying.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.180
So these are
corresponding sides.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:20.490
Similarly, this side, this
blue side, and this blue side

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.730
are corresponding sides.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:22.160
Why?

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.180
Not because they're kind of on
the top left because we could

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.940
have rotated this and flipped
it and whatever else.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.980
It's because it's
opposite the same angle.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.895
That's the way I always
think about triangles.

00:04:33.895 --> 00:04:35.160
It's a good way to think about
it, especially when you

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.100
start doing trigonometry.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.310
So what does that us?

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.220
Well, the ratio between
corresponding sides

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.810
is always the same.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.270
So let's say we want to figure
out how long this side of

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.110
the small triangle is.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.040
Well there's a bunch of
ways we could do it.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:00.450
We could say that the ratio of
this side to this side, so x to

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:07.505
7 is going to be equal to the
ratio of this side to this side

00:05:07.505 --> 00:05:11.680
-- is equal to the
ratio of 2 to 5.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.440
And then we could solve it.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.150
And the only reason why we can
do this -- you can't do this

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.150
with just random triangles, you
can only do this with

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.100
similar triangles.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.090
So we could then solve for x,
multiply both sides but 7 and

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.200
you get x is equal
to 14 over 5.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.910
So it's a little
bit less than 3.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.180
So 14 over 5, so 2.8 or
something like that,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.550
that equals x.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.640
And we could do the same thing
to figure out this yellow side.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.200
So if you know two triangles
are similar, you know all the

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.775
sides of one of the triangles,
you know one of the sides of

00:05:41.775 --> 00:05:44.760
the other triangle, you can
figure out all the sides.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.720
I think I just confused
you with that comment.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.730
So, this side, so
let's call this y.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.000
So we could do the same way.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.230
We could say y over 6 is equal
to 2 over 5, Right Make sure if

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:02.710
you're doing one triangle's
going to be the denominator

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.260
here, then that same
triangle has to be the

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.520
denominator on the--.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.400
If one triangle is the
numerator on the left hand side

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.590
of the equal sign, right, so
the smaller one's

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.570
the numerator.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.900
Then it's also going to be the
numerator on the right hand

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.030
side of the equal sign.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:19.620
I just want to make sure
you're consistent that way.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.870
If you flip it then you're
going to mess everything up.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.180
And then we can just solve for,
so y is equal to 12 over 5.

00:06:30.736 --> 00:06:33.920
So, let's use this information
about similar triangles

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.300
just to do some problems.

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.680
So let's use some of the
geometry we've already learned.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:58.340
I have two parallel lines, then
I have a line like that, then

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.650
I have a line like this.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.390
What did I say, I said that the
lines are parallel, so this

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:09.010
line is parallel to this line.

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:24.990
And I want to know if this side
is length 5, what is -- well,

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.180
let's say this length is length
5, let's say that this length

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.030
is -- let me draw
another color.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:37.790
This length is, I
don't know, 8.

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:48.330
I want to know what
this side is.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.030
Actually no, let me give you
one more side just to make sure

00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:53.320
you know all of one triangle.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.090
Let's say that this side is 6,
and what I want to do is I want

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:05.570
to figure out what this side is
right here, this purple side.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.540
So how do we do this?

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.390
So before we start using any of
that ratio stuff, we have to

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.610
prove to ourselves and prove in
general, that these are

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.580
similar triangles.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.280
So how can we do that?

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.510
Let's see if we can figure
out which angles are

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:23.090
equal to other angles.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.020
So we have this angle here.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.330
Is this angle equal to any
of these three angles

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.820
in this triangle?

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:31.455
Well, yeah sure.

00:08:31.455 --> 00:08:33.990
It's opposite this angle right
here, so this is going to be

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:37.570
equal to this angle
right here, right?

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.900
So we know that its opposite
side is it's corresponding

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.380
side, so we know that it
corresponds to -- we don't know

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.040
its length, but we know it
corresponds to this

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.170
8 length, right?

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.200
I forgot to give you
some information.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.860
I forgot to tell you that
this side is -- let me

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.150
give it a neutral color.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.340
Let's say that this side is 4.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.470
Let's go back to the problem.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.340
So we just figured out these
two angles are the same, and

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.570
that this is that angle's
corresponding side.

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:05.590
Can we figure out any other
angles are the same?

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.430
Let's say we know
what this angle is.

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.100
I'm going to do kind of a
double angle measure here.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.480
So what angle in this triangle
-- does any angle here

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.990
equal that angle?

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.410
Sure.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.850
We know that these are parallel
lines, so we can use alternate

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.180
interior angles to figure out
which of these angles

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.830
equals that one.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.430
But I just saw the time
and I realize I'm

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.390
running out of time.

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:33.140
So I will continue this
in the next video.
