00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.370
JOSH YGUADO: My
name is Josh Yguado.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.300
I'm co-founder and
president of SGN.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.370
SGN is the fastest growing
mobile game developer

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.020
at scale in the West.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.790
Four of us founded the
company, and since then, we've

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.120
grown to over 200 employees.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.510
Our goal is to
continue that growth.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.150
Right now we've got four
games that are top-grossing.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.790
And we want to continue
to expand the portfolio

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.790
of top-grossing games.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.940
All of our products launch
across multiple platforms

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.290
simultaneously.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.050
Getting that right
can be very hard.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.427
If you want to succeed
in this industry,

00:00:39.427 --> 00:00:41.260
you have to make sure
that you're constantly

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.999
iterating on your product.

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:45.040
When you're at scale, that
can be very difficult,

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.100
because there are tens of
millions of players every day

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.362
enjoying your game.

00:00:49.362 --> 00:00:51.070
MATTHEW CASERTANO:
I'm Matthew Casertano.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.280
I'm SVP of game
operations at SGN.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.660
Testing has really helped us
move from subjective criteria

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.570
to objective criteria.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.380
The inability to test led to
a lot of qualitative decision

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.880
making.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.540
Now with the tools
that we have, we're

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.830
able to make
quantitative-based decisions

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.760
and use a very
short feedback loop.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.560
For Cookie Jam, we ran a
really interesting icon test

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.060
in which we toyed with the
background of the icon.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.075
This led to an 8% increase
in our conversion rate.

00:01:19.075 --> 00:01:23.180
We use the agency that
specializes in the preferences

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.310
of Japanese consumers.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.690
And we came up with
an icon that we

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.660
use heavy pinks and yellows
that performed 12% better

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.660
with the Japanese consumers.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.260
Another game that we ran
experiments on was Panda Pop.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.950
Previously, we had
an icon with a baby

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.480
panda flying through the
air surrounded by bubbles.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.280
Our designers came up
with a cool concept

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.170
with the baby panda.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.830
Instead of flying, he was
frolicking among the bubbles.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.390
When we switched
over the icon, we

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.300
saw an uptick of 25% in organic
traffic and an uptick of 4%

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.440
on the install rate.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.560
We ran a really interesting
icon test in Book of Life.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.000
The icon that featured
Maria performed 10% better

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.110
than the icon that
we had previously,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.380
which featured Chuy.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.890
Additionally, for Book of
Life, we tested different copy

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.139
for our description.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.340
We found that the enhanced copy,
which was a little bit more

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.550
direct and shorter, performed
4% better than the existing copy

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.280
that we had in the store.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.710
Store experiments have helped
SGN improve its ROI equation

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.500
by improving our costs through
higher conversion rates,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.571
and improving our LTVs through
higher retention rates.

00:02:28.571 --> 00:02:30.820
Each test that we've run,
we've learned something new.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.600
It's provided us with
actionable results that have

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.200
helped improve our business.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.920
JOSH YGUADO: My
first piece of advice

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.100
is no matter how big you
are, you have to stay nimble.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.230
Be willing to innovate.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.200
Be willing to fail.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.130
You also have to
love what you do.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.840
So we love to play casual games.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.040
I think that's core to
making a successful company,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.740
and to making a game
that people want to play.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.090
