- And I realize
she's looking at a pig...

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:13.546
driving a car...

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.180
doing cocaine.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.184

[cheers and applause]

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:55.121
- Hello, everybody, welcome
to "This Is Not Happening."

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.622
I'm your host, Ari Shaffir,

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:58.991
and today all the stories
are about nostalgia.

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:01.627
[cheers and applause]

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:03.897
Hells, yes.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.065
This first comic,
what an honor to introduce him.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.501
He's absolutely hilarious,
a legend of stand-up comedy.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.136
Please give it up
for my friend and yours--

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:12.004
<i> Mr. Artie Lange,
 everybody.</i>

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:15.474
<i> [cheers and applause]</i>

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:18.010
- My story has to do
with cocaine, and--

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.278
[laughter and cheering]

00:01:19.278 --> 00:01:20.846
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
listen,

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:22.515
I've had a love affair
with cocaine--

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:24.684
a love/hate affair,
you know, it's--

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:27.019
I mean, I'm the only guy
who ever got fat on cocaine,

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.822
as far--

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:30.856
I went to rehab for coke.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:32.458
I swear to God--
this is a true story.

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:33.926
I'm in group therapy,

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.662
and this black kid
walked up to me and said,

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:39.699
"What are you, pouring that shit
on cheeseburgers?"

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:42.535
[laughter]

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:50.710
"God damn, you're the fattest
cokehead I ever seen?"

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:55.381
That's how black guys talked
in my rehab.

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.485
I went to rehab in 1888.

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:03.155
Uh, so, okay, I--
here's the story.

00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:06.025
I come out here in 1995

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.561
to do a show called "MADtv."

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:10.063
It was a sketch-comedy show.

00:02:10.063 --> 00:02:14.233
[cheers and applause]
Oh, oh, thank--all right.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:15.801
Thank you.
I mean, you know, the show was--

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:16.836
it was fun, you know.

00:02:16.836 --> 00:02:18.738
I was 27 years old,
came out here,

00:02:18.738 --> 00:02:20.406
and the first time
I was ever out here

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:22.842
was the screen test
for "MADtv."

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:26.011
And I came out here with a job,
making, like, ten grand a week,

00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:27.346
and it was great.

00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:31.084
The problem was,
I brought from New York City

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:34.420
a massive cocaine problem.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.189
And I somehow had
a coke problem

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.393
with $40 in my pocket
in New York.

00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:43.162
Now I had
ten grand a week, okay?

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:46.832
And I literally would intercept
the checks at "MAD"--

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:49.335
I would go to the accounting
office at "MADtv,"

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:50.736
before it went to my agent.

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:53.439
I would get the check.
I would cash it.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.107
I would send, like, four grand
to my mother

00:02:55.107 --> 00:02:56.342
'cause she needed it.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.876
I would put six grand
in my pocket

00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:00.046
and walk around L.A. like I was
Jack fucking Nicholson,

00:03:00.046 --> 00:03:02.081
you know.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:05.451
And, you know, I had a blast,
but, you know--

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.587
I was on a train
that was gonna hit a mountain,

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:10.590
you know, that was--
moving real fast.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.726
So a lot of the sketches
we did on "MADtv," we did--

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:16.295
we did film parodies, okay,
'cause that's "Mad"--

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:18.231
It was based
on "Mad" magazine,

00:03:18.231 --> 00:03:20.266
and, you know,

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:24.103
you did these bad, bad puns

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.638
of movie titles,

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:28.474
and we'd have a pitch meeting
to pitch this stuff,

00:03:28.474 --> 00:03:30.976
and I would just say stuff
as a joke.

00:03:30.976 --> 00:03:32.545
Like,
instead of "Dead Man Walking,

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:36.082
I'd say,
"Ed McMahon Walking"...

00:03:36.082 --> 00:03:37.316
as a joke, in the back.

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:39.118
Cut to me in three hours
of prosthetics

00:03:39.118 --> 00:03:42.588
as Ed McMahon.

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:44.156
Stuff like--
one time, I pitched--

00:03:44.156 --> 00:03:45.891
They told us
that Tori Spelling

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:47.926
had agreed to do
a guest spot on the show,

00:03:47.926 --> 00:03:51.831
and I pitched
the Tori Spelling Bee.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:57.003
And it--
[laughs]

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:59.338
The Tori Spelling Bee,
and she would, you know,

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:00.673
have to spell words,

00:04:00.673 --> 00:04:02.775
and she would have to use words
in a sentence,

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:06.245
and the one word she would have
to spell was "nepotism."

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:10.149
[laughter]

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.817
[laughs]

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:13.953
And then use it in a sentence,
and the sentence was her

00:04:13.953 --> 00:04:17.857
looking right at the camera,
going, "I like nepotism."

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.027
So stuff like that.

00:04:22.027 --> 00:04:26.799
So one of the sketches we did
was called "Babe Watch,"

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:31.871
and that was Babe the Pig
in "Baywatch."

00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:33.372
My hand to God.

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:36.041
So guess who played
Babe the Pig?

00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:37.643
<i> Moi.</i>

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:39.511
And there was
a lot of fucking money

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.347
for these sketches
at the time.

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:44.216
We had a big budget, so we
shot it on location in Malibu.

00:04:44.216 --> 00:04:45.551
It was a two-day shoot.

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:46.886
I go out there.
I had to be there at 4:00 a.m.

00:04:46.886 --> 00:04:51.491
to get three hours
of pig prosthetics--

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:55.661
a pig face, a pig snout,
six teats,

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:58.364
the bikini top on each one--
that was the joke, you know,

00:04:58.364 --> 00:05:00.533
and...

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:04.470
You didn't see us at the Emmys
a lot back then.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.705
So, anyway, yeah.

00:05:06.705 --> 00:05:08.474
So six teats
and a pig snout.

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:09.742
Now, the woman
who did the makeup

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.477
was the best in the business
at this.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:14.681
So three hours of prosthetics,
I look like a fucking pig, man.

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.915
I looked in the mirror,
and I was like, "My God."

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:20.253
I had a pig snout covering
my mouth and my nose

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.754
and the ears and all that shit
and the teats.

00:05:22.754 --> 00:05:24.189
So I go back
to my trailer.

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.924
We got about an hour
before we're shooting.

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:27.760
I go back,
and I start eating.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.497
Now, I catch of glimpse of me
in the mirror, eating.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:34.600
[laughter]

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.201
Guys, I'm--

00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:40.506
literally, I'm going,
"I'm a fucking pig."

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:42.608
I'm a pig eating.

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:45.912
This is not why
I signed up for this, you know.

00:05:45.912 --> 00:05:47.680
I don't want to be
in show business

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:48.914
to be this, you know.

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:50.282
So I really started
to freak out.

00:05:50.282 --> 00:05:52.084
It was, like,
a 14-hour shoot,

00:05:52.084 --> 00:05:54.419
and I said, "I'm not gonna get
through this without cocaine."

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.054
Not gonna happen.

00:05:56.054 --> 00:05:59.959
So my coke dealer in New York
hooked me up with this guy,

00:05:59.959 --> 00:06:03.462
a contact he had in L.A.
who was a coke dealer,

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:06.966
and this guy--
he was a Rastafarian guy.

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:10.236
I don't want to be,
you know, racial,

00:06:10.236 --> 00:06:14.407
but they just happen to dominate
that business, all right?

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.475
And--
[laughter]

00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:20.046
And he was the best
cocaine dealer ever.

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.814
He was always
right on time.

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:23.549
You called him, he was like,
"I'm there," you know.

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:25.651
He was kind of--
he was always at a party

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:28.321
no matter what time
of the day it was.

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:31.156
He was like Harvey Keitel
in "Pulp Fiction,"

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:32.658
you know, the--
[laughs]

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.927
The Wolf, like,
"You sending The Wolf, baby?

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:39.398
That's Kool and the Gang."

00:06:39.398 --> 00:06:42.468
So I call him.
I call him from the set.

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:43.936
And I go,
"Dude, you got to fucking--

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:45.504
You got to meet me
on the Pacific Coast Highway."

00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:47.106
We were in Malibu,
by Oxnard.

00:06:47.106 --> 00:06:49.142
"You got to meet me.
I got to get something from you.

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:51.077
I got to get an eight ball
from you," and he goes,

00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:53.279
"All right, all right, can you
get to this restaurant, Duke's--

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:57.016
Can you get to the restaurant
on the Pacific Coast Highway?"

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:58.951
And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah,
I think I can."

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:01.153
So I hang up with him.
I look around.

00:07:01.153 --> 00:07:04.122
Now, I'm in every shot
of this sketch.

00:07:04.122 --> 00:07:06.358
I look at the--
the assistant director's

00:07:06.358 --> 00:07:07.527
not looking for two seconds.

00:07:07.527 --> 00:07:08.827
I run to my car.

00:07:08.827 --> 00:07:13.031
I get in my car,
and I speed the fuck away.

00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:14.133
I just speed away.

00:07:14.133 --> 00:07:17.370
I'm doing, like,
90 miles an hour...

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.672
looking, I'm telling you,

00:07:19.672 --> 00:07:23.509
exactly like a pig.

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:26.479
I do, like, 90 up the highway,
took about 20 minutes.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:29.048
I get to Duke's. I pull in.
He's already there.

00:07:29.048 --> 00:07:30.849
The fucking guy--
[stutters]

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:33.952
What, were you at a brunch
at Duke's? What happened?

00:07:33.952 --> 00:07:35.554
'Cause I mean, anyone here
who does drugs,

00:07:35.554 --> 00:07:39.224
you got to score, you know--
you know, coke or heroin or--

00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:40.826
you know, we all know
what it's like

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:42.695
to score heroin, right?

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:45.230
[laughter]

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.699
[laughs]

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:50.836
I don't know.
I was at a church social, sorry.

00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:52.537
So, you know,
they're never there.

00:07:52.537 --> 00:07:54.139
These guys are
never there.

00:07:54.139 --> 00:07:55.974
You're supposed to meet them,
you know, in Brooklyn,

00:07:55.974 --> 00:07:58.010
and you get a call
a half hour later,

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.745
the guy goes--like,
a Puerto Rican guy going,

00:07:59.745 --> 00:08:04.083
"Yo, man,
I'm in North Carolina now."

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:05.751
"Excuse me?
'Cause I'm in Brooklyn."

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:07.420
"Yeah, man, I'm sorry.
I fucked up.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.590
Can you get
to North Carolina?"

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.892
This guy was efficient.
Okay.

00:08:13.892 --> 00:08:15.861
So I get there.
I get out of my car.

00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:17.362
I run to him.
He gets out of his car.

00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:19.865
Now, I never told him
I was on a TV show,

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:22.435
'cause I was afraid to, like,
share my life with him,

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:23.669
and I forget myself.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:28.573
He sees me get
out of this car...

00:08:28.573 --> 00:08:33.279
dressed
exactly like a pig.

00:08:33.279 --> 00:08:36.048
And he looks at me, and--
It's so fucking--

00:08:36.048 --> 00:08:40.018
[laughter]

00:08:40.018 --> 00:08:42.454
I'll never forget
the look on his face.

00:08:42.454 --> 00:08:45.124
[babbling and laughing]

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.129
When I retell this story,

00:08:50.129 --> 00:08:52.798
this might be
the funniest fucking part.

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:55.268
He goes--he looks at me,
and he goes--

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:01.740
"Damn, man, what kind
of crazy shit are you into?"

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.444
[laughter and applause]

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:08.047
He probably thought
I was at some crazy drug party,

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:09.114
you know?

00:09:09.114 --> 00:09:12.285
People dressed like pigs,
like the--

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:16.155
like the "Eyes Wide Shut"
orgy scene, you know?

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:21.260
What's the other password?

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.264
So I said--
I had to come clean.

00:09:25.264 --> 00:09:28.967
"Oh, no, I'm on a TV show.
I'm doing a sketch.

00:09:28.967 --> 00:09:31.103
Like, I'm paid--the pig--
it's a long story."

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:32.738
And then he goes,
"You're on a show?

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:33.839
What show you are on?"

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.241
and I go, "'MADtv.'"

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.308
He goes, "Oh, damn."

00:09:36.308 --> 00:09:37.677
Look, can we talk
about this later?

00:09:37.677 --> 00:09:38.911
I just need the coke,
you know?

00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.846
He was starstruck
for a second.

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:42.347
So I get the cocaine
from him.

00:09:42.347 --> 00:09:43.949
I can't pay.
I don't have anything on me.

00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:46.151
But he was, again,
the best drug dealer ever.

00:09:46.151 --> 00:09:48.687
He took credit. He goes,
"Fine. Don't worry about it."

00:09:48.687 --> 00:09:51.189
So I grab the coke,
and now I'm, like, so freaked,

00:09:51.189 --> 00:09:52.023
I got to do some.

00:09:52.023 --> 00:09:53.592
I have to do some immediately,

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:56.662
just to get myself ready
for what I'm going back to.

00:09:56.662 --> 00:10:00.166
I get back in my car, and anyone
who's ever had a cocaine problem

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:02.334
knows what a key hit is.
You put--

00:10:02.334 --> 00:10:03.702
If you don't have a straw,
you know,

00:10:03.702 --> 00:10:05.771
you put some coke
on a key.

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.840
You know this, right?
[laughs]

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:10.309
[laughter]

00:10:10.309 --> 00:10:11.877
[laughs]

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:15.514
I apologize. You look
really grossed out by me, but--

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:17.716
[laughter]

00:10:17.716 --> 00:10:19.885
For a ton of reasons,
but--

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.319
So I put some coke--

00:10:21.319 --> 00:10:24.056
Again, forgetting
what I look like--

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:26.392
I put some coke
on the end of a key.

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:28.527
I go to do it.

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:33.031
I can't get the coke
through the pig snout.

00:10:33.031 --> 00:10:34.667
I can't do it,
so now I'm thinking--

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:37.236
[laughs] I'm the only one
in the history of the world

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:41.640
who's ever had
this problem.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.408
So now, three hours
of prosthetics

00:10:43.408 --> 00:10:44.710
I went through, okay?

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.078
And I'm trying to get

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:47.546
the fucking, you know, key
through the thing.

00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:49.347
I can't do it,
so I'm like, "Fuck it."

00:10:49.347 --> 00:10:50.149
I make a decision.

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.383
I break the fucking nose,

00:10:51.383 --> 00:10:53.185
which means
when I get back there,

00:10:53.185 --> 00:10:54.853
it's gonna be an hour
of fixing it before we shoot.

00:10:54.853 --> 00:10:56.421
I'm in every shot.

00:10:56.421 --> 00:11:00.726
So I break the fucking pig nose.
I do a couple of blasts.

00:11:00.726 --> 00:11:02.094
I'm like,
"Okay, I'm fine."

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:03.695
Now I get back
on the Pacific Coast Highway,

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:05.330
I rush back towards Oxnard.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:08.267
I stop at a light
at Topanga Canyon,

00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:10.102
and I figure I'm gonna do
another hit.

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:12.571
It's broad daylight.
It's, like, 8:00 in the morning.

00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:13.906
[laughs]

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:16.175
[laughter]

00:11:16.175 --> 00:11:18.344
So I do another hit.
I got the--

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:20.011
I got it up to my nose
like this,

00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:23.281
I look over, and
there's this beautiful woman

00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:25.851
in a Lamborghini.

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:28.754
This is the look
on her face...

00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:33.058
[laughter]

00:11:33.058 --> 00:11:37.930
And I realize
she's looking at a pig...

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:42.601
driving a car...

00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:44.904
doing cocaine.

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:50.643
Then I'm thinking,
you know, "Fuck her.

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:52.244
"This is L.A.

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:55.447
It's probably the third time
she saw that that day."

00:11:55.447 --> 00:11:57.082
[laughs]

00:11:57.082 --> 00:11:58.651
At this point, I have no--

00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:00.485
I'm like, "Fuck it.
I don't care who sees what."

00:12:00.485 --> 00:12:04.089
So I do another hit. I drive.
I get to the fucking set.

00:12:04.089 --> 00:12:06.325
Everybody wants to kill me,

00:12:06.325 --> 00:12:08.126
but they can't really
say it yet,

00:12:08.126 --> 00:12:10.996
because we got to do
14 hours of shooting.

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:14.099
So they see that my fucking nose
is fucked up.

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:16.302
They have to redo my nose,

00:12:16.302 --> 00:12:18.436
and, you know,
we start shooting,

00:12:18.436 --> 00:12:21.140
and everybody couldn't stand--
Look, I was a fuck-up.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.510
Every two hours, I broke
the nose again to do coke,

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.345
and every two hours,
she had to fix it.

00:12:26.345 --> 00:12:28.914
And she knew what was going on.
I wasn't fooling anybody.

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:30.349
So this happens.

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:32.985
We get through the day,
and it's a nightmare.

00:12:32.985 --> 00:12:35.420
So we had to shoot
the next day.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.658
They got us a little motel
right on the ocean there,

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:40.992
which was next to the shoot,

00:12:40.992 --> 00:12:42.961
So I go in.
I fall asleep.

00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:44.830
They rip all the shit
off me.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:47.800
I fall asleep in the bed.
I wake up the next morning.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.868
At some point
during the night,

00:12:49.868 --> 00:12:53.805
every bad thing in my body
must have just fell out of me.

00:12:53.805 --> 00:12:58.277
I mean, yeah, I just--
I shit the bed.

00:12:58.277 --> 00:13:01.713
And I had a lot of bad
in me.

00:13:01.713 --> 00:13:04.383
I wake up--you know the scene
in "The Godfather,"

00:13:04.383 --> 00:13:08.153
the horse's head, where he
wakes up, he sees all the blood?

00:13:08.153 --> 00:13:11.290
I was like...
[screaming]

00:13:13.392 --> 00:13:16.561
[laughs]
I had shit all over the bed.

00:13:16.561 --> 00:13:18.397
I was late.
I had no time to clean it up.

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:21.500
I I took
a steaming-hot shower,

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.667
steaming hot, every--

00:13:22.667 --> 00:13:24.670
took everything off,
got dressed, ran out.

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:27.039
I had no time. We were checking
out of the hotel.

00:13:27.039 --> 00:13:28.674
I had no time to clean up.

00:13:28.674 --> 00:13:32.911
So I just threw the bedspread
over all the shit.

00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:36.248
I mean, it was
a river of shit.

00:13:36.248 --> 00:13:39.084
I just threw it
over the fucking thing and left.

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:40.652
What could I do,
you know?

00:13:40.652 --> 00:13:44.657
I had no cash for a tip...

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.359
which is very rude.

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:49.828
And I got there.
I got through the day.

00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:50.829
Everything was fine.

00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:52.564
So we're driving home,

00:13:52.564 --> 00:13:54.866
and I'm thinking about the
hotel, and I'm worried about it.

00:13:54.866 --> 00:13:56.402
I'm like, "Ah, well, you know,

00:13:56.402 --> 00:13:58.103
I'm just gonna have to be
embarrassed by that,"

00:13:58.103 --> 00:13:59.871
but then I realized
the room wasn't in my name.

00:13:59.871 --> 00:14:02.774
The room was in the name of
the first assistant director...

00:14:02.774 --> 00:14:06.545
[laughter]

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.119
This guy Josh, you know.

00:14:14.119 --> 00:14:15.621
If they want to blame somebody,
they're gonna say,

00:14:15.621 --> 00:14:17.356
"This guy Josh, you know,
shit the bed

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:19.891
and didn't clean up,"

00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:22.928
which got me off the hook,
but it made me feel happy/

00:14:22.928 --> 00:14:25.130
It really did.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.265
The Rasta guy,
the coke dealer--

00:14:27.265 --> 00:14:31.970
again, he was the single--
the single coolest motherfucker,

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:34.306
as far as fast living,
didn't care.

00:14:34.306 --> 00:14:36.375
About two years later,
I found out that he--

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:39.211
he was
in a metallic-blue Corvette

00:14:39.211 --> 00:14:41.646
driving with this chick
he dated

00:14:41.646 --> 00:14:46.485
up a winding street
up by Northern California.

00:14:46.485 --> 00:14:48.420
He was doing, like,
100 miles an hour, veered off,

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:53.125
hit a 18-wheeler, and just--
the two people disintegrated.

00:14:53.125 --> 00:14:55.327
That's how he died,
so he's dead.

00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:58.430
And I'll tell you what,
in the weirdest of ways--

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.666
and this is
why I'm a fuck-up in life

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:03.235
and I care
about all the wrong things.

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.671
In the weirdest of ways,
I miss that motherfucker

00:15:05.671 --> 00:15:09.508
more than anybody
I've ever met

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:12.844
in Los Angeles.

00:15:12.844 --> 00:15:16.582
My name's Artie Lange.
That's my story.
