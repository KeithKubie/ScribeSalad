00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.470
Stars, stars they're hottest to boot, the
more they heat the more they toot, the more

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.599
they toot the better the appeal -- except
when the stellar mass is so high that it burns

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:17.400
our planet to 
a cinder.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.900
sunspots
Stars are the building blocks of the universe,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.380
galaxies are made of them, and each create
their own solar systems.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.289
I titled this to be consistent with other
science publications, but when people talk

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.339
about "weighing" a star, I die a little.

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.950
Weight is the measure of gravity's pull on
our mass -- it's relative; on different places

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.160
on Earth or on different planets, our weight
changes relative to gravitation.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.720
So, obviously, you can't really weigh a star…
but you CAN determine how much matter is inside

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.840
which can tell you a star's life story!

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.620
I spoke to Dr. Natalie Hinkel, the co-director
of NASA's NExSS (Nexus for Exoplanet System

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:54.620
Science).

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.200
(She measures stars for a living), and she
told DNews, "The smaller the star, the dimmer

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.830
it tends to be but also the longer it lives.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.150
The bigger the star, the brighter it will
shine,… but the shorter it will live.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.280
If a star is big, the Habitable Zone is much
further away from the star; if a star is small,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.360
the Habitable Zone is closer to the star."

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.090
Before we can understand the planets that
might orbit a star, we have to understand

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.890
the star itself, and THAT starts with looking
at solar mass!

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.840
So, measuring solar mass can tell scientists
massive amounts of data about what kind of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.390
star it is, it's potential lifespan, when
it was born, whether it can have planets,

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.310
and even what kind of planets might be in
orbit!

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.799
Because we know the most about it, astronomers
pegged our personal star "the sun," at one

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.670
"solar mass" unit!

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.700
// We're number 1!

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.289
Literally! we're number 1!

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.340
// Big stars like blue giants, supergiants
and hypergiants can be hundreds of solar masses

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.850
and, according to Universe Today, can give
off 66,000 times the energy of our sun!

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.830
This means any exoplanet system would be COMPLETELY
alien to our experience.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.829
By studying stars we know ours is actually
pretty small for a white star -- any smaller,

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.320
and they dim and turn red.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.749
You can even have a star that is point-075
of our solar mass, or about 80 times larger

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.540
than Jupiter… that would be a brown dwarf,
the only thing that keeps those stars hot

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.300
is the friction of their own gravitational
collapse.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.300
Sad.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.010
There are two main ways to "weigh" a star.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.010
Ugh.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.910
One works if you know there's a planet there,
so for most stars, that's out.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.920
The other works for binary stars -- two stars
that orbit each other.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.330
By meshing Kepler's laws of orbital mechanics
and Newton's laws of gravity astronomers can

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.610
measure the mass of incandescent gas in these
giant nuclear furnaces.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.870
It's complicated, but essentially they watch
the stars move over days or months and, measure

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.850
their luminosity -- or light emitted, orbital
period, and velocity to determine their mass.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.870
This doesn't always work, because not all
stars are binary -- obviously, like ours…

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.810
But now, a new study in October 2015's Science
Advances, found a way to measure solar masses

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.460
of some these lonely stars -- by using pulses
of nuclear energy!

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.760
A pulsar, is a kind of star which emits a
"rotating beam of electromagnetic radiation

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.450
which can be detected when the beam sweeps
past Earth" almost like a galactic lighthouse.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.650
These beams are so steady you could almost
mark time to them, but sometimes, in young

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.760
pulsars, they "glitch."

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.540
Using these glitches, and the mathematics
of nuclear physics and superfluids -- which

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.590
I don't entirely understand -- researchers
can determine the mass of a star.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.520
Damn girl!

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.040
This expands our knowledge of the universe
even further!

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.860
Dr. Hinkel told me, "In the field of exoplanet
exploration, it is often said that you cannot

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.850
learn about the planet until you understand
the host star."

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.920
If you know the mass of a star, you can understand
its physical properties, and then, through

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.260
observation determine if it has a planet.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.570
From there, we sometimes can learn the mass
of that planet, the size, and sometimes, if

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.840
the planet passes in front of the star, what
atmosphere it had, and the properties of the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.840
planet too.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.840
Without the stellar mass, none of this would
be possible.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.840
Stars are like ogres, er… onions… they
have layers.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.840
Once they've burned through their fuel (hydrogen)
and converted into other elements (like helium

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.840
or carbon), they'll stop shining and eventually
die in a supernova explosion.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840
That supernova combines those heavier elements
together and throws them out into the universe…

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.840
Eventually, those elements become Earth…
plants… and us.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.290
All heavy elements originated either in stars
or in their supernovae and understanding the

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.831
matter inside stars, and how that can vary,
helps us understand our universe, and even

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:09.831
to some extent ourselves.

00:04:09.831 --> 00:04:10.831
By trying to understand how solar matter works,
we're looking billions of years into the past

00:04:10.831 --> 00:04:11.831
to understand a bit about ourselves too.

00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:13.240
[[YT]] If this broke your mind a little, that's
okay.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.620
I like to do that occasionally.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.840
And if you love science as much as we do,
you could come join us at the Bay Area Science

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:20.840
Festival!

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.820
We're putting on our very first LIVE SHOW.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.520
ON STAGE at the Castro Theater!

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.860
We're going to have DNews favs Amy Shira Teitel,
Dr. Crystal Dilworth, plus illusionist Brian

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.930
Brushwood, biologists Dr. Joe Hanson and Dr.
Carin Bondar will be there… seriously it's

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.509
going to be a nice of nerdy nerdy goodness.

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:45.150

If you have questions for Dr. Hinkel, find
her on Twitter at Natalie_Hinkel, and ask

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.370
her about stars.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.030
Anything else you want to know about space?
