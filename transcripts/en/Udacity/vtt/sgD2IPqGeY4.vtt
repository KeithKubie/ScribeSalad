00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.580
In this lesson, we'll cover the End to

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:04.270
End Argument, as discussed in the paper, End to

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:07.770
End Arguments in System Design by Saltzer, Reed,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.440
and Clark in 1981. In a nutshell, the End

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.300
to End Argument reads as follows. The function

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.100
in question can completely and correctly be implemented only

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.770
with the knowledge and application standing at the end

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.620
points of the communication system. Therefore, providing that questioned

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.780
function as a feature of the communication

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.350
system itself. Is not possible. Essentially, what

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.060
the argument says, is that the intelligence

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.910
required to implement a particular application on

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.230
the communication system, should be placed at

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.550
the endpoints, rather than in the middle

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.100
of the network. Commonly used examples of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.900
the end-to-end argument include, error handling and

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.680
file transfer, encrypting end to end versus hop

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.380
by hop in the network, and the partition

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.100
of T C P and I P of

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.500
error handling, flow control, and congestion control. Sometimes the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
end to end argument is summarized as, the

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.820
network should be dumb and minimal. And the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.640
end points should be intelligent. Many people argue

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.150
that the end to end argument allowed the internet

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.160
to grow rapidly, because innovation took place at the edge in

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.350
applications and services, rather than in the middle of the network,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.840
which can be hard to change sometimes. Let's look at one

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.880
example of the end to end argument. Error handling in file transfer.
