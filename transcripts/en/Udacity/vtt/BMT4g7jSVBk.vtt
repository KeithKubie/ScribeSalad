00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.270
What answers did you come up with,
David?

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.200
&gt;&gt; So I counted out seven
possible next states.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:10.170
We can put B on A, B on D,
B on the table, A on B,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.540
A on D or D on B or D on A.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.720
So that's seven total operations.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.810
Of those, only one of them accomplishes
a goal we hadn't already accomplished,

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.360
and that's putting A up on B.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.090
&gt;&gt; That's good, David.
