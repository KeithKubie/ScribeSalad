00:00:00.581 --> 00:00:02.233
Voiceover:I have a system of 2 equations

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:03.366
with 2 unknowns here.

00:00:03.366 --> 00:00:04.566
We've seen how to solve this,

00:00:04.566 --> 00:00:06.233
and there's multiple
techniques we've used,

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:08.166
substitution, elimination,

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.766
and we could do that right over here.

00:00:09.766 --> 00:00:11.235
In fact, you could just add the two.

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:12.834
The left sides of the equations

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:14.169
and the right sides of the equations,

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:16.340
the s's would cancel out.

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.366
Actually, let's just do it to show

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:19.768
how that's relatively straightforward,

00:00:19.768 --> 00:00:21.501
for at least this example right over here.

00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:23.300
You add the left-hand sides.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.635
These cancel out.

00:00:24.635 --> 00:00:27.266
You're left with negative t.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.700
Negative t is equal to 7 plus
negative 6 is equal to 1,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.700
or you get the t is equal to negative 1.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.433
t is equal to negative 1.

00:00:39.433 --> 00:00:41.567
If t is equal to negative 1,

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:45.633
this top equation, you
could use either one,

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:48.600
would simplify to 2 times s.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:52.333
Negative 5 times negative 1 is plus 5.

00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:55.534
Plus 5 is equal to 7,

00:00:55.658 --> 00:00:57.330
is equal to ...

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.635
let me use those same colors
that we have over there,

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:05.366
is equal to 7, or, and we
could do this part in our head,

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:08.766
2s must be equal to 2
and that s is equal to 1.

00:01:08.766 --> 00:01:11.100
2 times 1 plus 5 is 7,

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.834
and so we have s is equal to 1.

00:01:13.834 --> 00:01:15.666
That was pretty straightforward.

00:01:15.777 --> 00:01:17.367
What we're going to do in this video

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:20.301
is represent the same system,

00:01:20.301 --> 00:01:22.100
but we're going to
represent it esssentially

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.834
as a matrix equation,

00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:27.679
and we're going to solve
it using inverse matrices.

00:01:28.077 --> 00:01:30.433
I'll give you a little bit of a warning.

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:32.167
It's going to be more involved.

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:33.967
It's going to take us more time to this,

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:34.700
and you're probably going to say,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.900
"Well, why are we even going
through the trouble of it?"

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.330
The value of what we're
going to do in this video

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.379
is that it's very useful in computation

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:44.435
where you might solve
almost the same system

00:01:44.435 --> 00:01:46.330
over and over and over again.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.330
Maybe the left-hand sides are the same,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.711
the right-hands keep changing,

00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:51.868
and this might be something
that you might see

00:01:51.868 --> 00:01:53.433
while writing a computer game

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:58.373
or while working on some
type of a computer problem.

00:01:58.711 --> 00:01:59.833
And this is a general theme.

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:02.700
A lot of the value of
matrices are they are ways

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.167
to represent problems,

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:05.500
mathematical problems,

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.919
ways to represent data,

00:02:08.673 --> 00:02:11.981
and then we can use matrix
operations, matrix equations

00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:14.300
to essentially manipulate
them in appropriate ways

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.900
if we're, for the most part,
writing computer programs

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.933
or things like computer programs.

00:02:19.592 --> 00:02:21.930
Bear with me, you will
enjoy it eventually,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.119
what we're about to do,

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:26.333
and one day, you will see that
it is actually quite useful.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.171
The first thing we need to
see or need to appreciate

00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:32.200
is that this can be represented
by a matrix equation.

00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:33.633
Now what I'm going to
do is I'm going to take

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:35.433
the coefficients here.

00:02:36.003 --> 00:02:38.433
I'm going to take the coefficients here,

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:42.334
so 2, negative 5,

00:02:42.673 --> 00:02:45.433
2, negative 5,

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:47.188
negative 2,

00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:50.333
negative 2 and 4, and positive 4.

00:02:50.438 --> 00:02:54.340
All I've done is I've taken
the coefficients here,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.103
and I'm going to claim that
that times the column vector,

00:02:58.103 --> 00:03:00.333
column vector st,

00:03:00.673 --> 00:03:03.866
s and t,

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:11.866
being equal to the column
vector 7, negative 6,

00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:15.200
7, negative 6,

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:19.433
is the exact same thing as
what we have right over here.

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:21.980
These are representing
the same constraints

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.170
on the variable s and t.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.302
You say, "Wait, I don't quite get that."

00:03:25.302 --> 00:03:27.233
If you're saying you don't quite get that,

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:28.733
multiply this out.

00:03:28.766 --> 00:03:31.252
Multiply this out and
think about which entries

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:34.135
they need to be equal to
when you multiply it out.

00:03:34.368 --> 00:03:37.966
And you would see this entry,
this first row, first column,

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:39.366
that's going to be this row.

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:41.901
We're going to be dealing
with this row and that column,

00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:47.433
so if you think about it,
this tells us that 2 times s,

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:53.970
2 times s plus negative 5 times t,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.033
so I could say minus 5 times t

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:02.100
must be equal to the first entry up here,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.300
first row, first column,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.766
is equal to 7.

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:06.567
All I did is I multiplied,

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:08.566
I dealt with the first
row, first column and said,

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:11.300
when I take essentially
the dot product of those,

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.167
and if you don't know what a
dot product is, don't worry.

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:14.767
We'll explain it at other places.

00:04:14.767 --> 00:04:16.033
It's essentially what I just did here,

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:19.233
the first entry here
times the first entry,

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:20.833
the second entry here
times the second entry,

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:22.033
and we add them together,

00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:23.367
that that must be equal to 7,

00:04:23.367 --> 00:04:24.100
but when you do that,

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.134
you essentially construct
this first equation.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.633
Now when you do it with the
second row and this column,

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:30.167
you construct the second equation.

00:04:30.167 --> 00:04:32.700
You get negative 2 times s,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.100
negative 2 times s

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:42.011
plus 4 times t,

00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:43.966
4 times t,

00:04:43.966 --> 00:04:50.720
is equal to negative 6.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.500
Hopefully you appreciate
that this contains

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.400
the same information as that.

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:56.600
And there is other ways
that I could have done it.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.633
For example, you could have,

00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:00.213
instead of writing it this way,

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.933
this system is obviously the same thing,

00:05:02.992 --> 00:05:04.700
is obviously the same thing as ...

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.700
and actually, let me
just copy and paste it,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.100
is the same thing as ...

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.233
so copy and paste,

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:12.700
is the same thing as this system,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.400
where I'm really just swapping.

00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:17.666
So once again, copy and paste.

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:19.989
Obviously, I've written
the second one first,

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:21.566
and I've written the first one second,

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:23.866
so this is obviously the same system.

00:05:24.033 --> 00:05:28.500
If I wanted to construct a
matrix equation with this system,

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.633
I would just swap all of the rows.

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:33.112
The first row here would be negative 2, 4.

00:05:33.627 --> 00:05:35.900
I would swap the rows
for the coefficients,

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.633
but I would still keep the
s and ts in the same order,

00:05:38.633 --> 00:05:39.766
and you could do that.

00:05:39.766 --> 00:05:42.634
Try to represent this right over here

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.366
as a matrix equation.

00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:46.234
You would have the matrix here would be

00:05:46.234 --> 00:05:48.633
negative 2, 4, 2, negative 5,

00:05:48.633 --> 00:05:51.200
and this would be negative 6, 7.

00:05:51.373 --> 00:05:53.433
But now that we have set this up,

00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:56.033
how do we actually solve
something like this?

00:05:56.033 --> 00:05:57.733
Why do we even do this?

00:05:58.038 --> 00:05:59.900
To think about this, let's
actually think about it

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.601
in terms of literally a matrix equation.

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:07.066
Let's say that A, the matrix A
is this thing right over here.

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:09.400
This thing over here is the matrix A.

00:06:09.701 --> 00:06:11.167
Let's say that this right over here,

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:13.901
this is the column vector x.

00:06:14.685 --> 00:06:17.868
I'll write it as a
vector x right over here.

00:06:17.967 --> 00:06:19.500
You have the column vector x,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.967
and then this right over here,

00:06:20.967 --> 00:06:22.433
you could say that this is equal,

00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:24.536
and let's call this the column vector b.

00:06:24.835 --> 00:06:28.233
This is equal to the column vector b.

00:06:28.233 --> 00:06:30.502
We're essentially saying that A,

00:06:30.502 --> 00:06:35.367
the matrix A times the
column vector x is equal to,

00:06:35.367 --> 00:06:37.678
is equal to the column vector b.

00:06:37.678 --> 00:06:39.635
Let me write that again right over here,

00:06:39.635 --> 00:06:41.104
just to emphasize it.

00:06:41.104 --> 00:06:45.700
The matrix A times the column vector x

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.167
is going to be equal to,

00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:52.533
is equal to the column vector B.

00:06:52.634 --> 00:06:53.900
This is what they're talking about

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.368
when they say a matrix equation.

00:06:56.368 --> 00:06:58.439
Actually, before we even
think about computation

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:00.166
and computer graphics and all of that,

00:07:00.166 --> 00:07:03.166
you will see a lot of
things like this in physics,

00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:04.634
where they're speaking in general terms,

00:07:04.634 --> 00:07:06.034
or they might not even be specifying

00:07:06.034 --> 00:07:07.501
the dimensions of the matrix

00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:09.234
or the dimensions of this vector,

00:07:09.234 --> 00:07:11.566
but they're talking about
some general property,

00:07:11.566 --> 00:07:13.100
in, say, physics.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.633
You will see matrix vector
equations like this a lot

00:07:17.633 --> 00:07:20.466
as you get into higher
and higher sciences.

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:22.248
But once again,

00:07:22.633 --> 00:07:25.366
let's just go back to our core issue

00:07:25.366 --> 00:07:27.400
of how do we actually solve this?

00:07:27.766 --> 00:07:29.100
One way you could think about it,

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.166
we've already seen that
if a matrix is invertable,

00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:35.766
that means that there is a
matrix A inverse that exists,

00:07:35.766 --> 00:07:41.301
such that A inverse times
A is equal to the identity,

00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:44.002
is equal to the identity matrix.

00:07:44.233 --> 00:07:47.366
What if we multiplied the left-hand sides

00:07:47.366 --> 00:07:49.300
of both sides of this
equation by A inverse?

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.073
Remember, order matters

00:07:51.073 --> 00:07:53.200
when we are multiplying matrices.

00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:56.766
We multiply the left-hand
sides of both sides

00:07:56.766 --> 00:07:58.233
of the equation by A inverse,

00:07:58.233 --> 00:08:07.367
which would get us A
inverse times A times x

00:08:07.367 --> 00:08:12.566
is equal to A inverse.

00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:14.301
Remember, I'm multiplying
the left-hand sides

00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:18.866
of both equations, A inverse,
times the column vector B.

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:20.500
Now why is this interesting?

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.368
Well, we just said that
the inverse times A,

00:08:23.368 --> 00:08:24.900
assuming that A is invertable,

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:26.367
that this right over
here is going to be equal

00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:28.268
to the identity matrix.

00:08:28.566 --> 00:08:30.720
That's going to be the identity matrix

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.700
times column vector x,

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.666
and that's going to be
equal to this stuff.

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:41.000
That's going to be equal to that.

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:43.667
Let me just copy and paste that.

00:08:43.967 --> 00:08:45.467
That's going to be equal to that.

00:08:45.569 --> 00:08:47.100
Now why is that interesting?

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:52.700
The identity matrix
times some other matrix,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.167
this column vector essentially
is a 2 by 1 matrix,

00:08:56.167 --> 00:08:58.567
that's just going to be
this column vector again.

00:08:58.567 --> 00:09:03.700
It's just going to simplify
to that our column vector

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:05.700
is equal to,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:10.567
our column vector is equal
to the inverse matrix

00:09:10.567 --> 00:09:13.101
times our column vector,

00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:16.233
or our column vector x is
equal to the inverse matrix

00:09:16.233 --> 00:09:18.000
times the column vector b.

00:09:18.033 --> 00:09:21.103
Once again, emphasizing
why is this useful,

00:09:21.103 --> 00:09:23.100
yes, you do have to go through the trouble

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.370
of calculating A inverse,

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:26.633
but once you've done that,

00:09:26.633 --> 00:09:29.633
you could keep swapping in
different, different b's.

00:09:29.633 --> 00:09:32.435
This one is 7, negative 6, but
you could have other b's here,

00:09:32.435 --> 00:09:34.303
and if you're running a computer program,

00:09:34.303 --> 00:09:35.366
you want to do this over and over again,

00:09:35.366 --> 00:09:38.133
you just have to do multiple
matrix multiplications.

00:09:38.633 --> 00:09:40.168
I'll leave that thought here.

00:09:40.168 --> 00:09:42.166
I've realized that I'm
approaching 10 minutes,

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:44.568
which I never like to
cross in these videos.

00:09:44.568 --> 00:09:48.901
In the next video, we'll actually
compute what A inverse is

00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:53.268
and calculate what the
solution vector x is.
