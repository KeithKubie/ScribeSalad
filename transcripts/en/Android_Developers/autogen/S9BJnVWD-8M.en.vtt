00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.110
 I'll be fine 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:14.820
 Hi my name is my waiting house Ryosuke on google 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:20.550
 8 Today is android app quality guidelines 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:25.260
 A lot of different qualities on that recently Google Android developer site 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.560
 Guidelines have been added. Typical ones are 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.810
 It's ui ux 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:37.270
 General guidelines on goritin that are equally important 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:42.190
 As google has published the guidelines recently, I have a background about that 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:46.120
 I would like to have time to talk about various tips. 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.579
 I am working with Android Developer Clock on Google 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.150
 nice to meet you 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.829
 Please 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:58.429
 I would like to thank you. 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:59.749
 It's getting tired so it's already summer, it's certain that it's summer and it's summer 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:05.269
 Live 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:07.840
 The players have a bit of trouble and that broadcast has been postponed but I did not 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:13.299
 I think today is fine 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:16.960
 Yes, but rather how to improve the quality of the app 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:22.840
 By the way, it was introduced in the previous broadcast 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:24.330
 I think there was an android design web page, but 8 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.570
 That 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.860
 More like a high check list than 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:35.850
 If we recently issued the guideline from our company 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.680
 Let's explain it one by one today, so it's a capital share 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:44.580
 Yes, that's right 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:48.540
 Well, what is really behind the scenes is the attraction of that end of the volume is the attraction of the app 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:54.770
 I think that the part that is greatly affected is very large. 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:57.670
 So, if you want those who bought the android terminal inexorably, you want that excitement 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.500
 It looks like various application examples 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:06.670
 You may think that it is good to buy the terminal ah by using the app already 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:12.910
 How can that quality be achieved? 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:17.690
 While providing information as much as possible from google, by all means to those app developers 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.840
 We want to have them, but our application is expensive 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:26.030
 Is it quite enough to differentiate itself? 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.340
 That's pretty much compared to Seo's app, but I want users to be in this position 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:33.080
 Because it will be easier to say 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:38.450
 Even if it is better that the high frequency is high even by the factor of that differentiation, today 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:41.599
 What kind of application is high quality while explaining the guidelines 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.790
 One piece of piece that says the quality is getting higher 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:48.340
 Items 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.299
 While I'm looking forward to it, it's nice to see Mr. Matsui in Seoul explaining 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.530
 I think 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:55.590
 Well then you should go to the computer screen first of all 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.590
 Or 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.319
 Oh yeah Oh this is a little bit 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.319
 First of all 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.030
 What is displayed on the screen now 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.010
 this 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.810
 A section called Up Quality on Android Developer's Website 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.959
 there is 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:23.870
 In this section 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:26.510
 So far there are about 3 big guidelines published by Google 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:32.150
 One is core up quality 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.860
 The other is tablet-up quality and the third from various users 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:39.950
 For feedback 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:44.870
 Well various recommended accidents about the response are introduced 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:46.040
 The content of this is so diverse that today's Sawari's 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.660
 Part i 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:53.850
 I would like to introduce some cart big from core up quality 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:04:01.590
 It's been done recently, hey, hey 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:03.150
 Well, it's been a long time ago that it was released to the public first of all that head of this year 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.550
 It may have been about 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.910
 A section called Tablet-Up Quality has been added recently. 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.840
 The 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:18.650
 And this is Nex that we announced from that child 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:22.580
 A terminal that is or is complicated to be a terminal of Las 7 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:27.889
 Even in the market, the quality of tablet apps is becoming more important 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:33.770
 This should be strongly guided by google 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:38.639
 Well just before it's a tablet or something more basic than before 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:44.069
 First of all, there are 6 core parts that you can put into kill each application 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.550
 Let's think very much up-quality, so let's go first 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.689
 Shall we 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.689
 Click link 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:05:00.110
 Yes I went, but this is a little smaller for those who are watching that broadcast 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:06.940
 I think I see it by all means while looking at it secretly in the browser on hand by all means 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:07.900
 But I want to talk about that little bit, so this guideline 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.660
 Oh dear 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:17.919
 Well, it is divided into some big sections, but the first big one 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:24.009
 Section is visual design &amp; user interaction 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:25.700
 Here is a section in the section is almost already this Android design 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:31.070
 Guidelines 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:34.220
 Please be sure to comply with that. 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:40.160
 Design guidelines in AndrÃ© as content 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:43.820
 If it is this way of simplifying Junko with an explanatory note of feeling that points 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:49.670
 Explanation that quality will be high 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:54.530
 Well, I want to skip that detail today but it's coming out 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:06:00.419
 There's a navigational taiko this is another moving landin Landon is Godzilla Gunn 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:06.449
 Please take navigation as it is. I think that back button 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:08.069
 Because it is controlled by default to all android terminals by all means, it is 5 pairs yes 

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:13.770
 I want to ask 

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:20.289
 Or when you press the home button, you should always return to the home screen 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:23.800
 Wiper recommended Satation of customizing that home key 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:26.390
 Hmmm I heard that this is that notification 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.900
 I don't like being too noisy 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.169
 Not many 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:34.470
 Here's the part that you should take care of 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:37.800
 It's an atmosphere that's a year old 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.510
 That's right here, but it's important. 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.830
 Russian birth 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:48.450
 There is a function whose next big one is also block 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:53.940
 It is a section called Hayano Yes that is functional it 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:55.230
 Well, it's too common that only a little words are used, but I'm looking at the item or I'll hold the easy soil 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.160
 I will try that 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:07:01.080
 Perception is written in the textbook 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.979
 Permission is as much as possible 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:09.030
 Please make me angry with a few permissions 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:12.200
 If you are installing the app, you 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:19.610
 Well there is no permission 

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:23.870
 The country thinks that it is natural to be anxious when it is requested a lot unnecessarily 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:27.229
 Anxiety Anxiety is also considered as a language comment 

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.580
 I wonder if it will be easier for me to go down, but I'm going to put the clock on my head 

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:32.880
 I mean not 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:37.180
 After all perfume perfume this way also say that 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:40.520
 Thinking thinks about mission 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:45.979
 I am saying that the form of going to take is the best 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:49.009
 Well, that's typical of the kind of permission that makes the user anxious 

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:54.099
 I'm reading through the contacts 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:54.099
 That or when I read the system log 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:08:19.000
 Make a Bubba Call here are you the te 

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:25.090
 It was once in the department that worked out the tax system for easy-to-understand explanations 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:32.110
 It is also one way to write in the description and especially that one 

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:37.570
 Well if you need to exchange sensitive data dynamically while running 

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:43.000
 Take out the keg or do some explicit user relationship there 

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:45.080
 Android by making you care for such users 

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.650
 The app is for the user 

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:53.769
 I think it may be possible to use it newly 

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:57.810
 And next is speaking of installation location s 2 / card 

00:08:53.769 --> 00:09:01.200
 Please tell me that this is that of people like that terminal 

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:04.200
 00:00 with internal memory and external stress 

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:09.120
 There is an area called internal storage and external storage 

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:11.279
 But this is a complaint when it comes to internal storage 

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:17.830
 There are many customers who rush into 

00:09:11.279 --> 00:09:22.960
 There is a terminal in a limited memory, but it is yes by all means this is an app 

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:24.460
 Application android manifest.Iki another tree in xml 

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:30.250
 Just write me 

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:33.690
 If you have at least android 2.2 or more yes yes floor you want to ask 

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:37.820
 Is almost mandatory already, yes 

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:41.600
 And I will skip the screen a little 

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:45.860
 I'm wise lapping tigers 

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:52.220
 Let's go to preset or let's go from audio This is that 

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:53.209
 It is written in some detail, but simply speaking it does not sound at the time of the lock screen 

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:58.670
 Please 

00:09:53.209 --> 00:10:03.319
 It seems that the lock screen and the screen hall that are exhausted will be life 

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:05.089
 Especially when it comes to game applications, it is often the case that you suddenly get surprised 

00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:09.110
 When 

00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:10.080
 I don't need the lock screened wood, so it's true how many times it is 

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:16.080
 so 

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:21.149
 It's a problem that you can hear the music on the lock screen in a moving ball. 

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:27.459
 Is the case I have ever seen a game 

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:28.360
 I went to the home screen to finish but my brother's music continues to sound and I live in the back 

00:10:27.459 --> 00:10:33.339
 Do you say 

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:38.800
 Music will keep sounding when I try to the other application 

00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:39.930
 I have seen a phenomenon that says that such part does not happen 

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.810
 By all means 

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:45.430
 I hope for consideration and think early 

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:52.270
 Yes and 

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:56.310
 It is this that it is written with that celebration graph ui bubble la fix 

00:10:52.270 --> 00:11:03.480
 That's right as a recommendation for that 

00:10:56.310 --> 00:11:05.540
 It is a part that the terminal will not be allowed to turn vertically or horizontally 

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.300
 This is that 

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.440
 In particular 

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:13.990
 Oh dear 

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:15.590
 It is expected in the case of tools based utility productivity based apps 

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:21.350
 There are more users 

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:25.040
 I think that the contents are pulling out the keyboard from the bottom with that ball head sideways 

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:29.750
 As there are three girls with such stuffy noses, in that case 

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:34.990
 It is very difficult to use an app that is only compatible with letters 

00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:38.080
 Well, in the case of games, this is 

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:44.020
 It becomes a problem of the worldview 

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:48.430
 There is also a view of the world The part that thinks about the manga usage scene is that the user's usage mind 

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:50.089
 Of course there are of course there are also resource problems etc. I think there are various things 

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.020
 In the game again 

00:11:50.089 --> 00:11:54.290
 Yup 

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.350
 I think it would be nice if you think, but it is compatible 

00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:59.710
 Note 

00:11:55.350 --> 00:12:03.070
 It seems that you say that is good 

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:09.300
 Yes next was up 

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:15.959
 This is a user upgrade. This is that simple. 

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:19.420
 Oh, for example I left the app and went back to the other apps and came back again 

00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:22.780
 I see 3 that state is saved 

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:26.170
 I want to be able to resume properly 

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:33.130
 I can't see how well the game was saved to the US Army 

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:37.030
 It is a kind of feeling whether or not another consideration is recommended some kind of 

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:39.440
 Well, for example bluetooth or gps is a pretty area like 

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:43.550
 I'm using it 

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:48.380
 Appo For example, I went to another app that was temporarily away 

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:49.250
 Please turn off bluetooth or gps by all means when you say 

00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:54.980
 I see 

00:12:49.250 --> 00:13:00.860
 Imai I will continue to give you a column column It seems to be a better than even ã

00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:05.240
 And again if you go back to the app and you have such a function that Tanaka-in needs 

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:07.880
 I think I say loveliness is the movement of that focus or activity 

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.240
 According to the life cycle of 

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.580
 Ask that management 

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.550
 I think if you 

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:17.930
 Yes and 

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:25.060
 Stabilized by the arrogance of Aikome with a sense of attention 

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:26.520
 Well, this is already very difficult to talk in a few minutes, so please put it together 

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:30.150
 Early up 

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:34.170
 Please make it fast and stable. 

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:40.470
 Yes I can only say so, but just 

00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:45.020
 Well that's right after touching the screen, for example 

00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:46.899
 For example, it is too late to make the user wait for 0.5 seconds or so 

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:52.660
 Less than 0.2 seconds 

00:13:46.899 --> 00:13:57.730
 The response of the is generally expected, I would like a button 

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:59.230
 If it is troubled that loading seems to be different from woman by woman after pushing 

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:00.010
 I think that 

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:06.370
 The 

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:07.720
 Whether that ui's ui works crisply is an important part of quality 

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.490
 With the com pipe 

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:13.550
 Yes I think so by all means 

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:18.140
 I do not do the kind of thought with ui thread 

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:22.899
 If the user can tune the app until the last minute of the user, the action is 

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:31.900
 It is good for the user to put too much processing on where to wake up 

00:14:22.899 --> 00:14:37.870
 It seems to imitate the action, and one more point regarding this performance, especially that one 

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:40.259
 Especially when you use web view, you can see the network after a touch occurs 

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:46.679
 It is no longer for you to go to 

00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:48.989
 In the meantime, it seems that the food does not change at all during that time. 

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:54.190
 In the middle it's true 

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:55.769
 This is quite a user experience of that smartphone tablet 

00:14:54.190 --> 00:15:01.379
 What 

00:14:55.769 --> 00:15:05.489
 It's a shame that even though it's been years as an app, it's regarded as a sloppy love. 

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:10.110
 I think before that I think 

00:15:05.489 --> 00:15:14.519
 Even if it is a hunger degree, let's read ahead with that part or use that kind of foot 

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:15.760
 Let me talk about that kind of thing when using u web fire 

00:15:14.519 --> 00:15:18.940
 If you can make full use of it 

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:23.590
 It is a thing, and the change of the screen is already 

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:29.170
 I'm not saying that I'm switching the screen after the data comes, but I'm switching the screen before 

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:34.510
 5 behind me with something happening on the screen 

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:35.779
 That hurry to prepare the data If you don't let that kind of user wait anyway 

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:37.939
 Please ask for consideration 

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:43.579
 I think that I want to do it 

00:15:37.939 --> 00:15:48.600
 Stability It's hard to explain again, but it won't crash or freeze 

00:15:43.579 --> 00:15:54.750
 Don't do heavy processing with ui threads 

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:56.130
 Let's save memory as much as possible Oh, speaking of that wooden item is talking about Moon 

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:58.259
 I can not do it 

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:59.500
 Oh, yes 

00:15:58.259 --> 00:16:05.350
 It is hard 

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:10.360
 It is such a basic thing but it is worthwhile to spend that time very much 

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:13.750
 When it comes to being loose, it's a child app that becomes quite fragile here 

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:18.060
 It exists in many 

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:18.060
 That day jua's ice te This is 

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:26.870
 Oh dear 

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:32.920
 Provide a very beautiful visual tailored to the screen resolution and discuss within us with shallow 

00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:37.600
 When I see the app on the phone 

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:40.920
 Igor suddenly when I've got it in my place 

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:45.300
 There is a tendency for Jagi Jagi to enter 

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.350
 There is a tendency that there is a blurry part. 

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:50.209
 Ne 

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:52.070
 Even if the remodeling changes, the dark days are together 

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:57.800
 So by that 

00:16:52.070 --> 00:17:04.040
 Well nexus terminal that we announced that this nexus 47 points 

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:09.680
 10 pro terminal is now 2560 pixels times 1600 pixels 

00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:11.860
 The resolution has become-by all means such beautiful resolution 

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:15.670
 An expression that looks good 

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:17.150
 I think if you can all ask 

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:21.080
 Iida entering 

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:25.280
 I played Google Play Yoshitsuji Ahaa 

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:29.810
 Well I wonder if I would like to ask you right away 

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:30.800
 It's the same feeling as the last time, I've been talking about it so far 

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:36.170
 on google play 

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:37.140
 It is important to provide an app on top of the group here. 

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.940
 First one theme 

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:45.950
 Please be sure to follow the policy 

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:49.190
 Please have a goupe developer content policy 

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:53.960
 The content rating is also firm 

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:59.419
 Look at that rating of Joongsu Fine a 8 a 

00:17:53.960 --> 00:18:00.140
 It is part of the first policy that you should paint well 

00:17:59.419 --> 00:18:04.150
 so 

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:07.060
 Even if the eighth order is the detail 

00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:09.190
 We're starting a blog post from us, but it's definitely a feature 

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:13.330
 It is a place that please put a graphic 

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:17.539
 feature Understand in simple form without too much clutter 

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:21.660
 There is a place that please do it easily 

00:18:17.539 --> 00:18:26.620
 Well, the video that was a screenshot 

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:29.299
 Well here is actually quite inside, but with non android device 

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:35.179
 It is a video or screenshot 

00:18:29.299 --> 00:18:35.899
 I would like to avoid as much as possible, but I often see it. 

00:18:35.179 --> 00:18:40.580
 but 

00:18:35.899 --> 00:18:42.669
 I can see it from const but I hope that you use good things here 

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:46.809
 It is a place called 

00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:49.359
 Please make sure your mart user support is correct. 

00:18:46.809 --> 00:18:51.220
 It is quite common to say that 

00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:55.600
 that 

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:58.940
 There is a possibility that there is a possibility that the bug resulting from there is hidden, so overlooked 

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:02.050
 Please be sure to give support well without 

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:02.050
 It becomes a point 

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:09.250
 Well, so it's okay to have them appear on the screen of a couple of people 

00:19:09.290 --> 00:19:17.540
 Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm which is somebody about the other than that 

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.700
 Various know-how 

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.970
 Important to this Core Up Quality Guidelines 

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:26.970
 that 

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:28.770
 A lot of information is being provided 

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.660
 That little school 

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:32.730
 Has entered 

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:37.570
 Information provided by us 

00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:39.320
 How about that reason Yosuk 

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:48.110
 It will be an idea 

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:49.600
 Why do you use this information for differences? 

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:53.110
 More 

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:56.350
 8 good good content quality is high 

00:19:53.110 --> 00:20:01.179
 In the high-run attack can be high in the application 

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:08.350
 8 If the application for which the attack is high was extremely excellent content 

00:20:01.179 --> 00:20:09.590
 At the same time, it is easy to reflect our features and such 

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:13.220
 It is called a guideline 

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:16.610
 In fact, I think that it is a turning point if it is in line with this double 

00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:22.220
 Yes, so the quality way open 

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:23.690
 + Marty small which is likely to be featured more easily 

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:29.840
 I'm going to Kouno 

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:32.740
 Such guidelines of strong control are explained in this guideline 

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:38.800
 I think it seems like I'm cutting it off to some extent 

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:42.130
 That feature is just one possibility, and I will never promise from that country etc. 

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:47.559
 It is not that I can do it 

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:52.730
 It is not limited to feature but it is ranking and search ranking etc 

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:56.179
 To the sky of such app itself to have you go up high in part 

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:59.450
 It may not be very important that you 

00:20:56.179 --> 00:21:00.710
 It seems so quite that 

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:05.029
 Oh dear 

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:10.290
 I hope the device point that the user has can be expected to be high to some extent, but now 

00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:14.430
 Some users have tablets like this in android 

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:19.740
 Well when there are some users who are playing phones 

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:20.580
 In what form do you expect each user to meet their expectations late? 

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:26.010
 After all 

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:30.310
 You will use points or both, and you will use that app when you like it 

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:36.509
 The user is more likely not to say anything 

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:42.200
 The higher the level of satisfaction, the more natural the number of Google Play stars will be. 

00:21:36.509 --> 00:21:46.490
 If there are many behind, naturally it will be on the ranking, so the app 

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:49.850
 It's true when you stay in the terminal for a long time 

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:55.280
 Then, let's take a look like it's a good app 

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:59.690
 App users who will be loved by users for a long time, so it will be spread to everyone 

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:02.220
 It is fun and convenient to use 

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:05.980
 Yup, it looks beautiful 

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:08.470
 An application that Kimo day sun grass movement is also stable 

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:13.990
 That google play that 

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:19.870
 Ranking, search ranking and also our editorial conference this feature 

00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:24.340
 I would like to make sure that I would like to raise the exposure at the editing conference as well. 

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:25.500
 I think yes if you can ask for an understanding 

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.610
 Is 

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:30.480
 8 

00:22:26.610 --> 00:22:36.120
 Is it all right to ask questions? 

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:39.510
 Today's Seo is that it probably won't end with a little bit of anaha 

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:43.740
 I'm sending in the first part 

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:46.600
 I'm sorry that the screen subtitle is not riding with the first part 

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:52.570
 It seems that this is not all part 1 

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:57.700
 Which is the complaint that will come later from the actual user later on 

00:22:52.570 --> 00:23:04.000
 It should be done in the same way with s whether it is sharpened to cope 

00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:05.860
 Well, I think that it will be better to deliver at that next opportunity, but with the questions received today 

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.130
 Say 

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.130
 Wintering 

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:11.110
 Please wait 

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:24.620
 What is coming 

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.620
 There 

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:31.250
 Yaho 

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:34.700
 It is a chain device Wigsus 

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:37.870
 Hmmm, some of the abandoned holy cups 

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:37.870
 We have sent you 

00:23:38.429 --> 00:23:47.519
 Get service as a service to listen to the user's voice service rod com 8 

00:23:43.649 --> 00:23:49.309
 users voice. com is introduced, but similar service in Japan 

00:23:47.519 --> 00:23:54.620
 do you have 

00:23:49.309 --> 00:24:01.410
 I wonder if this can you start? 

00:23:54.620 --> 00:24:08.400
 What does that mean to our two people or service? 

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:11.940
 Well for men and women, it's a service to keep in touch with the user 

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:16.530
 Well there is that user 

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:21.120
 In such a place that this developer is managed 

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:21.400
 Guide the user towards there eg complaint or bag direction 

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.180
 Become 

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:28.270
 If you post more and more feedback to users 

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:33.370
 In that day blocker from that 

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:37.750
 Well then, this has been cured, etc. This is under consideration, but it is like that 

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:41.389
 Interactive from the communication developer 

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:43.240
 Well there seems to be a place like saying that it is a comment bird 

00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:48.430
 Hey 

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:50.310
 If you provide the functionality of this kind of interaction itself with google play 

00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:57.840
 The schedule is 

00:24:50.310 --> 00:25:01.530
 There is one right now, in the form of reply to comments, the constitution itself yesterday is in progress 

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:06.900
 It seems to be gradually expanded to developers 

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:10.330
 Unfortunately for those who still have c, there is no such c cedede, but it is very good at the examination stage 

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:16.149
 Only some people can offer that test 

00:25:10.330 --> 00:25:17.570
 It is planned that there is a reply function to the comment behind, but this is gradually 

00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:22.010
 that 

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:25.910
 It is possible to say that you do not want to expand the commissioner This is also one 

00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:29.990
 So-called interactive interactive with the tool user 

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:31.030
 We are expecting to move into a green one 

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:33.630
 Yes 

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:39.570
 Next question 

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:42.170
 Are there any items that can not be released as an app without following the high strength guidelines? 

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.170
 Oh yeah 

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:54.659
 Well I can release this 

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:59.820
 If you dare to mention such a developer distribution 

00:25:54.659 --> 00:26:02.659
 agreement It seems that it is a violation of the example, so-called policy violation 

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:07.909
 Is not this 

00:26:02.659 --> 00:26:12.889
 Yeah I don't need a kid that's released and found that 

00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:16.249
 There is one black star in this history when it becomes out of the Purpe 

00:26:12.889 --> 00:26:19.970
 That seems to be left forever forever 

00:26:16.249 --> 00:26:25.520
 If there is any such policy violation, that 

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:28.770
 It's like I want you to be careful, and it's love and visual other voice 

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:35.309
 The vertical and horizontal correspondence of the screen 

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:37.870
 For example, you can already do the publishing itself on Google Play 

00:26:35.309 --> 00:26:41.380
 Right in that 

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:48.280
 Especially, for example, the way of music is strange 

00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:50.340
 Even if the screen looks dirty depending on the correct terminal, it seems that the movement is slow in the first place. 

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:56.580
 Well released 

00:26:50.340 --> 00:27:01.679
 If it is already done, the user of the article is sure to receive a comment 

00:26:56.580 --> 00:27:08.340
 Well, it's up to the meloper to decide what time to fix 

00:27:01.679 --> 00:27:11.159
 Well, at the beginning of the pilot phase, it has started offering to a few users. 

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:16.230
 Have you received that user cup from 

00:27:11.159 --> 00:27:16.570
 I'm doing my best with Garr while receiving feedback 

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:21.130
 A child 

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:26.620
 Sometimes we sometimes see cases 

00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:30.430
 It is the Diet, and then the next is the content that has been reproduced following the wide area guidelines introduced this time 

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:33.810
 Content that is particularly emphasized in the Japanese market 

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:37.220
 Or the difference between the situation in Japan and overseas 

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:37.220
 8 Japanese power 

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:47.000
 this 

00:27:38.919 --> 00:27:52.340
 Japan's reaction is tough in response to customers, but it's tough to some extent Japan 0 

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:54.200
 If the lens comes out, it would be fine for both inside and outside of the country 

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:57.530
 content 

00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:02.440
 When I make a tablet to see well, I suddenly go to the crowded place 

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:06.340
 It is true that there are many cases where the layout is broken. 

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:10.140
 There is quite overseas people corresponding to the tablet there 

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:17.290
 It is a part but I do 

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:20.310
 As for the guidelines described here, especially the border 

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:23.310
 What is the difference in the market? 

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:26.169
 I do not think so much 

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:27.970
 If you enter and say 

00:28:26.169 --> 00:28:30.169
 that 

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:38.359
 I agree 

00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:42.680
 In Japan, vertical scrolling in web games is rather popular, but it is more popular 

00:28:38.359 --> 00:28:48.110
 It's hard to be accepted, right? Well now filler 

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:53.930
 I guess that's right 

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:58.340
 If you are an overseas user, that so-called i-mode culture game so far 

00:28:53.930 --> 00:28:59.270
 Playing Culture or Playing Games There is no experience in playing games in i-mode 

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.669
 Suddenly 

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:04.269
 Users coming from smartphones to smartphones 

00:29:02.669 --> 00:29:06.600
 Because there are many to say 

00:29:04.269 --> 00:29:11.500
 There is not much culture called scrolling 

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:13.830
 I don't think it's true from the perspective of the game 

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.830
 Yup 

00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:24.679
 That's about it, especially when it comes to guidelines 

00:29:17.869 --> 00:29:30.229
 It's not that the difference is that it is a part of the taste of the sea drink line 

00:29:24.679 --> 00:29:34.500
 Although I often say culturalization, I often use Asian people in the desk part 

00:29:30.229 --> 00:29:35.860
 It seems that the lively screen is preferred 

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:41.559
 Western 

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:43.420
 That popular popular app prefers the app as clean as possible 

00:29:41.559 --> 00:29:47.740
 In a way like 

00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:53.230
 I think that is often said, but regarding that there of that android 

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:55.850
 The guidelines are neutral, so here are the different developer 

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:57.010
 We will enter if we can make a decision 

00:29:55.850 --> 00:30:03.630
 Hmm 

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:10.360
 Well, that's the end of the question, but that's the one I said- 

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:16.999
 It's full of booboo and you just have to make some medicine. 

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:22.230
 Aringu from my google + page that I have been a nufu 

00:30:16.999 --> 00:30:28.500
 It is not an official translation of Maa, but to Mr. Ando's kindness already 

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:30.410
 Thank you potato This quality guideline is very 

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:34.820
 User experience 

00:30:30.410 --> 00:30:40.039
 It's also a manifestation of google's desire to improve as much as possible. 

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:45.590
 If you have a few of those apps, you should have that quality 

00:30:40.039 --> 00:30:51.559
 Get in high praise of users in the quality part of construction community content in love 

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:54.700
 I always got what I think we always have, ã¼ and Kyoko 

00:30:51.559 --> 00:31:01.280
 You should talk to him something 

00:30:54.700 --> 00:31:06.380
 Booboo is okay today, and I will talk about that series of children for a while 

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:14.010
 Well, I think if you let me talk about Eto'o on a basis like the basics of basics 

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:19.080
 By all means Well then today thank you for that 5 hours Today's broadcast is this 

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:22.280
 ibus it has become cold so please beloved everyone Thank you for today 

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:22.280
 I was sorry
