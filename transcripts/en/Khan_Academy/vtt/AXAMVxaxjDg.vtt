00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:03.010
In the last video on exponential
functions, we saw

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.380
that functions of the form,
y is equal to some

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.180
number to the x.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.050
Say y is equal to 3x,
which was what we

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:10.410
used in the last video.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.630
We saw that these grow very,
very, very quickly.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.960
So the shape of the graph that
we got in the last video looks

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.060
something like this.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.790
It gets very close to 0,
slowly pulls away from

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.920
0, and then, bam!

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.870
It starts to explode.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.010
This, of course, is when
x is equal to 0.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.970
So the y-intercept there
is y is equal to 1.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.990
But the important thing is it
just grows super fast. But

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.090
this was the case where the
base in the exponential

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.430
function is greater then 1.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.280
Here, it's 3.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.900
If it's 2, it'll still
grow quickly.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.840
If it was 10, it would
grow even faster.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.790
What I want to talk a little bit
about in this video, and

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.990
really just introduce you to the
idea, is the notion of an

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.320
exponential decay function.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.530
So this is an exponential
growth function.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.540
An exponential decay function
has essentially, as its base,

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.530
a number less than 1.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.790
So an example of an exponential
decay function

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.600
would be y is to 1/3
to the x power.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.180
This would be exponential
decay.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.620
And notice, another way I could
write this, 1/3 is the

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.480
same thing as 3 to
the negative 1.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.490
So it's 3 to the negative
1 to the x power.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.560
I could also write this as 3
to the negative x power.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.940
This and this are equivalent.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.440
That's another interesting way
to think about exponential

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.380
decay functions.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.410
It could either be kind of a
standard positive exponent,

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.750
with a base that's less than
1, or you could have a base

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.110
larger than 1, but you're going
to have a negative as

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.980
the exponent.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.520
So let's plot this, just to
get the general shape.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.140
And the shape will always
be consistent.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.260
I'm going to do it for 1/3,
but it's going to have a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.010
similar shape for 1/2, or
for 1/10, or for 1/100.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.320
It'll just be scaled
up or down.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.050
So let's plot a few.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:06.890
Let's have some x values and
let's have some y values.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.580
So let's start with
some small values.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.380
So let's say that x is
equal to negative 3.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.200
Well, what is 1/3 to the
negative 3 power?

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.740
1/3 to the negative 3, that's
the same thing as 3 to the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.440
third power, which
is equal to 81.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.310
Let's do another point.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.070
What about negative 2?

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.800
1/3 to the negative 2 power.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.380
It's the same thing as 1 over--
Sorry, it's equal to 1

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.470
over 1/3 squared, which the
same thing as 3 squared.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.840
You just take the inverse of
the number, get rid of the

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.590
negative and that is equal
to equal to 9.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.620
Oh, I got this one
wrong up here.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:50.890
3 cubed isn't 81.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.140
That's 3 to the fourth.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.010
3 times 3 times 3 is 27.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.980
My brain is malfunctioning.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.040
What about when x is equal to
negative 1, then you have 1/3

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.370
to the negative 1 power.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.280
which is just 3.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.030
What about when x
is equal to 0?

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.860
When x is equal to 0, remember,
anything to the 0

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.070
power is 1.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.360
And then let's go to a couple
of larger numbers.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.630
When x is equal to
1, what is y?

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.990
1/3 to the 1 power is 1/3.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:26.770
Let's do one more.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:32.920
When x is equal to 2, we have
1/3 squared, which is 1/9.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.200
So let's plot this exponential
decay function right here.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.590
I want to draw it reasonably
neatly.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.870
And all of these values, once
again, are positive because

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.260
our base was positive.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.175
So it looks like that.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.020
So let's say that this
is 10, 20, 30.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:07.270
Let's start at negative
3, negative 2,

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.380
negative 1, 0, 1, 2.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.880
So when x was negative
3, y was 27.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.589
Right about there.

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.200
When x was negative
2, y was 9.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.650
Which is right about there.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.000
When x is negative 1, y is 3.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.630
Right about there.
x is 0, y is 1.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.825
x is 1, y is 1/3, until
we decline like this.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.350
Let me draw it a little
bit neater than that.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:43.110
The decay functions are
harder for me to draw.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.670
We'll draw it in
reverse order.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:50.520
No, that's even worse.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.650
One more shot.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.760
I think you get the
general idea.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.700
That's my best shot
right there.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.030
So you see, a decay function
is kind of

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:00.950
reversed around the y-axis.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.700
We start from a large quantity
and we decay

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.430
very, very, very quickly.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.590
So in either case, exponential
functions, whether we have

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.920
exponential growth or
exponential decay-- Let me

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.210
make sure that you understand
this growth applies to this

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.280
thing up here.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.220
This is exponential decay.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:19.800
And either way, in exponential
functions,

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.470
things happen quickly.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.330
Now, using what we know about
exponential decay functions,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.460
let's do an actual
word problem.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.320
Let me read it here.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.545
It says, a person is infected
by a bacterial infection.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.110
And they say, when he goes to
the doctor, the population of

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.200
bacteria is 2 million.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:55.696
So at the start, he's got 2
million little critters, 2

00:05:55.696 --> 00:05:58.260
million bacteria.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.140
The doctor prescribes an
antibiotic which kills

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.700
bacteria, that reduces the
bacteria to 1/4 of its

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.655
population each day.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:19.060
So we have the antibiotic and
it cuts down the population.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:33.430
So it reduces population
to 1/4 of the previous

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:39.270
population each day.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.020
So they ask us a couple
of things.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.920
Draw the graph of the size of
the bacteria population

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.840
against time in days.

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.870
So let's draw this.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.960
So day, and then population.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.250
So let's say on day 0, before
you went to the doctor, your

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.060
population is going
to be 2 million.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.750
Now on day 1, what happens?

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:09.450
On day 1 you've taken their
antibiotic, right?

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.540
The antibiotic is starting
right there.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.510
So it reduces it to 1/4 of
your previous population.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:18.090
So now your population is
going to be 1/4 times 2

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:25.620
million, which is equal
to 500,000.

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.800
Then on day 2, what happens?

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.940
On day 2, it's going
to be 1/4 of this.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.660
It's going to be 1/4 of
your previous day.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:37.790
1/4 of 1/4 of your previous
2 million.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:46.450
So it's 1/4 of this 500,000
which is 125,000.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.450
I think you're starting to see
the pattern that's emerging.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:51.010
On day 3, what's
it going to be?

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.140
It's going to be 1/4
times this thing.

00:07:53.140 --> 00:08:00.720
So it's going to be 1/4 times
this 1/4 times 1/4 times 1/4

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.890
times 2 million.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:07.000
Which is essentially 125,000
divided by 4, but the

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.890
important thing is, I want
you to see this pattern.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:14.730
In general, the population
at day n-- Let me write

00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:16.400
this in a new color.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:25.850
The population on day n is going
to be equal to what?

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.600
It's going to be equal to 1/4
to the n power, right?

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.730
This is day n.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.630
On the third day, it was
1/4 to the third

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:33.700
power times 2 million.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.659
On day 2, it was 1/4 to
the second power.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.799
On day 1 it was 1/4 to
the first power.

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:41.690
On day 0, there is actually
1/4 to the 0 power, right?

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:42.799
That's 1.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:48.660
So it's 1/4 to the nth power
times our starting population,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:51.606
times 2 million.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:59.310
And if we were to graph it,
using at least just the points

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.870
that we have here, we're only
going to be dealing with

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.630
positive x's.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:07.360
So on day 0, we start
at 2 million.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.690
So let's say this
is a million.

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:10.520
So on day 0, we're
at 2 million.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.780
On day 1, we're at
1/4 of that.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.300
So let's say that's 1 million,
so then that is 500,000.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.190
On day 2, we're 1/4 of
this, so this is

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.160
250,000, that's 125,000.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.770
And then on day 3, we're
1/4 of that.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:32.420
So you see the population of our
bacteria really goes down

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.150
very quickly.

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.250
It never gets quite to 0.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.310
We're always going to
have some bacteria.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.340
Well, eventually you're going
to have 1 bacteria, and you

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.310
can get the antibiotic.

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:42.690
And it's going to have a 1/4
chance of hitting it so,

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.690
maybe, eventually you'll get to
0, but it slowly gets to 0.

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:51.900
But the absolute number
decreases very, very fast.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.850
Now they also ask us, find
the size of the bacteria

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:59.660
population 10 days after the
drug was first taken.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.960
So that's just n
is equal to 10.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.870
So it's going to be equal
to 1/4 to the tenth

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:13.300
power times 2 million.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.000
Let's take our calculator out
to calculate to this.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:25.490
So let's take 1 divided by
4 to the tenth power.

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:30.080
That's equal to this very small
number times 2 million.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:35.200
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, is equal to--
we're only going to have

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:40.310
a 1.9 bacteria after
the tenth day.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:45.720
This is going to be equal to 1.9
bacteria, so pretty much

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:51.120
most of the bacteria is
gone by the tenth day.
