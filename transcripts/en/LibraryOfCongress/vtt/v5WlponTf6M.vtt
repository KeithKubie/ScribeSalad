From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.570
Hi. I'm John Brown.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.930
In this edition of the
BARD Mobile How-To Series,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.230
we are going to cover activating

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.010
and deactivating VoiceOver
in iOS devices.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.760
VoiceOver is a full-featured screen
reader available on all iOS devices

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.880
that run the BARD Mobile
application.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.810
It allows blind users to access
iPhones, iPods, and iPads.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.020
To turn VoiceOver on,
go to Settings.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.130
From there, select
General, then Accessibility.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.340
Under the heading Vision,
select VoiceOver.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.820
Slide the on/off switch to On.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.640
Note that gestures for
navigating the device are different

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.040
when VoiceOver is turned on.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.560
Once you have activated VoiceOver,
triple clicking the Home button

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.080
on your device will quickly
turn VoiceOver on and off.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.220
A blind user may turn VoiceOver
on without sighted assistance

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.120
by connecting the device
to a computer

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.300
and accessing it through iTunes.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.190
This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
