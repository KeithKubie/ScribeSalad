00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.450
Came in for some orange juice and left with
a cart full of crap.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.550
FOILED AGAIN!!!

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.619
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:15.339
Who hasn’t gone to run some errands and
ended up leaving the store with stuff you

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.449
never came for?

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:17.449
Oh yeah people.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:18.700
You’re not alone.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.270
Stores are actually incredibly sneaky and
evil and employ a number of scientifically-backed

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.070
strategies to make you spend more without
realizing it until it’s TOO LATE.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.679
One of the most heavily employed strategies
is changing your perception of a bargain.

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.770
Have you ever noticed a sale sign on the window
of your favorite store only to walk in and

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.700
realize that it’s not as big of a sale as
you thought it was?

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.710
Some stores even seem to be in a perpetual
state of SALES THAT ARE ENDING SOON SO GET

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.320
YOUR STUFF NOW!

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.610
Retailers purposefully create a high number
of short sales to create the illusion of a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.130
fleeting bargain.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.080
Psychologists at the Association for Consumer
Research have found that excitement while

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.840
shopping is caused by making shoppers feel
like they’re a smart shopper who’s found

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.840
a great deal.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.070
In reality, the price may not even be substantially
lower and the product may be overpriced to

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.070
begin with.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.580
Sometimes you’ll see something like “20%
of MSRP” the manufacturers suggested retail

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.890
price, when in fact, no retailer could ever
sell the product for that price to begin with.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.540
Another way that our minds get tricked all
the time is with prices that end in 99 cents.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.360
Researchers at Rutgers have found that even
though we know, rationally that it’s only

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.360
a 1 cent difference, our minds are still tricked.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.100
When retailers end the price in 99 cents,
they see an increase in sales comparable to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.280
if they had marked the item as 10% off.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.030
Perhaps a little more sneakily, retailers
also use scents to sell.

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.600
The olfactory system is a powerful trigger
of emotion and memory, and stores DEFINITELY

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.670
use that to their advantage.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.740
There are giant companies that specialize
in helping big stores, hotels, even restaurants

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.950
to manufacture smells that will help their
clients have an emotional attachment to their

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:47.950
company.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.600
Research at the Scent Marketing Institute
(yes that’s a thing) has found that citrus

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.979
scents make people spend more, the smell of
baked goods sells more homes, and the smell

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.280
of leather and wood encourages us to splurge
on luxury furniture.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.549
But furniture and houses are rarely impulse
buys….which is why cheaper items are all

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.229
about encouraging a split second decision
to spend just a little more at a time.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.799
Have you ever noticed how stores that cater
to younger crowds often have loud faster paced

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:13.799
music?

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.760
A study in the Journal of Applied Psychology
says that music that gets your heart going

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.639
encourages more sales per minute.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:23.909
But it’s about the RIGHT music too - this
wouldn’t work in, say, a fine wine shop.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.030
Psychologists have found in luxury settings,
classical music encourages more sales.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.440
It’s all pretttttty sneaky!

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.989
Have you ever fallen prey to these common
strategies?

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.819
Tell me about it down below and we’ll catch
you next time with more DNews updates!
