00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.831
about Aboriginal Australia.

00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:38.237
They have the oldest, longest
running culture on Earth.

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:41.674
Sixty thousand years.

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.610
It's a really sad history.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.414
It's a litany of dispossession.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.917
Maybe my job here
as a story teller

00:00:50.917 --> 00:00:54.420
wasn't to just document
a disappearing culture,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.188
in this modern world.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:01:00.226
Maybe it was to look
at this living, breathing,

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.929
thriving part of their culture,
and how important it is

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.698
to the future health
of their communities.

AMY TOENSING: I am going
to talk to you tonight about

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.785 line:0%
my journey through
Aboriginal Australia,

00:01:25.785 --> 00:01:30.856 line:0%
which began in a cave,
in Western Australia.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.859
And I was wedged between rocks,

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.796
trying to get the best
angle on a piece of rock art.

00:01:37.796 --> 00:01:41.300
I was working on a story
for National Geographic magazine

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.670
about a group of animals
that had gone extinct

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.408
all at the same time,
50,000 years ago.

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:53.045
And there was a raging debate
as to whether or not humans,

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:54.880
specifically
Aboriginal Australians

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.982
had something to do with it.

00:01:56.982 --> 00:02:00.185
The critter that you see at
the end of this hunter's spear

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:03.456
was maybe one of those animals.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:07.961
There is also
a 10-foot kangaroo.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:13.166
There is an 18-foot
constrictor snake.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:16.068
And there is an animal that I
don't know how best to describe

00:02:16.068 --> 00:02:22.174
except ask you to imagine
a hairless marsupial chipmunk,

00:02:22.174 --> 00:02:25.611
and then make it the
size of a rhinoceros.

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.480
And then you have a Diprotodon

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.817
that walked here
80,000 years ago.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:38.157
My husband, Matt Moyer,
who is in the audience

00:02:38.157 --> 00:02:42.061
and also a photojournalist, came
on this assignment with me, and

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.265
here we are on his assignment
in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:46.665
for National
Geographic magazine.

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:49.401
And we try to do it as much
as possible because otherwise

00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:52.705
we wouldn't see
each other very much.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:55.675
So, our journey to
get to this rock art

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:59.178
began with a chartered
flight to a remote community

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:01.347
and then a good part of a day

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.982
on a dirt track in
a four-wheel drive vehicle.

00:03:03.982 --> 00:03:05.884
Not really out of the ordinary

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:09.088
if you are trying to get
to anywhere in the world remote.

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:11.090
It's a lot of logistics

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.493
and just trying to get
to where you're supposed to go.

00:03:14.493 --> 00:03:16.662
And, so in the midst of that,

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:20.433
it's really important
to remember what's important,

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.568
what's the big picture.

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:25.104
And, so I had one
of these moments

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:27.239
when I finally
got to my rock art

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.310
and I was like, "Ah, okay,
I'm going to make my picture."

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.044
And I thought,

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:36.249
"Who is this person
that drew this hunting scene?"

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:37.883
And I assumed it was a man

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:40.153
because of the traditional
hunter roles.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:42.155
And I thought,
"Who is this guy?"

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.123
He is documenting his day.

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:46.291
He is documenting
the world around him.

00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:51.497
And I started to feel connected
to this fellow storyteller.

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:53.932
This person that
was communicating to me

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:56.735
from tens of thousands
of years ago,

00:03:56.735 --> 00:04:00.106
something into the
future about his people

00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:03.276
and his people's relationship
to these animals.

00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:08.247
So, something that
you might not realize

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:11.984
about Aboriginal Australia.

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:18.223
They have the oldest, longest
running culture on Earth.

00:04:18.223 --> 00:04:25.064
Sixty thousand years,
they've been around.

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:28.133
So, a few days
later I found myself

00:04:28.133 --> 00:04:31.337
sitting across from
Jack and Lily Karadada,

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:34.173
in the Aboriginal
community of Kalumburu.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:37.076
It's the gateway to and from
this rock art.

00:04:37.076 --> 00:04:40.079
So, Matt and I decided
to stop for one night

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.982
and we were going to see if we
could find some Aboriginal art.

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.884
And we were led to Lily,

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:48.720
because she is known
globally for her paintings.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.925
So, when Jack found out that
we are from the United States,

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:54.927
his eyes lit up.

00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:58.531
And he told me how
he worked side-by-side

00:04:58.531 --> 00:05:01.033
with the Americans
during World War II.

00:05:01.033 --> 00:05:02.935
And how with his bare hands,

00:05:02.935 --> 00:05:05.637
he helped build
a strategic airstrip

00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:07.840
that helped fight the Japanese,

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.208
who had invaded Timor,

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:10.943
just a couple of hundred miles
to the north

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:13.278
of where we are sitting.

00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:18.084
And then Lily started to
talk to me about their childhood

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:21.720
and how they both grew
up naked and in the bush.

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.724
A hunter-gatherer lifestyle.

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:29.228
And then Lily started
to talk about her country.

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:32.164
And when Aboriginal Australians
talk about their country,

00:05:32.164 --> 00:05:33.832
what they are talking about

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:37.469
is the land that's theirs
by birthright.

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.206
Where they are from,
the land that they are of,

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:43.309
their ancestral lineage.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:45.744
And so then Lily started
to tell me

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:49.081
how everything in her country,

00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:53.485
the rocks, the trees,
the water, the fish, the birds,

00:05:53.485 --> 00:05:55.487
even the sandflies

00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:59.625
that bite really horribly
and hard, were her family.

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.560
That she was connected
to all of them and

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.130
they were connected to her.

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.398
So, these are
things as Americans

00:06:06.431 --> 00:06:09.001
we read a lot about
in New Age magazines

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:11.203
and we're like, "Oh yeah,
let's get connected."

00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:14.006
But in Aboriginal Australia,

00:06:14.006 --> 00:06:18.711
it really-- it, it is
the structure of their society.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:22.615
It dictates who you marry,
how you address somebody

00:06:22.615 --> 00:06:25.451
and even what you eat.

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:27.754
So, let's go back
to that thing of

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:31.256
how long Aboriginal Australians
have been around.

00:06:31.256 --> 00:06:34.994
So, if the indigenous
population of Australia today--

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:38.030
that's Lily and her ancestors--
have been around

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.099
for 60,000 years,

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.669
the last 250 years
of colonization,

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.740
have brought around the
more-- most change than ever.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.875
Albeit kind of
slow in some areas,

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:54.212
because it's this really huge,
vast, remote country.

00:06:54.212 --> 00:06:56.282
The last hunter-gatherer group

00:06:56.282 --> 00:07:00.886
walked out of the
Gibson desert in 1984,

00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:03.556
into the town of Alice Springs.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:06.525
Still, if you think
about it then,

00:07:06.525 --> 00:07:10.963
Aboriginal culture went
along pretty much uninterrupted,

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:18.504
at least nothing like
colonization, for 59,750 years.

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:23.276
Jack and Lily were able
to walk in both of these worlds,

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.679
because they remained
in pre-colonized Australia

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:31.250
until World War II
pulled them out.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.519
And I thought back to that
ancient storyteller in the cave

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:36.255
who made that hunting
scene and I thought,

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:39.391
"Wow, Jack's life as a kid

00:07:39.391 --> 00:07:45.197
was probably pretty similar
to that ancient storyteller's,

00:07:45.197 --> 00:07:49.701
hunting on the same landscape."

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:54.840
Jack and Lily were bridges
between two alien worlds.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.776
And when Lily talked about

00:07:57.776 --> 00:08:00.913
her childhood and her
connectedness to her country,

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:05.184
her eyes just lit up,
she had a glimmer in them.

00:08:05.184 --> 00:08:08.220
And it made me wonder
where could I find

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:11.791
that connection
in Aboriginal Australia today?

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:15.461
Because it was so contrary
to the prevalent story

00:08:15.461 --> 00:08:16.829
that I was hearing
everywhere about

00:08:16.829 --> 00:08:19.632
the downtrodden indigenous
group of Australia.

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:26.706
Don't get me wrong,
it's a really sad history.

00:08:26.706 --> 00:08:30.276
National Geographic staff
writer, Cathy Newman wrote,

00:08:30.276 --> 00:08:33.178
"It's a litany
of dispossession."

00:08:33.178 --> 00:08:35.114
Their stolen land.

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:38.250
There are government policies
that controlled their movement,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.853
who they married,
where they worked.

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:43.622
They even took
their children away.

00:08:43.622 --> 00:08:48.995
From 1909 to 1969,
government agencies went

00:08:48.995 --> 00:08:52.197
into the home of Aboriginal
Australian families

00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:56.102
and removed their children
without any proof of neglect.

00:08:56.102 --> 00:09:01.540
And today they are known
as the stolen generation.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.878
So after meeting Jack and Lily
and the rock art, I was hooked.

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:09.047
And so I proposed a story to
National Geographic

00:09:09.047 --> 00:09:12.318
and they accepted.

00:09:12.318 --> 00:09:17.156
And I learned that after
250 years of dispossession,

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:20.626
the Aboriginal Australian
population had

00:09:20.626 --> 00:09:22.728
the highest rate
of heart disease,

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:25.598
kidney disease,
cancer, diabetes,

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:28.900
and they die on average
10 years earlier than their

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.103
white Australian counterparts.

00:09:33.138 --> 00:09:36.008
Sixteen percent unemployment,

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:40.079
as opposed to five percent
for the rest of Australia.

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:43.282
And they make up a third
of the prison population.

00:09:45.317 --> 00:09:49.388
Trying to impose a
European style of education

00:09:49.388 --> 00:09:53.058
on an indigenous group
does not always work very well.

00:09:53.058 --> 00:09:56.195
So only 37 percent
of Aboriginal students

00:09:56.195 --> 00:09:58.264
graduate from high school.

00:10:00.332 --> 00:10:02.234
I was in a community where

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:06.939
the principal had to go around
every morning, door-to-door,

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:09.508
and round the kids up.

00:10:09.508 --> 00:10:11.844
Otherwise she said
no one would attend.

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.983
And the teacher cried herself
to sleep almost every night,

00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:19.851
because she was
so frustrated about

00:10:19.851 --> 00:10:22.188
not getting through to the kids.

00:10:22.188 --> 00:10:26.058
So, you see
little Matty down there,
on the left hand corner.

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:33.732
He's four years old, completely
disconnected in this classroom.

00:10:33.732 --> 00:10:39.205
And here he is again
completely connected,

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:41.240
learning about his culture

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.275
and how to manage
his land with fire,

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:47.913
just as his ancestors have
for tens of thousands of years.

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:50.683
So this moment
from disconnect to connect

00:10:50.683 --> 00:10:53.786
really connected something
for me.

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:58.023
And I thought, "Maybe
my job here as a storyteller

00:10:58.023 --> 00:11:01.426
wasn't to just document
a disappearing culture,

00:11:01.426 --> 00:11:03.261
in this modern world.

00:11:03.261 --> 00:11:07.265
Maybe it was to look
at this living, breathing,

00:11:07.265 --> 00:11:10.936
thriving part of their
culture and how important it is

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.739
to the future health
of their communities."

00:11:16.041 --> 00:11:19.444
Most non-indigenous Australians

00:11:19.444 --> 00:11:21.947
have never met
an Aboriginal person.

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:26.585
And most Australian news stories
about Aboriginals are negative.

00:11:28.754 --> 00:11:33.726
I felt like there was some
piece of the story missing.

00:11:36.929 --> 00:11:42.234
And the Aboriginal population
is sort of faceless.

00:11:42.234 --> 00:11:45.504
They don't have education,
they don't have jobs,

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:50.809
all the things that we value
in Western hyped up society

00:11:50.809 --> 00:11:52.577
is not what they have.

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:54.880
And so I thought
maybe if I could find

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.182
that connectedness
that I saw with Matty,

00:11:57.182 --> 00:12:01.119
it would-- they would
see something different.

00:12:01.153 --> 00:12:06.124
So I started to look
to the remote communities.

00:12:06.124 --> 00:12:08.561
And I learned about
the homelands movement

00:12:08.561 --> 00:12:09.995
from the 1970's,

00:12:09.995 --> 00:12:13.565
when a more liberal Australian
government gave incentives

00:12:13.565 --> 00:12:16.168
for people to go
back to their homeland,

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:19.338
and utilize their
land and live there.

00:12:21.607 --> 00:12:26.445
"Homeland for the Aboriginal
person is your being.

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:29.514
It's where you have
been for thousands of years.

00:12:29.514 --> 00:12:34.386
Dispossess the person from
that and they become nothing.'

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.525
Maybe this was where
I could find that glimmer

00:12:40.525 --> 00:12:43.362
I saw in Lily's eyes.
The homelands.

00:12:46.565 --> 00:12:49.268
Extensive studies
have shown that

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:51.103
Aboriginal families
that are utilizing

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:53.706
their homelands are healthier.
They live longer.

00:12:56.141 --> 00:12:59.010
They hold on to their
language and culture.

00:12:59.544 --> 00:13:04.750
They pass on their language and
culture to younger generations.

00:13:06.151 --> 00:13:10.923
And they utilize their homelands
for food and cultural practices.

00:13:12.691 --> 00:13:15.995
They spend more time
with their family.

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:22.234
And Aboriginal youth that spend
more time in their homelands

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:25.805
are less likely to get
involved with drugs and alcohol.

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:33.879
So, my first night on a homeland
went something like this.

00:13:34.746 --> 00:13:36.882
It's always a crazy
road to get there.

00:13:36.882 --> 00:13:39.718
You're gonna get stuck,
you're gonna get bogged down.

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:42.687
Really deep sand,
so it was a really long day,

00:13:42.687 --> 00:13:45.257
and we got there
really late at night and

00:13:45.257 --> 00:13:48.960
I had this big truck
and some young Aboriginal boys

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.895
were helping me because
they knew the roads they drove.

00:13:50.895 --> 00:13:52.364
We got in really late at night.

00:13:52.364 --> 00:13:54.599
Set up my tent,
went straight to sleep.

00:13:54.599 --> 00:13:56.835
Next morning I woke up,

00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:59.905
go to my truck
to go find something,

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:02.040
and I heard this crashing
and banging

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.109
and sand flying everywhere.

00:14:04.109 --> 00:14:06.845
I couldn't figure out what it
was, I was looking up and down.

00:14:06.845 --> 00:14:10.482
And I look in the back and
there was a 400-pound sea turtle

00:14:10.482 --> 00:14:16.989
in the back of my truck,
on its back, upside down.

00:14:16.989 --> 00:14:19.959
What-- like these
are the moments

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.393
that challenge
you on assignment.

00:14:21.393 --> 00:14:22.527
They are kind of random.

00:14:22.527 --> 00:14:23.695
You wouldn't be able
to predict it,

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:25.698
but it's like, "Yeah,
that would be challenging."

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.500
So it turns out
boys will be boys,

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.469
and they went out hunting
after I went to sleep

00:14:31.469 --> 00:14:33.906
and they found
themselves a sea turtle.

00:14:33.906 --> 00:14:36.541
And they figured that because
they had the keys to my truck,

00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:39.111
you know, that was where
it should go for the night,

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:41.045
in the back of my truck,
on its back.

00:14:41.045 --> 00:14:43.882
And so they were waiting
for to keep it alive

00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:47.686
until the rest of the family
came, so they could butcher it.

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:50.655
And I have to admit it
really wasn't easy for me to

00:14:50.655 --> 00:14:54.493
watch it get killed
because I swam with these,

00:14:54.493 --> 00:14:58.129
but I'm also not
a vegetarian, so--

00:14:58.129 --> 00:15:00.165
And then I saw how they utilized

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:03.068
every part of this
animal for food.

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:06.038
And here they are
washing the guts for soup.

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:08.040
It was amazing.

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:12.176
And somehow I got
talked into eating these.

00:15:12.176 --> 00:15:13.812
These are-- These are the eggs

00:15:13.812 --> 00:15:16.381
straight from the
belly of the turtle.

00:15:16.381 --> 00:15:19.818
And there is a number
of other foods that got me,

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:22.588
like pushed me
to my limit on this--

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:26.224
I wasn't brave enough to eat
these witchetty grubs raw,

00:15:26.224 --> 00:15:28.961
but cooked they taste
like cheesy eggs.

00:15:33.264 --> 00:15:35.266
These are cycad nuts and you--

00:15:35.266 --> 00:15:38.670
they get turned into flour,
and then bread,

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.774
but if it's not prepared
correctly, you die.

00:15:43.608 --> 00:15:48.446
And this is Wallaby, which
is really delicious, actually.

00:15:49.047 --> 00:15:54.620
But this is really what my diet
looked like most of the time.

00:15:56.187 --> 00:15:59.090
So, by the time I got
to the end of this assignment,

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.126
I had cast quite a web

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:03.127
of connections
throughout Australia.

00:16:03.127 --> 00:16:05.063
You can see all those
red dots are places

00:16:05.063 --> 00:16:06.898
where I actually
spent some time.

00:16:06.898 --> 00:16:10.135
But one of these
connections spun me

00:16:10.135 --> 00:16:13.639
back up to the top there,
called Arnhem Land,

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:18.077
which is right up there in the
clump of red flags that you see.

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:22.481
And it also spun me
back to National Geographic.

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:27.886
So it turns out,
almost 70 years ago, in 1948,

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:31.356
National Geographic
ran a joint expedition

00:16:31.356 --> 00:16:33.826
with the Smithsonian Institute.

00:16:33.826 --> 00:16:37.229
And then, Arnhem Land was
really, really remote.

00:16:37.229 --> 00:16:39.598
You couldn't even drive there.
You had to go by boat and it was

00:16:39.598 --> 00:16:41.866
months and months.
They spent almost a year there.

00:16:41.933 --> 00:16:44.169
And they collected
all the things

00:16:44.169 --> 00:16:46.672
that they do in
a 1948 expedition.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:49.942
They took like birds,
and flora and fauna, and

00:16:49.942 --> 00:16:55.080
all sorts of data.
But they also took human skulls.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:59.817
And a couple years ago
as part of a global trend to

00:16:59.817 --> 00:17:04.522
return human remains
to the rightful owners,

00:17:04.522 --> 00:17:05.858
the Smithsonian decided that

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:08.727
they would return these
human skulls to Australia,

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:13.799
to Arnhem Land and to the
community to which they belong.

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.934
This is actually,
this is the photographer,

00:17:15.934 --> 00:17:17.969
the National Geographic
photographer on the assignment,

00:17:17.969 --> 00:17:20.938
Hal Walker,
photographing some kids

00:17:20.938 --> 00:17:22.741
in the same area that I was in.

00:17:22.741 --> 00:17:25.844
So you might wonder,
"Okay, how did they figure out

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:28.914
how, where those
skulls belonged?"

00:17:28.914 --> 00:17:33.418
Well, it turned out those
skulls had paintings on them.

00:17:33.418 --> 00:17:36.354
And those paintings
had the story

00:17:36.354 --> 00:17:39.091
of that person's
country on them.

00:17:39.091 --> 00:17:40.992
And so when they showed
the skulls

00:17:40.992 --> 00:17:44.195
to some elders in the area,

00:17:44.195 --> 00:17:47.199
they knew exactly
what land they went to

00:17:47.199 --> 00:17:50.269
and to whom they belonged.

00:17:50.269 --> 00:17:52.771
So the descendants
of these skulls

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:56.274
decided that they
wanted to honor them

00:17:56.274 --> 00:17:58.510
by bringing them
back and burying them

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:01.613
with the traditional
log coffin ceremony.

00:18:01.613 --> 00:18:04.316
And a log coffin ceremony

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:08.253
had not been done in this
community for over 40 years.

00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:11.056
So anybody here who knew,

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:13.424
who had seen it were just
little kids when it happened.

00:18:13.424 --> 00:18:15.460
So this whole community
was coming together,

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.896
trying to piece together
how to do this ceremony.

00:18:18.896 --> 00:18:20.899
And it goes something like this:

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:25.337
so you bury the deceased and you
leave their body in the ground

00:18:25.337 --> 00:18:27.138
until just bones remain.

00:18:27.138 --> 00:18:29.241
You exhume the bones;

00:18:29.241 --> 00:18:32.945
and then you find a
log hollowed out by termites.

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:37.015
And you paint the story
of that person on the log,

00:18:37.015 --> 00:18:38.483
like they are here.

00:18:38.483 --> 00:18:41.786
So all these critters that you
see on this log are the story

00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:45.891
of that person who died,
and their country.

00:18:45.891 --> 00:18:49.927
And then you put the remains
back in the hollowed log,

00:18:49.927 --> 00:18:53.231
and you let them go
back to their country.

00:18:53.231 --> 00:18:57.302
You just leave it out there.

00:18:57.302 --> 00:19:01.473
So finally ceremony
day happened.

00:19:02.006 --> 00:19:05.177
( Aboriginals singing )

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:34.406
One of the ceremonies that day,

00:19:34.406 --> 00:19:37.609
or a part of the ceremony,
was private.

00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:39.577
And it was for men only,

00:19:39.577 --> 00:19:43.348
and it was for only
the men of the deceased.

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:46.317
But they asked
me to document it.

00:19:46.317 --> 00:19:48.753
And I said, "Sure,
of course I'll document it."

00:19:48.753 --> 00:19:52.757
And they said, "No,
this is not for your magazine.

00:19:52.757 --> 00:19:55.160
Nobody else can see this.
This is only for us.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.231
We want a visual record
of this ceremony so that

00:19:59.231 --> 00:20:02.500
if it doesn't happen
again for 40 years or more,

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.604
we-- our future
generations will know

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:07.705
what happened and
they can do it themselves

00:20:07.705 --> 00:20:10.142
because they can learn from it."

00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:12.110
And so,
I documented the ceremony,

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.914
and I can't show
it to you today.

00:20:15.914 --> 00:20:23.654
But maybe that visual record
will be a bridge across time

00:20:23.654 --> 00:20:28.093
just like that story in the
cave by that ancient storyteller

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:29.928
with the hunting scene.

00:20:29.928 --> 00:20:31.796
And it will offer
a pathway

00:20:31.796 --> 00:20:33.665
for this community

00:20:33.665 --> 00:20:37.935
to speak to their future
generations about their culture.

00:20:37.935 --> 00:20:41.273
And maybe somebody's grandson,

00:20:41.273 --> 00:20:45.710
or better yet, great-great-
great-great granddaughter,

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:47.545
will watch this visual record,

00:20:47.545 --> 00:20:50.048
and she'll learn
something about herself,

00:20:50.048 --> 00:20:53.118
and her people,
and her homeland.

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:54.953
Thank you very much.

00:20:54.953 --> 00:20:57.556
(applause)
