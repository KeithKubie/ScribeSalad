&gt;&gt; OMA: Hi, my name is Oma, I'm an engineer
on the Android product. And today I want to

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:13.750
tell about an exciting key feature about platform.
Every application on an Android system is

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.220
able to create background services. We can
perform background test on your behalf while

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.949
you're busy doing something entirely different.
I’m in the application right here that I

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.679
want to show you and then demonstrate this
feature. This application lets you manage

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.949
a list of bodies from their website flicker.
And when I click on the body, I can see all

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.120
these photos from the website. Now, I really
like these photos and I don’t want to check

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.420
every hour or everybody if there's a new photo
available. So, the application is smart enough

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.680
to start a background service. And while I'm
using, for instance, the web browser and doing

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.640
other task, the application will keep checking
the account in the background and will send

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.490
you a notification as soon as a new a photo
is available. So here, I just got a notification

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.330
about a new photo. I just pull the status
bar, and when I click on the notification,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.750
I get right back to the photos and I can see
the new photo for this body available in the

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.790
application.
