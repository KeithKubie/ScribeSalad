00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:12.680
Although I'm at Davos, at best in any light
I'm an ordinary person who feels the outrage

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:21.130
that many people do, most people do when they
hear the CEOs receiving huge bonuses, 18.4

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.640
billion dollars in bonuses for 2008 performance
or lack of performance. And I think I reflect

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:36.390
the outrage of the ordinary citizen who feels
very strongly about the notion that we were

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.101
told that CEOs require those kinds of pay
packages because they are tied to performance.

00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:49.150
And then we find out that essentially the
notion of corporate welfare is stronger than

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.900
the notion of corporate performance. So I
believe very strongly that the average tax

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:04.439
payer in the U.S. must demand a code of ethics
for corporations that in fact if we are tied

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.710
to the notion of paying very, very high figures,
so far outside the understanding of an ordinary

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.509
tax payer, ordinary person, wage earner. That
in fact they do tie very strongly to performance

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.409
and that they tie to a code of ethic that
in fact reflects the values of ordinary citizens.

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:25.700
Thank you.
