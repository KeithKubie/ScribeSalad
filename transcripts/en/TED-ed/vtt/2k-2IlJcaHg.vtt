00:00:15.172 --> 00:00:17.340
You step into an elevator.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.906
It starts going down, fast.

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:25.142
What would happen if you jumped right when it started going down?

00:00:25.142 --> 00:00:28.191
Would the ceiling hit your head? Ouch!

00:00:28.191 --> 00:00:32.456
Do you stay suspended in the air while the elevator plummets down?

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:37.759
Let's examine the elevator problem one step at a time.

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:41.940
First, consider a scale.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.860
You know, the kind of scale you weigh yourself on.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.057
When you step on a scale to weigh yourself,

00:00:47.057 --> 00:00:49.706
there are two forces involved.

00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:52.756
One, gravity pulls you down.

00:00:52.756 --> 00:00:55.575
Two, the scale pushes you up.

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:58.791
What? You didn't know a scale could push?

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:03.975
Of course it can! If it didn't push up on you, you would go crashing through the floor.

00:01:03.975 --> 00:01:10.226
This upward push is called the normal force and yes, it is normally there.

00:01:10.226 --> 00:01:14.791
Since you're just standing there on the scale, you're not moving.

00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:18.206
Therefore, you're not accelerating.

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:23.456
Newton's second law of motion -- net force equals mass times acceleration --

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:29.823
tells us that if the acceleration equals zero, the net force must equal zero.

00:01:29.823 --> 00:01:39.058
Which means that the force of gravity pulling you down must be equal to the force of the scale pushing you up.

00:01:39.058 --> 00:01:44.441
Now let's suppose you're standing on that scale in an elevator.

00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:47.623
At first, the elevator is standing still,

00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:51.391
so you and the scale are standing still.

00:01:51.391 --> 00:01:55.091
The two forces on you are equal and opposite.

00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:59.023
You can read how hard the scale is pushing by looking at it.

00:01:59.023 --> 00:02:01.225
We call that your weight.

00:02:01.225 --> 00:02:04.540
Then, the elevator starts falling down.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.357
You and the scale are in the elevator, so you are falling down too,

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:10.942
faster and faster.

00:02:10.942 --> 00:02:14.707
That means you are accelerating downward.

00:02:14.707 --> 00:02:22.824
Now there is a net force in the same direction as the acceleration -- down.

00:02:22.824 --> 00:02:28.823
Since gravity hasn't changed, that must mean the scale isn't pushing up as hard.

00:02:28.823 --> 00:02:33.106
So the scale is reading a smaller number.

00:02:33.106 --> 00:02:39.924
The faster the elevator accelerates, the less the scale pushes up.

00:02:39.924 --> 00:02:44.357
What if you jumped? Would you stop falling?

00:02:44.357 --> 00:02:46.355
Would the elevator hit your head?

00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:50.406
Well, what's pulling the elevator down? Gravity.

00:02:50.406 --> 00:02:54.274
Is gravity pulling on you? Of course.

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:58.273
So your relative position in the elevator will stay the same.

00:02:58.273 --> 00:03:03.291
The ceiling will only hit you if you can jump up to the ceiling.

00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:09.424
Now consider: what would happen if the elevator accelerated upward

00:03:09.424 --> 00:03:15.725
and, even more frightening, if someone snuck in and cut the cable holding the elevator,

00:03:15.725 --> 00:03:18.142
what would happen then?

00:03:18.142 --> 00:03:19.957
Think about it.
