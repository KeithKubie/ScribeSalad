00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.880
The idea of dream analysis, I suppose

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.180
Is one of Freud's - perhaps Freud's major contribution

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.420
To modern western thought

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.360
The idea was there was something - two dreams

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.100
And I suppose what Freud did was said "Hey look, isn't it strange?

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.780
We have this whole other form of thought that we engage in, at night,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.940
and it speaks in a language that we don't really understand."

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.460
And so, what the hell is that?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.160
And you can say, and many modern people do, dreams are of no significance

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.840
Or even that they're random processes, which is an absurd proposition - obviously

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.220
Because - whatever they are, they're obviously not random

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.340
So, Freud's idea was that there was something in dreams that was informative

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.080
So that's his - Now, he had a method for extracting out from the dream

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.880
What

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.160
The dream purported to represent

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.060
And he outlined that in great detail in the interpretation of dreams

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.220
And, if you want to read one book by Freud I would highly recommend that one

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.540
It's a very long book and it's very detailed, but

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.340
Freud does an extraordinarily complicated analysis of the way that dreams work

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.920
Now he - because he had brought a theoretical framework to bare

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.640
Even on his investigation into dream structure

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.700
he concluded that dreams were essentially wish fulfilments

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.960
And that's were Jung and Freud disagree

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.240
He also believed that the primary motivating factor of

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.860
human beings was sexual

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.815
Now that's a tougher one to toss aside because

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.920
even if you're a Darwinian, rather than a Freudian,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.720
you're going to obviously support the proposition that

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.975
sexual motivation among any living creatures is going to be

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.020
one of the highest order of motivation,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.140
Because, otherwise creatures don't reproduce and prevail

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.960
over the long run

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.440
So the question is that the ultimate source of motivation, in some sense is the

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.220

00:01:57.225 --> 00:01:59.215

00:01:59.215 --> 00:02:01.865

00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:03.495

00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:05.885

second time they lay out the dream and you can get a kind of picture of it

00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:50.745
and then they lay out the dream a second time and as they go through it
