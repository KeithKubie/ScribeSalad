if you if you grouped government's by

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
if you if you grouped government's by
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.899
if you if you grouped government's by
right-wing philosophy say or by

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
right-wing philosophy say or by
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.850
right-wing philosophy say or by
left-wing philosophy and then you

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
left-wing philosophy and then you
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.609
left-wing philosophy and then you
calculated inequality coefficient would

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
calculated inequality coefficient would
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.010
calculated inequality coefficient would
the left-wing organizations be

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
the left-wing organizations be
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.080
the left-wing organizations be
characterized by reduced inequality and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
characterized by reduced inequality and
 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.210
characterized by reduced inequality and
the answer was no there's no evidence

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
the answer was no there's no evidence
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.490
the answer was no there's no evidence
that they are and what that points to

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
that they are and what that points to
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.749
that they are and what that points to
and this is something very fundamental

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759
and this is something very fundamental
 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910
and this is something very fundamental
it's even it's far more fundamental than

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
it's even it's far more fundamental than
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.840
it's even it's far more fundamental than
than political is that inequality is the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850
than political is that inequality is the
 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.069
than political is that inequality is the

you can't positive value without

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600
you can't positive value without
 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.660
you can't positive value without
producing a hierarchy right because you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670
producing a hierarchy right because you
 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.520
producing a hierarchy right because you
positive value say this is worth doing

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
positive value say this is worth doing
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.170
positive value say this is worth doing
everyone says yeah this is worth doing

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180
everyone says yeah this is worth doing
 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.209
everyone says yeah this is worth doing
well then what happens automatically is

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219
well then what happens automatically is
 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.069
well then what happens automatically is
that it turns out that some people are

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079
that it turns out that some people are
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.290
that it turns out that some people are
better at doing it than other people no

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
better at doing it than other people no
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.880
better at doing it than other people no
matter what it is I'm gonna get better

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
matter what it is I'm gonna get better
 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.990
matter what it is I'm gonna get better
and better at it like the way I don't

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
and better at it like the way I don't
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.130
and better at it like the way I don't
respond

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140
respond
 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.600
respond
- and then they start getting better at

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610
- and then they start getting better at
 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.630
- and then they start getting better at
it so the problem is is that without you

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
it so the problem is is that without you
 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.190
it so the problem is is that without you
with if you're gonna positive value

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200
with if you're gonna positive value
 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.570
with if you're gonna positive value
which you have to do if you're gonna act

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580
which you have to do if you're gonna act
 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.309
which you have to do if you're gonna act
and immediately you create a hierarchy

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319
and immediately you create a hierarchy
 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.370
and immediately you create a hierarchy
and you also build into the value claim

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380
and you also build into the value claim
 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.699
and you also build into the value claim
the claim that a is better than B you

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709
the claim that a is better than B you
 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.760
the claim that a is better than B you
also build into that the idea that if a

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770
also build into that the idea that if a
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.350
also build into that the idea that if a
is better than B then people who are

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
is better than B then people who are
 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.060
is better than B then people who are
doing better at a should be

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070
doing better at a should be
 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.860
doing better at a should be
differentially rewarded compared to

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870
differentially rewarded compared to
 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.260
differentially rewarded compared to
people who who aren't there's no way

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270
people who who aren't there's no way
 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.610
people who who aren't there's no way
around that if you're gonna play the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620
around that if you're gonna play the
 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.990
around that if you're gonna play the
game and so in it you're stuck with

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000
game and so in it you're stuck with
 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.699
game and so in it you're stuck with
inequality but there isn't any evidence

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709
inequality but there isn't any evidence
 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.360
inequality but there isn't any evidence
that that social engineering policies

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370
that that social engineering policies
 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.850
that that social engineering policies
are really very good at dispensing with

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860
are really very good at dispensing with
 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.350
are really very good at dispensing with
inequality which is a fundamental

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360
inequality which is a fundamental
 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.090
inequality which is a fundamental
political problem and no one really

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100
political problem and no one really
 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.380
political problem and no one really
knows what to do about it but

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390
knows what to do about it but
 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.440
knows what to do about it but
criticizing the entire society is I mean

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450
criticizing the entire society is I mean
 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.440
criticizing the entire society is I mean
the thing about the West and this is

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
the thing about the West and this is
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.970
the thing about the West and this is
increasingly true all over the world is

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980
increasingly true all over the world is
 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.380
increasingly true all over the world is
that it's generating our approach

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390
that it's generating our approach
 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.570
that it's generating our approach
generates a tremendous amount of wealth

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580
generates a tremendous amount of wealth
 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.370
generates a tremendous amount of wealth
forever I mean it even happened in China

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380
forever I mean it even happened in China
 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.550
forever I mean it even happened in China
you know despite their exceptionally

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560
you know despite their exceptionally
 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.390
you know despite their exceptionally
totalitarian leanings and so you what

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400
totalitarian leanings and so you what
 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.009
totalitarian leanings and so you what
happens with the lefties is that they

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019
happens with the lefties is that they
 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.170
happens with the lefties is that they
say well inequality is a consequence of

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180
say well inequality is a consequence of
 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.370
say well inequality is a consequence of
the West and the consequence of

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380
the West and the consequence of
 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.710
the West and the consequence of
capitalism which is palpably false claim

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720
capitalism which is palpably false claim
 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.620
capitalism which is palpably false claim
and say well because it produces

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630
and say well because it produces
 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.330
and say well because it produces
inequality then it's a corrupt system

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340
inequality then it's a corrupt system
 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.069
