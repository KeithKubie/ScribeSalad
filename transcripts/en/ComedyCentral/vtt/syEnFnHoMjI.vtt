00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:03.369
My opponent tonight is
Democratic congressman,

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:05.738
Ted Lieu--
here's what you need to know.

00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:08.641
He represents the state
of California in congress.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:10.343
Meanwhile, California represents

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:13.413
the state of moral decay
in our country.

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:15.381
He's a member
of the Democratic Caucus,

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.450
where he serves
as an assistant whip.

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:20.219
I'll ask him
for Adam Schiff's safeword.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.954
-(laughter, groans)
-He's a colonel

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:23.656
in the U.S. Air Force Reserve,

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.859
but he won't trick me with
any sexy volleyball montages.

00:00:26.892 --> 00:00:29.095
Congressman Ted Lieu, everybody.

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:30.596
-Congressman.
-(cheering, applause)

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.799
Thank you.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.901
Congressman, just want to get

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:36.903
a little small talk
out of the way.

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:39.939
No big deal, but who did you
vote for in the last election?

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:41.874
-I voted for myself.
-You d...?

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:43.209
Yeah. Who did you vote for?

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:44.744
I'm not gonna answer
that question.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:46.979
I find that inappropriate.

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:50.016
You have given our president
a pretty hard time.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:52.251
Have you given him
a fair chance?

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.854 line:0%
I have. I didn't set out
to run for congress

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:56.456 line:0%
to resist the president.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.491 line:0%
I served active duty
in the Air Force.

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:00.693 line:0%
I believe America
is an amazing country.

00:01:00.726 --> 00:01:02.695
So after last November's
elections,

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:05.398
I actually wrote a memo
that said:

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.366
Hey, Donald Trump won
the electoral college.

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.235
One of the great things
about America

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:10.803
is our peaceful transfer
of power.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:12.905
We should give him
a chance to govern.

00:01:12.938 --> 00:01:15.241
About two months later,
I concluded I was wrong.

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:16.642
(laughter)

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:19.145
Did you... did you
release that memo?

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:20.580
I made it public.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.849
-You made the memo public?
-I absolutely did. I did. Yes.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.917
And I read the underlying
information as well.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.153
-You did your research?
-I did.

00:01:27.186 --> 00:01:29.255
(whooping, applause)

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:30.890
That's your first mistake.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:32.592
You're on the House
Judiciary Committee.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.193
Have you read the memo?

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:36.929
-I have not, but it doesn't mean
I can't talk about it. -Great.

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.498
For the same reason
that Chairman Nunes

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.433
wrote the memo without reading
the underlying information.

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.835
Well, it's not about what
you know or what you've read,

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:44.437
it's about, like,
what you understand

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.972
and who you want to convince.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.508 line:0%
There's only three things you
need to know about this memo.

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:51.377 line:0%
-Great. -First of all, Democrats
have a better super secret memo

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.745 line:0%
than Republicans.

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:54.280
-(laughter)
-Second...

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:56.616
It's a follow-up, it's a sequel,
nobody likes the sequels.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.451
Do you think anybody liked
 Godfather II?

00:01:58.484 --> 00:02:02.488
So second,
their hyper-partisan GOP memo

00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:05.558
was written based on the
chairman not actually reading

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:06.926
the underlying information.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.995
And third,
there are two organizations

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:10.997
that have read
the underlying information:

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.965
the Senate Intel Committee

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:14.467
and the Department of Justice,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.270
and Chairman Nunes
won't give them the memo,

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.505
because he's scared they're
gonna tell him he's wrong.

00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:21.607
Why are you so scared
of this memo?

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.242
Are you in this memo?

00:02:23.275 --> 00:02:24.577
I'm not scared of this memo.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.479
I just think the Democrats
have a better one.

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:28.147
Do you think
it's gonna come out?

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.750
Um, it doesn't really matter,
'cause it's a stupid memo.

00:02:30.783 --> 00:02:32.451
(laughter)

00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:35.454
(whooping, applause)

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:37.990
Again, the Democrats have
a better super secret memo.

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:39.825
Oh, the Democrats have
a better plan,

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.494
a better way to deal
with health, right?

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:44.096
-We do have a better deal.
-You didn't have a better path

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.133
to the White House,
I'll tell you that much.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:50.436
You are also pretty critical
of Jared Kushner.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:51.904
Absolutely.

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:53.906
And you've been pushing to take
away his security clearance,

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.875
or showing that he doesn't have
security clearance.

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:57.843
So this is what we know about
Jared Kushner...

00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:00.112
That he's the son-in-law
of the president

00:03:00.145 --> 00:03:02.248
and should get what the hell
he wants.

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:04.116
Well, that apparently is
what's happening.

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:06.118
So to get a security clearance,
you have to fill out

00:03:06.151 --> 00:03:09.322
what's known as an SF-86
security clearance form.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:11.791
I had to fill those out to get
my security clearance.

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:14.093
They're very intrusive,
and they say

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:16.295
if you lie on it,
you'll be prosecuted.

00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:18.331
Jared Kushner lied twice on two

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.032
of his security clearance forms.

00:03:20.065 --> 00:03:21.968
He had to submit three
to get it right.

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.803
In addition,
he's under investigation

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:25.838
by special counsel Mueller's
office.

00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:27.840
No one in that kind of situation

00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:29.008
should have
a security clearance.

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:30.876
Sounds like he's got
a lot of eyes on him,

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.446
so he's probably fine.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:35.314
Well, so that's a good point.

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.817 line:0%
He is now in a compromised
situation, right.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.286 line:0%
So foreign powers know they can
leak things,

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.121 line:0%
whether it's true or not,

00:03:42.154 --> 00:03:44.190 line:0%
and put him into even
deeper trouble.

00:03:44.223 --> 00:03:46.158
That's why his
security clearance

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:47.793
needs to be revoked immediately.

00:03:47.826 --> 00:03:49.161
So what-what do you want to do
about this?

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:50.630
As somebody who's in
a position of power,

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:52.331
what can you do about
something like that?

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:53.966
Help me take back the House

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.768
and we'll revoke
his security clearance.

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:57.737
(cheering, whooping, applause)

00:04:02.641 --> 00:04:04.810
You are on your own here,
let me tell you.

00:04:04.843 --> 00:04:06.212
Do you have a plan?

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:07.780
How are the Democrats gonna
take back the House?

00:04:07.813 --> 00:04:09.215
Give me your plan and maybe I'll
help you,

00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:10.549
and by that I mean thwart you,

00:04:10.582 --> 00:04:12.985
but listen to the first part.

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:15.421 line:0%
We have a better deal
on the economy.

00:04:15.454 --> 00:04:17.757 line:0%
This GOP tax scam was really

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.059 line:0%
a bad deal for the
middle-class families.

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:22.662
83% of all the benefits are
eventually gonna go

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:24.964
to the top one percent
of America.

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:27.033
Many middle-class families are
going to end up getting

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:28.567
the short end of the stick.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.037
And when you look at all
the activism out there,

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:33.005
these amazing women's marches,

00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:35.775
you see huge amounts
of voter behavior shift,

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:39.745
and we just flipped a rural
state senate seat in Wisconsin.

00:04:39.778 --> 00:04:43.349
All the activism and energy is
on the part of the Democrats.

00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:46.185
Now, the doomsday clock
just clicked

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:48.521
one more click closer
to midnight.

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:51.223
Yee-haw, I guess?

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:53.092
You've been pretty adamant.

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:55.695
You've tried to propose

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.697
to take away Donald Trump's
ability

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.599
to launch a first strike attack.

00:05:00.632 --> 00:05:03.636
Don't you think now would be the
time to give him that option?

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.538
-Not at all.
-No?

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.640
We're getting this much closer
to doomsday.

00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:09.575
Give that guy the keys
to the car.

00:05:09.608 --> 00:05:11.310
So this is something
I think most people

00:05:11.343 --> 00:05:12.712
will find interesting.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.880
How do you launch a nuclear
weapon in America?

00:05:14.913 --> 00:05:16.515
President wakes up one morning
and says,

00:05:16.548 --> 00:05:19.118
"Hey. I'm angry; I want to go
nuke some country."

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:21.654
Secretary of defense has to
execute that order.

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:23.823
The order goes down through
military chain of command,

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.424
and missiles launch.

00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:26.992
It is that easy.

00:05:27.025 --> 00:05:29.428
Congress is not involved, the
judiciary is not involved.

00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:31.430
There's no way the framers of
the Constitution

00:05:31.463 --> 00:05:34.734
would have let a small amount of
people destroy the entire world

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:36.902
without additional checks
and balances.

00:05:36.935 --> 00:05:39.739
Well, I think it's good that
it's easy for Donald Trump.

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:41.507
I mean, you make it too hard,
that guy's not gonna be able

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.009
to do anything with it.

00:05:44.042 --> 00:05:45.611
So we're trying
to make it harder.

00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:47.613
So my legislation with
Senator Ed Markey

00:05:47.646 --> 00:05:50.750
is bipartisan, and says
before the president

00:05:50.783 --> 00:05:52.852
can launch a
nuclear first strike,

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:55.688
he first has to get the approval
of Congress.

00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:59.158
-Congress has to agree
on that. -Absolutely.

00:05:59.191 --> 00:06:01.227
I think we're pretty safe
from nuclear war, then,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.762
-if that's the case.
-That's the point of it.

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.195
Congressman Ted Lieu.
