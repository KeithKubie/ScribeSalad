00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.299
Hi, I'm Corey D'Augustine.

00:00:01.299 --> 00:00:06.740
I'm an art conservator and I'm also teaching
MoMA's online course called In the Studio,

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.260
Postwar Abstraction.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.720
We're here today in MoMA's excellent exhibition
called “Making Space: Women Artists and

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.090
Postwar Abstraction.”

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.779
In fact, some of the artists in this show
are also covered in the course, so check that

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.579
out on Coursera if you have a moment.

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:25.029
And today, what we're gonna do is look very
closely at some of the really interesting

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.399
paintings in this exhibition, paintings and
sculpture, I should say.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:35.670
And we'll really be focusing in on the artist
materials and working methods, how these paintings

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.670
get made.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.680
Now, a word or two about the exhibition itself,
these are works all painted by women in the

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.760
postwar period, so 1945 through, let's say,
1970, something like that.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.020
Suffice to say for now that these women had
an extremely challenging situation to be taken

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.629
seriously as artists in a very male dominated
and at times, potentially misogynistic art

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.079
world.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.520
However, issues of gender are obviously on
the table here.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.660
In fact, that's really the only thing that
all of these artists have in common but it's

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.400
potentially a slippery slope because sometimes
we may think about issues of gender too much

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.560
at the expense of the paintings themselves
since many of the artists in this exhibition

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.000
really didn't want to be thought of as women
artists per se, but just as artists, just

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
as painters.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.600
Since a lot of these are really damn good
painters.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.980
Let's in fact start with Hedda Sterne here,
in fact the first painting that you'll see

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.920
walking into the exhibition.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.530
Hedda Sterne born in Romania, a really remarkable
life, as a matter of fact, she narrowly escaped

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.430
a concentration camp in the World War II era
and moved here to New York City to pursue

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.030
a career as a modern artist.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.040
Hedda Sterne was sort of an abstract expressionist
but she never really fit into that category

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.020
very comfortably, in fact, many of those artists
didn't really fit that category.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.280
Sterne changed her style again and again and
again and here in 1954, we see her right on

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.280
the threshold between figuration and abstraction.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.670
On first glance, this absolutely looks like
a nonobjective or an abstract painting but

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.610
as we get close here, we realize that there
certainly is a structure.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.840
And in fact, Sterne really developed this
vocabulary at first looking at farming machinery

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.510
and think about huge conveyor belts and tractors
and things like that, but then really here

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.950
in New York City, in Manhattan specifically,
looking at the structures of skyscrapers and

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.540
here really of bridges.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.740
This painting is called New York 8, painted
in 1954, it's not a bridge but certainly the

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.990
vocabulary here is closely related to it.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.740
The grid is really accentuated and some of
these diagonals, they almost seem like trusses

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.860
or perhaps cables on the Brooklyn Bridge here
in Manhattan or something like that.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.670
As we come in really close, you'll see something
quite remarkable, especially for its period

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.150
that some of these light spots which initially
read as being, you know, some light space

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.160
behind that bridge or something like that,
they're in fact painted right on the surface.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.100
So kind of reverse way of bringing light into
this painting opaquely right on the surface

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.800
and you'll notice that that's spray paint.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.400
And what Sterne is doing here really hot off
the press is working with acrylic paints which

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.520
had literally just been invented where here
in 1954 and she's immediately using them spraying

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.819
paint kind of an industrial treatment of the
surface, right on to the canvas here.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:39.340
Now spray paint of course was used on bridges
and other industrial surfaces in the 1950s,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.910
so there's something very real about her treatment
of materials here.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.020
There's also something very aggressive in
cutting edge about using paints that had literally

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.180
just been invented at that time.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.450
So as we're really looking at the facture
or the making of this painting, we can see

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.790
traditional brush marks, we can see sprayed
passages like these and then we see a lot

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.290
of scraping.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.720
And this here, these are not actually brush
strokes, but this is, you know, the tip of

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.830
a palette knife or perhaps the reverse of
a paintbrush that she is scoring back into

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.200
that dried paint, you know, literally stripping
off a little bits of it here.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.390
So this is very muscular, very aggressive
technique.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.900
This one made the following in year in1955,
it's called Trojan Gates by American painter,

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.900
Helen Frankenthaler.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.819
Frankenthaler is really best known for a very
different take on how to paint horizontally

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.360
on the floor in other word.

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.740
Very influenced by Jackson Pollock as many
artists in the 1950s were.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.520
However, whereas Pollock is known for these
very crisp, linear kind of marks all over

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.870
the canvas, we can already see on a first
glance that Frankenthaler's marks here, they're

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.710
much softer, more fluid, more nebulous or
organic in character and part of the reason

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.059
why as we really, you know, get our nose in
toward the painting here is that we realize

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.539
that this is a stain painting.

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:01.300
In almost all of this paint is really thinly
applied and has been absorbed into the canvas

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.300
itself.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.439
She's not working principally with enamels
although she certainly dabbled with them,

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:10.659
instead she's working with traditional oil
paints but using, using, excuse me, a ton

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:15.330
of solvent, that's turpentine to really thin
her paints so the consistency of let's say

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.190
wine or watercolor or something like that.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.960
So working so thinly, her paint becomes very
translucent and looking at this area here,

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.360
you realize that there is stain over stain
over stain, four, five, six, seven different

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.999
applications of paint.

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.699
A few words about Joan Mitchell, another of
the New York school painters.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:38.840
In fact, Mitchell herself, her New York'ness,
if you will, is a bit debatable because the

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:43.979
year after making this painting, excuse me,
a couple of years after making this painting

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:50.059
in 1960, Joan Mitchell moved to Paris where
she would spend a lot of time in, let's say,

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:51.749
the second half of her career.

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:55.659
In fact, Mitchell is known as one of the principal
painters of the 2nd generation or the 10th

00:05:55.659 --> 00:06:00.349
Street generation of abstract expressionists
or New York school artists.

00:06:00.349 --> 00:06:04.259
So many of the artists in the 1950s, working
here in New York City, were really trying

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.409
to break away from European modernism.

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:12.009
They're trying to find styles that were new
or were perhaps more American than what had

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:14.410
been made in this country beforehand.

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.930
Mitchell perhaps is in a different category,
though.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.689
Mitchell wears her influences on her sleeves,
and they're very European, in fact, in nature.

00:06:22.689 --> 00:06:27.500
Mitchell repeatedly drew attention to her
interest in Vincent van Gogh and, for me,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.569
I think even more strongly to Henri Matisse.

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:35.150
From van Gogh, and I think, probably, you
can see this right off the bat, her interest

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:38.680
in these brush strokes is quite evident.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.069
van Gogh, of course, if you think of starry
night or something like this, these pastels,

00:06:42.069 --> 00:06:47.999
thick, kind of toothpaste, applications of
paint dabs, well, these are now really blown

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:51.009
up, and those are those same van Gogh-type
dabs of paint.

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.349
But now, rather than the knuckles flexing,
it's the elbows rotating and extending.

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:59.779
So these become kind of muscular Van Gogh-type
applications of paint.

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:05.279
Joan Mitchell, also very interested in landscape,
and a lot of the colors of nature are summarized

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:11.099
here in this kind of our crossing mesh of
aggressive thick brush strokes.

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.909
But I shouldn't say only thick brush strokes,
there certainly are some thick ones.

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:19.039
Look at his yellow straight out of the tube
here almost very pasto or thick in character.

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:24.400
And as we allow our eyes to kind of move around
this painting, this all over composition here,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.149
we realize that this is virtually a dictionary
of physical qualities of paint.

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:33.180
Basically, every single thing that you would
ever imagine that paint could do, it's here

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.180
somewhere.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:38.969
So we saw that very thick mark here, we see
some very thin and runny and translucent paints

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:39.969
here.

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:43.189
At other times, she's painting very forcefully,
you can see she's put a lot of pressure on

00:07:43.189 --> 00:07:49.270
the brush here as she's almost scraping paint
across the canvas, the brush...the bristles

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.490
here are very evident.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.629
At other times she's been a little bit more
gentle as she hasn't put as much pressure

00:07:54.629 --> 00:07:59.279
on the brush here with this looping green
stroke where you don't see the canvas and

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:03.159
she's just kind of allowing the brush to move
over the canvas really rather than scrubbing

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:04.309
into it.

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:08.379
Let's take a look at the work and sculpture
here by Louise Nevelson.

00:08:08.379 --> 00:08:14.149
This is a sculpture made in 1963, it's called
Big Black and this is really Nevelson's signature

00:08:14.149 --> 00:08:15.149
style.

00:08:15.149 --> 00:08:16.969
We can say that this is a work in assemblage.

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:21.620
These are found objects, almost all of these
are wood and they've kind of been bric-a-brac

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:29.550
or assembled together and this is really Nevelson's
key contribution to mid-century abstraction.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:35.120
In fact, she lived in a part of Manhattan
called Kips Bay, which in the mid-1950s, 1955,

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.599
if I'm not mistaken, was rezoned and really
demolished.

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:44.651
That's where her studio was and around her,
one tenant after another after another, were

00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:49.410
getting evicted, so of course, they were taking
old furniture and leaving it out on the sidewalk

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:54.750
or what have you, and Nevelson began well
dumpster diving, so to speak and really scrounging

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.920
around for all of these interesting shapes,
found art if you will.

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.410
As we really start to look inside of some
of these boxes, there are some very recognizable

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.410
objects.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.500
There are bedposts here.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.269
Perhaps this is a kind of a banister for a
stairwell or something like that.

00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:14.100
And some...I don't know what this is, some
kind of molding up by the ceiling and all

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:17.089
of these very dated, but quite recognizable
objects.

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:21.149
But as we retreat from a distance here, we
realize that by painting these monochrome,

00:09:21.149 --> 00:09:26.870
they all become kind of the same thing, they
become buried by a very interesting treatment

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:33.800
of form here, where suddenly, the entire structure
has this totemic form, whereas we realize

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.360
it's actually assembled from all of these,
you know, almost a thousand little bits and

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.639
pieces here.

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:44.370
Nevelson was very cavalier about her use of
paint and color.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.830
Black is really the signature color of her
works.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:52.009
She also does work in white monochrome and
for a time worked in gold monochrome, but

00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:55.550
it's interesting I've read some correspondence
with her conservators worried, "Oh, there're

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:59.170
some scratches, a loss in the paint, so what
do we do."

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:03.920
And she basically said, "Just take it on the
fire escape and krylon it...sssshhh like this."

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.990
So for her, it wasn't really about the application
of paint, it was more about the color of the

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.540
work entirely.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:13.350
quite interesting in some of the emotional
connotation that's here.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.459
As we take a walk around the corner, we'll
go from black to white here.

00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:21.810
Okay, so looking at a painting by the Japanese
artist, Yayoi Kusama, called number F.

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:24.920
Well, F is not exactly a number but we’ll
forgive Yayoi for that.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:30.300
In fact, this is a painting that we referred
to in, in the course in a YouTube video.

00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.930
So you might check that also.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:37.980
But as we look at Kusama's 1959 canvas here,
this is really her signature style.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.279
This is the infinity net.

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:46.580
Kusama carving out space here, loop to loop
to loop to loop here, obsessively, neurotically,

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:49.029
really filling this entire space of the painting.

00:10:49.029 --> 00:10:53.959
very thick, very dry application of these
crusty accumulations of paint in some places,

00:10:53.959 --> 00:10:59.290
and then in other areas, quite thin and much
smoother as she's adding some oil, some medium

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.290
to her paint.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:05.139
Also, the holes, if you will here, you can
see that there's a lot of black showing through

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:06.139
there.

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:10.810
So what she's done is to ground this canvas
with black and then to stain over with white

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.339
to have a very active surface.

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:17.020
But Kusama, again, she made these infinity
nets in a really wide variety of different

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:23.069
waves, reinventing her motif, if you will,
which again, according to her, comes from

00:11:23.069 --> 00:11:27.910
these hallucinations that she suffered from
flowers, you know, repeating in her field

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:29.089
of vision.

00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:35.500
This is some kind of cathartic mode of mark-making
to really relieve the tension of what sounds

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.630
like some very terrifying experiences.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:44.210
Kusama sometimes would paint like this style
but in huge canvases and we have legend, perhaps

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:48.149
true perhaps not, now where she's staying
up for night after night after night, loop,

00:11:48.149 --> 00:11:49.389
loop, loop, loop.

00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:54.699
So these are in fact the knuckles flexing
like a van Gogh or something like that and

00:11:54.699 --> 00:12:00.449
quite different from de Kooning which is really
the main style of so many painters of the

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:01.449
New York school.

00:12:01.449 --> 00:12:05.310
If we move over here to the right, we'll see
really interesting work again by Kusama.

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:11.079
This is actually a collage of photos that
Kusama took of her own paintings.

00:12:11.079 --> 00:12:13.449
Kusama was very well aware of the lens.

00:12:13.449 --> 00:12:17.390
She's someone who had herself photographed
in her studio wearing, you know, costumes

00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:20.149
of her own design in front of her paintings.

00:12:20.149 --> 00:12:24.589
As we move into the Vietnam era, she made
a lot of very well known protests including

00:12:24.589 --> 00:12:28.670
some here at the Museum of Modern Art and
brought a film crew with her.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:34.410
So we have some early inclinations about her
awareness of the lens and its power as she's

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.250
documenting her own paintings and in fact
these are all different paintings photographs

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.509
of different paintings of hers that she has
cut into squares and she's essentially making

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:44.760
an infinity net out of an infinity net.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.639
So she's inbreeding her own ideas if you will
complicating something that's already quite

00:12:49.639 --> 00:12:50.639
complicated.

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:55.689
And as we backdrop here, it's almost this
checkerboard of darks and lights that has

00:12:55.689 --> 00:13:02.390
this almost optical kind of vibrating effect,
a really interesting motif here by Kusama,

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:07.360
again recycling her own ideas and finding
new ways, new creative pathways forward through

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.360
it.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.360
All right, thanks for watching.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.360
