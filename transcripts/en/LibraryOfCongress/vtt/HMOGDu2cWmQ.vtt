00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.510
&gt;&gt; David Mao: All right.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.810
Good afternoon.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.110
Good afternoon everyone,
can you hear me?

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.410
&gt;&gt; Woman: Yes.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.710
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, welcome to
the Library of Congress,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.580
welcome to the Whittall Pavilion
here at the Library of Congress

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.760 position:56%
where we generally celebrate music
with our wonderful instruments here,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.010
but today we're going to be
hearing about the music of law.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.310
[ Laughs ]

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.150
&gt;&gt; David Mao: It is our pleasure
at the Library to be host

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.160
to the Law Library of Congress's
annual Law Day Celebration.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.120
We're a few days early,
but ready to go.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.220
Most of you probably know that
Law Day was created by or created

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.370
as a holiday by presidential
proclamation in 1958

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.630 position:56%
by President Eisenhower and since
that time we have used that as a way

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.420
to celebrate a lot
of different things,

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.620
but most importantly the
importance of the rule of law

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.670
and its impact on our daily lives.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.400 position:56%
Before we start our program though I
want to mention a couple of things,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.430
we will have a small reception
afterwards with a few nibbles

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.090
and invite all of you
to join and for that.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.470
We also have on display, if
you haven't seen it already

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.820
when you first came in, items from
the libraries manuscripts division.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.770
One of our curators
has brought out items

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.160
from the manuscript
division's legal collection,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.300
specifically from the
personal papers of -

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.950
I want to make sure I
get all of them all.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.890
Supreme Court Justices Earl Warren,
Thurgood Marshall, Byron White,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.290
Hugo Black and William
Douglas all speaking

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.430
to the topic of today
s conversation.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.430
So I invite you to take a
look at those on your way out.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.010
The only thing I do ask is that you
take no food and drink over there.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.310
[ Laughs ]

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.060
We'd like to keep them in good
condition as we're supposed to do.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.040
The other thing I should mention is
please turn off your mobile devices

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.340
or at least silence them.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.300
We are recording this event
today, so that we can webcast it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.900
on the library's website.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.630
&gt;&gt; Woman: [Inaudible]
behavior [laughs].

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.220
&gt;&gt; David Mao: So I want to thank
the American Bar Association,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.460
the American Bar Association
Standing Committee

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.940
on the Law Library of Congress,
which is very instrumental

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.820
in helping the Law Library here.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.510
Shelia Hollis is the current chair
and I don't believe she's here.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.850
I think she was unable
to join up with us today.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.960
The friends of the Law
Library of Congress,

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.250 position:56%
their Library's manuscripts
division, all of us working together

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.950
for making contributions of
Thompson Reuters for helping

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.550
out with today's program.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.050 position:56%
I should note that we have president
elect of American Bar Association,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.770
Linda Kline and Vice
President at Thompson Reuters,

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.070
Tom Laden with us here today.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.010
If you want to just turn
and wave to everybody.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.310
[ Laughs ]

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.010
We thank them for being here.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.390
[ Clapping ]

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.380
And with that I will turn it
over to my colleague, Roberta,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.480 position:56%
to introduce to us our very
special guest, the current president

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.090
of the American Bar Association,
who I'm very proud to be able

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.120
to stand here and introduce
her because I am myself I'm

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.020
from the Great Garden
State of New Jersey.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.790
And she currently practices
in New Jersey,

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.010
so I'm very proud of that fact.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.310
[ Laughs ]

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.610
And she is going to
tell us a little bit

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.950 position:56%
about her distinguished legal
career and also about today's topic,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.190
her thoughts on the very important
Supreme Court decision Miranda,

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.920
as we celebrate its 50th
anniversary this year.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.970
So with that, I will turn it over
to my colleague, the Law Librarian

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.760
of Congress Roberta to get
us going on this program.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.060
Thank you.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.840
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Great.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.320
[ Clapping ]

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.660
Thank you, David, and thank
all of our distinguished guests

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.270
and our colleagues who
are here, joining us today

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.180
for a really momentous occasion.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.590 position:56%
Paulette Brown, our honored speaker,
the first African American woman

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.550 position:56%
to head the American Bar Association
is probably also the first ABA

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.960
president to address the Library
of Congress with a law library.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.010
So I know in your career
you have numerous firsts.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.310
[ Laughs ]

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.610
And I hope that you
will have the people

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.730
who are controlling your
biography add that...

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.030
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.330
[ Laughs ]

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.630
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.390
to it, but you have had an
illustrious career in practice.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.120
You've been in private practice
as you are now with a law firm.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.780
You were a corporate counsel for
a number of large corporations

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.640
and you even served as
the municipal court judge.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.940
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.890
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: So your
career has been very varied

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.990
and you've had a great commitment
to both bringing highlights to some

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.870
of the challenges that face
minorities and women in professions

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:48.770
and actually even more
broadly in society.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:56.470 position:56%
And I noted with a lot of joy that
you were on the Margaret Brent Award

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.300
from the ABA Commission
on Women in the profession

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.410
and there are two things
I'd like to say about that.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.710
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Okay.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.620
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: You were
raised in Baltimore, actually sadly

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.920
at segregated schools at that time.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.220
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.520
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: But,
Margaret Britton, for those of you

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.480
who don't know, was one of
the first women who practiced

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.230
in the American colonies.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.760
She was from Maryland

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.250
and she actually had a very
illustriousness career,

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.760
including representing Lord
Baltimore in the Colonies.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.750
But she fell out of favor
with him because she insisted

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.330
on paying soldiers their
fair due and she took

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.040
that money out of his trust.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.060
[ Laughs ]

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.980
And when I was thinking
about Paulette Brown,

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.010
I thought my goodness what - these
people, these two are connected.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.310
[ Laughs ]

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.380
They care about justice, but
they also are very forthright

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.680
practicing attorneys.

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.440
And the other thing that was kind

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.890
of interesting was we
just lost Robert MacCrate

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.660
who is another former president
of the American Bar Association,

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.990
he died just a few weeks ago.

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.120
And I believe that it was he
who created the Commission

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.530
on Women in the Profession...

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:10.830
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.130
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.430
back in 1987.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.730
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Correct.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:16.030 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And there's just
one final historical note I will add

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:17.400
and then we'll go into the
conversation and that is

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.960
that Bob MacCrate appointed the
first lady of Arkansas at the time

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.010 position:56%
to head that commission and that
was none other than Hillary Clinton.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.310
[ Laughs ]

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.800
So there are lots of good vibes
in this room today for women

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.900
and everything, but I think

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.680
that Paulette you haven't always
had an easy road and I wonder

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.090
if you can take the story
of your career from here

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:50.060
and tell us a little bit about
how you decided to become a lawyer

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.140
and then a little bit about
obstacles you may have faced

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.050
in the practice and entering
the practice and all that.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Good, can I just
say one thing about Margaret Britton

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:02.490
and how bodacious she was?

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.900
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Yes [laughs].

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.850
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: She not
only was she practicing law,

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:10.440
but she also decided that
not only should women vote,

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.910
but she should have two votes.

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.210
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Right.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.510
She did.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:15.810
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: She
should have two votes.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.110
[laughs]

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.410
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Right.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: [Laughs] One as a
land owner and then one as a lawyer

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.210
and as a regular citizen,
so she thought

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:26.190
that she should have two votes.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:27.490
So what...

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.920
&gt;&gt; Roberta: So you
followed in her footsteps?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.220
[Laughs]

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.520
&gt;&gt; Paulette: Oh, I absolutely
agree that she should have -

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.970
for each thing that you
do should have a vote.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.110
[ Laughs ]

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.410
&gt;&gt; Roberta: We're being recorded.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:38.710
[ Laughs ]

00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:40.300
&gt;&gt; Paulette: Exactly right.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.640
So I thought that was right.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.690
She was really ahead of her time.

00:07:43.690 --> 00:07:50.150
But, so, you know, like you said I
was born and raised in Baltimore,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:51.450
went to segregated schools

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.950
until I was 10th grade,
didn't know any lawyers.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:58.010
I knew Perry Mason
in black and white.

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.310
[ Laughs ]

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:03.530
But didn't know any
personally and I had

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:08.410
from my parents a great commitment
to community and giving back

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:14.590
and so forth and so I thought
that I wanted to save the world

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.710
and so I still think I
want to save the world,

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:19.320
but I wanted to be a social worker.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:25.530
And I went to college with that
thought in mind and when I got

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.570
to college I had two
roommates from New Orleans,

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.970
and Will Jones now knows this.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:33.630
We went to college
together [laughs].

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:34.930
And...

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.230
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: [Inaudible].

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.530
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yeah.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.830
Yeah. He's sitting right here.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:40.130
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: He's 55?

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.430
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Uh-huh.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.750
And my roommates came to college
knowing that they wanted to go

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:49.590
to law school and the backgrounds
weren't that much different

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.050
than mine, so I don't
know how they got in it.

00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.080
Well, one reason is because
there was Judy Dimes,

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.750
who was from New Orleans,
who they knew,

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:58.600
who was a law librarian at Howard.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.900
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Right.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:05.340
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: And so I got
to know Judy and my roommates sort

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.050
of talked me into it and then we
had professors who were lawyers

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.020
who taught us and then I decided

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.140
that with a law degree I could
probably save more people.

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:19.230
Quote, unquote, save more people,
but I decided that I would be able

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.580
to help more people
with a law degree

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.550
than I would as a social worker.

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:27.470
Although, a social worker is
obviously an admirable profession.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.860
So that's what I did, and I went
to law school and, you know,

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.090
there were definitely challenges.

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.000
When I first got out of law
school when I first went to court,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.010
you know, I was anybody
but the lawyer.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:42.310
[ Laughs ]

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:43.610
Anybody but the lawyer.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.970
So I was either a defendant,

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.200
was either court reporter,
was I one of the jurors.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.520
Well then, who are you?

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.800
It was never they never got to the
part, well, are you the lawyer.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:00.200
And, you know, that sort of
persisted for a really long time

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.080
and even now I'm confused
with other professions.

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.510 position:56%
My new favorite one is that so many
people think I'm a flight attendant.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.210
[ Laughs ]

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.550
It's really a true story.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.270
It's a true story, even now.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.010
And I don't have to
be in an airport.

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.310
[ Laughs ]

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Oh, my goodness.

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:18.910
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown:
People to ask me that.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.210
I've twice been in an elevator,

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.920
in a hotel where people ask
me was I a flight attendant

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.240
from customs agents to people

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:28.390
from other countries ask me
whether I'm a flight attendant.

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:32.310
I don't know what it is,
but, you know, again,

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:35.990
that's an honorable profession,
but I don't know why people think.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:42.020
Only - I was buying Garrets Popcorn
most recently in Chicago airport

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:45.010 position:56%
and I was asked and I said does that
mean I'm going to get a discount?

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:46.350
[ Laughs ]

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:48.520
And that's what it was, but
I didn't take the discount

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.540
because it would not
have been honest.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.090
But, you know, but it is, you
know, those I don't, you know,

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:57.060
with some people I don't
take any offense to that.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:01.000 position:56%
I really don't, because I don't
think people are being mean spirited

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.300
in any way.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.180
But, you know, sometimes
some challenges do persist.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:10.000
One of the challenges that I've
been able to use to my advantage is

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.260
that when people think that I don't
have the requisite intelligence

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:17.170
or knowledge, in a particular
case I've been a litigator

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:18.470
for a long time.

00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.870
And especially when I've been
in cases with nothing but men

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.620
on the other side and white
men on the other side,

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.700
and they don't really think
I know as much as they do,

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:31.120
so it's really great
when I crush them.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.690
[ Laughs ]

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:41.510
So it's been, you know, so that
has had some advantages too, but,

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:45.630
you know, it's been and for women
in general and for women of color,

00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:47.600
you know, there are
some unique challenges,

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.150
especially in the large law
firm context that we need

00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:55.450
to do a lot better and just in
general the legal profession,

00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:58.730
you know, just wanting it not to
be the least diverse profession

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:03.360
of all comparable professions
has been an ongoing challenge.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.650 position:56%
And how do we change that and what's
necessary to be done to change that.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:10.900
But I will say even with
all of those things,

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:14.390
I don't think I could have
chosen a better profession ever.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:15.690
It's still the best.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:24.010
Librarians are wonderful and, you
know, my new psychiatrist friend.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.870
[ Laughs ]

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.830
You know, they're wonderful
too, but, you know, seriously,

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:36.000
I think that a law license gives
you ability to do so many things.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.430
And it gives you some power to do
really great things for society.

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.200
And as I tell people
all the time that even

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.810
with all the different
professions that we have,

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:54.540
generally a lawyer is going to
come into play in some way, and so,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.380
you know, no matter how much
people talk badly about lawyers,

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.060
we really can't live without them.

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:03.050
So I am really pleased that I'm
an attorney and chose this path.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.350
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
Well we certainly

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.200
in the Law Library are
delighted you chose that.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.500
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Thank you.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And we totally
agree with you about how fulfilling,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.010
having legal knowledge and being
able to use it for the better...

00:13:15.010 --> 00:13:16.310
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:17.610
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:18.910
is a value.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:20.650
So I think we can move
now to Miranda.

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:21.950
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Okay.

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:24.230 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: As David
mentioned we're celebrating the 15th

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.330
anniversary of that
really landmark decision.

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:33.120
And I am delighted that you have
chosen that theme for Law Day

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:37.430
and I know you've added on a
tag line "More Than Words."

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:40.750
And it particularly I
think strikes us all

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:46.230
about how profoundly important
Miranda warnings and interaction

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.620
in general with our judicial and
criminal justice system are today,

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:54.590
because every day in the news we're
seeing examples where we wonder

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:58.030
about how fairly the
system is being applied.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.890
And I think that might have
been in the back of your mind

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:05.050
as you looked back on the
50 years and look forward.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.350
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:07.650
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: So could
you tell us a little bit

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:12.020
about choosing Miranda beyond just
the fact that it's an anniversary.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.320
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Right.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.580
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And what
you think about how it plays

00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.800
into our justice system today

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:25.360
and how it may have created some
skepticism among certain sectors

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.660
of our society.

00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:28.870
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: So that's
kind of a loaded question.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:30.170
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Yes.

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.470
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: But...

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.770
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Just slightly.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.070
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: But,
you know, many things.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:38.540
Some of which you mentioned it
is, you know, I looked at Miranda

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.930
and how it's evolved over time.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:45.920 position:56%
And I look at the intention of
people not incriminating themselves,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.800 position:56%
that it's an extension of the Sixth
Amendment to a right to have counsel

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.360
and so, you know, I think
about that and I also think

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.890
about how there was a President

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:58.480
after the court ruling he said it
was his main mission to make sure

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.430
that we get rid of Miranda.

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:07.240
And just how it evolves and when
we talk about more than words,

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.720
what that means, it
means having people

00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:16.680
to understand what their rights
are with respect to Miranda

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.490
and the ability to speak
freely and not freely.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:24.570
But them also look at how it's
evolved over time with respect

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.430
to what exactly does that mean?

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:27.990
And when do the warnings apply?

00:15:27.990 --> 00:15:32.500
So if I give you a warning
today and I interrogate you,

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:37.080
and then I Iet you go and then I
call you back in two weeks later,

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:38.870
do I have to give you
the warning again?

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.940
Court says, no, you don't have
to give the warning again.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.740
And then, you know,
you think about -

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.720
so you think about
also the implications

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.610
that if you don't talk now, how
silence can be used against you,

00:15:54.610 --> 00:15:57.950
that if you don't say anything
that your silence can be used

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.630
against you in a court of law.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:02.560
So you think about how
it's evolved over time

00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.270
and then really the meaning of it,

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.340
because all of us hear the
word Miranda we don't even have

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:11.010
to say the word Versus
Arizona anymore.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:12.310
[ Laughs ]

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.010
It's just the one word thing,
like Beyonce, like Price.

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:15.850
[ Laughs ]

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.590
You know, everybody
knows what it means.

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.760 position:56%
And then if you hear that, you know,
any of those famous police sounds,

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.010
da, da, da, da, or any of those
we know that Miranda is coming.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:27.310
[ Laughs ]

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:32.490
And, you know, we also
question about, you know,

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.500
this shouldn't be used
in every circumstance.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:38.690
You know, should there be
some exigent circumstances

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.690
where we don't have to
give the Miranda warning

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.950
and then what happens if
we start making exceptions?

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.110
How far will that crack expand?

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:51.430
And I think it's really important
that we think about those things

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:55.410
when you have half of young people
in the United States believing

00:16:55.410 --> 00:16:57.900 position:56%
that the justice system is not fair.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.580
And you have 66% of
African Americans

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:04.020
who think the justice
system is not fair,

00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.820
and what impact Miranda
has on people like them?

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:11.360
And what does it really mean
that people get Miranda?

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.450
As a judge told a story a little
earlier today about people

00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:19.130
who plead guilty, who
confessed to things to crimes

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:20.430
that they never committed.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:23.690
And the coercion that takes place,

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:26.410
even after a person
has been Mirandized,

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:30.020
which fortunately has led to
a lot of videos being placed

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:34.290
in interrogation rooms because
there's been so many people

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.140
who have admitted to crimes
that they haven't committed,

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.560
even though they've
been read their rights.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.890
And people and the courts
have used those confessions,

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.660
because people have been
Mirandized to do that.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:51.670
So it has been an evolution.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:56.390
I think there's been a true
evolution of Miranda and I think

00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:59.280
that all of us need to pay
really close attention to it,

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.380
so that the rights that people
have come to know as just Miranda,

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:06.070
that they won't be eroded.

00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:08.190
And people will have an
understanding and belief

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.870
that they really don't
have to say anything

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.540 position:56%
that will be against their interest.

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.200
That they really have a right
to counsel and the right

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:21.100
to counsel extends before
they get to the courtroom.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.340
So that people will
understand and believe

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.900
that they really have
access to justice.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.200
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And I know

00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.650
that you yourself have been
very active during your term

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.460
in reaching out to young people.

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.760
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yeah.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.430
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: I think
either before coming to West today

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.380
or immediately following,
you're going to be meeting

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.680
with the Boys and Girls Club?

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.980
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:41.280
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.910
And I'm wondering what do
you tell these young people,

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:47.300
these middle schoolers and
younger about the justice system

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:52.820
and what do you use to encourage
them that there will be justice

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.030
in the true sense of it and
fairness in this society

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.730
that they are growing up in?

00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: So what I say to
everyone is that everyone has a role

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.650
to play in our society, no
matter how young you are

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:09.520
or no matter how old you are and
everyone can make a contribution.

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.330
Understand that how access
to justice and people

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:16.120
who have true access, how
it affects the rule of law.

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:20.070
And that we are a nation of
rules, and that, you know,

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.370
if people don't perceive the
justice system as being fair

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.300
that maybe they don't feel
like they have to abide

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.600
by the rules because why bother.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:32.310
And so when we have that
there can be no rule of law,

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:33.910
and there will be just chaos

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:38.900
and then they will just
not be a democracy anymore.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.380
And so they, a lot of
them understand that even

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:46.240
at a very young ages, but one of
the main reasons I go to the Boys

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:50.740
and Girls Club is to expose them,
because I never knew any lawyers.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:53.760
So they can see a lawyer
and one of the great things

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.800
that happened the day
before yesterday.

00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.040
In New Mexico I said,
"Anybody know any lawyers?"

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:04.300
And a couple of people
said, "Yes, I know three."

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.840
And there were three of the young
lawyers who had come with me

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:09.140
and they met up in the tech lab.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:10.490
[ Laughs ]

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:14.260
And so, you know, they
hadn't known any before,

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:17.790
but they feel so good now that they
can say that they know a lawyer

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:22.160 position:56%
and understand more of what a lawyer
does and their role in society.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.840
They ask the best questions.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.180
You know, a seven year old
asked me, "What do you do

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.160
if you get a case you
don't believe in?"

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.360
And which I thought was a
very interesting question

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.770 position:56%
and young lawyers always go with me,

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.070
so I punted it off
to the young lawyer.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.130
[ Laughs ]

00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:42.730 position:56%
But, you know, they asked, you
know, really - you know, people say,

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:44.760
"I bet you they ask how
much money you make."

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.490
Very, very, very rarely,
especially the younger kids.

00:20:49.490 --> 00:20:54.510
They very rarely ask
how much money you make.

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:58.010
Now, there was one who realized I
was older than her grandmother...

00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:59.310
[ Laughs ]

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.100
... and asked me whether
I knew any abolitionists.

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:08.080
[ Laughs ]

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:13.640
But, you know, but generally they
ask some really, really questions

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.590
and so, you know, what we want

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:20.540
to do is just really capture
this curiosity that they have.

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.780
And make sure that they keep this
curiosity and they don't get swept

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.110 position:56%
up in the school to prison pipeline.

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:31.260
And so I always ask young lawyers
and law students to go with me.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:36.720
They really think that just driving
me there, and they sort of standoff

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.950
to the side and I always
make them come forward

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:40.250
and introduce themselves.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.170
Say what they do, because then
at the end of the day they get

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:45.570
so involved with the kids that
generally I don't have to ask them,

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.260
but in case I do they always want

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.240
to have a continuing
relationship with the clubs.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.610
And so that is really,
you know, kind of the idea

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:57.930
to keep this curiosity going
with these young people.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:01.940
And even if they don't go to
law school, they understand

00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.030
that there's a window of
opportunity for them to go

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:07.010
as far as they want to go.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:08.310
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Oh,
that sounds marvelous.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.610
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yeah.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:10.910
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
And I'm happy to see

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:12.490
that even though you might
have known an abolitionist...

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:14.770
[ Laughs ]

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:18.510 position:56%
... that you didn't confirm or deny.

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:21.410
[ Laughs ]

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:26.050
That you still have a very youthful
optimism and that's wonderful

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:28.690
to see, because many times,
as you know, our colleagues

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:33.060
in the law get a little bit
jaded as they are coming

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.130
to a certain point in their career.

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:38.630
And all they're wondering about
is how much money will I make

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:39.930
on this case.

00:22:39.930 --> 00:22:41.230
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Right.

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.710
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And so it's
wonderful to see the leadership of,

00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:46.180
you know, one of the oldest
professional associations

00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:49.350
in America be led by
someone who's an optimist.

00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.450
I should have also
said that at one time

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:55.970
in your career you were president
of the National Bar Association.

00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:57.270
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Correct.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.570
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And that's
something very important for us

00:22:58.570 --> 00:22:59.880
to keep in mind, because I think

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.750
in the 1920's the National Bar
Association was created exclusively

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:07.650
because at that time,
and not exclusively,

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:09.810
most professional associations,

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.860
the American Bars Association did
not allow African American lawyers

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:15.160
to be a member.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.460
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: That's correct.

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And so the
National Bar Association was created

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.070
as an alternative for
African American lawyers

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:25.980 position:56%
to have professional development and
camaraderie, but in many ways it led

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:32.130 position:56%
so many of the civil rights movement
of the 20th century and continues...

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.430
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:34.730
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: :...

00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:36.260
to do that, so I think you
are, you know, it's so fabulous

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.830
that you've sort of
worn the crown of both

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.150
of those wonderful professions.

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:43.450
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes, thank you.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:47.460
Yes. And can I just say that one
of the things that the highlight

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:51.470
of my presidency of the National
Bar was I had an opportunity

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:53.160
to monitor the first free

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.640
and democratic elections
in South Africa.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.760
Yeah. You remember Rachel,
yes, so it was great.

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.810
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: I knew
that and I think you've also -

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.640
was it at that time that you
testified before Congress

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.910
about the diversifying
federal bench?

00:24:05.910 --> 00:24:07.210
&gt;&gt; Paulette: Yeah.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.510
Well, yes, it was, yes.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.810
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: I thought so.

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:11.110
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:12.410
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: I was trying...

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.710
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown:
Indeed it was,yes.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:15.010
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:16.310
to remember pretty much...

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.610
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:18.910
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:20.210
I'm writing the biography now.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:21.510
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: No.

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.810
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And I pretty
much have the dates right.

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.110
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes,
that is correct, yes.

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.410
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And that
is pretty terrific as well.

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:26.710
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yeah.

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.010
Thank you.

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:29.310
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: So to
moving on this theme of access

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:30.610
and diversifying, I know that a big
part of your agenda for your term

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.780
as ABA President is to diversify
the profession and to do things

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.750
through the ABA through
ABA outlets...

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:39.050
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Right.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:40.350
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.650
to do that, And one of the
things that I loved reading

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.440
about your interest was
that you would like to look

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.080
at legal education and
see if you can find ways

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:51.170
to reduce the cost
of legal education...

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:52.470
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Right.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:53.770
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.070
as a way of diversifying
who can pursue it.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:57.850
And would you consider
talking a little bit about that

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:02.210
or other things that you want to do
to diversify the legal profession?

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:03.510
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:05.340
So it's multi prong.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.640
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
Yes, I noticed that.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.940
[laughs]

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:09.240
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Right.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.570
It's multi prong and I think that
we have to do things in law school.

00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:13.210
We have to do things
long before law school.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.890
We have to build a pipeline, so we
do have a pipeline working group.

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:21.170
And we look in K through
12, college,

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.110
then law school through
Bar admissions.

00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:27.720 position:56%
And the cost of law school is really
a big factor, so one of the things

00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:33.220
that the ABA has worked long
and hard on is loan forgiveness

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.520
for those individuals who go
into some form of public service

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:38.920
and work there for ten years.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:43.530 position:56%
I think that, you know, it has been
taken out of the budget to Congress,

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.940
but we're trying to
make sure it goes back.

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.830 position:56%
And so there's been a huge campaign.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:52.800
It's hashtag loan 4giveness.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.100
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Say it again.

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.400
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Hashtag...

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.700
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: [laughs]

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:58.000
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: ...

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.300
loan 4giveness.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.600
[laughs] Huh?

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.900
&gt;&gt; Woman: What's the
number for loan?

00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:03.200
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Four, okay, yes.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.500
The numeral four.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.800
That's like my twitter thing is.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.100
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Oh.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:08.400
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: And
[inaudible] for lawyers.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Loan 4 Giveness.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.000
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Thank you Linda.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.120
And so we're working
really hard on that.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.420
We're looking at other means.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:17.250
There was a special
task force that talked

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:20.030
about financing of legal education.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.440
And, in fact, some strong
recommendations were made

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:26.870
that actually the American Bar
Foundation has gotten a grant

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:32.120
to help to find ways that we can
reduce the cost of law school.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:34.460
We're looking at people
who get scholarships

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.350
and how scholarships are
administered as well,

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:40.950
because the scholarships don't
really trickle down to the ones

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.970
who really need them, especially
now when there's a shrinkage

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:45.990
of people going to law school.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.470
So the issue has been
compounded because people want

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:54.520
to give the scholarships to
attract what people consider

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.180
to be the best and the brightest.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.560
I could speak about that for a
long time in terms of looking

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.490
at other things other than
just grades for law school,

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:10.220
but it is an issue that we
are constantly looking at.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:14.670
And, you know, one of the - we
have four working groups with this

00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.640
and another one in addition to
the pipeline working group is

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.490
that we think when we talked about
earlier about the justice system

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:26.430 position:56%
and the fairness, and so forth, we
have an implicit bias working group,

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:30.880 position:56%
that is looking at how implicit bias
may affect decision making among

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:33.480
judges, prosecutors
and public defenders.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:40.120
And so we're creating videos trying
to be used as a training tool

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.750
for judges, prosecutors,
and public defendants.

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.270
And the one for judges
is already completed.

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.920
It's all available
on the ABA website.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.140
Please feel free to
look at it and use it,

00:27:50.140 --> 00:27:55.610
but it's really very powerful I
think because we have three experts

00:27:55.610 --> 00:28:00.350
who talk about implicit bias, but
we also have three judges who are

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:04.160
on the video who talk about and
admit to their implicit biases.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.650
And how they believe it may have
affected their decision making.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.330
And how now that they know
about them and because none

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:11.940
of us are exempt from having them.

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.240
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Right.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.540
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Right.

00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:18.400 position:56%
And so, you know, it's really good
and important to acknowledge that so

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.780
that you won't make
decisions based on any biases.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.330
And so we're working
on the prosecutors one

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:29.140 position:56%
where we will have prosecutors on as
well and public defenders, because -

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.180
and people say why do you have
public defenders doing trained?

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.940
Because they're the people
who do good, as yes they are.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:38.100
But one of the things that
triggers our biases more

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:39.840
than anything, stress.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.140
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Oh.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:42.690
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: And so when
we're under stress and we have

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:46.060
to move things along, you know,
we want to do things in a hurry

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.110
and so all of those things
that have been in the recesses

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:51.890
of our minds come flooding forward.

00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:54.010
And we make decisions based on that

00:28:54.010 --> 00:29:00.110
and so even the most well intended
people can be adversely affected

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:01.410
by implicit bias.

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.940
And then we're also looking
internally at the ABA

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:08.240
to see what we have doing, because
it would not be a good thing for us

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.050
to go out and try and tell
other people what to do.

00:29:10.050 --> 00:29:11.350
8

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.650
[ Laughs ]

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.190
If we don't have our
own house in order.

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:18.490
We do a number of things correctly,
so if you looked at all of those

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:21.080
who were following
me in ABA leadership.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.830
You have Linda Cline behind me.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:27.210
You have Hilary Bess
behind her and then in terms

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:30.750 position:56%
of our officers next year you have a
woman who's going to chair the House

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:34.160
of Delegates, an African
American woman.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.390
You've got the treasure elect
is an African American woman.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.910
You've got the secretary
whose a Native American,

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:42.460
so it's pretty incredible.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.730
So the lineup and, you know,

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:49.010
the succession we've got
some men here or there.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:50.310
[ Laughs ]

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:53.010
But it's okay because they've had
it for the last 36 years, so...

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:54.350
[ Laughs ]

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:57.410
... you know, so we're trying to
do a number of different things.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.420 position:56%
And then we're looking at economics.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.660
So we've got an economic
case working for that.

00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:06.980
You know, we hear over and over
again how all the women are more,

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:09.920
you know, half of the profession
graduating from law school,

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:13.010
only 17% of them are
equity partners in law firm.

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:15.010
And women of color only about 2%.

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:18.230
And so we think that part of
it has to do with economics,

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:22.470
and that they're not getting
enough business and getting credit

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:24.640
for the business that
they bring to their firm.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.200
So we've got three general
counsels working on that and trying

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.840
to create guidelines
for both law firms

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:34.590
and companies use uniformed
guidelines, so that, you know,

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.920
especially when it comes
to surveys and so forth

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.880
of how law firms are doing,

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:42.860
everybody is reporting the same
information to everyone else.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:44.420
So, yeah, so.

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:46.300
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Well I know
that you've been very active

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.060
in your current law
firm, Locke Lord,

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.410
and co-chairing the
diversity committee.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:55.460
I wasn't surprised to
see in recent issue

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.550
of the American Bar Association
Journal that there was a focus

00:30:58.550 --> 00:31:02.190
on women leaving the
practice of law.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:03.490
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:06.660
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And I think it
might have been in the same issue

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:10.540
of a presidential page you wrote
that I found really inspiring,

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.960
so I'd like to talk a little
bit about that for a minute.

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.260
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Okay.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.560
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And
that was when you spoke

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:21.230
about the disparate impact
of bail and fines and fees

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:25.520
on members of minority communities.

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:31.400
And the reason it struck me so much
that was I think the very same week

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.580
in the New York times they had
reported finding the same factor

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:38.010
in library fines.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:39.310
[ Laughs ]

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:43.070
That the very people that we want
to have access to public libraries,

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.210
also find that many times
they can't get to the library

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:47.510
when the library is open.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.900
No, they can't get to the
library to return a book

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.730
or somehow a fine accrues.

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:56.910
And these are the very same
people who we want to have access.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:58.210
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.700
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: So when I
read your column and that article,

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:03.510 position:56%
I was struck by that and I
wondered what do you think we can do

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:07.680
as a society to really
level that playing field,

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:10.280
because it seems so
disparate right now?

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:12.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: I think the
first thing we have to do is we have

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:17.540
to stop punishing people
for being poor.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:24.640 position:56%
And figure out alternative ways for
the imposition of fines and not only

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.170
that have the fines not
turned into a criminal action.

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:29.470
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Right.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:30.770
Which happens so quickly.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.070
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: So frequently.

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.830 position:56%
So, you know, we talk about the fact
that there should be no debtors...

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.130
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Right.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:36.430
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: ...prisons,

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:37.730
but we have certainly
created debtors prisons

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:39.030
in the United States.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:41.480
And so some people are
actually looking at alternatives

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:48.160 position:56%
to heavy fines and I think one of
the things that the report that came

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.720
out from the Attorney
General on Ferguson

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.580
and how they collected fines
and how the fines turned

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.600
into criminal actions and so forth.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:58.900
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Right.

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:01.070
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: That what we've
discovered is that, you know,

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.500
people said these things
happen in Ferguson,

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.660
but unfortunately Ferguson is a
microcosm of what's happening all

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.850
over the country and how
people are generally punished

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:12.270
because they are poor.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:16.850
And so I think that we really
have to be innovative and creative

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:24.490
in our thinking and think about
not just how we can do things other

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:25.810
than impose fines, you know,

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:27.940
there is something
called community service.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:29.240
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
Community service.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.540
[ Laughs ]

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.180
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Community
service that we can do.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.950
There are some other
judges who are doing things

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:41.410
that are finding alternatives,
having people to just sit and write

00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:46.660
about what it is that's
going on with them,

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:54.110 position:56%
and explaining different things and
using that as a way to bridge a gap.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:57.690 position:56%
And, you know, when its satisfactory
completed, that there are no fines

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:01.000
and that there are no penalties.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.010
But, you know, you have
to have a commitment,

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:07.630
because the judges I know who do
this, they get paid no extra money,

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:11.050
the days become a little longer,
but all of them say that it's

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:15.090
so worth it, because it causes
us to have less incarceration.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:18.420
It causes people to maybe
who have made a mistake

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:22.810
or who have gotten some
sort of fine, you know,

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:27.490
maybe they should have that they
can deal with it and not end

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:28.790
up with a criminal record.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:30.730
So I think that it's
really incumbent us

00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:32.410
to really find ways to do that.

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:34.850
And we have to find other
ways, because some of them are

00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.110
for people not appearing in court.

00:34:37.110 --> 00:34:41.220 position:56%
We also have to able to use
technology for people who are unable

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.480
to get to court to find a
means or maybe they could go

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:44.950
to the library and get in.

00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.250
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: They can.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.550
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: To use...

00:34:47.550 --> 00:34:48.850
[ Laughs ]

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:51.230
... to use the technology to
interface with the court system,

00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:53.230
so that they can state
with their cases

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:55.670
without physically
having to go there.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:58.260
So, you know, because
if you get a ticket,

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.560
you get your license suspended,
how are you going to get to court?

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:01.860
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Right.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:03.160
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: So
you can't get to court,

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:04.460
so then there's a bench
warrant for you.

00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:05.760
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Right.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:07.060
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: And it
just goes on and on and on.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.360
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: It's a cycle.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.660
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Exactly.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.960
You know, and the other
thing is that we have

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.260
to really look at the bail process.

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.860
You know, one of the things I
leaned through this process is

00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:19.070
that bail bonds people are
some of the biggest lobbyists.

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.370
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Oh.

00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:21.670
[laughs]

00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:22.970
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yeah.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:24.270
Neither did I.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.570
They're some of the biggest
lobbyists because, you know,

00:35:25.570 --> 00:35:26.870
when you postpone you
don't get your money back.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.170
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Right.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:29.470
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: And so they want

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:30.870
to have a continuous
robust bail system.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.010
because that is how they
survive and bail bondsmen

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:35.570
in several states they
are the biggest lobbyist.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:36.870
You know, we have to look

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:39.600
at privatization of
different things too.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:42.910 position:56%
You know, I did not know that in so
many places to wear the ankle braces

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:45.440
to get out on, you
have to pay for that.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:49.340
So some places as much as
$300 a month for the privilege

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.600
of wearing the ankle
bracelet and so forth.

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.330
So, and even sometimes probation
services are privatized now too.

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:59.370
So, you know, obviously it's
a benefit to have more people

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.350
on probation to stay on
probation, if its privatized.

00:36:02.350 --> 00:36:04.750
So, you know, there are so many
things, there's no shortage

00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:08.080
of what it is that we can
do, each one of us to help

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.380
to try to make things better.

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.680
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
Well, I think you said

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:13.580
in that wonderful presidential
page that you were concerned

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.510
that all these fees were really
just a revenue generator...

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:17.810
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:19.110
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.410
for the local jurisdiction...

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:21.710
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:23.010
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:24.310
or for others.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:25.610
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:26.910
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And they really
had lost their initial function...

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:28.210
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: That's right.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.510
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:30.810
in the law.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:32.110
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: That's right.

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:33.410
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And really
these sound like great ideas.

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:34.710 position:56%
Well, we're at a point where as much
as I hate to do it, I think I need

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.010
to turn the microphone
over to the audience.

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:37.310
[ Laughs ]

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:38.610
I'm so enjoying conversing with
you, but I know that others would

00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:39.910
like the privilege of
asking you a question,

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:41.210
and so I can't be that selfish.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.510
So we have staff members.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:43.810
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: You
can be, but you won't.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.110
[ Laughs ]

00:36:45.110 --> 00:36:46.410
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Thank you.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:47.710
I will not be.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.010
I will not be.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:50.310
So we have members of the
Law Library staff roving,

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.560
and if you'll just raise your hand,
they will bring a microphone to you

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:58.330
and I know that Paulette Brown
will answer your question

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.860 position:56%
on the spot with great articulation.

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.660
I've gotten such wonderful
tidbits from you today.

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.960
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Thank you.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.470
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Any question?

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:10.140
Cliff, right here.

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:16.690
&gt;&gt; Barbara Moreland: Hello,
my name is Barbara Moreland

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:20.640
and I must confess I'm one of the
people who knew not much at all

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:24.260
about our justice system
until several years ago.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:27.970
And Michelle Alexander,
very well educated me.

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:29.270
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.980
&gt;&gt; Barbara Moreland: But when I
saw the topic today it did bring

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.690
out some of the things I've learned

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:41.050
and perhaps I've only partially
learned, but Miranda even

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:46.830
when it's said, but how effective
is it with many of the community

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:52.700
in terms of actually making
their situation better?

00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:59.450
Do they get adequate help through
that process of being able to be

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:05.450 position:56%
in touch with the lawyer, because we
do hear so many people that confess

00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.990
to crimes that they
have not committed,

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:10.530
and something happens
in that process.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:18.200
And so how would you evaluate how
successfully Miranda is working

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:22.690
across these spectrums of
people, and especially the poor

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.020
and what might be done
to improve it?

00:38:26.020 --> 00:38:28.490
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: First of all,
I think that Miranda is necessary

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:31.710
because it does provide
some necessary protections

00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:34.810
that we will be much
more without it.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:38.680
But to your point there
are too many instances even

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.800
after the person has been
Mirandized, people who need

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:46.130 position:56%
to get back to work, people who
need to be back with their families,

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:49.600
people who want to be a witness
to their child's graduation.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.870
You know, even though they
have Mirandized you know,

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.940
they can be convinced into
pleading guilty that things

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:57.220
that they haven't done with
the notion that, you know,

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.420
you can have your time served.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:01.740
You can be out in time for
your daughter's graduation

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.860
if you plead guilty to this.

00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:09.660
And so you still have situations
like that and sometimes, you know,

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:14.420
the person who is encouraging
somebody to plead guilty, you know,

00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:15.820
maybe they are maybe they aren't.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.050
But, you know, there are other
things that come along with that,

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:20.800
you know, the collateral
consequences of pleading guilty

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.810
to things, you know, you're
giving up the right to vote later.

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:26.280
You may not be able to
get certain housing later.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.130
You know, you may not be able
to get a plumbing license,

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.190
electrician's license, it
can go on and on and on.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:33.130
In fact, there are about
46,000 collateral consequences

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:35.050
in the federal system.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:39.550
But, you know, what we can
do is that we can, you know,

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:44.140
when I tell people all the time
that it's so important to vote.

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:48.760
And that not just vote on
presidential elections,

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.250
but you have to vote on every
level from board of education

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.220
to town committee to everything,

00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:59.040
because it really all politics
really start off as local.

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:02.570
And there are so many
things that are affected

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:06.510
by those initial elections
that have a great impact

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:08.810
on everything else
that's done, you know,

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:10.680
in the municipalities
and all of that.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.210
And also to make sure you know who
the people who are representing you

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:16.950
that you don't wait
until there's something.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:20.670
Let people know who you are in
your community, so that when you go

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:23.180
to them you say this
is who I am I was here,

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.720
you know who I am and
I have this issue.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.690
So everybody should make themselves
have a voice in the process

00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:31.470
and there are a number of
different ways that you have it,

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:35.090 position:56%
but it's going to take an individual
and both collected efforts

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:39.030
to make any type of
sustaining change.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.330
&gt;&gt; Barbara Moreland: Thank you.

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.920
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: There's
another question here on this side.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:50.090
&gt;&gt; Woman: First, I really
enjoyed your comments and I grew

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:54.920
up in Baltimore much like you did
and I always want to help people,

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.470
much like you did, so I
became a psychiatrist.

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:01.640
But I went to law school for a year
before I went back to med school.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.760
So now I'm working in corrections

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:07.410
and what I'm seeing is the same
thing you've been talking about,

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:11.910
people that have pled guilty
when they haven't done anything.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:14.880
Then as they're getting ready to
be released, where they get a job?

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.180
How they're going to live?

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.960
How they're going to survive?

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:22.250
But even deeper problem, which
I don't know how to address,

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.960
but I just like to hear what
you have to say about it,

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:30.470
is in the inter city these
young people grow up.

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:36.340
I have a case where the father
has been in prison on and off,

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.960
because they were selling drugs.

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.160
The mother may have mental illness,
so we have people that are growing

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:45.030
up in cities that really
don't have parents.

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:48.040
And no one's doing
anything about it.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:52.310 position:56%
And so what I see is a prison system
all across the state of Maryland

00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:55.480
where people are just
funneled right into it.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:59.250
And they're generally black
people and Hispanic people.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:02.970
That's who are showing
up in my offices.

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:06.240
And lower income white people.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:13.550 position:56%
And I think that we are losing
generations of young, bright people,

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:16.300
because we don't intervene
early enough

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.360
at all the levels, economic...

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.660
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: That's right.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:20.960
&gt;&gt; Woman: :...

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.260
educational.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:24.180 position:56%
And I just like to see if you've
had any ideas about that in the time

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.960
that you've been taking
care of people too?

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.650
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Do I have ideas?

00:42:28.650 --> 00:42:30.080
How much more time is it?

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:32.150
[ Laughs ]

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:33.450
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer:
It's a quarter to.

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:34.750
We have about 15 minutes.

00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:36.920
You are the one who is
really scheduled today.

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.220
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Right.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.360
So because that's such a question.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.970
First of all, things
have to be looked

00:42:41.970 --> 00:42:44.500
at I think in a more holistic way.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:48.540
And we have to stop
treating poverty as a crime.

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:52.400
And we have to really look it
out implicit biases to figure

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.370
out why it is that only what such
a greater percentage of black

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:00.180
and brown people are going
to or being prosecuted.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:04.080
I think that prosecutors have so
much power in the justice system,

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.310
because they determine who is going

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:08.860
to be prosecuted and
with what charge.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:12.000
And so some people, even though
other crimes are being committed

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.820
by other people, some people are
given the benefit of the doubt.

00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:21.350
And whereas some may say this
is what we expect of this person

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:26.010
and so we're going to charge
him with as much as we can,

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:28.860
because it's expected that
this person should do this.

00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:32.470
The same judge they said that
they had two jurors who said

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:33.870
that they could not be fair

00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:38.530 position:56%
because they thought all black men
were criminals and committed crimes.

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:43.200 position:56%
And so they couldn't be fair, but we
have these notions a lot of it has

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.550
to do with what we see on TV
and just the constant images

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:50.280 position:56%
that are projected over and over and
over again telling us what's good

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:52.690
and what's bad and
what we should expect

00:43:52.690 --> 00:43:56.480
from one group of people
over another.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:59.920
And so I think that's part

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:03.380
of the reason why there's
so many more people.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:07.280
It's the same with school
suspensions, school expulsion.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.160
The whole thing it's
generally when brown

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.230
and black children are
suspended or expelled

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.530
from school it's something
that's discretionary,

00:44:14.530 --> 00:44:17.190
whereas if it's a white person
there's something that's really

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:20.450
like a clear violation, like having
drugs at school, for example.

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:24.850
And so I think that just the
greater education of individuals

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:28.550
to have them understand what
their implicit biases are,

00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:32.460
I think that everybody on this
earth should take the Implicit

00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:34.160
Association Test.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:38.480
To, you know, they have all types
of implicit association tests.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.780
You can find it on line.

00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:42.620
You can Google implicit
association test just

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:45.870
to see what your biases are.

00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:50.160
You know, I know my sister
years ago accused me of one.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.880
I denied it but then I found out
about - I mean for years and years

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.590
and years long before there was
any such thing as implicit bias.

00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:58.940
She was just saying,
"You're prejudice

00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:00.310
against this group of people."

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:04.620
And I found out that not
so much that I'm biased

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:08.010
against them, but I
slightly favor...

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:09.310
[ Laughs ]

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.610
... the other group.

00:45:10.610 --> 00:45:15.060 position:56%
But, you know, I think that a lot of
it, you know, the way people react

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:19.300
to things has so much to do
with what people have been told

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:24.320
and taught about a certain
group of people for so long.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.920
Without recognizing what
the true history is.

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.210
So I think that there's a lot
of education that has to be done

00:45:31.210 --> 00:45:32.510
and that needs to be done.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:36.170
I think that all of us need to
check and see who we are first,

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:40.690
and then I think that all of us has
an obligation to put other people

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:44.220
in check when we hear
things, when we see things.

00:45:44.220 --> 00:45:47.700
You don't necessarily have
to be really confrontational,

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.160
but you can ask them a question,
"Do you realize what you said?

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:54.030
Do you realize the impact
of what you're doing?

00:45:54.030 --> 00:45:58.770
Do you realize the effect that what
you're saying has on the person

00:45:58.770 --> 00:46:00.800
who is receiving the information?"

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.160
I think that all of us has an
obligation to point out things

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.980
to people when we see
or hear something.

00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:11.750
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Are
there any further questions?

00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:18.010 position:56%
Well I want to before we adjourn for
the afternoon, I want to just say

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:20.970
that this is not the
first and last time

00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:23.940
that the law library will
be commemorating Miranda.

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.240
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Good.

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.540
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: I don't
want to say celebrating.

00:46:26.540 --> 00:46:27.840
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Good.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.480
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: So I want to
put the following on your radar,

00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:32.800
we will have a program in
July at our Calpepper Campus,

00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.380
which Paulette, is where
we have our motion picture

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:39.740
and recorded sound preservation
in a former federal reserve vault.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:41.040
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Oh.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:45.330
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: And there we
will have experts talk about how TV

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:50.730
and movies in the last 50 years
or so have spread the word

00:46:50.730 --> 00:46:52.910
to the population about Miranda.

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:55.720
And basically I think it was
Justice Rehnquist who said

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.020
in the Dickinson case in...

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.320
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.620
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:00.920
2000 that Miranda was
virtually a part of our culture.

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:02.220
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Sure, yes.

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:04.480
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: So I hope
that you'll be able to participate

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.650 position:56%
in that program, either in
Calpepper, which is a gorgeous place

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:13.100
or virtually by streaming video.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:17.700
This year we will celebrate Human
Rights Day on December 9th and at

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:20.160
that time we will look
at how Miranda

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.600
in many ways has become
a human right.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:26.780
The Law Library of Congress
specializes in research

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:31.490 position:56%
about jurisdictions around the
world and a very quick survey showed

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:35.940
that many, many jurisdictions,
everything from Australia

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.460
to the Ukraine, I couldn't find
a Z country that had Miranda.

00:47:38.460 --> 00:47:40.910
[ Laughs ]

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:45.660
Have some version of Miranda
rights following our decision.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:49.320
And so it in a way we hope
gives the United States

00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:52.550
and our legal system some moral
authority around the world

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:54.970
and that always makes me happy.

00:47:54.970 --> 00:48:00.370
And then please always follow
us on Twitter and we know a lot

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:02.000
of people were tweeting today.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.650
If you are someone
who plans way ahead,

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:09.680
next year May 1st will be a Monday.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.670
This year it's a Sunday that's
why we're celebrating early.

00:48:12.670 --> 00:48:15.630
And we will have a
program on drawing justice

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:20.340
which will display the many, many
collections of court illustrators

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:24.140
that the library owns,
which is fascinating to see

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:28.170
and we will have court illustrators
on the panel for Law Day.

00:48:28.170 --> 00:48:30.470
But we also hope that
Linda will join us

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:33.740
and maybe make some
remarks and set a tradition.

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.040
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.030
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Of the ABA
president making an appearance

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:42.300
at the Library of Congress for this
very, very exiting day every year.

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:46.310
And last, but not least, or second
to last but not least, of course,

00:48:46.310 --> 00:48:47.620
join us for the reception.

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.280
I hope Paulette will
be able to stay...

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.580
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Yes.

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.880
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: ...

00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.180
for a very few minutes like
every president she is very

00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:54.480
tightly scheduled.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.780
[ Laughs ]

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:58.260
But we also continue to have our
Miranda display in the background

00:48:58.260 --> 00:49:01.940
and if you're killing just a
little bit of time this afternoon,

00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.450
last week we opened our
extraordinary Jacob Riis

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:07.040
Exhibition upstairs.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.890
Remember he was the author of
"How the Other Half Lives,"

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:16.450
and had a huge impact on
legal reform in the early part

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:20.800 position:56%
of the 20th century and we're hoping
that there are his successors.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:25.040
I think I'm looking at one for the
early part of the 21st century.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.630
Thank you so much for being
with us this afternoon

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.830 position:56%
for a truly remarkable conversation.

00:49:30.830 --> 00:49:32.130
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown: Thank you.

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:35.930
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Thank you.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:37.790
&gt;&gt; Paulette Brown:
Thank you so much.

00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:41.420
&gt;&gt; Roberta Shaffer: Thank
you, thank you, thank you.
