Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast and

Speaker 1:          00:00:09       ahhh

Speaker 1:          00:00:14       just checking in on you. I can't yell at, I am in New York City right now and I'm, it's late. I forgot, you know, today was Thursday and I had to do the Po, the podcast, so I apologize for it being late. I, um, I dunno. I, uh, I don't know. I wasn't thinking the fuck do you want from me? And all of a sudden I landed and I got a bunch of tweets from people going to it. I thought you were going to check in on me. I was like, God, I'm letting people down. I'm letting you down. So here I am. I'm checking into, so now you're gonna hear it on Friday. Let's see. Some lonely bastard on the west coast, you know, still up or some lonely lay. Um, anyways, so I just got here to New York because I'm doing Foxwoods this weekend. And, um, since I left New York, my neighborhood has become extremely gay.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       And I don't mean it in a way that all the gay people don't like. When you say that neighborhood's gay, like it stinks. I mean like literally gay. I mean, men are attracted to men. You know there's gay guys up and down this trip and over each other. And let me tell you thought. Nobody's complaining honey. Right? So here's the deal. When when gaze move into your neighborhood, there's three stereotypes that everybody says. You know, when gay people move into the neighborhood, this is, these are three things everybody says, right? They say, number one, all right, what are they saying? They say the neighborhood's going to become safer, right? Number two, they say property values that gotta to go up. And number three, they say there's going to be all these great new fucking restaurants and Holy Shit, the cuisines going to be fucking unbelievable. Thank God the gay showed up.

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       Now this neighborhood can fuck in, you know, live up to its potential. Well, they showed up. Definitely got safer. Definitely less shady. All right, so check on the first one. Stereotype number two. Uh, the fuck did I say it was still property value would go up? Yeah, it did. But I miss New York. It goes up everywhere, but you know what? You know what? It's election year. I don't want to derail the podcast campaign. I'll give you credit on that one. Gay People, it got safer and the property values went up. And then lastly, all this great cuisine was gonna come here. And you know what? It still hasn't shown up. The food in my neighborhood absolutely fucking sucks and I am so sick of it. Okay. The goddammit, I was told when these gay showed up that the fucking food was going to get better. And I think not only is it not gotten better, it's actually taken a nosedive. I just went out and got a Burrito. Right. What kind of asshole leaves Angeles and then tries to get a Burrito in New York. You're listening to them, this asshole. All right. The Brito was fine.

Speaker 2:          00:03:06       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:06       Yeah. Chicken Burrito, whatever. It's funny, you know, I looked at the menu was all this fucking shit. I just looked at the, the waiter, I felt like I disappointed them. I was like, can I just get some chips and with guacamole salsa and like just like a chicken burrito. And I just saw it in his eyes like, oh, you want white people Mexican food? And I was like, exactly. I am as white as it gets and I will have my Mexican food is white as I am, please. Right. Um, and before, you know, Mexican people write in and tell me that's not real Mexican food. I understand. I get it. All right, whatever. This is what the fuck I wanted. Here's my question. How do you have all these gay people walking up down the street and you can't even make decent guacamole? How the fuck does that happen? You know, who do I blame in this gay people slipping? Is it because these are the millennial gays and they're just Emoji in each other? You know, I don't know what's going on. Um, I'm blaming the gates. I'm blaming you guys on this one. Alright. Whatever pressure used to put on a fucking neighborhood, you're not doing it anymore. Or what? You decided not to do it in my neighborhood. I was so fucking, you know the anticipation.

Speaker 2:          00:04:21       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:22       Once you guys to send in on this one straight shady fucking neighborhood, you know, and the rainbow flags came out and all this shit. When the fuck is the food truck getting here? That's what I want. Enough fucking pizza sucks. The fucking guacamole sucks. The Middle Eastern food sucks the whole fuck it. They just sucks. Everything is just like, it's,

Speaker 1:          00:04:46       yeah. How much I drank when I'm in my neighborhood. It's just so the fucking food will tell. It's all like, just get shit faced and didn't make it fill up that hole in your stomach. I don't know. Maybe that's why I want all these gay guys who are in such great shape around here. They're cooking it on a fuck. Nah, that pisses me off. I just had a fucking God damn chicken Burrito and Guacamole this late at night. So at my age I, you know, I'll probably have a heart attack around eight 30 in the morning, you know? At least it could have tasted good. Right? Why is that fucking button on it now? It's off. I want, if you guys can hear this shit, f whatever the fuck you going to do. I don't know why the fuck I bring my mixer and all that stuff. God Damn and I'm in a grumpy mood and I was in such a great mood. There's nothing worse than when you're starving and you go out and you order a fucking meal, right in a neighborhood that's now a gay neighborhood and it sucks. I mean, I'm talking literally like the two dudes next to me at the end of their fucking meal, right? They fucking like kissed each other tenderly. Can I at least get some fucking decent guacamole? How much care is it going to be around here? It's only going at these burrito.

Speaker 1:          00:05:56       So I learned that stereotype is a, is not true. Just because they show up doesn't mean the chefs are going to start fucking throw in doubt that drop in the fucking ball. I'm not going to lie to you when the two went to kiss, okay, is as open minded as I am. I have to admit, I was wearing a baseball cap and I tilted it down so I didn't see their lips meet. You know, does that make me a bad person? If you're judging me, can I just tell you that one of them look like that, that fucking scrawny little dude that J-lo married. Just imagine that Guy Kissing Lenny Kravitz.

Speaker 1:          00:06:31       You know, forgive me, I didn't want to see it. You know, maybe that makes me a bad person, but whatever. I am a work in progress just like everybody else and I will have a decent bowl of fucking guacamole. You sons of bitches. All right, let's plow ahead here. So, um, I flew out this morning and I actually have this app on my phone where I can listen to the control tower and I'm just totally nerd now. You know, every time he had the tower talking about our plane of Sydney, he's talking about us. He just told us to go into this little fucking taxiway or whatever, you know? And, um, so I'm flying up front, right? Cause at this point I, I spent 20 years in the back of the plane. I'm not flying. I'm not fucking, I'm not doing that anymore. I'm done. I don't give a shit if I lose money on the gigs, I'm flying up front and for all you guys, for 20 years, I sat in the back of the plane looking what goes on on the other side of that curtain.

Speaker 1:          00:07:24       What happens up there? What is that like? You know what happens up there? People, spoiler alert. You know what happens? They treat you like a human being. I sweat. They do. They treat you the way they treat everybody in the commercials about their airline. Right? Everybody's smiling, having a good fucking time. You know, you got a seat that's actually comfortable. There's nobody leaning on you. Nobody breathing on you. You're hungry. They bring you food, you're thirsty, they bring you a drink. They treat you like a fucking person. It's posted in the back. Righteous jamming in there, stuffing in there. Right? So anyways, two I board first because you know I'm a fancy fucking guy, right? So I fucking I board, right? I can't say fancy guy. Jim Norton says that fancy man. I'm a, I don't know what I am the fucking jerk off, right. So I get on, I get on a plane, right? And I'm this fucking lady behind me. All right. The second she gets to a chair, she just starts yelling on sir, sir, stare.

Speaker 1:          00:08:33       You know, did she yelling at this foot that the fucking male stewardess and he turns around, he's like, Hey, what's the problem? And because there's something wrong with my chair that on, is this broken? Is it broken? Like freaking the fuck out. And the guy's like, no. The other person just, you know, whoever was sat in this on the last flight didn't bring in all the way to the upright position. Oh. Because I thought it was broken, you know? And right there I immediately just fucking hated this woman fucking, and she had this, the sniffles just kept sniffing and shit didn't give a fuck about anybody. And just, I swear to God, this shit that I thought about her because she sat up in the front of the plane, I immediately judged and that she was some rich company while I'm sitting up there. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:09:15       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:15       I don't know what she was thinking about me was Baldwin head. Fuck. You know, he used his miles to get up here. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:09:25       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       Anyways, thought Jesus, I'm, I can, I apologize early for the fucking horrible fucking mood I'm in right now. I was in such a great fucking mood, you know, and I was actually, you know, walking down the street here in Manhattan and just laughing, looking at these people, so excited that I left this fucking place. People in their 20s look, okay? All right. In Manhattan, they just got here. It's still exciting. Okay. But see this, this, this city beats the fuck out of you. All right? I've always said, you know, if you can do it, if you have a desire to do it, at some point you life, you gotta come here and live here just to do it. Cause it really is one of the most amazing cities you're ever gonna, uh, live in. But you know, what else is amazing about after you let you owe it to yourself, to Olivia, and you also owe it to yourself at some point to fucking leave.

Speaker 1:          00:10:13       I swear to God, Dude, the amount of people that you see walking down the street that looked like shut-ins, that finally just fucking came out of the Cave of a God damn apartment. Jesus Christ. I fucking walked into my building and this lady standing there, she looks like one of the patients on shutter island. Fucking dark circles under her eyes. Her hat yanked down like one of those people that's like ageless. It's like, are you 70 or 26 I don't even know what you just, your skin is gray, right? And she's with this older dude kind of look like me. To be honest with you, I'm a little chunkier, you know, probably a lot more jollier. He's probably not pitching about the Guacamole, right? And I'm fucking like, hey, excuse me. As I go, hey, how are you? Excuse me. As I got to walk by, and she does like this weird like [inaudible] to get out of the fucking way. Like, oh my God, another human big. And then as I go to walk away, she starts singing in this beautiful voice as she walked up. She is an amazing, beautiful fucking voice.

Speaker 2:          00:11:10       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:10       I said, so what? What happened to you?

Speaker 1:          00:11:13       Jesus fucking Christ. What's like the way she looked and then the sound that came out of it was like haunting. Then I felt like I was in one of those horror movies. You know that now I'm in and now I can't get out. You know what I mean? She's actually a vampire is gonna come by later to feed, you know? Then I become her boyfriend forever cause we're both vampires until she gets sick of me and finds up fucking, I don't know, a younger version of me. That doesn't happen. Right. The fucking red headed male is never a love interest. That doesn't happen in movies, you know? Do you hear us bitching about it or we boycott in anything? I don't think so. We just trudge on trying to stay out of the sun. That's what it feel like when it come to New York. Everybody here, did she just go, can you get some sun in your fucking face?

Speaker 1:          00:12:04       Something? What's that vitamin you get when the, when the sun shines on you? It's, it was fuck it. Things that everybody just says in a bar. Oh yeah, vitamin D, Sun's gone for your vitamin E, you know, not too much, but you know it's good for you. You know what they say? You know what they say? It raises your levels of, Oh, is that what they say? Say what they say. They're a guy with his fucking name on his shirt. What do you do? Well, what do you for you fucking on clog during the course of the day. What are you talking medical here for me? For me or to me? Why are you doing it? All right. You fucking plumber. I say that with extreme prejudice. You know, that's the one trade. I don't respect the plumbing. You know, cause I go to home depot and I swear to God, I can almost figure it out.

Speaker 1:          00:12:49       Electrical. That's like wizardry. You're a fucking wizard, right? Plumbing. [inaudible] I mean he just opened the door so everything's right there in the sink. You know, once it goes in the wall, then I give it to you. You know what I mean? Then you're a closer. All right? But if you just find a way to hit it with a wrench, he on Dick, shut off the main fucking water and yeah. Yeah. Fucking he, I don't know. Until you're young, screw it. Right. If you can, you can fucking open and close. Or You could take the lid off a jar if you can remember what the thing is that's on top of a jar. Right? You're smart enough to be a fucking plumber. I just don't respect that trait. You know? Look, they they, they really are. They're like welders or this shit electricians or the shit.

Speaker 1:          00:13:37       People get fabricate stuff. People who build hot rods, those, that's the upper echelon. Those are the one they have like the, I work with my hand awards, my hands, I should say. They're not jerking off. I worked with my hands when they have those awards. Right. They've got to have those at some point. The welders, right, or some shit, whatever the fuck it is. You know? Those are the people that bring home the fucking hardware. Nobody gives it to a plumber. Plumber. Yeah. Once you go on clog something, what trade did you really want to be good at? Huh? It's funny right now, there's a plumber out there that's actually getting upset by this and someone will present it on another website is if I was fucking serious. Hang on, I'm trying to get through my fucking password here. Plumber Jesus Christ. I mean, the whole fucking state.

Speaker 1:          00:14:29       It doesn't even sound perspectival does it? Um, oh my God, dude. The other night I fucking met law head for a drink. Okay. I was just like, dude, I am trying not to booze, but I, I gotta I gotta have a couple, two or three, right? So he goes, all right. He goes, you know, I'm doing a spot. I'll meet you over at this bar. So we go to the bar and sit in there with shooting the shit with have a great time. And uh, this the plumber thing, this is what reminded me. So this big guy comes in. By big, I mean fat, all right? Big Mother and hips to puts it on like Oprah thighs and ass. And then he also puts it on like a dude and he puts it on like a chick and a dude. This was just a fat man and you know, he, he was obese, but he wasn't even biggest loser fat.

Speaker 1:          00:15:11       He just was, he was just tall. He was a mountain of a fucking man. So he sits down at the bar store just off the off of the, you know, La head's right shoulder. It's a really not a well lit bar. And I'm just sitting there and I'm looking and he's got this weird design on his pants and I'm just like, what the fuck is that? That's weird. Is that a new style at genius on those big dazzled jeans that everybody was wearing like 10 15 years ago? It looked like he had a horseshoe on, on your pockets. You know, the big thing was to have the stitching like that. The blue jeans were blue and then you had the, it was all white. I never bought those. I'm so fucking glad I never bought those. There's not one picture of me in those. There's already pictures of me and Z. Cavariccis okay.

Speaker 1:          00:15:59       I don't need it. I don't need to, you know, jump on that trend either, you know? So, um, I'm sitting there going, what is that design? It looked like, like, like almost like he ordered custom pants and they just didn't put this design right and I looked a little closer, my eyes adjusted and I realized it was his hairy ass crack. I couldn't fucking believe it. This guy sat down, he was so big, dude, I am telling you there was the top of his ass crack. He was so fat. It was like twice the size of my whole ass crack. That's why I didn't take it was that, and it was fucking Harry, I apologize for putting this image in you, but it was hairy so it looked like it was a design and it, I just can't fucking in Lawhead what was caught my eyes when I realized what I was looking at and he was like, dude, what the fuck?

Speaker 1:          00:16:54       And when I told him what had just happened, I don't think I've ever made law laugh like that. He was fucking howling in this bar to the point. I think even the guy looked over at us. Oh my God. Well I kept saying that. I said that you could measure I was going to do it. How can that be? How could they be more ass crack like this weird like when you lose weight you like if you become a fat fuck you have a giant, so you have this, I never thought about this. You have this giant fucking ass crack. So when you lose the weight, like the crack goes away too, right. That doesn't seem, money doesn't make sense to me. Cause it seems like it's a hole in your body kind of. You know, I don't, I don't know where I was trying to figure it out and I was, I was riffing about this dog discussing this was a the fuck did I say?

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       I was saying, you remember that home run Mark McGuire hitting the kingdom off to Randy Johnson, I would say. And you could measure that home run with the amount of ass crack this guy had coming out of the top of his pants. And that was just his, that was just as plumber crack. Oh, Jesus Christ. What a fucking image they'd gone air already ate before I did this. Huh? Um, all right, let's, uh, I, Oh God, I wish I had video of my, you know, they always do those reaction videos that just fucking see, like you must have done that before, right. You know, when you look and say, Oh, what is that? And then you realize you don't know. I don't know, pretty much gross things in your head. Oh God, I've got another disgusting story. I should I do it at this point. If he get grossed out easily.

Um, I was living, I had roommates, I was living in this place and uh, I got up early and I went into the bathroom and take a shower and I looked down and what looked to be a brown wash cloth, you know, that was all twisted up. Uh, the bottom of the shower. I think, you know, what's his going, I reached down to pick it up and if somebody had, one of my roommates had shit in the shower,

Speaker 1:          00:25:01       I never got over that. I woke them all up. They were all awoken by who? Shit in the shower. And they were laughing because I'd have think laughing because it was hilarious. And then also I started laughing because it'd be literation later. I did, but like, I literally could not eat with that hand for like fucking a month and thinking now I actually, I don't remember what she had. It was, I mean, it's fucking disgusting. It's the processing. That's the study. It's funny. Is it, do you know what, if you laugh at that right now, you're a sick fuck. Um, and who am I if I told you about it? Right? So anyways, I was on the plane and, um, I started watch this space movie and um, you know, it's just another one of those space movies where it's just like, you know, everybody dies or people leave.

Speaker 1:          00:25:51       There's always just like the one person left out in space, how are they going to survive? And I started to watch it. It's like I already saw this fucking movie two years ago. Sandra Bullock did this movie, right? She could go, I left alone when Richard Gere fucking floated off into sweat. I would, his fucking guy's name is the guy with the motorcycles, right. Married the lady, finally guy from oceans 11th one of those guys. He has so much charisma. All he has to do is just say the fucking line. You know, he doesn't have to throw in its dirty mustard on it. That guy, George Clooney, George Clooney, he just says the fucking line and yet believe him. Right? Fucking guys fearless. You'd see him in that movie. He didn't give a fuck. Yeah, I'm just going to float out into space. He's still cracking jokes and shit. Just going to go over here and suffocate. Take it easy sandy. Right. That's it man. That's all man goes out. I bet once she floated out of her fucking ear shot, he started crying.

Speaker 2:          00:26:53       Woo.

Speaker 1:          00:26:55       I just sit there fucking floating around. Um, you gotta love Scifi. You know I gotta love cy Fi. You know, I said I hate watching real shit about space cause all they do is just tell you how infinite it is and how insignificant we are. It's like I get it. I got it. Do you have anything else? Have you filed one fucking living thing out there. You have it. So there's really nothing to report other than it's so fucking immense and we still don't have the technology to meet anybody. That's why you, if you really want to see something about space, you got to watch his psi movie, you know, say what you want a bottom at least a fine shit. You know there's car chases and people, you know, hot chick aliens, right? Space bars and stuff like that. You plucking put on of Bravo shows with that black guy there who fucking knows everything.

Speaker 1:          00:27:54       What's his name? He's like, he's like the guy from the matrix. Laurence Fishburne, except for just Fishburne. Fishburn whatever. He's like that guy, except he's real. The Lawrence is real. I'm talking about his character. I fucking watched that guy. I've watched that guy like three times and I, I just was, he had me believing that we came from the trees. I'm like, this guy is. Yeah, we, and I was like, I thought we came from the ocean of mud. I was going with that and this guy's like, no, we're from the trees. We got the same fucking, I don't know what he said, but I mean there was nothing between my ears that could argue with anything that he said. You just have to fucking listen to it. I remember just sitting there watching the guy just going like, this has gotta be what it's like when you join a cult. Like how dumb I feel right now. That's what you have to do. Like I was reading this, this fucking thing. Who's kidding who? I was browsing it. I don't really read anything.

Speaker 1:          00:28:49       We saw this picture and I just put words to it in my brain and now I'm telling it to you. There's some fucking guy I know. He had like 80 wives, one of those fucking Weirdos out in fucking Utah. You know what I mean? I, I'll either that or he's just like, how can rappers don't talk about those guys? They're always talking about fucking pimps. How can a guy, that's key. The guy's got 80 fucking women. They all know about each other and they're all smiling in the fucking picture. Huh? I want to see somebody else pull that off and not live in the middle of fucking Utah. I don't know what the fuck it is about Utah, but you could talk a woman into anything out there. You're the a one for me. Hi. Yeah, you are no 79 other bitches. Okay, but go make me some butter bitch. Um, this guy's in prison and he's still running that. This harem.

Speaker 2:          00:29:48       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:29:48       They don't know any better. You know when you're walking around with a little house in the prairie clothes, I mean, you can fucking tell people anything. That's the key. You know what I mean? They feel like if you want to start a cult, it's very difficult to start it with people that have gone to a department store and bought their clothes, you know? But if you, if there's a group of people that are standing there and clothes that they made themselves, you get, that's where you start. You know what I mean? It's like when you've got a shit team, all right? And you got the number one draft, pick the t, the guy, the person you're going to build your fucking team around. That franchise player. When it comes to cult, those still the franchise tag is on all those people with those little house in the prairie clothes, those Quaker clothes, right? The QC.

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:30:35       You know, you ever think about start? I'd started cult. I would do it, you know, I would definitely start it fucking called, but then I, after a while I wouldn't want to do the work and I would just, I'd Sorta, I'd start like a, what do you call that? When you fucking don't want to do your job and you have other people do delegating. I'd start delegating all the fucking things and then granted, one point some people going to be like, whoa, hey shea was [inaudible] how come he's not doing anything? I don't remember reading anything about Jesus being being lazy. Let he just sits around and fucks everybody.

Speaker 3:          00:31:08       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:31:12       I'm going to check it as man shit. Maybe I'm Jesus. Right? And then he takes over. Then all of a sudden they all show up one day. You know, is there anything scarier than angry, stupid people standing in close that they made themselves? Just picture what that would look like. You know the amount of Mano Browse staring back at you and you just have to relinquish your power and just at some point ease your way out the back door and let them know that you're not the son of God. There's a fucking afternoon for you, Huh? Jesus Christ. How many dead bolts would you have on your bedroom door? I'm speaking of which, by the way, I got all the fucking interior door locks fixed on my house. They all have fucking skeleton keys. And then I found this fucking person on the Internet on the interweb as Richard Rollins says, from fast and loud.

Speaker 1:          00:32:04       Uh, another great show. Um, I got some of that's gonna line it up with the door jam. You know the little fucking latch thing, Dan. And I'm going to be good to go. It's going to be, fuck. I can't wait. Very excited about that. And speaking of great shows, I'm finally caught up with better call Saul. I feel like such a, not only a bad fan considering, you know, Vince hooked me up to be in, I'll have a small part in breaking bad. I should've been watching right along. But what happened was those of you who listened to the podcast last year, I fucking was taping the thing. For some reason I didn't get episode three and then I suck computers and the Internet. I couldn't figure out where else I could watch it. So I've been stuck on episode two. So finally they came on Netflix right before season two started and I just binge watched the entire first season and it was fucking unbelievable.

Speaker 1:          00:32:55       Whose fucking amazing starts. It just, it's, I don't want to ruin anything for you, but I gotta tell you something like a, the level of acting that everybody's doing, but like Bob old Kirk man, you know, it's very rare that someone is, is as great a comic as he is, is equally as great a fucking actor. He was, I want you guys to watch it just cause you got to see, he has this blow out fight. I can't ruin this for you with a relative. Any now you just say mean shit to each other. His brother says something to him. I've been thinking about that line for like the last five fucking days. It was just, I dunno, it's one of those lines.

Speaker 4:          00:33:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:33:40       That in real life usually gets set around the holidays after you've been sitting on something for 20 fucking years, and when it comes out, it's needle off the fucking record and the relationship is over. It's just like, yeah, dude, I'll see you when you're on your deathbed or I'm on my deathbed, or maybe never again. I mean, it's, it's a fucking rap. It's over. Um, oh man. The writing was just, it was just fucking outstanding and I'm can't say enough good things about it and I am totally caught up and, uh, I can't wait for next week's fucking episode. There you go. There's my little plug there for better call Saul. Um, and with that, that's it for this, uh, checking in on your podcast. Once again, I apologize for a few, you know, for not doing the podcast on t t on timely fashion, a timely fashion over the fuck you said.

Speaker 1:          00:34:33       I realized that I brought up that app. Sorry about the shit in the shower story. The ass crack one was funny. I don't give a fuck who you are by the way. That app is three 99 that I, if you want to listen to the towers anywhere where you're at, it's called live t c. Dot. Net app. Just do that ATC air traffic control. Um, and it's really cool. Like I just thought you could listen to the towers and near you but you can actually, um, I was at lax today and I was listening to uh, Logan Airport in Boston and it's really cool cause you, you, you're basically like, I'll click on California. They got Burbank, Cambra, Rio Concorde, any place in El Monte, any place you want to go to. And when you click on it as I'm doing right now, okay, this one has ground and tower and then you click on that.

Speaker 1:          00:35:25       Um, and then there's, what's really cool is they have like a diagram of the airport. So like you can actually, you know, I like to listen to it when, whatever, whatever airport I'm at, as we're taxing out to the, um, to whatever the fucking runway, Jesus Christ bells, you know, you'd think you'd know that, um, go out to the runway. I just like listening to it and it's fucking coolest shit. And I'm, you know, watching the, um, Jason Spill all the taxiways going by, sorry, I'm trying to multitask here. Answering a text message on, I apologize. Let me just put the fucking phone, don't see that, see that, pick it up. And all of a sudden I thumb just starts clicking on other stuff. I'm gonna Start fucking looking at Twitter and when I'm trying to do a podcast here anyway, she get the whole layout of the airport and as you go on down, he could tell what taxiway you're on. And then, uh,

Speaker 5:          00:36:21       hey, last way, right? So Charlie,

Speaker 1:          00:36:24       there you go. See that? You just listened to that shit. So that guy just obviously was cleared to land and that was the runway. And he said his tail number, that's it. So I just listened to that shit because a, that's one of the hard things when you first get a pilot's license, when you get up there, it all just sounds like, hey, I want to join a damn way. I'm gonna [inaudible] they don't even have southern accents, but that's what the fuck it sounds like to me. Um, you know what's funny is when this shit happens, when I, uh, when I'm just like walking around, like I'll accidentally set a pocket dialing, I'll hit this fucking app. And uh, if you're in the mob, do not get this fucking app because they'll think it's a bunch of fucking feds in a, in a van down the street. You know, if you fucking sitting there in a mob meeting and all of a sudden you got this fucking thing going and you're talking about some bullshit and out of nowhere this thing comes on. Come on. Just do it one time. One more time for me. Come on. This is Lex.

Speaker 1:          00:37:26       Oh, it's a quiet night out there.

Speaker 5:          00:37:29       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:37:29       You know what I mean? All of a sudden you just hear some fucking guys voice in there talking some official

Speaker 5:          00:37:33       seven 51 cross from way too far left. [inaudible] ground.

Speaker 1:          00:37:36       Hey, what a fuck out there. Fucking next. You know that the, I can get tongue through your throat. Um, all right, sorry. That was a long way to go. Why, where to go? Who uses a prop and a podcast? All freckles does. Hey, go fuck yourselves. You can't. So I hope you have a great weekend and a, his little music from Andrew, Sam Willis, a little throwback podcast from a Monday or Thursday gone by

Speaker 5:          00:38:32       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:38:34       you know, a few weeks ago somebody was asking me, you know, they wanted to break up with somebody and I was saying, listen, you gotta listen. You know, the person who has it down how to do the breakup was minivan men podcast, own celebrity star Al Madrigal. But if you don't have time to email Al Madrigal just listened to ll cool j a big old, but I don't know why. I never really listened to him when I was growing up. You know, Mama said knock you out. Did she? Is that what she said? Ll Cool J I don't care. You know, I just wasn't into witness deodorant in his armpits when he was jamming with those white guys. I just, I never got into it. But lately, lately, I dunno. I don't know what happened. I G's just come onto my youtube shit. I don't know what it is, but I was listening to some of his stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:39:32       Oh, I know why. Yesterday I was trying to remember like, what was that song he used to have that I'm the type of guy and you're the type of guy you put that, what the fuck was that? And then I listened to it and I kind of liked it, but I hated that. Oh, we, oh, part of it really annoyed me. I'm like, oh, that's why I never downloaded this shit. But then on the side they had a ll cool j big old, but you know, I played drums at Michael. Let me hear what this tracks. I was like, can I put it on? And he basically teaches you how to break up with a girl and that song or that rap or that, uh, that rhyme, whatever, however you supposed to say it. He breaks it down and just in like fucking 11 seconds, he sits his girls down.

Speaker 1:          00:40:17       He's basically hanging out and like some sunglass hut or some shit and some girl comes in with an insane ass and he does whatever he guy does. He stares out and he thinks, I want to fuck that. But Oh shit. I have a girlfriend. So what does he do? Does he sneak around on her? No, he goes home and he sits her down. He says, listen, I met this girl named Tina. Okay. Teen has got a big old, but I know that I said I'd be true. I'm really whiten this up. But Tina got a big old butt, so I'm leaving you. It's, I mean, that's just fucking air tight. He can't fuck with that. He was 100% I don't know. She could get mad. I think that's that. I think women's show expect guys to be lying weasely pieces of shit that if you actually hit them with that level of honesty, I think they would just be stunned. Just like the chicken, the video. Like I didn't think that that was bad acting. I think that they would absolutely be stunned if you just came home and said, listen, I met this girl. I know that I said I'd be faithful to you, but she's better looking than you. So I'm up with you.

Speaker 1:          00:41:38       Well, what is the combat? There's nothing. There'll be like if your girl came home and said, listen, I know we're together, but this guy, you know, I met him at the mall, his Dick is twice the size of yours and he's got a better car. So it's kind of a no brainer. Amati what are you going to do? What are you going to do with your little dick and your fucking Domino's pizza? It's over. You just gotta fucking be like, you know, you only go around once. So, uh, yeah, I, I, I get it. So anyway, so if you don't have time to email Al Madrigal, which you should, which you should, uh, just listen to a ll cool j big old bud.

Speaker 1:          00:42:25       You got to see his face. He goes, so I'm leaving you. It's, it's, I don't, can't explain it. It's way meaner than it has to be. That's what it makes it funny. Cause there's a way to read that where you're kind of letting them down easily, you know, but he didn't, he just did it like, yeah, this is how it works. So they would go look at that on a holiday. Um, anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast. It is the end of May. Everybody. All right, how many days are in May? 30 days had September sodas, April and November. All the rest have a bunch of other dates except for statuary. Go Fuck yourself with your song. Um, she got 30 31 fuck, what is it? April has 30. June has 30 maze. 31 well, what do I got? The little thing I can click right here. I'll have a computer. I don't need to think right. It has. Why is it in September? Oh, for Christ sake, do I have to click another button? It has 31 days.

Speaker 1:          00:43:36       All right, so you had till have you guys have until Thursday midnight to make something of May, 2012 all right. Are you on a fucking relationship? You don't want to be in? Do you want to be in this relationship? You don't want to be in in June? Why don't you celebrate the end of May by getting out of your fucking relationship and sitting down and basically just go with the ll cool j vibe, hold her hand and just go straight honesty and then what she going to do? Well, what is he going to do if they're going to flip the fuck out, but the die has been cast to ship his set sail. The ball is already rolling. The Sun is setting, the rain is fallen. Whatever the fuck you want to call it, it's out there. Just put it out there. Let them scream and yell and in your head, as much as he sucks, you're going to be like, okay, I did it. I did it. Now I've just got to sit here and get yelled at and uh, how long did somebody really yell before they lose their voice? An hour. 90 minutes and an hour and a half. I'm going to be in the car listening to ll cool j driving away from that thing I didn't want to be in. All right. And I know I talk about this shit a lot, but I think a lot of people are in situations like this. They don't know how to sit somebody down. It just say, so I'm leaving you.

Speaker 1:          00:45:04       You know, if I was ll cool J and I stop, you know, selling tickets and all that type of shit, that would be a side business that I would have. I would take that little fucking rhyme that he had and I would custom do it for everybody in their life and just make people who just write you all right, I need to charge it. You charge him a hundred bucks and he would write you a, you know, four bars. It all rhymes and you just get out exactly what you're saying. You know, just be like you eat with your mouth open. I know I said that I'd be true, but you eat with your mouth open so I'm leaving. You just get right. You just get right down to it. Your mom is a fucking con. I know I said that I be true, but she's fucking always coming over here and some the runs with coffee. You know I ain't got the, you got the idea right? Jesus Christ. What do I have to be yellow?

Speaker 5:          00:46:38       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:46:38       let's get back into this mark from a doesn't a furious. Yeah, I guess so. All right.

Like lots of Ford from the fans and shit. So I mean we're like, oh, that's cool. All right. You have the other drama, right? Yes sir.
