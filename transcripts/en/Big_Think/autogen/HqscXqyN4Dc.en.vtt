fascinating questions but they don't

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
fascinating questions but they don't
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.920
fascinating questions but they don't
realize that they are the questions that

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930
realize that they are the questions that
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.510
realize that they are the questions that
scientists ask and so I would like to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
scientists ask and so I would like to
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.490
scientists ask and so I would like to
base a curriculum more on questions and

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
base a curriculum more on questions and
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.709
base a curriculum more on questions and
answers because the process of asking

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719
answers because the process of asking
 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.510
answers because the process of asking
the questions and figuring out how to

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520
the questions and figuring out how to
 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.279
the questions and figuring out how to
address them is what science is all

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289
address them is what science is all
 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.869
address them is what science is all
about the answers are not important

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879
about the answers are not important
 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.000
about the answers are not important
because most kids won't necessarily

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
because most kids won't necessarily
 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.979
because most kids won't necessarily
become scientists but the tools of

be great to develop a curriculum where

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
be great to develop a curriculum where
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.570
be great to develop a curriculum where
we base it on the very questions that

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
we base it on the very questions that
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.340
we base it on the very questions that

do is you have to go out to where they
 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.550

means recognizing that science is
 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.030
means recognizing that science is
actually relevant to the things that

fascinated by now the problem with this

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079
fascinated by now the problem with this
 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.619
fascinated by now the problem with this
of course is that if teachers are going

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
of course is that if teachers are going
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.360
of course is that if teachers are going
to teach it they have to be comfortable

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
to teach it they have to be comfortable

to be able to go off in in different
directions and one of the big problems

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060
directions and one of the big problems
 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.330
directions and one of the big problems
is our teachers aren't trained in

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340
is our teachers aren't trained in

school science teachers don't have a

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700
school science teachers don't have a
 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.430
school science teachers don't have a
training in science beyond the high

school level now if you're not

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810
school level now if you're not
 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.150
school level now if you're not
comfortable with the material what

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160
comfortable with the material what
 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.370
comfortable with the material what
you'll inevitably do is teach to the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380
you'll inevitably do is teach to the
 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.250
you'll inevitably do is teach to the
curriculum you'll you'll you'll feel

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260
curriculum you'll you'll you'll feel
 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.630

comfortable with the answers that are in

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
comfortable with the answers that are in
 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.940
comfortable with the answers that are in
the book and you'll teach to that so we

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950
the book and you'll teach to that so we
 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.860
the book and you'll teach to that so we
need to real problem of course is we

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870
need to real problem of course is we
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.210
need to real problem of course is we
need to do a better job of training

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220
need to do a better job of training
 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.110
need to do a better job of training
teachers so they can feel comfortable to

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120
teachers so they can feel comfortable to
 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.500
teachers so they can feel comfortable to
go off in different directions if

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510
go off in different directions if
 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.090
go off in different directions if
they'll express a level of discomfort

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100
they'll express a level of discomfort
 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.890
they'll express a level of discomfort
that comes down to the students I

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900
that comes down to the students I
 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.560
that comes down to the students I
remember when my daughter was just in

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570
remember when my daughter was just in
 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.360
remember when my daughter was just in
grade 2 I went into her class and I saw

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370
grade 2 I went into her class and I saw
 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.160
grade 2 I went into her class and I saw
their teacher you know there they were

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170
their teacher you know there they were
 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.720
their teacher you know there they were
they were learning that it's like during

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730
they were learning that it's like during
 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.250
they were learning that it's like during
the day and dark at night trivial little

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
the day and dark at night trivial little
 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.930
the day and dark at night trivial little
little bits of information about the

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940
little bits of information about the
 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.250
little bits of information about the
universe but the teacher was clearly

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260
universe but the teacher was clearly
 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.620
universe but the teacher was clearly
uncomfortable with it and I was sure

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630
uncomfortable with it and I was sure
 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.000
uncomfortable with it and I was sure
that level of discomfort was coming

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010
that level of discomfort was coming
 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.620
that level of discomfort was coming
through the students so we have to do a

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630
through the students so we have to do a
 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.120
through the students so we have to do a
much better job of training teachers

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130
much better job of training teachers
 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.060
much better job of training teachers
that means we have to build a better

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070
that means we have to build a better
 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.370
that means we have to build a better
curriculum which of course requires more

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380
curriculum which of course requires more
 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.160
curriculum which of course requires more
emphasis and at the university level and

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170
emphasis and at the university level and
 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.550
emphasis and at the university level and
the realization that when we're teaching

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560
the realization that when we're teaching
 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.260

students were not trying to make clones

of ourselves when we teach physics we

tend to think that the students that the

down inclined planes I don't give a damn

down inclined planes I don't give a damn
 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.490
down inclined planes I don't give a damn
about that I want students to realize

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500
about that I want students to realize

about that I want students to realize
the process of how to do it because most

physicists and it doesn't matter it's

physicists and it doesn't matter it's

physicists and it doesn't matter it's
that process that will be useful to them

that process that will be useful to them
 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.840
that process that will be useful to them
later in life now if we are going to

later in life now if we are going to
 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.580

spend more time and effort training

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590
spend more time and effort training
 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.580

teachers then in some sense we have to

teachers then in some sense we have to
 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.160

have to consider the competitive

would if you were a teacher so I think

we have to consider paying in order to

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900
we have to consider paying in order to
 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.320
we have to consider paying in order to
recruit better teachers who have a

many teachers unions would be vastly

many teachers unions would be vastly

many teachers unions would be vastly
opposed to that but I think we at least

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520
opposed to that but I think we at least
 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.580
opposed to that but I think we at least
have to consider that possibility if we

have to consider that possibility if we
