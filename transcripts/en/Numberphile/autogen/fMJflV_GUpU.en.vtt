00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.880
everyone knows about the Fibonacci

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890
everyone knows about the Fibonacci
 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.829
everyone knows about the Fibonacci
numbers 1:1 and then I add those two

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839
numbers 1:1 and then I add those two
 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.379
numbers 1:1 and then I add those two
together to get to them 3 5 8 what would

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389
together to get to them 3 5 8 what would
 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.070
together to get to them 3 5 8 what would
happen if instead I start with three

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
happen if instead I start with three
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.630
happen if instead I start with three
numbers and now I'm going to add all

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640
numbers and now I'm going to add all
 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.000
numbers and now I'm going to add all
three together so that gives me three

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010
three together so that gives me three
 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.880
three together so that gives me three
and I'm now going to add these three

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
and I'm now going to add these three
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.029
and I'm now going to add these three
together that's gonna give me five and

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039
together that's gonna give me five and
 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.670
together that's gonna give me five and
then these three together that's going

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680
then these three together that's going
 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.240
then these three together that's going
to give me nine and then I'm gonna get

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
to give me nine and then I'm gonna get
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.180
to give me nine and then I'm gonna get
nine five and three 17 and we're gonna

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
nine five and three 17 and we're gonna
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.299
nine five and three 17 and we're gonna
get a different sequence of numbers oh

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
get a different sequence of numbers oh
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.860
get a different sequence of numbers oh
it's a bit like the Fibonacci but it's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
it's a bit like the Fibonacci but it's
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.220
it's a bit like the Fibonacci but it's
got three instead of two so it's called

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230
got three instead of two so it's called
 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.860
got three instead of two so it's called
the Trib inochi numbers let's call this

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
the Trib inochi numbers let's call this
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.790
the Trib inochi numbers let's call this
and and so this is that ribbon Archie TN

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
and and so this is that ribbon Archie TN
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.180
and and so this is that ribbon Archie TN
and you have that F n 1 divided by F n

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
and you have that F n 1 divided by F n
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.100
and you have that F n 1 divided by F n
goes to the golden ratio so we can also

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
goes to the golden ratio so we can also
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.710
goes to the golden ratio so we can also
do the same thing with the Trib annachi

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720
do the same thing with the Trib annachi
 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.100
do the same thing with the Trib annachi
numbers but they go to what's called at

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
numbers but they go to what's called at
 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.130
numbers but they go to what's called at
ribbon achi constant with the Fibonacci

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
ribbon achi constant with the Fibonacci
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.590
ribbon achi constant with the Fibonacci
numbers one of the ways we can sort of

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
numbers one of the ways we can sort of
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.880
numbers one of the ways we can sort of
think about what how they're going to

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
think about what how they're going to
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.429
think about what how they're going to
end up is say well let's start this one

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439
end up is say well let's start this one
 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.700
end up is say well let's start this one
X x squared + x squared was equal to the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710
X x squared + x squared was equal to the
 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.609
X x squared + x squared was equal to the
two previous ones together so here this

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619
two previous ones together so here this
 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.950
two previous ones together so here this
is x squared is equal to X plus 1 here

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
is x squared is equal to X plus 1 here
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.440
is x squared is equal to X plus 1 here
we're adding the three previous terms so

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
we're adding the three previous terms so
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.060
we're adding the three previous terms so
we get 1x x squared this term is going

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070
we get 1x x squared this term is going
 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.550
we get 1x x squared this term is going
to be the sum of all three so it's X

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
to be the sum of all three so it's X
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.539
to be the sum of all three so it's X
cubed and now we have X cubed is equal

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
cubed and now we have X cubed is equal
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.149
cubed and now we have X cubed is equal
to x squared plus X plus one and so

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159
to x squared plus X plus one and so
 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.850
to x squared plus X plus one and so
that's a polynomial whilst I can

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860
that's a polynomial whilst I can
 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.490
that's a polynomial whilst I can
reasonably well solve quadratics cubics

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
reasonably well solve quadratics cubics
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.039
reasonably well solve quadratics cubics
have a far more messy to solve so I'm

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
have a far more messy to solve so I'm
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.649
have a far more messy to solve so I'm
going to get a calculator to do that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659
going to get a calculator to do that
 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.900
going to get a calculator to do that
so this gives us one point eight three

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910
so this gives us one point eight three
 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.259
so this gives us one point eight three
nine two nine and that's gonna trip an

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269
nine two nine and that's gonna trip an
 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.210
nine two nine and that's gonna trip an
Archie constant tripping Archie constant

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220
Archie constant tripping Archie constant
 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.650
Archie constant tripping Archie constant
I'm assuming there's a four Bonacci

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660
I'm assuming there's a four Bonacci
 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.420
I'm assuming there's a four Bonacci
constant and a fire Bonacci they're

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430
constant and a fire Bonacci they're
 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.420
constant and a fire Bonacci they're
called the n Bonacci z' and so here I've

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
called the n Bonacci z' and so here I've
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.990
called the n Bonacci z' and so here I've
got an interesting shape it's got a a

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000
got an interesting shape it's got a a
 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.690
got an interesting shape it's got a a
fractal boundary going around it well

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700
fractal boundary going around it well
 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.670
fractal boundary going around it well
it's got a nice property to it so I've

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
it's got a nice property to it so I've
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.910
it's got a nice property to it so I've
got this style here and this is the same

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920
got this style here and this is the same
 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.370
got this style here and this is the same
shape but a little bit smaller and then

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380
shape but a little bit smaller and then
 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.910
shape but a little bit smaller and then
I've got again the same shape but

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920
I've got again the same shape but
 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.449
I've got again the same shape but
smaller the edges of these I can find it

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
smaller the edges of these I can find it
 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.180
smaller the edges of these I can find it
I have to get them the right way up and

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190
I have to get them the right way up and
 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.550
I have to get them the right way up and
there we go so the edges are such so

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560
there we go so the edges are such so
 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.890
there we go so the edges are such so
this shape at different sizes actually

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900
this shape at different sizes actually
 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.050
this shape at different sizes actually
fits onto itself and that means that

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060
fits onto itself and that means that
 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.490
fits onto itself and that means that
these edges might must either be

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
these edges might must either be
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.050
these edges might must either be
straight lines which they're clearly not

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060
straight lines which they're clearly not
 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.319
straight lines which they're clearly not
or fractal it's not a fractal itself but

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329
or fractal it's not a fractal itself but
 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.789
or fractal it's not a fractal itself but
the boundary is a fractal

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799
the boundary is a fractal
 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.750
the boundary is a fractal
so now I will take a third shape and put

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760
so now I will take a third shape and put
 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.559
so now I will take a third shape and put
them there and magically I have my same

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569
them there and magically I have my same
 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.400
them there and magically I have my same
shape these are three sizes of this one

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410
shape these are three sizes of this one
 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.440
shape these are three sizes of this one
shape and when I put those three

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450
shape and when I put those three
 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.270
shape and when I put those three
together I get the same okay if this one

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280
together I get the same okay if this one
 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.349
together I get the same okay if this one
scales up to this one this one scales up

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359
scales up to this one this one scales up
 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.910
scales up to this one this one scales up
to this one and then this one scales up

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920
to this one and then this one scales up
 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.470
to this one and then this one scales up
to the whole thing I can take this one

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480
to the whole thing I can take this one
 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.569
to the whole thing I can take this one
step further so what I've done here is

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579
step further so what I've done here is
 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.199
step further so what I've done here is
make a larger version of this object so

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209
make a larger version of this object so
 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.650
make a larger version of this object so
this piece here becomes this tile here

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660
this piece here becomes this tile here
 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.949
this piece here becomes this tile here
this piece here becomes this tile here

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959
this piece here becomes this tile here
 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.449
this piece here becomes this tile here
and then this tile here is replaced by

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459
and then this tile here is replaced by
 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.400
and then this tile here is replaced by
the whole piece here it's the the three

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410
the whole piece here it's the the three
 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.199
the whole piece here it's the the three
tiles if I rotate this there you see

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209
tiles if I rotate this there you see
 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.960
tiles if I rotate this there you see
that this is just these three titles so

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970
that this is just these three titles so
 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.180
that this is just these three titles so
now we could imagine doing this another

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190
now we could imagine doing this another
 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.400
now we could imagine doing this another
time and another time we can get larger

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410
time and another time we can get larger
 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.949
time and another time we can get larger
and larger regions we could ask what how

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959
and larger regions we could ask what how
 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.410
and larger regions we could ask what how
many tiles am I going to have in them

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420
many tiles am I going to have in them
 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.699
many tiles am I going to have in them
well this pattern is made up of one of

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709
well this pattern is made up of one of
 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.170
well this pattern is made up of one of
the smallest tiles one of the medium

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180
the smallest tiles one of the medium
 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.680
the smallest tiles one of the medium
tiles and one of the large tiles this is

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690
tiles and one of the large tiles this is
 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.150
tiles and one of the large tiles this is
made up of

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160
made up of
 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.110
made up of
one medium one large and then one of the

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120
one medium one large and then one of the
 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.750
one medium one large and then one of the
scale size beyond large which itself is

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760
scale size beyond large which itself is
 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.150
scale size beyond large which itself is
made up of one small one medium and one

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160
made up of one small one medium and one
 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.310
made up of one small one medium and one
large and when I go into the next step

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320
large and when I go into the next step
 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.060
large and when I go into the next step
up I'm gonna have one copy of this one

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070
up I'm gonna have one copy of this one
 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.580
up I'm gonna have one copy of this one
copy of this and then one additional so

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590
copy of this and then one additional so
 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.070
copy of this and then one additional so
at each stage I'm going to take the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080
at each stage I'm going to take the
 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.700
at each stage I'm going to take the
three previous pieces put them together

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710
three previous pieces put them together
 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.300
three previous pieces put them together
to get the next one up and so what are

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310
to get the next one up and so what are
 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.610
to get the next one up and so what are
we going to have well it's back over

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620
we going to have well it's back over
 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.630
we going to have well it's back over
here I have my 1 1 1 I put those

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640
here I have my 1 1 1 I put those
 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.520
here I have my 1 1 1 I put those
together so I get 3 1 1 and 3 gives me

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530
together so I get 3 1 1 and 3 gives me
 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:03.340
together so I get 3 1 1 and 3 gives me
my 5 the next one up is going to be my 5

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350
my 5 the next one up is going to be my 5
 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.280
my 5 the next one up is going to be my 5
my 3 and my 1 which is going to give me

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290
my 3 and my 1 which is going to give me
 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.220
my 3 and my 1 which is going to give me
9 and so on like that so this shape is

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230
9 and so on like that so this shape is
 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.170
9 and so on like that so this shape is
called the Rousey fractal and it was

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180
called the Rousey fractal and it was
 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.720
called the Rousey fractal and it was
found by Gerald Rousey the interest is

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730
found by Gerald Rousey the interest is
 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.580
found by Gerald Rousey the interest is
sort of studying how matrices act on

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590
sort of studying how matrices act on

lot of nice theory for how for certain

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710
lot of nice theory for how for certain
 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.840

matrix which has one expansion and one
 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.200
matrix which has one expansion and one
contraction what that will do is you

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210
contraction what that will do is you
 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.000
contraction what that will do is you
have up these things called eigenvectors

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010
have up these things called eigenvectors
 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.070
have up these things called eigenvectors
and you pull down in one direction and

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080
and you pull down in one direction and
 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.050
and you pull down in one direction and
you expand so that everything gets

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060
you expand so that everything gets
 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.000
you expand so that everything gets
squashed down and pulled up there's a

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.010
squashed down and pulled up there's a
 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.190
squashed down and pulled up there's a
whole theory in that called markov

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200
whole theory in that called markov
 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.250

partitions which have basically have

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260
partitions which have basically have
 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.290

and smeared out you can turn that into a

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260
and smeared out you can turn that into a
 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.140
and smeared out you can turn that into a
nice periodic product and what rousey

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150
nice periodic product and what rousey
 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.450

asks well what about for the the cubic

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460
asks well what about for the the cubic
 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.260
asks well what about for the the cubic
case when we're dealing with

case when we're dealing with
 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.990
case when we're dealing with
three-dimensional space so the specific

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000
three-dimensional space so the specific
 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.380

of its eigenvalues this number the Trib
 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.080
of its eigenvalues this number the Trib
inari constant and so because the Trib

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090
inari constant and so because the Trib
 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.690
