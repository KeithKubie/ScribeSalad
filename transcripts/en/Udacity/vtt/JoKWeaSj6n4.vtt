00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The question now is what's causing this unknown force,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
which I've labeled with a question mark subscript.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We know that this force is being caused by gravity and the mutual attraction of all objects,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so gravity is pulling this down, but I don't know what's causing this.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Is the cause of this unknown force some sort of antigravity

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
or is it a gravitational attraction to something above the ball?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Maybe Galileo's hand or something out in space.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Or is the ground somehow pushing upwards on the ball

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Choose what you think is the best answer.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And, again, don't worry if you get this one wrong. This is to get you thinking.
