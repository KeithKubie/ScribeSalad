1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's continue our discussion
of specialized defenses
where a long history of

2
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:10,001
selection has caused natural selection
to shape a particular response to a

3
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:12,830
particular environmental insult.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,570
The inflammatory response is activated
both by infection and by injury.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,120
There are specialized cells in the immune
system that coordinate inflammation

6
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,070
and inflammation maintains both
tissue integrity and homeostasis.

7
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:33,821
Those cells,

8
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:37,900
the macrophages and the mass cells detect
the noxious stimuli and they produced

9
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:42,180
inflammatory mediators, which
are cytokines, chemokine,

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:47,590
biogenic amines,
leukotrienes and prostaglandins.

11
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,890
So there is a mix of chemicals that
are secreted and act is signals to

12
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:55,900
coordinate this response.

13
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,680
The C fiber nociceptors,

14
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:04,681
the pain receptors produce neuropeptides
to elicit a local inflammatory response

15
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:11,110
to tissue injury and at the
expense of normal functions.

16
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:16,500
These mediators act on the target tissues
inducing changes that defend against

17
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:18,220
the noxious stimulus.

18
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,080
The inflammatory mediators produce
proteins that are involved in defense,

19
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,430
in blood clotting,

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,760
tissue repair that suppress proteins
that are involved in normal homeostasis.

21
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,870
And that changed the homeostatic set
points for body temperature and for

22
00:01:37,871 --> 00:01:38,704
appetite.

23
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,540
Yeah,

24
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,770
these symptoms of sickness
then result fever,

25
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:49,810
anorexia, fatigue, social
withdrawal, sleepiness,

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,700
and decreased sex drive.

27
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,870
So the inflammatory response coordinates
a defense reaction across a series of

28
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:03,781
levels from inside sales to communicating
between cells to whole organism

29
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:05,014
behavior.

30
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,020
Yeah,

31
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,000
inflammation is quite costly.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,420
There are many changes induced by acute
inflammation that are the opposite of

33
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:18,300
the fight or flight response,
but some of them overlap.

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,490
Inflammatory mediators suppress growth
and reproduction and the override homo

35
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:29,160
homeostatic controls, so that allocation
goes towards survival functions.

36
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,810
Inflammation is a high benefit trait
that permits high costs in trade offs and

37
00:02:38,221 --> 00:02:39,120
vulnerabilities.

38
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,940
Acute inflammation can result
in collateral damage and
even an organ failure at

39
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:47,900
the extreme.

40
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,560
This dysregulated acute inflammation
can be deadly as for example,

41
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:57,710
in septic shock, which results
from infections in the blood.

42
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,320
Dysregulated inflammation can also lead
to diseases of homeostasis that are

43
00:03:04,321 --> 00:03:08,490
often elicited by mismatch
such as type two diabetes.

44
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,010
Allergic defenses are
another specialized defense.

45
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,470
They operate in barrier tissues of the
upper respiratory, gastrointestinal,

46
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,940
and urogenital tract.

47
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,580
They respond to noxious substances
such as venoms and irritants.

48
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,880
The main defenses expel the substances
and reinforced the barriers.

49
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,050
So there's mucus production,
runny nose, airway obstruction.

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,210
I have a bit of that right now.

51
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,540
Bronco constriction to prevent
further exposure, sneezing,

52
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,220
coughing, vomiting and diarrhea to get
the noxious substances out of the body.

53
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,940
Itching to remove
substances from the skin.

54
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,790
Yeah,

55
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:01,790
so these defenses have high costs and
produce significant discomfort and that

56
00:04:02,731 --> 00:04:06,690
discomfort protects by
inducing behavioral avoidance.

57
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,990
The discomfort teaches us
to avoid these situations,

58
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,870
runny nose and vomiting,

59
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,440
both ways of getting noxious
substances out of the body.

60
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,230
The detoxification response,

61
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,610
a specialized defense is used when we've
been exposed to toxic environmental

62
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:34,021
chemicals and they elicit a different
kind of protective response.

63
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,900
This response is based on metabolic
modification and excretion of noxious

64
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:45,901
chemicals and much of it is mediated
by two gene families that you are now

65
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:50,190
already familiar with.
Those that are coding for NSF,

66
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,200
he'll transfer races and ATS and
Cytochrome p four 50s see why peas?

67
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,620
This is an ancient defense system system.

68
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,710
It protects from the harmful
effect of reactive chemicals.

69
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,960
It presumably evolve to defend us against
phytochemicals which plants use to

70
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:10,240
defend themselves against herbivores

71
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,030
and the modern world.

72
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:17,080
This is the system that
provides protection from
industrial pollutants and from

73
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:18,700
toxic drug metabolites.

74
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:20,870
Yeah.

75
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,870
Define detoxification of metabolic
byproducts is conceptually distinct from

76
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:29,270
defense against environmental insults,

77
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,410
but the two are making this
Stickley and evolutionarily related.

78
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,460
Essentially an ancient system used to
defend us against nasty substances made by

79
00:05:39,561 --> 00:05:42,200
plants,
is used in the modern world,

80
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,270
both to defend us against industrial
pollutants and other environmental insults

81
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,310
and also the process drugs.

82
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,123
Yeah.

83
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,200
The innate immune response to infection
is our first line of defense against

84
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:58,034
pathogens.

85
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:04,940
It is defending us against microbial
infections and detects infection by

86
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:10,401
recognizing conserved microbial
products such as lipopolysaccharides and

87
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:16,761
peptidoglycan hands that are unique
and that are essential to microbes.

88
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,520
So these molecules are a signal that a
microbe is present and they are not made

89
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,710
by cells in our body.

90
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,590
They can therefore be discriminated from
self and they ensure that pathogens do

91
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,930
not evolve.
Escape units,

92
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,070
which would be crippled by the
laws of essential molecules.

93
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,760
So the innate immune system is looking
for things that are unique to microbial

94
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:48,450
pathogens and that microbial
pathogens cannot do without.

95
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:50,650
Yeah.

96
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:54,970
It can also detect infection indirectly
by sensing the activities of virulence

97
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:57,400
factors,
toxins and allergens.

98
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:03,640
Innate immune recognition
rapidly activates the
inflammatory response signaled

99
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:08,641
here by conjunctivitis in of patient's
eye and other antimicrobial mechanisms

100
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,140
including Phagocytosis,
the compliment system,

101
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:18,480
a system of proteins that coats,
uh,

102
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:23,290
pathogens and aids immune cells
in recognizing and digesting them,

103
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:28,060
natural killer cells and
anti bacterial defense.

104
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:33,130
So the antibacterial defensins are
proteins that are secreted and the innate

105
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,240
immune response also has
natural killer cells,

106
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:42,241
which are a part of the immune system
that is not triggered by the adaptive

107
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:47,080
immune response. These are all things
that can be ramped up fairly quickly.

108
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,910
The innate immune system determines
the origin of an antigen. That is,

109
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:58,350
whether it is a virus and extra
or intracellular bacterium,

110
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,710
or you carry out like a
fungus or something like
malaria or the sleepy sickness

111
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:12,291
pathogen or a worm and it produces a
corresponding signal so it identifies the

112
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:20,640
kind of pathogen and signals then
the adaptive immune system system.

113
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:26,100
That's why it is essential for activating
the adaptive immune responses because

114
00:08:26,101 --> 00:08:29,370
those immune responses differ
with the type of pathogen.

115
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,010
The adaptive immune system is
mediated by T and B lymphocytes.

116
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,700
T means that they've
matured in the thymus.

117
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,950
B means they matured in the bone marrow.

118
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:42,850
Okay.

119
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:47,850
And the adaptive immune response is
an extremely powerful defense system.

120
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,680
It uses antigen receptors,

121
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:55,740
antibodies that are generated at random
by somatic recombination gene and random

122
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,530
pairing of receptor subunits.

123
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,160
So these different genetic mechanisms
take the genetic heterogeneity,

124
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,330
which is stored in families
of these genes in our,

125
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,660
in our genome and recombine them and
associate them with particular clones of t

126
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:18,240
and B cells.

127
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:24,290
It's capable of making millions of
antigen receptors and one of them will be

128
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,840
able to recognize any attitude

129
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,470
lymphocytes with antigen
receptors specific for
microbial antigens are selected

130
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:36,270
them to proliferate.

131
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,540
This is the clonal selection process,

132
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,340
generating clones of effective
of effector memory cells.

133
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,860
So this is a way of ramping up a very
specific response by growing a huge

134
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:51,180
population of cells,

135
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,400
all of which are devoted
to one particular antigen,

136
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,370
which is associated with
a particular pathogen.

137
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,360
Because the antigen
receptors are made at random,

138
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,140
they cannot determine the
origin of the antigens,

139
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,470
whether that's self tissue,
microbial pathogen,

140
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,200
or some innocuous environmental antigen.

141
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,920
They must therefore be kept from
reacting inappropriately to self and to

142
00:10:18,991 --> 00:10:22,380
harmless environmental antigens.
So it's a very powerful system,

143
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:25,320
but it contains a
vulnerability because of it.

144
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:28,260
It reacts with inappropriate tissue.

145
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,140
It can cause autoimmune pathologies.

146
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,910
This is the structure of an antibody.

147
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:39,540
It is a y shaped molecule
protein molecule.

148
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,090
It has a fairly cause.

149
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,590
It has a constant region with a heavy
chain and a constant region and the light

150
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:51,591
chain and the action is going on out
here at the tips where you have the

151
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:56,841
variable region of the light chain and
the variable region of the heavy chain.

152
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,260
And these are the segments which exist
are being produced by genes that are

153
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:10,131
highly polymorphic and they can be
recombined to generate particular binding

154
00:11:11,161 --> 00:11:13,680
regions that will recognize
particular antigens.

155
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,190
Now one of the powerful features of
the adaptive immune response is that it

156
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:27,720
creates a memory so that
after an initial exposure,

157
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,720
the host can then be protected
from subsequent effects,

158
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:35,900
infections coming from the same pathogen
and that allows subsequent responses to

159
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:42,440
ramp up more quickly.
And this is the basis of vaccinations.

160
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:47,470
So vaccination induces the production of
a clone of cells that will be ready to

161
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:54,880
react the next time the organism
sees that particular antigen.

162
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,940
Vaccines Mimic infections and they produce
then this immunological memory that

163
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:01,774
will protect.

164
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,833
Okay.

165
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,240
The defenses are modifications
of processes that operate
normally in the absence

166
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:16,130
of a stressor might seem less
obvious for immune defense,

167
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:19,430
the detoxification
response and tissue repair.

168
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,620
But in all of these cases,

169
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,890
there is a non defensive counterpart.

170
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,240
The immune system manages the Microbiota
and it manages tissue homeostasis.

171
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:33,993
Okay.

172
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,490
There is metabolic regulation for
the diff detoxification system,

173
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,750
and in the case of tissue repair,
there was tissue renewal.

174
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,330
So in all of these cases,

175
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,400
the defense system is evolutionarily
derived from a part of normal physiology.

176
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,210
Yeah.

177
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:57,210
The exaggeration of each type of defense
produces a characteristic associated

178
00:12:58,661 --> 00:12:59,170
disease.
