00:00:06.407 --> 00:00:10.697
A garrulous grandmother and a roaming 
bandit face off on a dirt road.

00:00:10.697 --> 00:00:14.798
A Bible salesman lures a one-legged 
philosopher into a barn.

00:00:14.798 --> 00:00:20.281
A traveling handyman teaches a deaf woman 
her first word on an old plantation.

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:22.473
From her farm in rural Georgia,

00:00:22.473 --> 00:00:24.673
surrounded by a flock of pet birds,

00:00:24.673 --> 00:00:27.533
Flannery O’Connor scribbled tales 
of outcasts,

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:31.803
intruders and misfits staged in 
the world she knew best:

00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:33.642
the American South.

00:00:33.642 --> 00:00:35.262
She published two novels,

00:00:35.262 --> 00:00:37.982
but is perhaps best known 
for her short stories,

00:00:37.982 --> 00:00:42.562
which explored small-town life 
with stinging language, offbeat humor,

00:00:42.562 --> 00:00:45.548
and delightfully unsavory scenarios.

00:00:45.548 --> 00:00:48.458
In her spare time O’Connor drew cartoons,

00:00:48.458 --> 00:00:51.168
and her writing is also 
brimming with caricature.

00:00:51.168 --> 00:00:56.828
In her stories, a mother has a face 
“as broad and innocent as a cabbage,”

00:00:56.828 --> 00:01:00.337
a man has as much drive as a “floor mop,”

00:01:00.337 --> 00:01:04.447
and one woman’s body 
is shaped like “a funeral urn.”

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:07.007
The names of her characters 
are equally sly.

00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:10.137
Take the story “The Life You 
Save May be Your Own,”

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:13.427
where the one-handed drifter Tom Shiftlet 
wanders into the lives

00:01:13.427 --> 00:01:15.767
of an old woman named Lucynell Crater

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:17.647
and her deaf and mute daughter.

00:01:17.647 --> 00:01:19.707
Though Mrs. Crater is self-assured,

00:01:19.707 --> 00:01:22.327
her isolated home is falling apart.

00:01:22.327 --> 00:01:25.227
At first, we may be suspicious 
of Shiftlet’s motives

00:01:25.227 --> 00:01:27.257
when he offers to help around the house,

00:01:27.257 --> 00:01:29.697
but O’Connor soon reveals 
the old woman to be

00:01:29.697 --> 00:01:32.567
just as scheming as her unexpected guest–

00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:36.137
and rattles the reader’s presumptions 
about who has the upper hand.

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:38.847
For O’Connor, no subject was off limits.

00:01:38.847 --> 00:01:40.497
Though she was a devout Catholic,

00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:42.807
she wasn’t afraid to explore 
the possibility

00:01:42.807 --> 00:01:45.137
of pious thought and unpious behavior

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:47.157
co-existing in the same person.

00:01:47.157 --> 00:01:49.597
In her novel The Violent Bear it Away,

00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:53.117
the main character grapples with the 
choice to become a man of God –

00:01:53.117 --> 00:01:55.797
but also sets fires and commits murder.

00:01:55.797 --> 00:02:00.267
The book opens with the reluctant prophet
in a particularly compromising position:

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:04.327
“Francis Marion Tarwater’s uncle had been 
dead for only half a day

00:02:04.327 --> 00:02:07.588
when the boy got too drunk 
to finish digging his grave.”

00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:11.308
This leaves a passerby to “drag the body 
from the breakfast table

00:02:11.308 --> 00:02:13.308
where it was still sitting and bury it […]

00:02:13.308 --> 00:02:17.158
with enough dirt on top to keep 
the dogs from digging it up.”

00:02:17.158 --> 00:02:19.178
Though her own politics are still debated,

00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:23.238
O’Connor’s fiction could also be attuned
to the racism of the South.

00:02:23.238 --> 00:02:25.788
In “Everything that Rises Must Converge,”

00:02:25.788 --> 00:02:28.738
she depicts a son raging 
at his mother’s bigotry.

00:02:28.738 --> 00:02:31.548
But the story reveals that 
he has his own blind spots

00:02:31.548 --> 00:02:33.918
and suggests that simply recognizing evil

00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:36.637
doesn’t exempt his character 
from scrutiny.

00:02:36.637 --> 00:02:40.057
Even as O’Connor probes the most 
unsavory aspects of humanity,

00:02:40.057 --> 00:02:42.917
she leaves the door to redemption 
open a crack.

00:02:42.917 --> 00:02:45.117
In “A Good Man is Hard to Find,”

00:02:45.117 --> 00:02:49.117
she redeems an insufferable grandmother 
for forgiving a hardened criminal,

00:02:49.117 --> 00:02:51.707
even as he closes in on her family.

00:02:51.707 --> 00:02:54.987
Though we might balk at the price the 
woman pays for this redemption,

00:02:54.987 --> 00:02:57.127
we’re forced to confront the nuance
in moments

00:02:57.127 --> 00:03:00.647
we might otherwise consider 
purely violent or evil.

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.691
O’Connor’s mastery of the grotesque

00:03:02.691 --> 00:03:06.581
and her explorations of the insularity and
superstition of the South

00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:09.641
led her to be classified as 
a Southern Gothic writer.

00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:11.976
But her work pushed beyond 
the purely ridiculous

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:14.956
and frightening characteristics 
associated with the genre

00:03:14.956 --> 00:03:18.546
to reveal the variety and nuance 
of human character.

00:03:18.546 --> 00:03:20.926
She knew some of this variety 
was uncomfortable,

00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:23.316
and that her stories could be 
an acquired taste –

00:03:23.316 --> 00:03:26.536
but she took pleasure 
in challenging her readers.

00:03:26.536 --> 00:03:29.356
O’Connor died of lupus at the age of 39,

00:03:29.356 --> 00:03:33.786
after the disease had mostly confined her 
to her farm in Georgia for twelve years.

00:03:33.786 --> 00:03:34.906
During those years,

00:03:34.906 --> 00:03:37.766
she penned much of her most 
imaginative work.

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:40.706
Her ability to flit between 
revulsion and revelation

00:03:40.706 --> 00:03:44.916
continues to draw readers to her endlessly
surprising fictional worlds.

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:47.180
As her character Tom Shiftlet notes,

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.580
the body is “like a house:

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.890
it don’t go anywhere,

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.780
but the spirit, lady, 
is like an automobile:

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.800
always on the move.”
