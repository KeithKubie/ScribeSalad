00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.070
Okay, so the staging area with Git, it's really helpful and really powerful.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.340
I think I try to use it in a way where I've just only written the things that I

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.120
actually want to commit and all I have to do is stage them and commit it.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.830
But in practice, things get a little messier than that.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.682
So, I think the common pattern for me is I do one thing and

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:19.509
then in the process, I accidentally do something else, and then I'll use

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.124
the staging area to help me just stage the first thing and commit that.

00:00:23.124 --> 00:00:25.210
And then if I'm ready to commit the second thing, I can.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.766
If I'm not, I can keep working on it.

00:00:26.766 --> 00:00:29.753
But it's just a really helpful tool to make sure that your commits are only

00:00:29.753 --> 00:00:32.980
the thing that you actually meant to commit even though probably along the way,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.700
you did a lot of other things.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.040
So for my own projects, I probably won't have that many branches.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.220
If, if it's simple enough, I'll even just have one.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.290
The main thing that I'll just be doing is committing as often as I possibly can.

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.860
I'll try and just whenever I think that I've accomplished anything that I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.380
can call a commit, that I can call a single unit of work, I'll just commit that.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.270
And it does lead to having probably a lot more commits than you'll ultimately

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.470
need to look back at, but at the same time, there's going to be a handful of

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.170
them that you really want because you want to undo that one thing or

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.810
you want to just see why you did that one thing.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.850
And it's just really, really valuable to, for those commits to be able to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.760
have them and not have them jumbled up with other things.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.470
So, committing really, really often is the most important thing for me.
