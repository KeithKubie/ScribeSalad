Congratulations. You've almost made it to the very end of lesson

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.610
four, and you know that that means you get a chance to

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.620
fill out the concept map with the blanks in it, with

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.730
words from the word bank here. Hopefully if you've been paying attention

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.660
throughout the lesson, this should be pretty straightforward. If you have

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.570
your own copy that's been filled in with the right answers already,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.910
just from your great note taking. If not, still take a

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.800
stab at this, Use one word from the word bank, or one

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.580
word or phrase to fill in each box here as

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.270
it's empty. And then when you're done just click submit.
