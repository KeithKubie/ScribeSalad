00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.883
It's important that the HTML and CSS that you write is correct and

00:00:03.883 --> 00:00:05.820
complies with standards.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.020
If it's incorrect it might display okay in one browser,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.100
which correctly guesses your intention, but incorrectly in another which makes

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.510
a different assumption, and there are also icons you can show on your web page.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.440
So that others know that your page complies with the standards.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.460
We've provided links where you can verify your HTML and

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.920
CSS code in the instructor note section below.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.760
Go ahead and do this now for your HTML page and

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.500
explore the error that it returns.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.950
The error is somewhat cryptic, so

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.000
if you can't figure out what it means, don't worry.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.200
Just see the answer video for an explanation.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.230
In exploring the error,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.160
you'll notice that there's something missing from the page.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400
What element is missing something?

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.480
Let me know which element is missing something.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.900
Now, you just have to enter the tag here.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.400
For example, html or div.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.459
Then let me know was your CSS correct?

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:06.080
Just answer yes or no
