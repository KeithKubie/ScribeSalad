PAUL SAXMAN: Hello, and welcome
to this week's episode

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.860
of Google Maps Garage.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.050
I'm Paul Saxman.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.050
And with me is Mano Marks.

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.710
And this week we're going to
talk about advanced map

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.440
markers using the Google
Maps utility library.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.550
So Mano, you're probably a
little more familiar with the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.290
Google Maps utility
library than I am.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.960
Do you want to give
a little review.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.350
MANO MARKS: Sure.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.520
So the Google Maps utility
library started--

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.060
well, we actually had
one for Maps API V2.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.730
And we now have migrated a lot
of this functionality to V3.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.600
And basically the idea is
similar to a lot of other

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.930
APIs, where they have what are
called plug-ins, we released

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.230
utility libraries that work with
the API to add additional

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.030
functionality.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.470
And one of the reasons we do it
this way instead of putting

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.110
them into the main API is
because we do them in a fairly

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.610
specific way.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.100
But we want to allow people
through the open source

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.560
library to modify the behaviors
of each of the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.250
individual libraries.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.990
So in these cases, since they
were all open source, you can

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.800
then go in and actually pull out
the source and change it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.640
to behaving the way
that you want.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.080
So for instance, I'm going to
talk about marker cluster.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.030
And there are different
clustering algorithms

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.500
that one can use.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.730
In this way you can then
modify the clustering

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.680
algorithm to suit
your own needs.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.090
PAUL SAXMAN: And not only can
you actually pull the code out

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.920
and modify it for
your own needs.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.912
But then you can
also contribute

00:02:43.912 --> 00:02:47.540
it back to the project.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.140
We do have some guidelines I
think for contributing back to

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.605
the project.

00:02:50.605 --> 00:02:50.990
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.650
PAUL SAXMAN: I think probably
code styling.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.030
But yeah, if you have any ideas
or code, I think it

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.250
would be a great thing for
us in the community.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.800
MANO MARKS: It's all hosted on
Google Code, code.google.com.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.150
And we will provide a
link to that in the

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.410
description of the video.

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.730
And it's also linked off the
documentation under More

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.748
Resources for the
JavaScripts API.

00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:23.800
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, and I
personally never remember.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.520
So I always just
search for it.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.580
MANO MARKS: Yeah, if you search
for Google Maps API,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.960
you totally get library
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.390
You'll find it.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.980
PAUL SAXMAN: Yep,
so first hit.

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.880
I just searched on Google
Maps utility library.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.600
It's actually in Google
code hosting.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.400
So the source repository
I think is

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.672
subversion if I'm not mistaken.

00:03:47.672 --> 00:03:48.060
Yeah.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.480
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.250
And if you click on the
wiki, it actually

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.100
has pages that describe.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.110
So there's one for libraries
that gives you the quick link

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:00.110
to each of the libraries
that are there.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.270
We're not going to
have time to go

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.210
through each of the libraries.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.890
But we're going to concentrate
on some that are specific to

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.400
markers and the ones that we
feel are the most broadly

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.060
applicable to what
you guys need.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.430
PAUL SAXMAN: Yeah, and if we
were to take a look at the

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.959
screen here-- so the Google
Maps utility library V3.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.120
The V3 is because it's for the
JS library version three.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.950
Lots of stuff in here
like Mano said--

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.680
I mean, Key, Drag, Zoom, Info
Box, MarkerClusterer.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.460
Actually you're going
to talk about

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.096
MarkerClustererPlus, I think.

00:04:36.096 --> 00:04:37.280
MANO MARKS: No, I'm just going
to talk to the basic

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.950
MarkerClusterer.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:43.130
But MarkerClustererPlus simply
adds a few additional options,

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:43.700
which I won't get to.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.440
PAUL SAXMAN: Cool, and I'm
going to talk about the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.090
StyledMarker and RichMarker.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.400
Because they're two ways you can
pretty easily get to kind

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.592
of nice effects or nice styles
for your markers besides just

00:04:54.592 --> 00:04:55.842
the kind of standard push pin.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.370
And I definitely recommend if
you haven't used the utility

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.610
library, just kind of come
here or check out

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.830
the wiki on the front.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.980
And kind of browse through and
see some of the others.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.600
Not all these were
developed by us.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.900
So as I said, this is an
open source project.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.880
A lot of these are submitted
by the community members.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.830
So try to provide attribution
for those.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.200
Because I think the first one
I'm going to start out with is

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.930
StyledMarker That was actually
contributed by--

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.000
if we go back to the code--

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.760
Gabriel Schneider.

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.040
It looks like Gabriel committed
this around 2010.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:40.320
And so the StyledMarker library
is actually a really,

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:49.160
really simple way to get custom
marker styles in the

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.360
form of either markers, your
classic markers, which is the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.360
kind of the inverted tear
drop or bubbles.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.820
And the way the library does
this is it actually uses

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.290
another Google API, the
Charts API, to render

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.060
these on the screen.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.080
So you can see here if we go
back to the screen, I have

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.790
five different types
of markers on here.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:13.420
And these all use the library
for generating these.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.670
So this is just a form of a
bubble with some custom text.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.260
These are actually just
variations of

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.640
the standard marker.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.070
A nice thing about this
library-- can provide your own

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:28.190
text, not only the bubble but
also into the markers.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.430
And I believe with the markers
themselves, you can actually

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.050
provide up to two characters.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.840
So if you have a lot of data and
you want to go from A to Z

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.910
back to AA to AB, something
like that, you can do it.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.200
Or for example--

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.290
MANO MARKS: Haxcode
your markers.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.130
PAUL SAXMAN: There we
go, even better.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.830
Another thing you can do-- you
can obviously just get rid of

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.700
all the information and just
do the standard marker.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.270
And there's a little
feature in there.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.630
You can actually add this little
star, which is kind of

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.030
cute I think, a nice way to
kind of highlight some

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:01.310
information.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.210
Another interesting thing
about this too is that--

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.450
so the style of marker
class in JavaScript--

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.990
it actually inherits from
the marker class.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.930
So things like dragability,
flat, whether or not you want

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.630
to render a shadow or not,
that's all built in.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.920
You just modify those parameters
the exact same way

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.340
you would if you were dealing
with a standard marker.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.620
So this is really kind of
like a marker plus.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.335
And I'll show you real quick how
that looks like in code.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.680
So you can see what I've done
is that you have to actually

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.770
download and import
this library.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.820
An alternative to that is that
you probably link to it

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:45.040
directly from our code site.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.690
So just rely on the fact that
that code is there.

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:54.320
The only question about that
would be as if you're linking

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.970
directly from code site if the
library changes in some way.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.050
Or if you want to modify the
library, you're probably going

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.810
to want to keep a local copy.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.110
But kind of as I said before,
if we take a look here-- so

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.100
the style marker.

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.800
You're actually creating these
the exact same way

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.610
you create a marker.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:13.900
You're passing in a
position in a map.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.800
You can also pass in the
additional information like

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.790
dragability or whether or not
you want a shadow rendered, or

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:21.900
if you want to change
the anchoring.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.940
Well the difference with the
style of marker is you're

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.080
passing in a style icon.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.300
The style icon is
just actually a

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.140
pretty simple class.

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:30.670
It takes a type of marker.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.789
So this is either going to
be a bubble or a marker.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.980
So by marker I mean the
inverted tear drop.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:40.929
And the bubble is actually kind
of the comic style, kind

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.440
of a thought bubble.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:46.710
And then you actually provide
some style properties.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.640
And there's, I believe, in the
bubble there's I think just

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.830
three different style
properties.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:55.700
You can either do the color,
the text, and the star.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:03.050
And then other way around.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:03.410
I'm sorry.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:07.780
So with the marker, you can
do color text and star.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.800
But with the bubble, you
do the color and text.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.530
And you can also change the, I
think, it's the property is

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.990
for-- and I might have an
example of that in here--

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.890
for actually changing the
foreground color.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.520
So you can actually change the
coloring of the text as well.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:23.980
I believe that works with both
the bubble and the marker.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.850
So you create the style icon.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:26.740
You create your marker.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.460
And you passive a style icon.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.750
Another nice thing about the
style marker is that these

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.900
styles you can actually
change dynamically.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.930
So if I take a look, I actually
put one of these in

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.080
the global context or the global
scope so that I can

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.330
actually go back to my
developer tools.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.170
And let's go here, open
up my developer

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:57.550
tools, and find my console.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.240
Oh yeah, I put it down
to the bottom.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.205
Go to my console.

00:10:02.205 --> 00:10:03.000
Can we blow this up?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.770
Yeah.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.480
And so here I'm accessing
the style icon.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.960
And I can do things like--

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.430
actually let's do this
the other way around.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.270
I can look at my properties.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.300
I can do things like
change the color--

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:25.280
and equals, I believe it's--

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.780
actually not so setting
property.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.010
So I'm going to do
this actually.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.810
Let's go back to my
code real quick.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:35.900
So I style icon--

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.300
what property do I want to do?

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.400
Actually probably a better way
around if I were to do this,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.240
maybe just take my
marker class.

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:49.170
And I can actually just apply
the style itself, so create a

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.230
new style icon.

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.130
But since these are--

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:56.420
I wonder if I go back to this
and just reload it, get my

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:57.670
marker in the global context.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.475
And then save that,
reload my page.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:16.990
I can go back to my marker now
and marker one, and do things

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:26.210
like set options, like I said
before, change things like

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:33.530
dragability if I get
this correct.

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:35.070
And now you can see
things like these

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.490
markers are now dragable.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.380
So that's kind of the example
I had down here.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:41.210
So things like the flatness--

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:43.500
so you see this doesn't
have a shadow.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.140
This one's also dragable.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.480
So these style properties that
are actually dynamically

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.080
changeable.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.277
So not only the marker
properties, but also the style

00:11:50.277 --> 00:11:51.650
properties.

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:57.860
Maybe I can do a demonstration
of that at another time.

00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.890
So an interesting thing about
StyledMarker that I mentioned

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:05.740
before that it uses the image
API, the image chart API that

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:07.020
Google provides.

00:12:07.020 --> 00:12:09.720
And the way that API works is
actually rendering these

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.470
markers actually on
the server side.

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.240
So you pass the properties.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:14.190
You get the image back.

00:12:14.190 --> 00:12:16.340
And then you can actually render
that in your website.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.090
Unfortunately that API has
been announced for

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.160
deprecation, which
is bad news.

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:24.260
But the good news is it's going
to be around for at

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.780
least another two
and 1/2 years.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:29.890
So I think it's sometime in
April, 2015 or something to

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.210
that effect.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:37.160
So another caveat with this API
is that it's likely safe

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:38.940
to use for at least the
next couple of years.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.080
But if you're building something
for a partner or

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:45.260
consulting and building it for
another company, you probably

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.910
don't want to use this API just
to be on the safe side.

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.380
Because you probably don't want
them calling you up in a

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:52.770
couple of years saying that
their markers no longer are

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:54.620
rendering properly.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.170
The interesting thing though
is that I'm guessing since

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.010
this is actually built on top
of the marker class that it

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:03.060
might just default back to the
original markers if it can't

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.890
get an image.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:06.770
I haven't tested that out.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.390
But definitely for like short
term projects, this is a

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:13.240
really easy way to get markers
on your map, a really quick

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.910
and easy way.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:19.470
The alternative though
is the RichMarker.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:24.020
So RichMarker is very similar in
that the interface is a lot

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:27.120
like the marker class, but
allows you to actually pass an

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:30.870
HTML code for rendering
your marker.

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:34.520
And it also supports all the
standard marker properties--

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.230
things like dragability and
flatness for setting the

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.080
shadow and anchor as well.

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.850
So you actually change
where it's rendered.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.370
And also like markers or
overlays in general is that

00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:49.280
you can also set different maps
or take it out of the

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.070
maps, change its visibility
and that type of thing.

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.770
So here's an example, if we
go back to the screen.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:14:00.100
So this is an example
of a rich marker.

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:01.620
You can see this is actually
a really nice

00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:02.650
piece of HTML code.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:03.890
It has some text in here.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.340
It has an image actually.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.740
You can see if you look
around the edge, it

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:07.990
actually has the shadowing.

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:10.650
That's because it is not flat.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.160
It's actually hovering
above the image.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.840
This one I actually have
dragability on.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:17.920
So you can see, I can
move it around.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.870
But if we go over here, I
actually created this little

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.110
widget over here that lets me
actually change some of the

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:23.660
properties dynamically.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.410
So for example, if I just click
that dragability toggle

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.380
there, dragabiity-- you
can now see that this

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:32.020
marker isn't dragable.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.830
I'm doing that just by
setting the options

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.400
on the class itself.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.790
You can do things like flat.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:41.730
If I do flatness, you see the
background disappears.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.980
And visibility we can talk about
as well pretty easily.

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:47.500
So the really interesting thing
about this though is

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.280
that this has this concept
of HTML content.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.310
So you give it some HTML code
that you want it to render

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.380
inside of the marker.

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.170
So here we have some
simplified--

00:14:58.170 --> 00:14:59.390
it just says hello.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:03.720
And it has a background
of green.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.610
If I set that content on the
object, you can see the style

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.090
of my marker changes
dramatically.

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:10.810
And I could still go back
and change the other

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:12.170
properties as well.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.650
So we go back to the code.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.000
This one--

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.570
the interface is a little bit
different from marker class.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:24.000
Because it's actually
implementing the overlay.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.230
Is that again the
overlay view?

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.480
But it actually works
very much the same.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.940
So you can see here I'm creating
a rich marker class.

00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:33.850
I'm giving it a position
on the map.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.530
I set dragability and
anchor on this one.

00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:38.880
And the big difference now is
that I'm passing in content.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.920
And this is the HTML content.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.820
I'm doing things-- so there's
actually a lot of convenient

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:47.070
methods on this class.

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:51.070
You can do things like get
flat and set flat, get

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:52.270
dragable, set dragable.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:54.440
I don't believe these
exist on Marker.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.710
In general, I think access these
through the options.

00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:59.650
So it's a little
bit different.

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:01.160
These are actually kind
of convenient methods.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.130
But they are very handy.

00:16:03.130 --> 00:16:06.080
But you can also go back and
actually do the set options on

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:10.560
the class and pass in a content
object or set the

00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:16.160
dragability by changing the
options of the marker itself.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.550
So either way--

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:20.300
what I'd say is that if
you want this kind of

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.730
interchangeable with the classic
marker, so let's say

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:26.120
you want to create
one of these.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:30.250
And then later in your code,
you want to be agnostic to

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:33.030
whether or not it's a rich
marker, a standard marker, or

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:39.115
even a styled marker, just
use the options, pass

00:16:39.115 --> 00:16:40.580
in different options.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:42.240
If the class doesn't
support that

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.840
option, it's just ignored.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.280
So for example, if I have a
marker class, and I pass in

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.920
the content option,
I'm just going to

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.030
render a standard marker.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.260
Because that option and the
content will be ignored.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.610
And that's a nice way, for
example, like I said before,

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:59.670
with the styled marker, if the
styled marker goes away at

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:02.840
some point, all you'd have to
do at that point is just go

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.050
into the top of your code
and change when you're

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.380
instantiating these.

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:08.560
Instead of just instantiating
a styled marker, switch over

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.300
to a rich marker.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.579
And then the rest your
code will just work.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:15.619
Because you're relying on the
standard set options property

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.690
or function.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.190
So that's it for the markers,
these two styled markers.

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:22.040
Very handy--

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.040
you can do a lot with them.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.210
You can dynamically change
their style, dynamically

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.950
change the content.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:30.210
But in terms of more advanced
stuff, I'm going to hand it

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.640
off to Mano.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.530
MANO MARKS: So just one
more point on that--

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:39.460
I think these two libraries,
the RichMarker and the

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:45.610
StyledMarker, just really convey
how extensible the Maps

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:52.820
API is through inheritance
and our MDC objects.

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.800
So hopefully we'll be doing
another session

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.120
on that fairly soon.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.940
But I just really encourage you
to actually start playing

00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:04.680
with that kind of extensibility
within the Maps

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:09.470
API, that you don't need to be
stuck with just the properties

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:13.800
and methods that are defined
by the Maps API itself.

00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.360
PAUL SAXMAN: Actually if you
do have a chance to look at

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:20.030
the code for the
StyledMarker--

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.320
StyledMarker is pretty
straightforward.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.160
Because it's actually just
changing the icon using one of

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.320
these icons generated by
the Image Chart API.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.400
But StyledMarker on the other
hand, like I said it uses I

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.390
think it's overlay layer.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:37.750
And that's how you actually
can plot pretty much any

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.960
information on top of a map and
have it synchronize with

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.540
the movement.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:44.200
So it's a very powerful
technique for putting

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.170
information on a map.

00:18:45.170 --> 00:18:48.114
It's just that this library
wraps kind of the-- not

00:18:48.114 --> 00:18:51.670
necessarily complexity, but
wraps the concept of the

00:18:51.670 --> 00:19:02.700
canvas view with the concept of
the marker, which makes it

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.620
very convenient to use.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.360
MANO MARKS: So the next one that
I'm going to discuss is

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.610
MarkerManager.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.910
Actually both of the ones I am
going discuss sort of get at a

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:21.060
problem of too many markers
on your map.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.370
Now too many markers on
your map has a couple

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.210
of different effects.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:28.360
One is it slows down
your browser.

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.160
That's an issue.

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.190
But it's also very cluttering.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:34.890
So if you have tons of stuff on
your map, it actually can

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:40.070
get hard to navigate to and find
the things that you want

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:43.150
and also get a clear sense of
how many things are in a

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.710
particular area.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:50.220
So MarkerManager handles this in
one way which is it allows

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:58.550
you in a very simple way to show
only a limited number of

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.280
markers per zoom level.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.200
And what it does is it breaks
down the view port into grids,

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:11.420
and then randomly distributes
your markers that you've

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:15.870
created into that grid.

00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:20.600
So for instance, you'll
see here this is a

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.600
random weather map.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:27.120
This isn't using any actual
data, but just some random

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:33.330
weather data generated
by the JavaScript.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.620
And you'll see that
there are about 20

00:20:35.620 --> 00:20:37.020
markers on it right now.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.010
At that this particular
zoom level, that's

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:40.020
how many there are.

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:45.090
As I zoom out, the markers will
actually disappear or

00:20:45.090 --> 00:20:46.690
more of them will be created.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:52.440
And as you can see here, I
think we have about 200

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.870
markers here.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:58.780
So this creates an effect very
much like you'll see in many

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:04.550
maps where you can watch the
actual background of the map,

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.640
the map tiles--

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.820
you see how the style changes
as you zoom in and zoom out.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.070
And smaller cities will
start to appear.

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:22.000
You can simulate that same
effect using MarkerManager.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.390
PAUL SAXMAN: So as you zoom in,
you're going from global

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.970
information to kind of regional
information to local

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:27.520
information.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.090
MANO MARKS: Exactly.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.250
PAUL SAXMAN: And this kind of
manages the complexity of kind

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:33.280
of how much you display.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.200
MANO MARKS: Exactly, right.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:40.560
So you'll see here there's a
bunch of set up for the map.

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:48.800
But basically you import in
the MarkerManager source.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.650
And all of these libraries have
both a compiled and non

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:56.330
compiled version.

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.890
The compiled versions obviously
have better

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:01.540
performance.

00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:06.310
And the non compiled versions
have more readability in them.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:10.630
So in this case, this is just
the sample that's right in the

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:11.970
utility library.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.910
But it's loading
in the script.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:16.340
And it depends on which
option you've passed

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.730
in, compiled or non.

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:28.340
So then what we do is
we set up the map.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:29.720
We create the map.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:33.930
And we had a listener for when
the bounds change to set up

00:22:33.930 --> 00:22:35.220
the weather markers.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:40.530
And set up weather markers
creates a bunch of random

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.950
markers, but also creates a new
marker manager and puts it

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:46.100
onto the map.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:53.903
And then every time you add a
marker, you're going to add it

00:22:53.903 --> 00:22:55.390
into the MarkerManager.

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:59.950
And then the manager you then
pass in some options.

00:22:59.950 --> 00:23:04.310
So you'll see here in these
three lines, you add markers.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.360
I say get weathermarkers20.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.810
And it pulls in three.

00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.100
So basically what this is saying
is give me an array of

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:18.790
20 markers that will show
up at zoom level three.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:22.120
And then at zoom level six,
give me an array of 200

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:27.780
markers, and at zoom
level eight, 1,000.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:31.240
And for those of you who are
relatively new to the Maps

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.090
API, the zoom levels--

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:36.000
zoom level zero is
the farthest out.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.800
And each zoom level addition
pulls you closer to the map.

00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:47.210
So that's basically
how it works.

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.800
It's actually a really
easy one to do.

00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:52.830
And then you refresh
the manager.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:53.820
You have created it.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:59.520
You would then refresh it to
start displaying the markers.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.590
And then the manager just
takes care of the rest.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:10.070
The other example which is
used quite a bit more is

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.160
called MarkerClusterer.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:17.750
So you'll see here I actually
took the radar search example

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:25.760
which is in our documentation
that pulls in 200 locations

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:32.410
that have the text best view in
Sydney and places them on

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.715
the map with these little
star icons.

00:24:34.715 --> 00:24:36.190
And you see I can click here.

00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:39.040
And I get the name
of the location.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.960
What this does with
MarkerClusterer is it

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.960
automatically clusters them.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.250
I give the markers--

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.210
instead of giving them
to the map, I

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.660
give them to the clusterer.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:51.460
And then the clusterer
creates clusters.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:55.210
So you'll see here, in this
marker I have 14.

00:24:55.210 --> 00:25:00.000
If I click on that marker, it
zooms in and breaks apart the

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.080
cluster into smaller clusters.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.040
But you'll see here that these
outlying stars that are

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.940
farther away from the center of
the cluster will actually

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.250
show up on their own.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:17.330
And as I break them down, you
just get the actual locations.

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:23.360
So this is a good way of
conveying the exact number of

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.930
things in an individual area.

00:25:24.930 --> 00:25:27.040
And you can see as I zoom
out, it re-clusters.

00:25:31.810 --> 00:25:33.860
And it handles changing
the style.

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.030
There's automatic ways in which
it changes the style.

00:25:37.030 --> 00:25:45.190
And you'll see the numbers
here above 10 are in--

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:46.905
what is that?-- orange,
I guess.

00:25:46.905 --> 00:25:49.110
Yes, sorry I have a
little slight red

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.660
deficiency in my vision.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:53.620
So those are orangish.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:26:00.240
And then you see as I pull
out even farther, it will

00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:01.040
re-clustering.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.860
PAUL SAXMAN: So they're really
capturing density as well

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:04.670
which is nice.

00:26:04.670 --> 00:26:05.610
MANO MARKS: Yeah, right.

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:11.250
And so over 100, you
actually get red.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:19.430
And so what I got was total
of 191 results.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:25.530
So the code for this
is pretty simple.

00:26:25.530 --> 00:26:33.070
Again, what I did here was I
created a markers array, which

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:34.820
is initialized right here.

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:40.120
And then I'm pulling in
the places search.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:45.210
And when the bounds change, it
actually performs the search.

00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:50.310
We've covered there places
before, so I'm not going to go

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:51.580
too much detail in that.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.970
But basically I'm adding an
event that performs a search.

00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:59.890
And at the end of the performing
of the search, it

00:26:59.890 --> 00:27:01.930
has a call back.

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.370
A call back is just
called callback.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:10.470
And at the end of that, I create
a marker clusterer.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:11.820
And I assigned it to the map.

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:14.170
And I assigned the array
of markers to it.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:16.490
So this is the simplest
example.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.370
I'm doing no real

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:23.000
customization of the clusterer.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.940
I'm just saying you handle all
the options here and figure

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:30.790
out how to actually do it.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:31.670
PAUL SAXMAN: So if we do--

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.370
like when you're creating your
marker class there, you're not

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.210
specifying the map, right?

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:37.380
MANO MARKS: So that's
the important thing.

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:47.240
When I create an actual marker,
I do not specify a

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.230
marker in the process.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.301
So

00:27:51.301 --> 00:27:52.410
PAUL SAXMAN: Do I
just say marker?

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:53.695
When you create--

00:27:53.695 --> 00:27:54.945
MANO MARKS: You do not
assign the map.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.350
Because if you assign the marker
to the map, then it's

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.340
going to display
it on the map.

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.510
You assign it to
the clusterer.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:05.840
And the clusterer figures out
when to assign it to the map.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.870
PAUL SAXMAN: OK, so this is a
little bit different from the

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.650
last example we saw with sort of
the MarkerManager in there

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:16.480
where the MarkerManager as
you're zooming in, you're

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.630
displaying more information.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.900
This one likewise, we're
displaying more information.

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:24.370
Because the markers are
expanding, except that with

00:28:24.370 --> 00:28:27.860
the clustering you get things
like the density.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.820
And you also get the information
about the number

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.910
of markers that are clustered
within each of these kind of

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:33.010
metamarkers.

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:34.390
MANO MARKS: That's right.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:35.780
PAUL SAXMAN: So you're
preserving a lot more

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.000
information using
this technique.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.340
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:45.500
On the flip side of that, with
MarkerManager, you can sort of

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:51.010
say OK, at this level these are
the ones that you display,

00:28:51.010 --> 00:28:55.300
whereas with the
MarkerClusterer, it's

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.240
effectively displaying them all,
but within these clusters

00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.600
instead of at different
zoom levels.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:04.766
PAUL SAXMAN: And we don't
have examples

00:29:04.766 --> 00:29:05.620
of this today, though.

00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.970
But there's other clustering
techniques as well, like I've

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.950
seen things like the spider
web clustering.

00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:13.260
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.640
PAUL SAXMAN: So the idea of
clustering is pretty powerful.

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:16.950
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:21.040
And heat maps is in an extreme
variation of that.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:26.670
It's basically giving you
information about density of

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:29.090
objects in an area.

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:31.420
There are some advanced
options.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.540
I'm going to just do a
quick example here.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.330
This is [INAUDIBLE] from the
official utility library.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:45.710
You can actually set the max
zoom level and which markers

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:46.770
will be clustered.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:51.950
So if I set it here at seven,
at a certain point if I get

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:54.130
down below seven, it will
just automatically

00:29:54.130 --> 00:29:56.310
break up all the clusters.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:59.760
And I chose a bad
area where there

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.930
are actually no clusters.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:08.500
But if, for instance, I zoom in
here, it'll break them up

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.060
fairly quickly.

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:14.470
I can also choose
cluster size.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:17.480
So you'll see before
this was around--

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.050
that's what I didn't do
is refresh the map.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:31.190
So I can make the clusters
bigger or smaller.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:35.000
So it will attempt to put them
into clusters around size 80.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.740
And here you see that the
maximum level there.

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:40.300
I can also change the styling.

00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.860
So change this to default.

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:51.700
So here I can style the icons
with custom icons.

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.560
So you can choose your
own icons for

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.970
the different styles.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:31:00.980
And one thing that people will
do is instead of creating just

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.890
one cluster, they may create
several MarkerClusterers if

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.680
they want a cluster different
kinds of objects.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:17.290
So if I wanted to have a people
or a heart as my icon,

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.430
you might have a cluster
of people and a

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:21.680
cluster of heart icons.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.520
PAUL SAXMAN: I mean both these
techniques, I think, are very

00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.650
useful, not only for
visualizations.

00:31:28.650 --> 00:31:32.610
Like if you want to the
display density--

00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:33.590
I don't know what this is--

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:34.470
but density--

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:35.860
MANO MARKS: Of random things.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.100
PAUL SAXMAN: Random things
on your map.

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.220
But also just as a standard
technique first Maps.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.290
Because a lot of people--

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:45.530
let's say if you wanted a
restaurant finder, you

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:49.180
probably don't want to display
a marker for every restaurant

00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:53.230
in Europe if the user zoomed
out at a certain level.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:55.390
So you could use this technique
to kind of let users

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.330
kind of drill down.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:58.660
So it's kind of broadly
applicable I think.

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:03.920
MANO MARKS: Yeah, for instance
you have an auto retail site.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.210
And you want to show where
all your dealerships are.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:08.690
In large cities, there
may be a lot of them.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.510
But if somebody's looking over
Europe, they want to know

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:15.090
where is the place that I can
go so I can try a bunch of

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.600
different dealerships to try and
get the deal that I want

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.880
or the specific car
that I want.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.250
And so they'll look for
the cities with the

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.500
most markers in them.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:30.660
PAUL SAXMAN: OK, well with that
I think that's it for our

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:33.170
demos today or for what we're
going to talk about.

00:32:33.170 --> 00:32:35.870
I mean it seems like we could
even have a whole talk on

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.670
clustering at some point.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:37.890
MANO MARKS: Right.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:41.652
PAUL SAXMAN: Because it's a
really powerful tool I think.

00:32:41.652 --> 00:32:42.730
MANO MARKS: Well, in
not just this.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:46.575
But yeah, looking at different
algorithms for clustering and

00:32:46.575 --> 00:32:47.370
certain [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:52.290
If you do searches online for
clustering algorithms, you'll

00:32:52.290 --> 00:32:54.660
find a lot of different ways
in which people have

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.460
implemented these kind
of clusters.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.990
PAUL SAXMAN: Cool.

00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.830
All right, so that's it.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.270
If you guys have any questions,
feel free to post

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:05.790
them in the YouTube stream
or on the Google+ post.

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.915
And we'll try to get
back to you.

00:33:07.915 --> 00:33:09.730
If you have any ideas for shows,
if you really want to

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:14.910
see more marker clustering, let
us know as well, or ideas

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:15.910
for future shows.

00:33:15.910 --> 00:33:19.110
And with that, we'll catch
you next week.

00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.620
MANO MARKS: All right.

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.870
Thanks a lot, everyone.
