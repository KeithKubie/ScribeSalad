If Galileo did drop objects off the Leaning Tower of Pisa,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
he probably eventually got pretty bored of just dropping them.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So let's say 1 day he decided to toss one up at 20 m/s.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I just want to know how long will the ball stay in the air.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And this is another problem that might be best broken up into two parts.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The upward trip and the downward trip. But it's up to you. Enter your answer here.
