00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.409
 Let's exercise 

00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:03.603
 in the definition of equivalent expressions. 

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:06.180
 Here I have an expression written in yellow, 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.549
 and then I have two more, written with this pale green color. 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.652
 I want you to pause the video and see if you can 

00:00:10.652 --> 00:00:12.870
 to determine which of these expressions, 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.715
 and it may not be any of them, 

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:18.326
 which one is equivalent to that in yellow. 

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:20.649
 I accept that experience. 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.561
 I want to solve this task, 

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.639
 simplifying all as much as possible. 

00:00:24.639 --> 00:00:27.324
 This one here is clear that it is not very simple. 

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:29.551
 Let's reveal the brackets. 

00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.123
 If I multiply with the couple, what will happen? 

00:00:32.123 --> 00:00:36.703
 This is equal to two by minus 6c, it is minus 12c. 

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:40.609
 Two plus three are plus six. 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:44.100
 And then we have plus 4c. 

00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:46.689
 Then we can simplify it further, 

00:00:46.689 --> 00:00:49.138
 because I have these two articles that contain "c". 

00:00:49.138 --> 00:00:52.963
 I have minus 12s plus 4c. 

00:00:52.963 --> 00:00:54.402
 How much will it be? 

00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:57.692
 Minus 12 of something plus four of something 

00:00:57.692 --> 00:00:59.352
 it will be minus eight of this thing. 

00:00:59.352 --> 00:01:01.880
 this will be equal to minus 8c. 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.306
 If I gather these two members in blue, 

00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:05.804
 I will get minus 8c. 

00:01:05.804 --> 00:01:07.584
 And finally 

00:01:08.296 --> 00:01:09.501
 plus six. 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:12.637
 Now I see this is the same 

00:01:12.637 --> 00:01:14.518
 as the first expression in green. 

00:01:14.518 --> 00:01:16.888
 Therefore, this expression 

00:01:16.888 --> 00:01:18.583
 will definitely be equivalent to yellow. 

00:01:18.583 --> 00:01:20.662
 What about this one down here? 

00:01:20.662 --> 00:01:22.848
 To understand, let's simplify it. 

00:01:22.848 --> 00:01:24.536
 Let's reveal the brackets 

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:27.751
 Three in minus 4c is minus 12s. 

00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:31.593
 Three in plus plus two is plus six. 

00:01:31.593 --> 00:01:35.848
 Plus six and then we have plus plus 4c. 

00:01:35.848 --> 00:01:37.521
 Looks good. 

00:01:37.521 --> 00:01:41.164
 Now we can collect members that include "c". 

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:44.995
 Minus 12c and 4c, collect them together 

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:47.231
 and you get minus 8c. 

00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:49.283
 Minus 8c plus six. 

00:01:50.353 --> 00:01:54.454
 We got exactly the same as the other expressions. 

00:01:54.454 --> 00:01:57.864
 Therefore, all these expressions 

00:01:57.864 --> 00:01:59.584
 are equivalent. 

00:01:59.584 --> 00:02:01.686
 This one, this and that. 

00:02:01.686 --> 00:02:03.414
 Let's figure out another example. 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.403
 And just like the last time, pause the video 

00:02:06.403 --> 00:02:08.737
 and see which of these two expressions - 

00:02:08.737 --> 00:02:10.490
 may be both or none of them, 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.583
 or only one of them - 

00:02:11.583 --> 00:02:13.871
 are equivalent 

00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:15.668
 of this yellow expression? 

00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:17.924
 Okay, let's do it together. 

00:02:17.924 --> 00:02:19.778
 And as with the previous task, let us first simplify. 

00:02:19.778 --> 00:02:22.582
 I first think of that 

00:02:22.582 --> 00:02:26.593
 take the members that contain "n" and collect them. 

00:02:26.593 --> 00:02:29.962
 Minus six of something in this case "n", 

00:02:29.962 --> 00:02:31.749
 plus four of this thing, in this case "n". 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:34.177
 Minus 6n plus 4n will give you 

00:02:34.177 --> 00:02:35.687
 minus two of this thing. 

00:02:35.687 --> 00:02:36.586
 Collect the odds. 

00:02:36.586 --> 00:02:39.922
 Minus six plus four is minus 2n. 

00:02:39.922 --> 00:02:43.054
 We have minus 2n and then plus minus 12, 

00:02:43.054 --> 00:02:45.235
 which is the same as just minus 12. 

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:48.123
 So minus 12. 

00:02:48.123 --> 00:02:50.913
 I simplified the original expression. 

00:02:50.913 --> 00:02:53.600
 Let's see these down here. 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.279
 If I uncover the braces, 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:03:00.181
 I get four by "n", 4n. 

00:03:00.181 --> 00:03:03.373
 And then four by minus three is minus 12. 

00:03:03.373 --> 00:03:06.047
 And then we'll get 6n. 

00:03:06.804 --> 00:03:09.576
 Yes, minus 6n. 

00:03:09.576 --> 00:03:10.667
 What does this give us? 

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:13.354
 We get - let me use another color here - the following thing: 

00:03:13.354 --> 00:03:16.599
 4n, I gather all members with "n", 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.499
 minus 6n will give us 2n. 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:22.624
 Then we have 

00:03:22.624 --> 00:03:25.115
 minus 12. 

00:03:25.115 --> 00:03:27.359
 By simplifying this expression, I get 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.170
 same as the first expression. 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.034
 So these two are equivalent. 

00:03:32.034 --> 00:03:33.485
 This is equivalent to that. 

00:03:33.485 --> 00:03:35.196
 Now let me check this one. 

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:37.603
 Two - let's just 

00:03:37.603 --> 00:03:39.901
 I reveal the braces - 

00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:41.944
 two by 2n is 4n. 

00:03:41.944 --> 00:03:45.576
 Then two by minus 6 is minus 12. 

00:03:45.576 --> 00:03:49.440
 This is simplified to 4n minus 12, and it is obvious that it is different 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.261
 from minus 2n minus 12. 

00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:54.359
 So this expression 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:58.006
 is not the same as the other two.
