00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.450
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good
evening, everybody.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.850
Good evening.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.390
My name is David Plylar.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.220
And I'm pleased to welcome you
to this evening's event on behalf

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.070
of the music division in
the Library of Congress.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.190
We are thrilled to
continue our collaboration

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.380
with the American Musicological
Society in presenting a series

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.540
of talks at the library given by
scholars whose work has benefitted

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.030
from the vast resources that
the music division has to offer.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.610
Tonight's presentation
is a departure

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.270
from the usual solitary lecturer.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.770
Instead we have multiple speakers
and performers who have created a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.160
through composed venture
into the music of World War I

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.610
that was important to the English,
Canadian, and American allies.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.610
Speaking tonight will be Christina
Bashford, Williams Brooks,

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.580
and Gayle Sherwood Magee.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.140
And we will hear performances
by singers Laurie Matheson

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.280
and Justin Vickers along
side pianist Jeffrey Dukes.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.020
This event will be recorded
and available online.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.690
And you can supplement
your experience

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.810 position:56%
by visiting the library's exhibition
in the Jefferson Building,

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.740 position:56%
entitled Echoes of the Great War,
American experiences of World War I.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.120
There is also an online version of
this and other related exhibitions

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.920
and resources that can be
found at the libraries website.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.870
Following today's presentation,
anyone with questions

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.070
for our speakers or performers
are invited to come up

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.430
and speak to them individually.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.830
To more properly introduce
our guests, it's my pleasure

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.490
to invite a member of the
American Musicological Society,

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.410
who has traveled here
today to be with us.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.530 position:56%
Susan Weiss is professor of
musicology at the Peabody Institute.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.510 position:56%
And we thank Dr. Weiss for
offering greetings from the society.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:04.550
[ Applause ]

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.300
&gt;&gt; Susan Forscher Weiss:
Thank you, David.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.630
Can you hear me?

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.620
You'd think coming from
Baltimore would be easy.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:13.480
But afterwards, I'll tell
you how difficult it was.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.780
Thank you to David.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.080
And also, to Martha Feldman,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.230
the President of the
American Musicological Society

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.160
who couldn't be here to
these two institutions,

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.670
the American Musicological
Society and the Library of Congress

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.470
for this 19-year collaboration.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.920
And this one Johnnies,
Tommies, and Sammies.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.220
I love that title.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.990
Music and the World War I Alliance.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.330
And it's also presented, I
understand, in association

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.130
with the exhibition, World War I,

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.990
the American Artists
View of the Great War.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.210 position:56%
As you've heard from David, these
lectures have been given by scholars

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.220
who have conducted research
in the music division.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.040
As my colleague at Princeton, Scott
Burnham, said a couple of years ago

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.560
in his introduction to the
17th lecture in the series,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.310
"Many members of the American
Musicological Society delight

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.970
in the music division of the
Library of Congress as a kind

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.150 position:56%
of treasure chamber here in the
very heart of our nation's capital."

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.600
I don't think I could
have said that better.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.920
"For them being inside the
beltway most likely means headed

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.810
to the Library of Congress."

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.460
Today more than ever this treasure
chamber provides a safe haven

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.940
from the insanity and
dystopia of the walls outside.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.300
For the first time in
19 years, as David said,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.510
this year's event is not devoted
to the work of one scholar

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.650
but instead a team of
speakers, six of them.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.790
I just found out it was six,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.570
keeping with the sports metaphor
I had thought it was a basketball

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.810
team, even though they
might not be tall enough.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.440
But it could be an
augmented basketball team.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.770
On the other hand, if we
go back to music metaphors,

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.210
this dream team would form a
sextet of British, Canadian,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.660
and American musicologists.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.390
I guess there are four
fighting in line.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.830
And two redbirds.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.130
Is that right?

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.590 position:56%
Because they're a team, one long bio
is splintered into six smaller ones.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.170
And you have most of
them in your program.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.960
I'm going to add just a
little bit to two of them.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.340
Because these are two women who had
an effect on my life and the lives

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.830
of my students 40 minutes
away from here.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.160
A little longer than that maybe.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.700
The first of these is Gayle
Sherwood Magee who holds a BM

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.500
from McMaster University
and a PhD from Yale.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.740
Her scholarship is
mentioned in the program

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.720
with the wonderful
things that she's done.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.740
And over the years, I've had the
great good fortune to collaborate

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.510
with the library in
a variety of ways.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.620
I'm either aiding my own research,
hiring students as interns,

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.690
hosting them for presentations
of the treasures,

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.010
manuscripts, books, instruments.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.580
There is a Dayton Miller
flute collection,

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.930
which they love to come and see.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.520
And the Stradivarius instruments.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.250
It's just a treasure as Scott said.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.170 position:56%
In 2005 with gratitude to members of
the Performing Arts Library staff,

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:11.680
especially Susan Clairmont and Ray
White, we were able to borrow some

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.280
of these treasures for the
exhibition reading and writing

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.980
of pedagogy of the past held
at Peabody and John Hopkins.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:22.780
As part of an NAH crowd, that
we would not have received

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:28.240
without the support of Gayle Magee,
then editor of Indiana Press,

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.800
thanks to her stewardship,

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.300
Indiana University Press published
our volume, Music Education

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.910
in the Middle Ages
and the Renaissance.

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.970
Another personal reflection
concerns a volume that just came

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.210
out last June, A Cole Porter
companion, edited by Illinois Press

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.970
under the magnificent
baton of Laurie Matheson.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.220
Who has a master's in music
from Westminster College,

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.250
near and dear to me because one of
our editors is now the Dean there.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.970
And a DMA from the
University of Illinois.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.440
Shout out to members of the
performing arts division,

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.240
especially Walter Zahn
Kanko [assumed spelling]

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.650
and Mark Eden Horowitz.

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.740
Neither of them could be here.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.410
But Mark's chapter on Porter's
material in the library is one

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.620
of the jewels in the volume.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.040
There was an interview
on a website at Illinois

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.810 position:56%
that I found, written two years ago.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:23.370
And Laurie said, I'm a
professional musician.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.510
I play the organ, direct a
church choir, compose choral

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.670
and vocal music and
direct a community choir.

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.530
Last winter I composed
a set of songs

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.390
for a production at the Tempest.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.070
A colleague of mine put on at
St. Mary's-of- the-Wood College.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:37.930
I do as much music as I can.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:39.240
I think that's an understatement.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.150
This presentation is in
the form of a conversation

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.480
between representatives
of three countries,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.080
Christina Bashford
represents Britain,

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.080
William Brooks represents
the United States

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.910
and Gayle Magee represents Canada.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.640
The assignment is not arbitrary.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.740
Each was actually born in
the country represented.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.750 position:56%
But in keeping with the presentation

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.030
about alliances all
presently work elsewhere.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.820
Bashford and Magee in the
U.S. And Brooks in Britain.

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.020
Communication between the
allies is precisely the point

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.720
of this presentation.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.570
Communication in the form
of music, in particular,

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.810
and its role in shaping
relationships during

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:18.110
and after World War I.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.690
What was the nature of the alliance
just after the start of the war.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.990
For King and Country
can be an entry point.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:28.040
A song expressing loyalty
to England's King.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.160
Written in 1914 by Robert Harkness,
an Australian living in London

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.250
and published a few months later
by Gordon B. Thompson in Canada.

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.970
Where were the Americans?

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:41.320
Looking on for the
moment, but with interest.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:44.790
The recording you will hear
was issued by Victor and is

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.280 position:56%
by Brooklyn born Reinald Werrenrath.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.490
And so, the conversation begins.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:52.510
I welcome you.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:08:00.510
[ Applause ]

00:08:00.510 --> 00:09:34.730
[ Music ]

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.120
&gt;&gt; Christina Bashford: The song
we just heard echoes another

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.980
recruitment song about
loyalty to King and Country

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.650
by British composer Paul Reubens.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:46.780
It was published in London
by Chappell Co in late 1914.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:49.580
Just weeks after the British
Government had declared war

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.710
on Germany and had kicked off
a major recruitment campaign

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:58.610
which Reuben's song refers
to and subtly manipulates.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:02.800
It was immensely popular and surely
helped establish a role for women

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.920
in the bid to enlist young men.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.850
A role that would become highly
visible in Britain within months.

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.150
And also in Canada.

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.090 position:56%
In entering the war, Britain was
not only aligning itself with France

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.770
and Russia against German and
Austria-Hungarian aggression,

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:28.440
it was also creating the crux

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.830
of what became known
as the Allied Forces.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:32.730
And defending its position

00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:36.790
as the world's pre-eminent
imperialist power.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:41.190
Over the course of the war,
a staggering 2.7 million men

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:44.440
from the British colonies
would serve the British army.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.300
Fighting for a tiny island
thousands of miles away.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.440
Now one of the signal features
of the so-called great war,

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.470
is that it was not one
conflict, but many fought

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.920
in several parts of the world.

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.750
Thus, Japan soon entered on the
side of the alliance pushing back

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:06.320
against German naval ships in
the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:12.240
However, in August 1914, with the
British military under resourced,

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.730
the Colonial armies were
all that Britain could count

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.730
on to defend its territorial
interests.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:20.330
&gt;&gt; Gayle Sherwood Magee: When
Britain declared war on August 4,

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:26.250 position:56%
2914, Canada had an
insubstantial army of 3000 soldiers.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.880
Through the late summer and
fall of 1914 men from most parts

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.960
of the country rushed to enlist.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:36.140
Within one year 35,000 troops
were fighting in Europe.

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:40.800
Music, often British, resolutely
fed the recruitment drive.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.970
For King and Country was issues
in a Colonial edition in Toronto.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.280
Together with a piano version

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.700

Despite an official show of unity
and allegiance to Great Britain,

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.240
however, the first World War
would deeply divide Canada along

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.180
linguistic, political,
and religious fault lines.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.100
Particularly between the
anglophone half of the country

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.780
and the roughly quarter
of the nation

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:07.430
that claimed French
as it's main language.

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.000
&gt;&gt; Christina Bashford:
By April 1915,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.760 position:56%
it was clear that the war had
become to become that expected to be

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.490
over by Christmas was looking
like a much longer term haul.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:20.360
A significant development
came in May when Italy,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:23.910
which had initially been poised
to support the Central Powers,

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.130
switched allegiance and entered
the war on the other side.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:34.270
This moment was crystalized in
music by one Francesco Paolo Tosti.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:38.770
Tosti was an Italian born singer
and prolific song composer

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.540
who had settled in London
and become a British citizen.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.230
He'd had a successful career
and had even been knighted.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:49.990
He was living in retirement in
Italy when Britain declared war.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:53.360
And shortly after Italy
entered he wrote his one

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.860
and only political song,
The Allies March to Freedom.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:00.460
Which we'll hear in a moment.

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:05.700
Chappell published it with Italy
and English text and a lavish cover

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:09.410
that depicted the flags of the
major allies, Britain, France,

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.890
Belgium, Russia, and Japan.

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:13.380
We see it here.

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:17.750
The Italian flag at it's center,
snuggled close to the Union Jack

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:22.300
with gleaming finials that seemed
to be standing next to bayonets,

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.390 position:56%
which for now at least were still
the soldiers' quintessential weapons

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.220
of war.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.790
Chappell who'd already
published many

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:34.600
of Tosti's songs could
expect to trade on his name.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.440
But the firm might also have hoped

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.000
to market the work to
Italian immigrants.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.740
There were nearly 20,000
Italians living in London in 1915.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.380
We should note, too, the
American import stamp.

00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.120
And that the song was
sold in the U.S.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.450
where Italian immigrants
were much more numerous.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.700
And where that population
might also have been willing

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.000
in spirit to join the march.

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:13.610
the United States viewed
the European War

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:15.860
from a comfortable distance.

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:18.550
Despite political and
fiscal entanglements,

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.800
the immediate political
objective was

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.820
to keep Wilson's presidency
on track.

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:28.950 position:56%
After decades of work, American
Progressives finally had a president

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.610
and a climate that
supported their reform agenda.

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:35.680
The war threatened to deflect
attention and resources

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:37.870
from the domestic tasks at hand.

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.660
And they wanted no part of it.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.770
Moreover, even in its early
stages, the war threatened

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.770
to set ethnic groups
against each other,

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:49.690
fracturing the Progressive
community.

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.830
German-Americans wanted
strict neutrality.

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.750
English-Americans favored
support for Britain.

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.370
And Irish-Americans
were with the Germans,

00:17:58.370 --> 00:18:03.720
since their homeland was gearing
up for the uprising of 1916.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.530 position:56%
French and Belgium Americans mounted
relief efforts for the citizens

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:09.510
of the beleaguered countries.

00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:15.100
Italian-Americans, initially
confused, rallied behind Britain

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.550
after Italy changed sides.

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:22.090
All this was reflected
in the country's songs.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:27.060
Natalie Townsend, born in Paris and
a Belgium resident for six years,

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.970
wrote Belgium forever
with her daughter, Yvonne,

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:35.740
which enjoyed some success in
a recording by Herbert Stewart.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:41.680
The amateur Irish-American composer
John J. Donohue wrote Don't Blame

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:48.120
the Germans, which predicted 'The
French and the Belgians misled

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.860
by England's greed must
very soon surrender

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:54.490
for they know they can't succeed.'

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:58.940
It had no success whatsoever.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:04.830
More than one song took a humorous
view of conflicting allegiances

00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:08.360
or turned a Civil War
song on its head.

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.990
But most Americans
felt, rather smugly,

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.240
that they were above the war.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.040
A sentiment captured in two
songs by the novelty specialist,

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:19.850
Jack Frost and James White.

stereotypical Germans and Brits side

I'm over here, they're over there.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:36.560

plays several national anthems

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.960
The majority of Canadian
enlistees during the first year

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.150
of the war were, in fact, not born
in Canada but in Europe, Britain,

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.460
or other British and
European colonies.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.820
And many were veterans
of the Boar War.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.970
Joseph Fairholme, Sr, for example,

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:06.190
served in the British
Imperial Army Rifle Corp

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:11.670
for 21 years before retiring
to a farm in Alberta in 1913.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:16.260
In November 1915, he enlisted in
the Canadian Expeditionary Force,

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:20.780
or CEF, and was assigned to the
rank of Company Sergeant Master.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.070
Fairholme's two teenage
sons enlisted as well.

00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:26.270
The British character of
the Canadian armed forces

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.390
in the first year of the war
explains a large part the slew

00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:31.780
of songs issued in
Canada and dedicated

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:34.690
to King George and the Union Jack.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.240
Canadian World War I
songs made common use

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.350
of imported British imagery,

00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:42.510
including easily recognizable
British tunes,

00:22:42.510 --> 00:22:46.490
such as Rule Britannia and God
Save the King, often in conjunction

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:49.050
with British themed lyrics.

00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.240
Just as the Fairholmes enlisted
together based on close ties

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.630
to Britain, the French
speaking Belaire brothers signed

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:59.930 position:56%
up for military service that would
return them to a familiar landscape.

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:04.090
Born in Geneva, Etienne, Andre,
and Phillipe Belaire immigrated

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.850
with their parents
and other siblings

00:23:05.850 --> 00:23:09.280
to a comfortable suburb
of Montreal in 1908.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.780
French speaking non-Quebecca
[assumed spelling] soldiers

00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:15.190
in the allied forces such as
the Belaire brothers were part

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.910
of a large number of ex-patriots
from France, Switzerland, Belgium,

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:24.190
and Francophone colonies, to enlist
during the first nine of the war.

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:28.740
For whom a song such as Mon
Soldat served a recruiting role.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.850
The lyrics contained no hint
of empire, nor king, nor duty.

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.750
And little mention of
actually fighting the war.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.770
Instead the song focuses on a
soldier's sweetheart promising

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.090
to return to wait for
him until he returns.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.940
Notice as well, that the song
was published within Britain

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.000
and distributed throughout Canada.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.770 position:56%
In this case, the Atlantic
Canadian province of News Brunswick,

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:54.540

population outside of Quebec.

The alternative English lyrics

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:00.280
by contrast reinforced the
standard imperial tropes of duty,

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.000
defeating the foe, and
fighting for the community.

songs from the past.

A favorite image was of
the Statue of Liberty,

00:25:41.270 --> 00:25:43.650 position:56%
both because of its symbolic meaning

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.880
and because it embodied the
countries long-standing alliance

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.700
with France.

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:53.380
Mothers inevitably were trundled
out as iconic representation

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:57.850
of inspiration, nostalgia,
domesticity,

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:01.390
or occasionally good sense.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.170

were pervasive.

on the subject matter,

fought in the past.

anti-war song hit.

from Thomas Moore's
The Minstrel Boy.

The minstrel boy to
the war has gone .

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:57.760

quotation from Auld Lang Syne.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:00.800

the political message here.

But not all Americans felt that way.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.560
Even at the start of 1915.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.610
Just two months later Charles
Bayha wrote a rebuttal.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.410
Bayha was pro-engagement.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.030
He tried twice to enlist.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.670
And when he was rejected
he went to Camp Dix

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:22.490
and produced shows with
the soldiers there.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:26.100
Bayha's song is not as
powerful as Piantadose's

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.700
and it had less impact at the time.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:34.630
But it makes clear the very real
conflict of opinion in the country.

torpedoes at allied ships.

In 1915 the United States
was still officially neutral.

and weapons to Britain,

sometimes concealing them in
commercial passenger liners.

torpedo and sank rapidly.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:27.280
With the loss of nearly
1200 civilian lives.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.930
&gt;&gt; Gayle Sherwood Magee: An
estimated 360 Canadians or more

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:32.360
than a quarter of the
total casualties were lost

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.420
in the sinking of the Lusitania.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:38.010
Many were wives and children of
British-Canadian soldiers training

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:40.660
in England who looked
forward to renewing ties

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.220
with extended families
still in Britain.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.520
Other Canadian travelers

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:47.960
on the Lusitania were British
citizens living in Canada hoping

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:50.320
to enlist in the British
army once they returned

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.200
to their country of origin.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:54.690
Immediately the Lusitania
became a rallying cry

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.260
for the Canadian war effort.

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Christina Bashford: Most of
those who drowned were from Britain.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.580
Where the atmosphere in the days
following the atrocity was one

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.240
of deep shock.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.750
Several of the dead were
considerably wealthy.

00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:10.210
The ship being famed for
its opulent accommodations.

00:33:10.210 --> 00:33:12.420
And many of the fatalities
were women and children

00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:15.960
who had not been helped off
first as was the traditional code

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.610
of conduct in maritime emergencies.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:27.410
Worst of all, most of the children
drowned, a shocking 91 out of 124.

00:33:27.410 --> 00:33:31.500
This figure included all six
children of Paul Crompton.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:34.400
A successful British businessman
who had been living and working

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.630
in the U.S. and was
relocating his family to London.

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:42.340
I tell you this because the
Crompton's are connected with one

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:46.080
of the most poignant musical
responses to the tragedy.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.710
A short piece by the English
composer Frank Bridge.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:53.200
His Lament for String Orchestra.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:57.460
Written in June in 1915 in memory
of Crompton's 9-year-old daughter,

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.670
Katherine, a well-loved
child friend.

00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:04.360
The Lament was performed at a
major London concert in September.

00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:07.110
But it attracted little
public attention.

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:10.060
It's expression of
sorrow being out of sync

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.250
with the more upbeat
mood of patriotism.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:15.600
Actually, the reporting
of the Cromptons' deaths

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.810
in the British press was
fairly restrained, too.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:20.370
Compared to coverage
in American papers,

00:34:20.370 --> 00:34:22.090
which emphasized the tragic loss

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:27.130
of an entire family including
a baby and its nanny.

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:28.510
This poignant photograph

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:33.430
from a Philadelphia newspaper was
republished widely in the states.

00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:37.400
The piece itself is a
little gem of lamentation.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:41.790 position:56%
With downward chromatic emotion and
accented sighs in the violins melody

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.830 position:56%
that emulate the pained human voice.

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:48.230
As we listen, you may feel that
the rocking meter evokes the sea

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:53.310
and the residence of the deep base
line conjures up the ocean's depth.

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:56.250
Kevin Sultan has noted that
the swaying motion seems

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.600
to suggest a lullaby.

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.190 position:56%
We might further position this piece
in the cross-cultural tradition

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:05.310
of what has been termed
the lullament.

00:35:05.310 --> 00:35:10.060
Music of mourning that
integrates elements of lullaby.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.080
In fact, that's highly
appropriate for a work

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:14.510
that commemorated the
death of a child and one

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:17.050
that could symbolize
the children of all ages

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.960
and nationalities who
drowned that day.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:23.590
Moreover, with its
Anglo-American subject matter

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:27.190
and its public performance
by a large string assemble,

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:33.120
the Lament seems with hindsight
a British gesture of solidarity

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.000
and grief with North America.

00:35:39.510 --> 00:37:29.010
[ Music ]

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:32.250
&gt;&gt; William Brooks: The United
States lost fewer people

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:34.660
on the Lusitania than did Britain.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.980
But the shock was far greater.

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:40.530
The country had imagined
itself safe,

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:46.070
protected by distance
and by neutrality.

00:37:46.070 --> 00:37:48.770
Now clearly it was vulnerable.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:55.240
The war had come home, and
death had touched the country.

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.960
Tin Pan Alley reacted
with two songs published

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.030
within two weeks of the tragedy.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.430
But neither of these attained
the status of a true memorial

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:05.760
or expression of the
country's grief.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.970
That task was undertaken
by Charles Ives.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:16.030
Who composed an orchestral work,
From Hannover Square North,

00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:22.400
at the end of a tragic day the
voice of the people again arose

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.070
in the months that followed.

00:38:24.070 --> 00:38:28.610
The piece is an impression
of an incident

00:38:28.610 --> 00:38:32.450
that Ives witnessed
the day the news broke.

00:38:32.450 --> 00:38:34.800
And his description is remarkable.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:40.130
&gt;&gt; Justin Vickers: Leaving the
office, I took the Third Avenue L

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:42.410
at Hannover Square Station.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:45.070
As I came on the platform
there was quite a crowd waiting

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.500
for the trains.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:50.970
And a hand organ where Hurdy Gurdy
was playing in the street below.

00:38:50.970 --> 00:38:52.270
Some workmen sitting on the side

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.810
of the tracks began
to whistle the tune.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:58.520
And others began to
sing or hum the refrain.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:02.710
A workman with a shovel over his
shoulder joined in the chorus.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:07.060
And the next pan the Wall
Street Banker joined in.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:12.220
And finally, it seemed to me that
everyone was singling this tune.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:20.380
And they didn't seem
to be singing in fun.

00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:21.680
But as a natural sound
of what they're feeling

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.480
as they [inaudible] all day long.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:58.050
[ Music ]

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:03.270
&gt;&gt; William Brooks: Ives
perfectly captured the crisis.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:08.720
Not merely of war and peace but
of the country's very identity.

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:12.420
He reacted as a Wilsonian
idealist with a faith

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:16.950
that all factions would come
together, workmen and banker,

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:22.590
rich and poor, immigrants
and native born.

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:26.120
But events would overtake him.

00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:32.710
After the Lusitania, Wilson moved
very carefully, squeezed as he was

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.870
between militants like
Theodore Roosevelt and advocates

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:41.860 position:56%
of neutrality which included the
majority of Congress and the nation.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.430 position:56%
His primary policy was preparedness.

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.030
The nation would get
ready for war but seek

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.750
to avoid it, if at all possible.

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:54.540
This campaign also
had musical results.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.790
But the great consequence was
that Wilson managed to squeak

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:01.830
through the 1916 election by
promoting himself as the man

00:41:01.830 --> 00:41:04.350
who kept the country out of war.

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:10.250
In 1917, however, things
quickly turned ugly.

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:13.170
At the beginning of February,

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:17.900
Germany announced it was resuming
unrestricted submarine warfare.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:21.980
And in March, the so-called
Zimmerman telegram was made public,

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.790
in which Germany proposed
an alliance

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:26.570
with Mexico suggesting
another border war

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:30.160
to keep the United
States busy at home.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:34.250
American sentiment shifted
overwhelmingly to the Allies

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:42.240
and on April 6, 1917 the United
States officially entered the war.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.540
There followed a great
up swell of patriotism.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.820
Manifested musically in
George M. Cohan's Over There,

00:41:49.820 --> 00:41:54.170
allegedly written in a couple of
hours the day after the U.S. entry.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:57.000
We see it here in a later edition

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.640
with a famous cover
created by Norman Rockwell.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.160
But Over There was a
harbinger of times to come,

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.820
in that it was popularized as much
by recordings as by sheet music.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:13.460
First off the mark was
the American quartet.

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:18.160 position:56%
Followed a week later by Nora Bayes,
who was pictured on an early cover.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:23.890
But the most remarkable recording
was made by legendary tenor

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:29.860
and Enrico Caruso who recorded
two verses in two languages.

00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:35.380
This disc of a song written
by an Irish-American,

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:39.130
recorded by an Italian
singing in English

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:43.970
and in French was hugely
successful in the United States,

00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:47.970
Britain, Canada, and Australia.

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.380 position:56%
There was no better musical instance

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.510
of the alliance that
had been formed.

[ Music ]

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:46.550
&gt;&gt; Christina Bashford: As early as
1915, the popular music industry

00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:50.330 position:56%
in Britain moved beyond its
patriotic role as a recruiter of men

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:54.230
to buoy up spirits both at
home and further afield.

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:56.840
Publishers mailed sheet
music to troops stations

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:00.560
or training camps where, with
the aid of an upright piano

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:04.110
that had been commandeered
locally and a willing pianist,

00:46:04.110 --> 00:46:08.920 position:56%
soldiers' morale could be maintained
and boredom averted through song.

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:12.470
Men who had brought instruments
from home, a cornet, a violin,

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:15.710
a banjo, might join in, too.

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.750
Phonograph companies likewise
supplied free recordings

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:20.090
of wartime hits.

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:22.170
And entertainers were
ushered off to Flanders

00:46:22.170 --> 00:46:25.080
to help keep up soldiers' spirits.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.440
Some of the performers were
well known musical personalities

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.530
such as the singer Harry Lauder
celebrated for his comic routines

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.800
and performance of
stereotypical Scottishness.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:41.790 position:56%
Also, important to the story is Lena
Ashwell, a key figure in setting

00:46:41.790 --> 00:46:44.210
up entertainments for the troops.

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:47.630
Already famed as a
Shakespearean actor and a supporter

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:51.500
of women's rights, she campaigned
strongly during the wars early

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.820
months for the creation
of touring programs.

00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:57.510
She raised considerable
sums of money to fund them.

00:46:57.510 --> 00:47:00.130
And she also got the YMCA involved.

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:02.890
Promoting and improving
diet of accessible items

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:07.210
of classical music alongside
recitations and group singing.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:10.900
Most of these concert
parties, as they were known,

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.280
performed well back
behind the lines.

00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:16.280
And they, no doubt, provided relief
for soldiers who had been there

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.850
for weeks without a break.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:20.220
But when the momen
[assumed spelling] moved

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:23.500
up to the trenches life
was very different.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:25.720
As was any music making.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.860
Instruments were few.

be times when you would sit

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:38.370
around on the firestop, the
lads would talk and sing.

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:41.540
We had one chap who was
a very, very good singer.

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:45.390 position:56%
And he used to indulge in his
singing and lead us in the choruses.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.490
And he was always inclined
to get a bit sentimental.

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.410
We had to shut him up
for obvious reasons

00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:56.760
as we couldn't stand
too much of that.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:59.150
&gt;&gt; Christina Bashford: With
sentimentality to be avoided,

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:03.570
clever parodies of popular
songs proved much more the norm.

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:07.810

to Tickle Mary.

Yet most soldier songs
were far more graphic.

The book of Tommy's Tunes compiled
by Frederick Thomas Nettleingham

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.490
and published in 1917
gives many glimpses

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:24.480
of the psychological reality
of being on active service.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.590
Numbers such as I Don't
Want to Be a Soldier,

00:48:27.590 --> 00:48:31.030
or I Want to Go Home are
complemented by others

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:35.720
that are glossed with
sarcasm or biting satire.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.040
Church of England hymns became
especially favorite targets

00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.480
for parody.

00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:43.960
An apt means of attacking
the establishment credo

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:48.000
but wartime sacrifice was
all for God and country.

00:48:51.510 --> 00:49:43.110
[ Music ]

00:49:43.110 --> 00:49:44.410
&gt;&gt; Gayle Sherwood Magee:
Canadian troops struggled

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:45.710
to keep up morale, too.

00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:49.190
And began creating their own
concert parties on the front lines.

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:54.170
The most famous comedy troop was
The Dumbells formed in mid-1917

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.950
from active duty soldiers
in the CEFs third division.

00:49:57.950 --> 00:50:01.270
A typical Dumbell variety
show featured wartime hits

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:05.870 position:56%
such as It's a Long Way to Tipperary
alongside send ups of military life.

00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:08.520
After the war, the
Dumbells would find fame

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.430
in London's West End
and on Broadway.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:15.830 position:56%
Other Canadian entertainers included
Nova Scotia born Lieutenant Gitz

00:50:15.830 --> 00:50:19.610
Rice who performed as singer
and pianist in concert parties,

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.290
in addition to his
duties as a soldier.

00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:24.860
Rice's musical training
at the McGill Conservatory

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:28.480
in Montreal along with his
firsthand military experience

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.600
as a gunnery officer inspired
his work as a songwriter.

00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.340
Rice's songs achieved
widespread fame in Canada

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:37.360
and the United States, especially

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:40.070
after the American
entry into the war.

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:43.520
His most successful song
was Dear Old Pal of Mine.

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.050
Which he wrote while on duty
in Ypres and which became a hit

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:49.600
in sheet music and recordings.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:53.870
During the Battle of Vimy Ridge
on April 9 through 12, 1917,

00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:57.260
Rice was gassed along with
thousands of Canadian soldiers.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.640
He was discharged from
the CEF and worked

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.980
in Vaudeville through the 1920s.

00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:07.260
He died at age 56 in 1947 of
complications from bronchial asthma

00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.540
and long-term damage to his lungs.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:13.750
&gt;&gt; William Brooks: In the United
States enlisted vaudevillians

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:16.270
and musicians produced
entertainments both

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:19.270
at home and abroad.

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:22.930
Possibly the most famous musical
soldier was Irving Berlin,

00:51:22.930 --> 00:51:27.170
whose score and performance in
Yip, Yip Yaphank was seen first

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:30.980
in a New Jersey training
camp in summer 1918.

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:35.150
And then before and after
the armistice on Broadway.

00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:39.580
Nearer to the action,
though, was Elsie Janis.

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:43.060
A vaudeville star who not
only entertained the troops

00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:48.340 position:56%
but incorporated ex-soldiers into
her review Elsie Janis and Her Gang,

00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:52.100
which ran for over three
years in various venues.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:57.790
In Europe, however, the unexpected
musical stars were African-American

00:51:57.790 --> 00:51:59.960
soldiers and ensembles.

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:05.070
Most famously, James Reese
Europe's Hellfighters Band.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:08.920
Like Francophones in Canadian
and the Irish in Britain,

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.320 position:56%
African-Americans would take a
large step on the road to acceptance

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:15.490
and respect during the Great War.

00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:18.530
Although initially Wilson's
administration avoided recruiting

00:52:18.530 --> 00:52:23.090
African-Americans, and although
African-American regimens never

00:52:23.090 --> 00:52:27.930
served under American officers,
their troops fought with the French

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:33.100
and compiled a remarkable
record of service and valor.

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:35.050
James Reese Europe had enlisted

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:38.260
in the National Guard even
before the American entry

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.500
on September 18, 1916.

00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:44.220
He assembled a band of
remarkable musicians

00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.470
and the music they made caused
a sensation when they appeared

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:51.940
in France on New Year's Day 1918.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:53.920
The stylistic innovations that he

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:58.740 position:56%
and other African-Americans produced
would transform popular music

00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:03.950
in the post war decade in
America as well as France.

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:06.250
Gone was Ragtime.

00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:09.100
In its place, Jazz.

00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:11.960
Gone were mournful ballads.

00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:15.310
In their place the Blues.

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:18.980
Even more importantly,
gone were coon songs

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:22.600
and the most despicable
of racial stereotypes.

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.720
In their place arose the
beginnings of dignity

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:28.380
and honor for people of color.

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:33.710
&gt;&gt; Christina Bashford: By the
time the U.S. entered the war,

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:37.530
Britain was fully operating
under wartime conditions.

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.830
Right from the start, the
government had taken control

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:43.670
of its citizens lives,
mobilizing a mass male army,

00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:49.090
initially through volunteers,
and from 1916 by conscription.

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:53.300
Along side came a reconfiguration
of Britain's industrial economy.

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:57.010
As women took jobs in factories
or worked with munitions,

00:53:57.010 --> 00:54:02.370
communication, farming, nursing,
and other war effort duties.

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:04.340
Encouraged by national advertising

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:08.760
and the temporary dissolving
of gender stereotypes.

00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:12.910
In the musical world the empty
chairs in orchestras created

00:54:12.910 --> 00:54:16.860
as men went to war were
temporarily taken over by women

00:54:16.860 --> 00:54:20.970
who had long been denied such
professional opportunity.

00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:23.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gayle Sherwood Magee: In Canada
government censorship controlled the

00:54:23.110 --> 00:54:25.760
publication and distribution
of sheet music.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:29.050
Authorized songs reflected the
official narrative of progress

00:54:29.050 --> 00:54:33.160
from colony to nation and to a
unified anglophone Canadian culture

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.030
loyal to British rule.

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:37.490
These songs served to
recruit the army's volunteers

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:40.550
and to build popular
support for the war at home.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:43.890
Criticism of the war and realistic
representations of suffering

00:54:43.890 --> 00:54:46.270
by Canadian soldiers
were not allowed,

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:49.060
at least during the first
few years of the conflict.

00:54:49.060 --> 00:54:53.210
And official reports of the
war were relentlessly positive.

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:57.070 position:56%
On the home front, families were
encouraged to write cheerful letters

00:54:57.070 --> 00:54:59.710
to soldiers in training
and on the front lines.

00:54:59.710 --> 00:55:02.330
For their part, soldiers
tried to make light of life

00:55:02.330 --> 00:55:04.220
in the trenches in letters home.

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:07.240
Even as their private journals
expressed the harsh reality

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.000
of the western front.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.020
These documents reflect
a personalization

00:55:11.020 --> 00:55:13.670
of public discourse
concerning the war effort.

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:19.830
A denial of the horrors of war in
all but the most private spaces.

00:55:19.830 --> 00:55:22.500
&gt;&gt; William Brooks: June 6, 1916.

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:26.140
Dear Mother, you have probably
received my card telling you

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:27.950
that I was wounded.

00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:29.910
It's happily nothing very serious.

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:31.850
And I think that I will
be cured in a week.

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:33.150
Andre.

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.150
&gt;&gt; Justin Vickers: July 20, 1917.

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:44.410
My Dear Parents, I am writing
to you from a little paradise

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:47.500
where we are resting after
a stint in the trenches.

00:55:47.500 --> 00:55:50.120
Our camp is set up in a
field completely surrounded

00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:53.190
by a beautiful forest
in the French style.

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:55.700
Hardly touched by the bombardments.

00:55:55.700 --> 00:55:59.250
It is so restful to be in a
normal corner of the country.

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:00.550
Phillipe.

&gt;&gt; Laurie Matheson: August 29, 1918.

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:10.720
My Dear Boys, We will read a few
short verses from the big Bible

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.830
and pray for the victory that may
follow the uninterrupted march

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:16.650
that we have just read about.

00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:20.870
And we also pray for the European
families that we love so much.

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:23.370
And especially for our soldiers.

00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:27.570
We are presuming that the Canadian
advance is giving the topographers

00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:31.880
so much work that Andre
finds it impossible to write.

00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.400
Mother.

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.760
&gt;&gt; Gayle Sherwood Magee: Privately
soldiers recorded a different

00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.360
version of their experiences.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:42.690
&gt;&gt; William Brooks:
December 16, 2916.

00:56:42.690 --> 00:56:44.890
We had quite a night
of it in the barn.

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:51.420
It was cold and the rates
danced over us all night.

00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.170
April 12, 1917.

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:56.460
Mud up to our thighs.

00:56:56.460 --> 00:56:58.230
I've had no sleep whatsoever.

00:56:58.230 --> 00:57:03.430
October 31,1917.

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:08.000
I shall ever remember
the Hell we went through.

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:13.790
The United States entered the war

00:57:13.790 --> 00:57:15.990
with a great show of
collective resolve.

00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:19.460
But the country quickly
began to divide.

00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.920
On the one hand, there were great
national campaigns for support.

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:29.430
Manifested especially by promoting
a series of Liberty Loans support

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:32.940
for which transcended
class and region.

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:35.980
These were boosted by
promotional music written not only

00:57:35.980 --> 00:57:41.260
by Tin Pan Alley but by locals
like Earl Threlkeld of Charleston,

00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:46.060
Illinois, whose Buy a Bond was
adopted as an official song

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.260 position:56%
of the Fourth Liberty Loan campaign.

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:53.580
Publications like this produced by
people living in small communities

00:57:53.580 --> 00:57:56.100
and motivated in large
part by patriotism

00:57:56.100 --> 00:58:00.430
or civic duty played a large
part in home front displays

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:03.630
of support for the troops.

00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:06.590
Such support was actively
promoted by government agencies

00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:10.380
like George Creel's committee
on public information

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:15.020 position:56%
which produced posters, issues
press releases, and recruited a corp

00:58:15.020 --> 00:58:20.680
of Four-Minute Men who boosted
morale at rallies and in theaters.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:23.680
Creel's committee also sponsored
music in training camps run

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:28.440
by professional musicians and with
an approved uplifting repertoire.

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:32.980
But Creel's committee had
a darker side as well.

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:37.080
One that reflected a see
change in American culture.

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:41.810
The country was coming apart
despite the forced show of unity.

00:58:41.810 --> 00:58:45.280
Americans began to view
each other with suspicion.

00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:48.920
German-Americans, in particular,
were forced out of jobs

00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.520 position:56%
and isolated from wider communities.

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:56.480
Now, there were two
views about foreigners.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.640
On the one hand, the United States
continued to think of itself

00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:04.660
as a refuge, give me
your tired, the poor,

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:08.060
your huddled masses
yearning to be free.

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:13.940
But on the other, vigilante groups
sanctioned by the government began

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:17.870
to persecute immigrant
and ethnic minorities.

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:22.390
At times government interventions
constituted censorship,

00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:23.920
pure and simple.

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:29.960
Just after the war was declared two
obscure songwriters in New Jersey,

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:34.830
Joseph Woodruff and E.J. Pourmon
self-published After the War is

00:59:34.830 --> 00:59:38.440
Over Will There Be
any Home Sweet Home?

00:59:38.440 --> 00:59:43.190
With disturbing lyrics and
an equally disturbing cover.

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:47.120
The song became locally popular and
later that year it was purchased

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:51.740
by the Joe Morris Music
Company, a major New York firm.

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:56.520
Morris reissued it, dressed up
with slightly softened lyrics

00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:58.760
and its popularity continued.

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.660
But in spring 1918, the
song came to the attention

01:00:02.660 --> 01:00:06.770
of the army's military intelligence
division and as reported

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:11.350
by author Rupert Hughes, Joe
Morris' patriotism was appealed to

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:15.320
and as a result he promptly
changed the words to others

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.810
of a more inspiring
and cheerful nature.

01:00:18.810 --> 01:00:24.560
He also deleted the title tag
and replaced the cover image.

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:28.930
And in it's new upbeat version,
After the War is Over was printed

01:00:28.930 --> 01:00:32.520 position:56%
and reprinted to the end of the war.

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:35.230
Justin and Jeff will give
us both versions now.

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:39.680
First the original as
self-published in April 1917.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:43.470
And then the more inspiring
and cheerful song

01:00:43.470 --> 01:00:45.000
that the government imposed.

&gt;&gt; Christina Bashford: In and out

01:04:13.290 --> 01:04:16.810
of the British trenches despite
the dankness and squalor,

01:04:16.810 --> 01:04:19.500
verse of another sort came to life.

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:24.340 position:56%
Some of it was written by amateurs
who made forays into poetry clinging

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:27.590
to religion or patriotism
as a means of coping

01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:30.170
with their military assignments.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:34.700
As with this one, later printed
privately for the soldier's family,

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.000
which you can see for
yourself on the screen.

01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:46.190
But the most famous
of the soldier poets,

01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:48.800
when they entered the military,
were already living lives

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:53.080
through the written word, teaching
English, publishing poetry, essays,

01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:57.020
novels, working as
journalists, and so forth.

01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:59.860
Today enshrined as the war poets,

01:04:59.860 --> 01:05:03.850
this group includes Siegfried
Sassoon, Edward Thomas,

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:06.960
Rupert Brooke, Wilfred
Owen, and Isaac Rosenberg.

01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:11.870
And their work vividly communicates
the mix of fear, routine,

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:16.170
and searing horror that they
experienced on the front line.

01:05:16.170 --> 01:05:18.000
Again, you can see some
of it on the screens.

01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:32.900
Musicians signed up to serve
their King and country, too.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:36.230
Many of them were on the
threshold of significant careers.

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:39.690
Such as the young classical
composers George Butterworth,

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:44.080
Arthur Bliss, Cecil
Coles, and Iver Gurney.

01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:47.710
All fought, some were killed.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:52.200
The older Ralph Vaughn Williams
volunteered for the medical corp

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.130
and was deeply disturbed
by the experience.

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:58.530
In practical terms, writing music

01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:01.860
in the trenches was much more
challenging than writing poetry.

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:05.670
In as much as it required
special paper and a certain amount

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:09.900
of silence if not a
piano within reach.

01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:12.770
As a result, most war
pieces were composed

01:06:12.770 --> 01:06:15.560
after the conflict had ended.

01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:17.570
With a few exceptions.

01:06:17.570 --> 01:06:21.690
Coles was working on an orchestral
suite entitled Behind the Lines

01:06:21.690 --> 01:06:23.230
when he died.

01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:26.170
He had sent its third movement
back to his friend and mentor

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:27.960
in England, Gustav Holts.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:32.580
Then there was the
brilliant Iver Gurney

01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:35.750
who was both poet and composer.

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:39.100
In France he produced poems as
well as a few songs settings.

01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.440
Though he is experiences of war
would soon unravel through injuries

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:44.250
into serious mental collapse.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:48.120
And he would write most of
his war induced art songs

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:52.640
in an asylum back in
post-war Britain.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.470
Gurney's songs from
the front are imbued

01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:58.680
with poignant pastoral yearnings
for his native Gloucester.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:01.790
But there are also traces
of anger and revulsion

01:07:01.790 --> 01:07:05.020
at what was happening around him.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:09.640
His powerful setting of John
Masefield's By a Bierside,

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:15.640
written in a disused trench
mortar emplacement in August 1916

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:20.320
and a spell away from front line
duty puts the soldier's distress

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.620

had its own war poet as well.

01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:46.370
An obscure physician from
the small town of Guelph.

01:11:46.370 --> 01:11:50.980
In late April 1915, Canada's First
Division fought alongside French

01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:53.950
and British troops at the
second battle of Ypres.

01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:57.670
And as was reported in the British
and Canadian press, the untested

01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:00.830
but tenacious Canadians
performed valiantly.

01:12:00.830 --> 01:12:03.290
Despite the division
having more British veterans

01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:06.440
than Canadian born soldiers,
the victory became part

01:12:06.440 --> 01:12:09.510
of national lore almost
immediately with accolades

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:13.790
by British leadership praising the
"grand colonial type of manhood

01:12:13.790 --> 01:12:16.890
that we now recognize as
the cream of the race."

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:22.380 position:56%
Behind the public relations campaign
that emphasized glory and sacrifice,

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:25.080
the CEF suffered horrific losses.

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.420
Around a third of the divisions
18,000 men were killed,

01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.090
wounded, or missing.

01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:35.000 position:56%
With many casualties resulting from
the war's first use of chlorine gas.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:36.300
The battle inspired one

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:39.640
of the Canadian brigade's
physician's Lieutenant-Colonel John

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:45.110 position:56%
McCrea to write the most famous
poem of the war, In Flanders Fields.

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:47.250
With McCrea's permission
the poem was used

01:12:47.250 --> 01:12:50.010
to sell war bonds in
Canada and elsewhere.

01:12:50.010 --> 01:12:52.910
It inspired the symbolism
of the poppy as a means

01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:55.000
of keeping faith with
those who died.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.000
Which remained central to memorial
efforts through the present day.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.710
&gt;&gt; William Brooks: McCrea's
poem had an even greater impact

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:05.960
in the United States
than it did in Canada.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:09.530
It first appeared in 1916 but it
wasn't until the following year

01:13:09.530 --> 01:13:12.020
that it took hold with the public.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:15.120
Reprinted in almost
every American newspaper,

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:23.050
the poem inspired nearly 70
settings between 1917 and 1922.

01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:28.280
Composers ranged from a LaCrosse
housewife, Mrs. Percy Lloyd Cilley

01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:31.870
to the internationally known
pianist Josef Hoffmann.

01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:35.020
From Denver piano teacher Dolsey
Grossmyer [assumed spelling]

01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:38.880
to Boston composer Arthur Foote.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:42.320
Nearly all these settings
share one characteristic.

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.220
They are among the very best music
that their creators ever made.

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:50.070

from America's Progressives.

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.870
They are truly remarkable.

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:09.090
The first recorded performance was
in Vancouver on March 28, 1917.

01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:15.450
Of a setting by John Deane Wells,
an expatriate Australian organist

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:18.970
that was published
separately in Canada, England,

01:14:18.970 --> 01:14:23.550
and the United States and
went through four editions.

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:27.360
The second performance
was on April 15, 1917,

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:30.700
of a setting by Charles Ives.

01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:34.070
It was not nearly so successful.

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:37.840
Sousa's setting probably was
heard most frequently simply

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:40.170
because his band played it on tour.

01:14:40.170 --> 01:14:46.370 position:56%
On April 14, 1918 Frederick Donaghey
noted in the Chicago Tribune

01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:50.840
that four settings of In Flanders
Fields had been heard recently.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:54.130
One by Sousa, two others
by the Chicagoans,

01:14:54.130 --> 01:14:58.330
Susan Weare Hubbard,
and Alfred Hiles Bergen.

01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:01.550
And the fourth by Frank E. Tours.

01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:04.750
Tours was English by birth.

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:09.600
From a musical family, educated at
the Royal College of Music, London.

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:12.030
He conducted and wrote
operettas and musicals.

01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:13.990
And in 1910 he came to the States.

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:18.220
For the next 15 years he was
active on both sides of the ocean.

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:22.820
But he became an American
citizen on October 2,1917.

01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:25.440
And increasingly his
career was concentrated

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.260
in the U.S. His setting
is remarkable.

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:31.440
Very unlike his music for shows.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.420
And it was taken up by John
McCormack who first performed it

01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:39.930
at Carnegie Hall on
Easter Sunday, 1918.

01:15:39.930 --> 01:15:45.920 position:56%
We have then an Englishman's setting
of a Canadian's poem performed

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.320
by an Irishman in a
New York concert hall.

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:54.670
Again, a perfect example of the
musical alliance that was firmly

01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:57.000
in place by the final
months of the war.

signed in a French railway carriage
in the early hours of November 11,

01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:04.200
1918 came into effect at
11 a.m. Paris local time.

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:08.300
And with it, an end to
the formal hostilities.

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:13.380
The negotiation as to the terms
of the peace were to follow.

01:20:13.380 --> 01:20:15.850
In Britain the news spread rapidly.

01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:19.470
But even on this day of
wide jubilation and relief,

01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:22.820
death hovered in new guises.

to wipe out vast numbers

of the population world
wide had already taken hold

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.350
in Britain that spring.

01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:34.140
It soon intensified
bringing more grief

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.480
to families in the months to come.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:41.660

year of the war saw the introduction

01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:45.210
of conscription in Canada.

01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:48.200
Which resulted in violent
deadly riots within Quebec

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:50.880
as French-Canadian citizens
took to the streets.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:54.440
The post war era witnessed a new
low in English-French relations

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.400
that would fuel separatist
sentiments

01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.410
for the rest of the century.

01:20:58.410 --> 01:21:02.020

60,000 Canadian soldiers who died

in the conflict and
the more than 130,000

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:08.570
who were injured were erected
throughout Europe as symbols

01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:10.000

and sacrifice.

that the war would make the

And in negotiating the
Treaty of Versailles.

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:23.740
And proposing a visionary League
of Nations as an instrument

01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:26.130
to preserve peace, he attempted

01:21:26.130 --> 01:21:29.810
to extend a Progressive political
agenda to the world as a whole.

01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:33.530
But he suffered a stroke.

01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:36.260
The Treaty and the League
went down to defeat.

01:21:36.260 --> 01:21:39.410
And the Progressives
lost the 1920 election.

01:21:39.410 --> 01:21:43.200

1920s Britain attempted to reach

01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:46.990
out to Europe with international
veteran's organizations,

01:21:46.990 --> 01:21:50.210
economic alliances
and social action.

01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:53.290
It had its place at the League of
Nations, which was up and running

01:21:53.290 --> 01:21:56.050
without the United States.

01:21:56.050 --> 01:21:59.450
Though it aimed to prevent future
world conflict the League was

01:21:59.450 --> 01:22:01.990
to prove incapable of
stopping the aggressions

from Germany and Italy in the 1930s.

01:22:05.710 --> 01:22:08.460
Meanwhile, anxiety about
the prospect of another war

against France remained
high in Britain.

01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:13.320
And its relations with both Germany

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.710
and the U.S. were tended
to with care.

01:22:16.710 --> 01:22:18.450

signed the Treaty of Versailles

01:22:18.450 --> 01:22:20.520
as an independent sovereign nation.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:23.420
And served as a founding member
of the League of Nations.

01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:25.740
As one Canadian commentator
described it,

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:30.580 position:56%
"The next great achievement of the
human society heralded by the League

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:33.770

ramifications is what I venture

01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:35.810
to call nothing less
than the beginnings

01:22:35.810 --> 01:22:39.440
of a new international
civilization."

01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:44.610
&gt;&gt; William Brooks: The United
States was having none of this.

01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:48.070
It refused to join
international organizations.

01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:50.510
It sealed its borders.

01:22:50.510 --> 01:22:53.530 position:56%
And it severely limited immigration.

01:22:53.530 --> 01:22:58.070
It removed many of the mechanisms
that had been put in place

01:22:58.070 --> 01:23:03.850
to regulate the economy and to care
for the country's underclasses.

01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:08.890
Racism, lynching, and
bigotry surged.

01:23:08.890 --> 01:23:11.270
The rich got richer.

01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:13.900
Nine years later an overheated,

01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:17.340
underregulated economy
would plunge the country

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:20.250
into the Great Depression.

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:23.390
&gt;&gt; Christina Bashford: In 1930s
Britain, problems mounted.

01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:25.630
Unemployment forged
to unheard of levels

01:23:25.630 --> 01:23:29.650
as the U.S. crash impacted
the U.K. In India,

01:23:29.650 --> 01:23:34.320 position:56%
civil disobedience campaigns set off
alarms in the British government.

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.880
But the deepest consternation
arose from awareness

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:39.830
of what was happening in Germany.

01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:43.380
Still sore at its treatment by the
terms of the Treaty of Versailles,

01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:45.390
Germany and Hitler
was rearming itself

01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:48.110
and expanding its territories.

01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:52.010
British policy, which above all
else, sought to avoid the slaughter

01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:54.840
of another war was
one of appeasement.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:58.680
And it was popular with a fair
segment of the population.

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:04.420
In September 1938, the Conservative
Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain,

01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:07.050
along with the French Prime
Minister signed an agreement

01:24:07.050 --> 01:24:10.070
with Hitler permitting
his recent invasion

01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:13.120
of German speaking Czechoslovakia.

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:17.990
Chamberlain came home falsely
believing it guaranteed peace

01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:19.290
for our time.

01:24:19.290 --> 01:24:22.130
&gt;&gt; Gayle Sherwood Magee:
In 1931, Canada, Australia,

01:24:22.130 --> 01:24:25.110
and New Zealand became
independent nations with control

01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:28.730
over their militaries through
the Statute of Westminster.

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.030
It made no difference.

01:24:30.030 --> 01:24:32.830
In September 1939, when
Britain declared war

01:24:32.830 --> 01:24:35.050
on Germany, Canada followed suit.

01:24:35.050 --> 01:24:37.980
More than a million Canadian
fought in the second World War

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:43.000
and nearly 100,000
died or were wounded.

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.150
&gt;&gt; William Brooks: Charles
Ives saw most of this coming.

01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:51.000
And he lived long enough to witness
the tragic sequel of World War II.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:55.000
In the aftermath of
the 1920 election,

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:58.880
he wrote a bitter indictment
of the American retreat

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:04.230
from progressive thought
setting his own text to music.

01:25:04.230 --> 01:25:09.550
His lyrics are a litany of
ills that resonate still today.

01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:15.180 position:56%
Money interfering with democracy,
an electorate led by headlines only,

01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:17.780
politicians that distort the truth.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:24.700
But at the end he reaffirms
his faith, Progressivism,

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:28.330
belief in the freedom
and dignity of all,

01:25:28.330 --> 01:25:34.920
and a society that promotes
the welfare of all will return.

01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:40.620
Ives was, eventually, proven right.

01:25:40.620 --> 01:25:41.940
Progressivism did return.

01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:44.000
And it will return again.
