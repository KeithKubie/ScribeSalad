So by unfollowing everybody I kind of created this mental model of social media as a transactional economy

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:18.939
Where when somebody follows you?

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.280
You have to follow them back, or else you don't care about them, like they're not your friends.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.469
You don't want that. [Fade out.]

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.160
I started my youtube channel in the spring of my senior year of high school

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.679
the idea was kind of just to document my

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.419
experience going to Harvard because I hadn't really seen anyone tell that story before at the time

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.570
I was really into watching Casey Neistat on YouTube &amp; I thought it'd be really cool to just kind of start a daily vlog

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.200
For 50 days, I posted 50 videos consecutively a few of the videos started to get popular

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.120
I made one talking about how I got into Harvard which started to get a little bit of attention as you can imagine

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.840
with you know the clickbait title how I got into Harvard?

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.399
For a while and that video is kind of my story how I got into Harvard

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.329
So I think that did almost

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.578
100,000 views in a month and that was the first real experience for me where it's just like wow

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:08.899
This is that I could really do

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.489
I think the way that YouTube connects with academics for me at least and in

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:15.739
moreso with my general life at Harvard

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.280
I think in order to actually

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.580
really take in a lesson you need to reflect on it because it's very easy at Harvard

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.540
to just kind of continue just going through

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179
the motions and just you know going from class to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.520
Midterm to final to class there and so on.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.358
And not really taking a moment to pause and reflect and I think what YouTube allows

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:36.469
me is this ability to reflect this kind of time I that I take out at the same?

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.759
What am I really learning here? You know like what are the lessons? How am I changing? How am I growing and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.388
By dedicating that time to it it kind of ties it in together

00:01:44.388 --> 00:01:48.480
Well, it lets me look back and kind of see how I've grown and changed over time.
