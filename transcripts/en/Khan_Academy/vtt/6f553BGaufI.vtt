00:00:00.121 --> 00:00:01.514
- [Voiceover] So if you're in a room of some kind

00:00:01.514 --> 00:00:04.067
I encourage you to try a little experiment right now.

00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:05.415
So look around the room

00:00:05.415 --> 00:00:06.854
and see if there's something in the room

00:00:06.854 --> 00:00:11.127
that's made out of wood, or maybe paper, or cloth,

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:13.843
and it's been in the room for some time,

00:00:13.843 --> 00:00:15.933
so hopefully it has the temperature of the room.

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:18.139
And then find something else that's made out of metal

00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:20.368
that's also been sitting in the room for awhile

00:00:20.368 --> 00:00:22.179
and it doesn't have its own source of energy,

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.108
so don't use your computer.

00:00:23.108 --> 00:00:24.219
It should just be something that's been

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:25.724
passively sitting in that room for awhile,

00:00:25.724 --> 00:00:27.164
it's not too hard to find,

00:00:27.164 --> 00:00:29.068
and touch them both.

00:00:29.068 --> 00:00:30.543
And what you will see, is that even though

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:32.656
they've both been sitting in that room for awhile,

00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:36.208
the metal is going to feel a lot colder.

00:00:36.208 --> 00:00:38.530
The metal is going to feel colder.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.109
And this is a bit of a conundrum

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:42.710
because they've both been sitting in this room

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.985
for a while, so they both should take on

00:00:44.985 --> 00:00:46.634
the ambient temperature.

00:00:46.634 --> 00:00:48.120
So let's make this a little bit more concrete.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.117
Let's say that the temperature of the room

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:52.671
is 70 degrees fahrenheit.

00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:54.528
And the key for this feeling colder,

00:00:54.528 --> 00:00:56.432
is that the ambient temperature of the room

00:00:56.432 --> 00:00:59.729
is less than your body temperature.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.169
Your body temperature is going to be

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:07.031
roughly 98.6 degrees fahrenheit.

00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:10.427
So let me write this, this is body temperature.

00:01:10.427 --> 00:01:11.750
And the temperature at the surface

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.538
of your skin might be a little bit different than this,

00:01:13.538 --> 00:01:14.931
but let's just assume that it's

00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:19.064
roughly 98.6 degrees fahrenheit.

00:01:19.064 --> 00:01:21.293
And so, what's happening is, this metal one,

00:01:21.293 --> 00:01:24.683
this metal surface, isn't actually colder.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.076
It doesn't actually have a lower average

00:01:26.076 --> 00:01:29.466
kinetic energy than the wood surface.

00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.951
They've both been sitting in this room for a while,

00:01:31.951 --> 00:01:33.762
they're both going to have the ambient temperature

00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:38.336
of 70 degrees fahrenheit.

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:39.218
So what just happened?

00:01:39.218 --> 00:01:42.515
Why, to your skin, and to your brain,

00:01:42.515 --> 00:01:45.743
does the metal actually feel colder?

00:01:45.743 --> 00:01:47.693
And the simple answer is, it's better

00:01:47.693 --> 00:01:50.383
at taking the heat away from you.

00:01:50.383 --> 00:01:53.610
So why is it better at taking the heat away from me?

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.093
Well, let's just imagine, let's say that these

00:01:57.093 --> 00:02:05.475
here are the atoms on the surface of my skin.

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:07.542
So these are the atoms on the surface of my skin,

00:02:07.542 --> 00:02:09.237
the bottom of my skin, let's just say my hand

00:02:09.237 --> 00:02:11.024
is touching a surface like this.

00:02:11.024 --> 00:02:12.255
That's my thumb right over there,

00:02:12.255 --> 00:02:13.578
and I'm touching the surface.

00:02:13.578 --> 00:02:16.342
And it's going to have an average kinetic energy

00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:19.012
that would be in relation to a body temperature

00:02:19.012 --> 00:02:21.821
of 98.6 degrees fahrenheit.

00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:23.377
So these things are going to bounce around,

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:26.264
or vibrate around.

00:02:28.134 --> 00:02:30.215
And maybe the covalent bonds between

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:34.394
the carbon atoms and the other atoms

00:02:34.394 --> 00:02:37.784
on my skin that keeps them from breaking free fully,

00:02:37.784 --> 00:02:40.106
but they're going to be kind of oscillating around,

00:02:40.106 --> 00:02:41.870
bouncing around a little bit.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.680
And they'll even kind of push on each other,

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.662
and this could be kind of the electrostatic forces doing it.

00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:50.401
But they're going to have some average kinetic energy.

00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:52.468
And let's say my hand is touching both of these

00:02:52.468 --> 00:02:54.186
surfaces at the same time.

00:02:54.186 --> 00:03:03.009
So I have the wood surface, I'll do that in yellow.

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:05.656
So I have the wood surface, right over there.

00:03:05.656 --> 00:03:07.235
That is wood.

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:10.509
And I have the metal surface, I'll do that in white.

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:13.667
So I have the metal surface, right over here.

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:15.176
And this metal surface, we already talked about,

00:03:15.176 --> 00:03:17.939
is going to feel colder.

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.727
Let me draw the rest of my hand, actually.

00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:27.389
So the rest of my arm, you get the idea.

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.154
So what's going on here.

00:03:29.154 --> 00:03:32.265
So let's just think about it at a microscopic level.

00:03:32.265 --> 00:03:33.658
So the wood, first of all, its surface

00:03:33.658 --> 00:03:34.982
is going to be uneven.

00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:37.133
So you're going to have atoms up here,

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:39.084
but then you're going to have gaps,

00:03:39.084 --> 00:03:40.709
there's going to be air here.

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.613
Let me actually scroll down a little bit.

00:03:42.613 --> 00:03:45.004
So it's going to be like this,

00:03:45.004 --> 00:03:49.718
so you're going to have gaps like that.

00:03:49.718 --> 00:03:57.450
And it also has internal gaps, like that.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.029
So this would be the wood,

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.024
while the metal is much denser.

00:04:02.024 --> 00:04:05.019
And the surface is actually much smoother.

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.711
So the metal, let me do the metal in that white color,

00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:14.841
the metal atoms are much more closely packed.

00:04:14.841 --> 00:04:19.183
It is much denser, the surface is smoother,

00:04:19.183 --> 00:04:22.642
it won't have any internal air pockets,

00:04:22.642 --> 00:04:25.940
it's not going to have any internal air pockets in it.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.542
And so what's going to happen?

00:04:27.542 --> 00:04:29.515
Well, we've always said, you're going to have

00:04:29.515 --> 00:04:34.763
a transfer of heat from the higher temperature system,

00:04:34.763 --> 00:04:36.295
or the higher temperature thing,

00:04:36.295 --> 00:04:37.526
to the lower temperature thing.

00:04:37.526 --> 00:04:40.057
And so, they're already going to have some kinetic energy,

00:04:40.057 --> 00:04:42.448
these things are going to have an average kinetic energy

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:47.882
that's consistent with 70 degrees fahrenheit.

00:04:47.882 --> 00:04:50.459
So, let me just draw a couple of these arrows.

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:51.689
Same thing over here, they're going to have

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.963
the same average kinetic energy.

00:04:54.963 --> 00:04:57.308
So these things are all jostling around,

00:04:57.308 --> 00:04:59.073
bouncing around and pushing on each other

00:04:59.073 --> 00:05:02.092
with the electrostatic forces.

00:05:02.092 --> 00:05:06.155
So, hopefully this gives you an idea of things.

00:05:06.155 --> 00:05:08.059
But, my hand is warmer,

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:10.288
my hand has a higher average kinetic energy.

00:05:10.288 --> 00:05:13.631
And so the atoms and molecules of my hand

00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:14.607
are going to bounce into

00:05:14.607 --> 00:05:17.788
the atoms and molecules of the wood,

00:05:17.788 --> 00:05:20.806
and they're going to transfer the kinetic energy.

00:05:20.806 --> 00:05:22.617
But we realize in the wood is,

00:05:22.617 --> 00:05:24.150
I'm making less contact.

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.029
Because, first of all, the surface of the wood isn't smooth,

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:28.608
so I'm making less contact.

00:05:28.608 --> 00:05:30.442
So this one over here might just bump into

00:05:30.442 --> 00:05:31.835
another air particle, it actually won't

00:05:31.835 --> 00:05:33.344
bump into a wood particle.

00:05:33.344 --> 00:05:35.063
But some of the wood particles will start to

00:05:35.063 --> 00:05:39.219
take some of the kinetic energy away from me.

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:41.308
And I will sense that as being a little bit cool,

00:05:41.308 --> 00:05:42.841
so maybe that takes a little kinetic energy,

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.095
that bumps into this guy.

00:05:44.095 --> 00:05:47.717
So the kinetic energy does get transferred down.

00:05:47.717 --> 00:05:50.108
But it's going to be transferred down a lot slower

00:05:50.108 --> 00:05:51.803
than what would happen in the metal.

00:05:51.803 --> 00:05:54.683
Because, one, I don't have as much surface contact

00:05:54.683 --> 00:05:56.006
between my hand and the wood,

00:05:56.006 --> 00:05:57.097
because of these gaps.

00:05:57.097 --> 00:06:02.020
I also have air pockets in the wood, like this.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.831
And in general, the wood is less dense.

00:06:03.831 --> 00:06:06.246
So, there's going to be less collisions

00:06:06.246 --> 00:06:07.407
and it's going to take more time

00:06:07.407 --> 00:06:09.520
for that kinetic energy to be transferred

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.377
away from my hand.

00:06:11.377 --> 00:06:12.724
And the metal, on the other hand,

00:06:12.724 --> 00:06:16.787
as soon as this atom bumps into this one,

00:06:16.787 --> 00:06:18.134
that's going to bump into that one,

00:06:18.134 --> 00:06:19.063
that's going to bump into that one,

00:06:19.063 --> 00:06:20.409
that's going to bump into that one.

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:21.640
And that kinetic energy is going to be

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.375
very quickly transferred down the metal.

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:30.092
So it's going to be able to take more heat away from me.

00:06:30.092 --> 00:06:33.482
So this molecule over here is going to get

00:06:33.482 --> 00:06:36.941
some kinetic energy from a molecule in my hand.

00:06:36.941 --> 00:06:39.747
But then, it's going to bump into it's neighbor

00:06:39.747 --> 00:06:41.210
and transfer that kinetic energy.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.741
So it's going to lose it's kinetic energy quite quickly,

00:06:43.741 --> 00:06:45.993
and so it's ready to be bumped into again

00:06:45.993 --> 00:06:48.199
by another molecule from my hand,

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.708
and take on more kinetic energy.

00:06:49.708 --> 00:06:52.889
So it's going to sap the heat away from me faster.

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.186
So you have faster heat transfer,

00:06:56.186 --> 00:07:00.226
than you have with the wood.

00:07:00.226 --> 00:07:02.966
And, from your body's point of view,

00:07:02.966 --> 00:07:06.658
this heat being sapped away from you faster,

00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:08.051
even though the two surfaces are actually

00:07:08.051 --> 00:07:09.119
the same temperature,

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:13.043
you perceive this, your body perceives this

00:07:13.043 --> 00:07:20.305
right over here as being colder.
