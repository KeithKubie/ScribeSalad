00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.650
 Here I have an interesting system, 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.300
 I have two compartments - in the left compartment I have gas, 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.750
 which has a temperature of T with index a, 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.900
 and on the right side I have a gas that has a temperature T with index b. 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.320
 They are separated by a wall of depth d, 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.020
 or suppose you can say in thickness d. 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.980
 And the contact area of ​​the wall, 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.820
 or the contact area of ​​the gas with the wall, 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.580
 this area is A - and draw only part of it, 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.740
 we assume that these two compartments are completely separated. 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.940
 Now I'm curious - and we will accept, 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.920
 that the temperature on the left is higher than the temperature on the right 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.140
 and therefore you will have a heat transfer 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.840
 from left to right. 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.020
 And the heat that is transferred is called heat 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.320
 and we will label it with the letter Q. 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.560
 I wonder how the speed at which heat is transferred, 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.260
 or how much heat is transferred per unit of time - 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.080
 this is the rate at which heat is transferred - 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.150
 how this will change, depending on it 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.680
 how we change these different variables. 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.020
 For example, if our contact area increases, 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.140
 what will this do for Q / t? 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.490
 Then Q / t will also increase for a unit of time, 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.520
 because I have more space, 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.960
 in which these hot air particles or molecules 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.080
 can crash, and heat that wall. 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.820
 And then there will be a more heated wall, 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.890
 which will heat up the colder air particles. 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.120
 That is, in this case, the rate of heat transfer will also increase. 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.260
 And obviously, if I make my area smaller - 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.520
 maybe I have to explicitly write down this - 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.820
 and if I make my contact area smaller, 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.880
 then my heat transfer rate will decrease 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.520
 and this seems to be self-explanatory. 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.320
 And what about thickness? 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.520
 If you increase the thickness, 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.140
 if I make this wall thicker, 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.490
 what will it do with my transfer rate of heat? 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.440
 Then I will have more things to warm up, 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.480
 to make them with a certain temperature, 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.600
 which can then heat the particles to the right 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.240
 and obviously this is a continuous process - 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.300
 it will always be done, but there will be more things to heat up. 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.000
 And it will take more and more of this kinetic energy, 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.500
 this average kinetic energy will be displaced in this wall, 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.200
 if this wall becomes thicker. 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.200
 If the wall gets thicker, 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.150
 then the heat transfer rate will decrease. 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.380
 Or if the wall becomes thinner, if this depth is reduced, 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.200
 then the heat transfer rate will increase. 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.120
 That is, you can say that the speed of heat transfer 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.820
 will be inversely proportional to the thickness of the wall. 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.840
 What else can we think of? 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.450
 Well, for the differential temperature. 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:03:00.100
 This is T with index a minus T with index b. 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.680
 If this temperature differential increases, what will happen? 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.520
 By the way of logic we understand that if this is super hot here, 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.920
 it's much hotter than the right, 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.320
 then more heat will be transferred. 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.040
 You will have more heat transferred per unit of time, 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.880
 then the heat transfer rate will increase. 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.440
 Similarly, if this difference decreases - 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.920
 and you can take the extreme case - 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.620
 if there is no difference - 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.550
 if T with index a was the same as T with index b, 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.020
 then you will not have heat transfer in any time unit. 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.240
 It is logical that the heat transfer rate 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.050
 will be proportional to the temperature difference. 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.680
 How can we gather all these logical reasoning 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.620
 in a formula to describe the thermal conductivity, 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.860
 to think how quickly this heat will be transferred, 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.340
 the heat transfer rate? 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.650
 We can say that the rate of heat transfer - 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.820
 and I hope you know that this stems from our intuition 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.600
 for what is happening here - the speed of heat transfer, 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.100
 I can say that this will be proportional to - 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.140
 what will this be in proportion? 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.090
 It will be proportional to the area - 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.900
 the more surface area we have on this wall, the more contact area, 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.660
 the more heat will be transferred per unit of time, 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.420
 so this will be proportional to this contact area. 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.640
 It will also be proportional to the temperature differential, 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.140
 so let's multiply this by the temperature difference, 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.900
 ie T with index a minus T with index b. 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.760
 And this is inversely proportional to the thickness of the wall, 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.820
 that is to say, the thickness of the wall. 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.820
 Another thing you can say is: 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.780
 "Okay, I have this ratio of proportionality, 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.920
 but will not this be different for different materials? 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.760
 For example, if it was a metal wall, would it not have to carry heat faster, 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.740
 than if it were a wooden wall? " 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.960
 And that's true - a metal wall would do it. 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.790
 This K, this K here 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:05.120
 depends on the material - what the wall is made of. 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.440
 The material on the wall. 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.200
 And you can measure this and the different materials 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.840
 will have different thermal conductivity, 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.080
 which this variable will represent here. 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.120
 With a little intuition, we were able to find what looks like a twisted formula 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.280
 and sometimes you will see this formula like 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.300
 &amp; quot; solid conductivity thermal conductivity formula &amp; quot ;, 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.340
 but it actually comes in a logical way. 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.100
 The amount of heat transferred over time 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.020
 will be proportional to - 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.360
 and the proportionality factor will be material dependent. 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.540
 Styrofoam, for example, will have a very low coefficient, 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.830
 that's why the coolers are made of styrofoam. 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.890
 And it will depend on the area, 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.420
 will be proportional to the area, 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.920
 the temperature difference, 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.320
 and then it will be inversely proportional to the thickness. 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.010
 That is, if you want to isolate something, 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.520
 you will want to minimize surface area 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.980
 and you want to maximize the thickness, 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.240
 and you want to have something with very low thermal conductivity. 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.700
 So a thick wall of styrofoam, which may be a sphere, 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.500
 it can be a pretty good vessel to keep something hot or cold.
