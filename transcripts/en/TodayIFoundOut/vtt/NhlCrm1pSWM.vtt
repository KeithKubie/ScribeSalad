00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:15.880
The Tiny Nation of 
Sealand

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.439
Pirate radio, kidnapping, battles- the principality
of Sealand has seen all of these things and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.080
more, despite only being a tiny micronation
lying about 7 nautical miles the coast from

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.630
Suffolk, England.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.540
If you haven’t heard of Sealand before,
it is the site of one of Britain’s Maunsell

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.649
Naval Sea Forts that were utilized during
WWII.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.190
This particular one was originally named HM
Fort Roughs.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.780
The fort’s primary function was to keep
tabs on the Germans who were laying mines

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.809
off the coast of England at the time.

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.920
The structure itself was built on top of barge,
which was then towed out to the present day

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.359
location and sunk.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.079
Within about 30 minutes of the barge settling
on the ocean floor, the crew of about 100

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.469
soldiers had it up and running.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.489
(The fort itself can accommodate up to about
300 people.)

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.129
It remained in operation after the war for
a time, but was abandoned by the Royal Navy

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.710
in 1956.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.640
It was left unattended for another 11 years
before pirate radio broadcasters decided that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.380
it would make a perfect base of operations
due to being situated in international waters.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.630
However, in the same year, a competing broadcaster
by the name of Roy Bates, broadcaster of the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.170
illegal station “Radio Essex” aka “Britain’s
Better Music Station,” was caught by authorities

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.719
and ultimately needed a new location for his
pirate station.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.549
What better place for a pirate radio station
than at sea in international waters.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.500
Thus, he decided he wanted the fort for himself.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.610
Using his military training- he was a Major
in the British Army during the war- he managed

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.619
to evict the squatters…before becoming one
himself, along with his fifteen year old son,

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.539
Michael who aided in the fight to take over
the fort.

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:51.520
Bates never did utilise the fort for a radio
station though.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.100
Shortly after his hostile takeover, it became
illegal under British law, via the Marine

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.610
Broadcasting Offences Act, to broadcast pirate
radio, even outside a 3 mile radius of the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.610
coastline.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.840
Previously, this was perfectly legal outside
of that span.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.380
As a result, Bates did what any rational being
would – he declared his oceanic fort an

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.300
independent sovereignty and renamed it Sealand.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.190
Oddly, this was a perfectly legal move, thanks
to a loophole in the law that Bates’ attorney

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.190
found.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.830
Specifically, because the structure was not
only in international waters, but also had

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.540
been abandoned by the UK, it was legally up
for grabs to anyone who wanted it.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.130
The UK military did for a time consider re-taking
the fort, but decided if the Bates family

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.071
pressed them during the invasion- perhaps
firing on the military- and they were then

00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:40.690
forced to kill the family, it wouldn’t make
for good press; so they abandoned the idea.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.610
They did, however, destroy another of the
forts that was still in existence to avoid

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.930
any copycats.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.480
There was also an issue in 1968 where Michael
fired on a group of engineers that were working

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.090
on some buoys near Sealand.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.370
At one point, they started making catcalls
up at Michael’s sister, Penny, and shouting

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.270
various lewd remarks.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.040
Prince Michael didn’t take kindly to the
Princess of Sealand being spoken to in such

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.120
an uncivilised manner, so fired several warning
shots to shut them up.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.100
It worked, but he was arrested once he returned
to the mainland.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.470
However, because the event took place in international
waters and the platform, according to the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.610
court, was no longer under British jurisdiction,
they let him off scot-free.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.720
This was a landmark ruling as now the British
court system had officially declared the fort

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.700
free from British rule.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.050
With the court’s 1968 ruling, by 1975, Bates
was doing his best to prove that he was serious

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.000
about Sealand being a country.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.460
At the encouragement of his wife, Joan, he
wrote a constitution, designed a flag, wrote

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.940
a national anthem, invented a unit of currency
and even had postage stamps made up.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.890
In the following years, he would also add
passports to that list, which to this day

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.450
you can purchase.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.860
During this time, he was approached by a myriad
individuals and organisations wishing to use

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.900
Sealand’s location for their own gain.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.610
Bates turned them all away, at least until
1978.

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.310
A group of self proclaimed diamond merchants
from the Netherlands and Germany asked Bates

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.370
and his wife to join them in Austria so they
could discuss a business proposition.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.860
Everything seemed to be legitimate until the
meeting time came and went without the group

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:07.860
showing up.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.950
Concerned, Bates attempted to make contact
with Michael via phoning some fisherman, but

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.100
learned from these fisherman that a helicopter
had been spotted over the ‘country’.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.870
It turns out, the fort had been taken and
Prince Michael had been locked in a cell without

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.120
any food or water, before being deposited
in the Netherlands with no ID or money.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.000
The invaders were a group led by the self-proclaimed
Prime Minister of Sealand, German lawyer Alexander

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.689
Achenbach, who had hired Dutch, Austrian,
and German mercenaries to aid him in taking

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:35.900
over the fort.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.280
Bates wasn’t going to give up his country
so easily, though according to Michael was

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.150
furious that his son had let the helicopter
land.

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.849
The Fort itself is actually reasonably hard
to invade given that there are no ladders

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:51.039
or any such method of scaling from below,
and the only other way to invade is via helicopter,

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:55.199
which is easily fended off with rifles, assuming
you aren’t being fired on yourself, which

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.599
Michael wasn’t.

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.680
Once reunited with his son, Bates and Michael
armed themselves and enlisted the aid of a

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.930
helicopter pilot who had worked on the James
Bond franchise, which is very fitting here.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.520
According to Michael, they approached the
fort into the wind, to mask the sound of the

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.699
helicopter, and chose dawn to strike when
the invaders were likely to be groggy or still

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.710
asleep, but there was still enough light to
attack by.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.719
Michael and his father slid down ropes that
were suspended from the helicopter, the former

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:23.819
armed with a sawed-off shotgun and the latter
with a pistol.

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:27.069
The usurpers emerged from the fort to see
what was going on.

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.970
While many reports say Michael fired a warning
shot at them, which scared the invaders out

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.259
of their wits (no doubt also because of the
action hero-like entrance), Michael doesn’t

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:36.259
claim such.

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:39.591
He said in an interview that when he landed,
he dropped his gun and when the butt hit the

00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:43.729
deck, the gun went off, nearly causing himself
to be shot in the process.

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.270
Nevertheless, when the invaders saw the princes
of Sealand had returned armed, they surrendered

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:53.150
immediately and were subsequently tried and
found guilty of treason, then held as POW’s

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.870
until their home countries could negotiate
their release.

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:00.900
The price of this release was set at about
the equivalent of $35,000 in Deutsche Marks,

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.860
or about $125,000 today.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.069
Those nations appealed to the UK to intervene
to get their citizens back, but the UK government

00:06:08.069 --> 00:06:12.689
declined to step in, citing the 1968 court
decision concerning Michael’s shooting at

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:16.400
the engineers where the court had declared
the fort independent of the UK.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.499
Thus, they were absolved of any responsibility
or obligation in the matter.

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:24.190
This was a double-win for the Bates family,
as once again the UK government seemed to

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.830
be supporting their claim of sovereignty.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.870
Germany then sent one of their diplomats to
negotiate the release of the POWs.

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.830
This also bolstered the Bates family’s claim
that Sealand was an independent nation, or

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:40.539
so the family stated, as Germany had now undergone
diplomatic relations with the micronation.

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.539
After a couple weeks of negotiation, the Bates
family let the invaders go.

00:06:44.539 --> 00:06:48.599
However, once back home, the ousted Prime
Minister of Sealand, Achenbach, setup the

00:06:48.599 --> 00:06:53.349
Sealand Rebel Government, as a “government
in exile” and the true rulers of Sealand.

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:58.710
No one else bothered to try and utilise the
country again until the Falklands War in 1982.

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.819
Some Argentineans asked Bates to sell Sealand
to them due to its proximity to England.

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:05.009
He respectfully declined.

00:07:05.009 --> 00:07:09.440
These days, Sealand generates income by offering
titles to regular Joes like you and me.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.319
For a mere £29.99 you can become a Lord or
Lady of Sealand.

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:19.500
Or, if you’ve got extra cash to blow, you
can shell out £199.99 and become a Count

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.699
or Countess of the micronation.

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:24.889
The future of Sealand is somewhat ambiguous
at the present time.

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:29.479
Prince Roy (I don’t know why he didn’t
go straight for King Roy) passed away in 2012,

00:07:29.479 --> 00:07:34.009
leaving Prince Michael as his heir, himself
up there in years at 62, though he does have

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:36.629
two heirs- Liam and James Bates.

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:40.120
As for the years ahead, there has been talk
of expansion and the possibility of opening

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.550
a casino or resort on site.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:46.139
Bonus Facts:
• In 2008, representatives of Sealand won

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:48.009
the world egg throwing championship.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:53.120
Sealand participates in various sporting events,
often with athletes from various nations volunteering

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.499
to represent the nation.

00:07:56.499 --> 00:08:00.409
• In 2007, the popular torrent site, The
Pirate Bay, attempted to purchase Sealand,

00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:01.749
but were turned away.

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:05.939
The Bates family are loath to allow anything
so controversial to exist on the fort, for

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:09.720
fear the UK may decide to re-take it after
all these years.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.569
That said, in 2000, Sealand became home to
HavenCo – a data hosting services company

00:08:14.569 --> 00:08:17.939
with Michael Bates listed as one of the directors
of the company.

00:08:17.939 --> 00:08:24.270
The company later ceased to be in 2008, but
in 2013 was resurrected.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:41.389
• The official motto of the Principality
of Sealand is “E Mare Libertas,” – “From

00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:42.710
the Sea, Freedom”.
