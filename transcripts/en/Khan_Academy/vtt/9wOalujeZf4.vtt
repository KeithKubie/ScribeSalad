00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.360
So you may or may not already
know that any linear equation

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.300
can be written in the form
y is equal to mx plus b.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.630
Where m is the slope
of the line.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.590
The same slope that we've
been dealing with

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.580
the last few videos.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.300
The rise over run of the line.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.090
Or the inclination
of the line.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.920
And b is the y-intercept.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.630
I think it's pretty easy
to verify that b is a

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:27.310
y-intercept.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.350
The way you verify that is you
substitute x is equal to 0.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.590
If you get x is equal to 0--
remember x is equal to 0, that

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.580
means that's where we're going
to intercept at the y-axis.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.630
If x is equal to 0, this
equation becomes y is equal to

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.650
m times 0 plus b.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.430
m times 0 is just
going to be 0.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.520
I don't care what m is.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.620
So then y is going
to be equal to b.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.075
So the point 0, b is going
to be on that line.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.510
The line will intercept the
y-axis at the point

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.540
y is equal to b.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.060
We'll see that with
actual numbers in

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.420
the next few videos.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.080
Just to verify for you that m
is really the slope, let's

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.310
just try some numbers out.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.840
We know the point 0,
b is on the line.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.465
What happens when
x is equal to 1?

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.450
You get y is equal
to m times 1.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.210
Or it's equal to m plus b.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.200
So we also know that the
point 1, m plus b

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.290
is also on the line.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:36.490
Right?

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.900
This is just the y value.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.770
So what's the slope between
that point and that point?

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.280
Let's take this as the end
point, so you have m plus b,

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:52.030
our change in y, m plus b minus
b over our change in x,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.770
over 1 minus 0.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.740
This is our change in
y over change in x.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.660
We're using two points.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.480
That's our end point.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.120
That's our starting point.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.100
So if you simplify this,
b minus b is 0.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.840
1 minus 0 is 1.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.500
So you get m/1, or you
get it's equal to m.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.510
So hopefully you're satisfied
and hopefully I didn't confuse

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.410
you by stating it in the
abstract with all of these

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.410
variables here.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.140
But this is definitely going
to be the slope and this is

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.580
definitely going to be
the y-intercept.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.360
Now given that, what I want to
do in this exercise is look at

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.890
these graphs and then use the
already drawn graphs to figure

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.860
out the equation.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.550
So we're going to look at these,
figure out the slopes,

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.650
figure out the y-intercepts and
then know the equation.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:48.440
So let's do this line A first.
So what is A's slope?

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.670
Let's start at some
arbitrary point.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.620
Let's start right over there.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.430
We want to get even numbers.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.070
If we run one, two, three.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.550
So if delta x is equal to 3.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.820
Right?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.550
One, two, three.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.640
Our delta y-- and I'm just doing
it because I want to hit

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:15.430
an even number here-- our delta
y is equal to-- we go

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.330
down by 2-- it's equal
to negative 2.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.790
So for A, change in
y for change in x.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.400
When our change in x is 3, our
change in y is negative 2.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.860
So our slope is negative 2/3.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.790
When we go over by 3, we're
going to go down by 2.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.920
Or if we go over by 1, we're
going to go down by 2/3.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.790
You can't exactly see it there,
but you definitely see

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.800
it when you go over by 3.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.430
So that's our slope.

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.380
We've essentially done
half of that problem.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.280
Now we have to figure
out the y-intercept.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.580
So that right there is our m.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.810
Now what is our b?

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.340
Our y-intercept.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.120
Well where does this intersect
the y-axis?

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.260
Well we already said
the slope is 2/3.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.250
So this is the point
y is equal to 2.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.610
When we go over by 1 to the
right, we would have

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.880
gone down by 2/3.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.000
So this right here must
be the point 1 1/3.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.370
Or another way to say it,
we could say it's 4/3.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.920
That's the point y
is equal to 4/3.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.660
Right there.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:17.560
A little bit more than 1.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.269
About 1 1/3.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.029
So we could say b
is equal to 4/3.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:27.300
So we'll know that the equation
is y is equal to m,

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.850
negative 2/3, x plus
b, plus 4/3.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.590
That's equation A.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.600
Let's do equation B.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.860
Hopefully we won't have
to deal with as

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.510
many fractions here.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.360
Equation B.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.420
Let's figure out its slope
first. Let's start at some

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.830
reasonable point.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.510
We could start at that point.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:49.650
Let me do it right here.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.380
B.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.030
Equation B.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.100
When our delta x is equal
to-- let me write it

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.960
this way, delta x.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.040
So our delta x could be 1.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.640
When we move over 1 to the
right, what happens

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.480
to our delta y?

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.270
We go up by 3.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.710
delta x.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.670
delta y.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:11.140
Our change in y is 3.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.710
So delta y over delta x, When
we go to the right, our

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.940
change in x is 1.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.830
Our change in y is positive 3.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.760
So our slope is equal to 3.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.410
What is our y-intercept?

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.550
Well, when x is equal to
0, y is equal to 1.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.160
So b is equal to 1.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.210
So this was a lot easier.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.430
Here the equation is y is
equal to 3x plus 1.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.280
Let's do that last line there.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.100
Line C Let's do the y-intercept
first. You see

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.820
immediately the y-intercept--
when x is equal to 0, y is

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.040
negative 2.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.380
So b is equal to negative 2.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.300
And then what is the slope?

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.220
m is equal to change in
y over change in x.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.880
Let's start at that
y-intercept.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.630
If we go over to the right
by one, two, three, four.

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.570
So our change in x
is equal to 4.

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.380
What is our change in y?

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.945
Our change in y is positive 2.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.780
So change in y is 2 when
change in x is 4.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.390
So the slope is equal
to 1/2, 2/4.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.870
So the equation here is y is
equal to 1/2 x, that's our

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.750
slope, minus 2.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:36.560
And we're done.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.480
Now let's go the other way.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.850
Let's look at some equations of
lines knowing that this is

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.900
the slope and this is the
y-intercept-- that's the m,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.340
that's the b-- and actually
graph them.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.320
Let's do this first line.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.030
I already started circling
it in orange.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.350
The y-intercept is 5.

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.800
When x is equal to 0,
y is equal to 5.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.240
You can verify that
on the equation.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.920
So when x is equal to 0, y is
equal to one, two, three,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.590
four, five.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.890
That's the y-intercept
and the slope is 2.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:08.330
That means when I move 1 in the
x-direction, I move up 2

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.770
in the y-direction.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.490
If I move 1 in the x-direction,
I move up 2 in

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:12.990
the y-direction.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.050
If I move 1 in the x-direction,
I move up 2 in

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.320
the y-direction.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.550
If I move back 1 in the
x-direction, I move down 2 in

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.830
the y-direction.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.160
If I move back 1 in the
x-direction, I move down 2 in

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.750
the y-direction.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.970
I keep doing that.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.130
So this line is going to look--
I can't draw lines too

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.060
neatly, but this is going
to be my best shot.

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.240
It's going to look something
like that.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.100
It'll just keep going on,
on and on and on.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.140
So that's our first line.

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:40.720
I can just keep going
down like that.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.420
Let's do this second line.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.200
y is equal to negative
0.2x plus 7.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.910
Let me write that. y is equal
to negative 0.2x plus 7.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:55.450
It's always easier to
think in fractions.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:57.420
So 0.2 is the same
thing as 1/5.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:03.500
We could write y is equal to
negative 1/5 x plus 7.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.000
We know it's y-intercept at 7.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.270
So it's one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.100
That's our y-intercept
when x is equal to 0.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.240
This tells us that for every
5 we move to the right,

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:18.120
we move down 1.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.330
We can view this as
negative 1/5.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.590
The delta y over delta x is
equal to negative 1/5.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.430
For every 5 we move to the
right, we move down 1.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.370
So every 5.

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:31.550
One, two, three, four, five.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:32.650
We moved 5 to the right.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.169
That means we must
move down 1.

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:36.309
We move 5 to the right.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.690
One, two, three, four, five.

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.549
We must move down 1.

00:08:40.549 --> 00:08:44.740
If you go backwards, if you move
5 backwards-- instead of

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.260
this, if you view this
as 1 over negative 5.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.450
These are obviously equivalent
numbers.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.060
If you go back 5-- that's
negative 5.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.500
One, two, three, four, five.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.805
Then you move up 1.

00:08:56.805 --> 00:09:00.050
If you go back 5-- one,
two, three, four,

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:01.830
five-- you move up 1.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.110
So the line is going
to look like this.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:07.000
I have to just connect
the dots.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.020
I think you get the idea.

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.170
I just have to connect
those dots.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:11.170
I could've drawn it a little
bit straighter.

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.840
Now let's do this one, y
is equal to negative x.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.800
Where's the b term?

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.940
I don't see any b term.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:22.490
You remember we're saying
y is equal to mx plus b.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.670
Where is the b?

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.780
Well, the b is 0.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.770
You could view this as plus 0.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.290
Here is b is 0.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.710
When x is 0, y is 0.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.080
That's our y-intercept, right
there at the origin.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.490
And then the slope-- once again
you see a negative sign.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:40.710
You could view that as
negative 1x plus 0.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:42.200
So slope is negative 1.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.570
When you move to the right by
1, when change in x is 1,

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:47.690
change in y is negative 1.

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:52.320
When you move up by 1 in x,
you go down by 1 in y.

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:55.580
Or if you go down by 1 in x,
you're going to go up by 1 in

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:57.660
y. x and y are going to
have opposite signs.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:58.850
They go in opposite
directions.

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.955
So the line is going
to look like that.

00:10:03.955 --> 00:10:06.550
You could almost imagine it's
splitting the second and

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.240
fourth quadrants.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.980
Now I'll do one more.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.160
Let's do this last
one right here.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.830
y is equal to 3.75.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.610
Now you're saying, gee,
we're looking for y is

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.630
equal to mx plus b.

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:22.940
Where is this x term?

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:24.650
It's completely gone.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:27.980
Well the reality here is, this
could be rewritten as y is

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:33.240
equal to 0x plus 3.75.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.120
Now it makes sense.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.500
The slope is 0.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.020
No matter how much we change
our x, y does not change.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.930
Delta y over delta
x is equal to 0.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.770
I don't care how much
you change your x.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.220
Our y-intercept is 3.75.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:51.870
So 1, 2, 3.75 is right
around there.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.710
You want to get close.

00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:54.990
3 3/4.

00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:57.620
As I change x, y will
not change. y is

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:00.570
always going to be 3.75.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:03.200
It's just going to be
a horizontal line at

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.450
y is equal to 3.75.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.600
Anyway, hopefully you
found this useful.
