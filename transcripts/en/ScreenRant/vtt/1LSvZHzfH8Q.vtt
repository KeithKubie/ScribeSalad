00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.420
Improvisation can take a scene to the next
level whether it is a comedic or a dramatic

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.630
scene but a great improvisational scene is
not known by the audience when watching it.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.029
We are going to look at ten scenes that were
improvised by their actors that actually worked

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.949
and you didn’t even know about.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.900

And don’t worry, we promise not to talk
about Leonardo DiCaprio cutting his hand in

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.440
Django Unchained but we will show another
gem from the actor.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.219
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Improvised
Movie Moments That Took the Scene To Another

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:54.539
Level.

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.059
The Hangover

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:00.530
Zack Galifianakis has this to say about this
scene, “The one improv that will haunt me

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.399
for the rest of my life.”

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.629
Talk about a buildup.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.360
When working with babies in films, it is common
to use a doll for rehearsals and shots that

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.690
are not close-ups.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.750
During a take Galifianakis took his prop doll
he was holding and had it mimic a sexual act

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.660
to make the director laugh.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.970
The director immediately said, “‘Oh, we
have to put that in the movie.”

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.760
And that’s exactly what they did.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.630
That’s one of the funniest moments in the
movie and we’re glad Galifianakis did it

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.630
despite his regret.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.630
Thor

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.630
Kenneth Branagh the director of Thor has directed
some amazing Shakespeare adaptions including

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.630
1996’s Hamlet.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.630
He knows how to get a performance out of his
actors and with the chance to stray from the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.630
script he took that advantage.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.630
Branagh asked Anthony Hopkins to improvise
his lines during Thor’s banishment scene

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.630
to achieve a higher stage of emotion.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.630
Crew members and actors cried during his performance
and even Hemsworth and Hiddleston said it

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:35.630
was hard not to break down during the filming
of this scene.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.630
Great job Sir Anthony Hopkins!

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.630
Good Morning Vietnam

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.630
Robin Williams was a comedy genius and even
though you already knew this, we like to remind

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.630
you.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.960
He worked with another comedy legend on the
film Good Morning Vietnam, director Barry

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.340
Levinson who was a writer for comedy legends
like Mel Brooks and Tim Conway.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.600
During the filming of Good Morning Vietnam
both men knew the broadcast scenes were poorly

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.310
written so Williams improvised all of them
as Levinson gave him feedback and suggestions.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.920
The improvisation between the two men worked
out and gave Williams his first of four Academy

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.420
Award nominations.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.890
Do you know which film Robin Williams won
an Academy Award for?

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:54.959
We’ll tell you the answer at the end of
our video.

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.290
Bridesmaids

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.870
One thing is certain about the movie Bridesmaids,
if you have seen the film you cannot forget

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.109
the scene when Maya Rudolph’s stomach kicks
in and she runs through the street.

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.209
As she crosses the street she fails to make
it to a bathroom and sits in the middle of

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:10.920
the street to do her business.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.469
You also got Melissa McCarthy doing the same
thing a sink and even if you want to forget

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:17.569
the scene, you’re not going to.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.670
Still it’s hilarious and 100% improvised,
they didn’t even have it in the script and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.030
it’s one of the funniest scenes in the movie.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:38.970
Looks like potty humor still works.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:04:04.529
Crazy, Stupid, Love

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:09.159
Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have become quite
the pair on screen with their success in La

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.920
La Land even if they only won best picture
for a few moments.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.180
Their first film together Crazy, Stupid, Love
showed their dynamic on screen together and

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.980
some of that dynamic came from improvisation.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.880
Gosling added the Dirty Dancing lift to their
scene because when he went out drinking with

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.840
friends that’s what they would do.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.470
For Goslings sake we hope it wasn’t in bars
or someday it will show up on YouTube.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.510
Do you know how many films Emma Stone and
Ryan Gosling have been in together?

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.500
Was it one, two or three?

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.600
Stick around to the end of our video for the
answer.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.600
The Dark Night

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600
There is a reason Heath Ledger won the Academy
award for best supporting actor posthumously

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600
for the role of the Joker in The Dark Night.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.600
There are numerous little moments he improvised
while filming that brought even more depth

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.600
to his character but only one that involved
an explosion.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600
While blowing up the hospital, Ledger didn’t
know there would be a small explosion before

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.600
the big one so his reaction to only a small
explosion was improvised.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.160
He nailed that scene and luckily he did because
explosions are pricey.

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.420
Animal House

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.560
The loss of John Belushi hit the heart of
the comedy community hard and his work in

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.470
Animal House shows why.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.880
With the lift of an eyebrow he can make you
burst into laughter.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.730
One of the films highlights is his improvised
moment in the cafeteria when he fills his

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:10.660
mouth with mashed potatoes.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.890
The response from the actors are real because
they didn’t know what he was going to do,

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.270
actually most of the dialogue at the table
is improvised by Belushi.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.870
It’s a shame he’s gone today because he
was one funny guy and wouldn’t it be nice

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.600
to see a follow up to Animal House?

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.690
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.040
Dawn of Justice brings three iconic heroes
together in the same film to fight the same

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.430
villain, Doomsday.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.620
This is probably good news for Batman since
his reaction to seeing the villain born on

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.670
Krypton was not one of optimism.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.900
When Batman gets his first glimpse of “The
Ultimate” he lets out a realistic reaction

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.500
that we could all relate to.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.410
This was improvised by Ben Affleck because
he felt that’s the way his character would

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:58.340
react, he is only a man of course.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:05.030
At least he didn’t turn around and leave
the work to only Superman and Wonder Woman.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.170
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part
2

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:12.440
With well-deserved Oscar nominations in Schindler’s
List and The English Patient it was exciting

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.520
to learn that Ralph Fiennes was joining the
cast of Harry Potter.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.640
In his final scenes of the Harry Potter franchise
he improvised his hallowing speech to the

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:30.170
cast because he wanted the cast to fear him
and get a fresh reaction to his performance.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.530
Even during rehearsal Fiennes improvised his
final speech just to ensure he got what he

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:35.530
wanted.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.500
Do you know which superhero film Ralph Fiennes
played a character in?

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.650
We’ll give you a hint before we tell you
the answer at the end of our video, he’s

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.000
miniature.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.060
The Wolf of Wall Street

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:51.420
Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese have
produced a great working relationship bringing

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.680
us films like The Departed, The Aviator and
The Wolf of Wall Street.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.620
The two men have a high regard for each other
and trust each other’s instincts.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.750
When filming The Wolf of Wall Street DiCaprio
wanted to improvise his drugged out “walk”

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.580
to his car and Scorsese loved the idea.

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:11.310
A walk downstairs and getting into your car
sounds easy but not when you are on Quaaludes

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.750
as DiCaprio shows us.

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:16.470
At least he made it home with no accidents
or at least that’s what he thought.

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:21.230
There you have it ten Improvised Movie Moments
That Took the Scene To Another Level.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.750
Here are the answers to our trivia questions:

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.890
Robin Williams won a well-deserved Academy
Award for 1997’s Good Will Hunting.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:32.200
Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling have been in three
films together, Crazy Stupid Love, Gangster

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:33.200
Squad and La La Land.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.090
And Ralph Fiennes played Batman’s butler
Alfred in The Lego Batman Movie.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.090
How many of those trivia questions did you
get right?
