[music playing]

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.755
NARRATOR: After spending the
morning making arrangements

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:09.175
to explore what remains of the
Hackley Union National Bank

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:14.055
building, Civil War researcher
Kevin Dykstra and his team

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:17.475
return with the tools they will
need to search the basement

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:19.811
for proof of his theory--

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:23.440
that a group of Union officers
stole six wagons filled

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.025
with Confederate
gold and silver,

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:28.903
brought it up to Muskegon,
Michigan by train,

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:31.030
and then deposited
it with millionaire

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.908
Charles Hackley,
who hid it for them

00:00:33.908 --> 00:00:35.869
in one of his many bank vaults.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:37.579
[music playing]

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:42.917
So which one's
got treasure in it?

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:43.918
These bottom ones do.

00:00:43.918 --> 00:00:44.711
You think the bottom ones?

00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.463
That's what I think.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.132
If we can find something here
in these safety deposit boxes,

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:51.801
it'll help prove that
the Confederate gold

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.762
came from Irwinville,
Georgia, right

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:55.221
here to Muskegon, Michigan.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.724
It'll be all worth it.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.726
Yeah, it's probably
already got--

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:03.062
Right there, gentlemen, is
about 45 boxes right there.

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.689
I think if I
can find something

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.067
here that Marty Lagina would
be extremely impressed.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:10.403
If I can come up with
one gold coin out

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.489
of these safety
deposit boxes, it might

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:13.448
just push him over the top.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:18.536
You got it?

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:19.871
Shake, shake it.

00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.207
Shake it, just like
a Christmas package.

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:24.501
Well, I got a
feeling it's empty.

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:25.835
Well, let's see
if we can open it.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:26.419
It's gold.

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:31.090
Oh.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.175
Nope.

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:33.301
Can your heart
handle 400 more?

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:34.010
No.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.719
[laughter]

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:36.221
How about more?

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.723
It felt as though we were
going to find something

00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:42.560
in these boxes,
whether it was gold,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.481
whether it was incriminating
evidence of some sort.

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:49.275
But every box weighed
about two pounds.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.027
Not very heavy.

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:52.904
I mean, you could shake it and
realize there's nothing in it.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:55.073
We started feeling a
little bit deflated.

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:55.865
They're empty.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:56.533
They're empty.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:58.034
They're empty.

00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:00.453
NARRATOR: After hours
of exhausting work

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:03.748
and having found no evidence
of Confederate gold,

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:06.042
Kevin Dykstra's
optimism for a critical

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.712
find is quickly eroding.

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:12.298
What you thinking?

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.591
It doesn't make
any-- oh, thanks.

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:14.592
You're welcome.

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:15.802
It doesn't make any sense.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.262
What?

00:02:17.262 --> 00:02:19.764
These are out here
and not in there.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:21.599
I want to try to get into these.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.393
I'd like to at least
try-- try punching one.

00:02:23.393 --> 00:02:23.977
OK.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.983
OK, I think it just went.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.234
Yep.

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:34.696
Oh, she's opening.

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:36.739
Oh, there she goes.

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.575
Ooh, that's a big box.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:39.284
All right.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:42.662
Oh!

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:44.414
Oh, that's heavy!

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:48.042
Make room for it, guys.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:48.877
There's--

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.587
Oh, my god.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:51.546
You better get over here.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.176
Oh, that just sounds
like it's full of goodies.

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.011
There's something in there.

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:05.810
Oh!

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.145
Ooh.

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.229
No.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.813
What is it?

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.234
Keys.

00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.906
NARRATOR: For
Kevin, the discovery

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:21.117
of envelopes filled with
safety deposit box keys

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:23.453
is not a positive one.

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.456
It suggests that all
of the remaining boxes

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.666
are probably empty.

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:30.043
It was really disheartening.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.211
Did somebody else
know prior to me

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:34.672
that maybe there was
gold in those boxes?

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:36.090
One thing's for certain.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.678
Those boxes were worth
something to somebody.

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:43.097
NARRATOR: After a long and
frustrating day searching

00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:46.851
for evidence at the old
Hackley Union Bank building,

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:50.355
Kevin Dykstra and his team
gather in his workshop

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:53.399
to call Marty Lagina and
update him on the status

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.735
of their investigation.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:56.778
Well, go ahead.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.446
Give me the good and the bad.

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:01.991
We opened up a bunch of the
safety deposit box cabinets,

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:05.995
but all we found were keys
for all of the other safety

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.039
deposit boxes.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.042
Look, Kevin, you ought not
to look at this as a failure.

00:04:11.042 --> 00:04:13.670
You knew when you started
this quest that there were

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.131
multiple places where this
gold or remnants of this gold

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:18.800
might reside.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.427
Well, you followed through,
and you obtained permission,

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:24.138
and you did what it took
to check off one of them.

00:04:24.138 --> 00:04:27.058
OK, so we've
eliminated that one.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:30.103
You know, Marty, with all
of his exploration up on Oak

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:32.230
Island, he's had a
lot of days like what

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.023
we had with the bank vault.

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:37.068
As my brother Rick
often says, "One in, all

00:04:37.068 --> 00:04:39.320
in, and once in, forever in."

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.697
Stay on quest, you guys.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:41.864
- All right.
- Thanks, Marty.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.032
Yeah, your
support means a lot.

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:44.325
All right, Kevin,
keep the faith.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.410
All right.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.077
Goodbye, Marty.
- See you later.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:46.953
Thank you.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:48.579
Thanks for the update.

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:50.873
NARRATOR: For Kevin Dykstra,
finding physical evidence

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:54.502
to support his theory has
been harder to do than he

00:04:54.502 --> 00:04:58.214
and his team had
previously imagined.

00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:01.134
Nevertheless, he
remains convinced

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:03.970
that millions of dollars
in Confederate gold

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.724
still lies at the
bottom of Lake Michigan

00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:09.684
and that he is
only one discovery

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:15.189
away from getting the financing
he needs to retrieve it.
