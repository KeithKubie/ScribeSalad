00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.930
When I say Hollywood, you probably think of
big-budget movies, star-studded premieres,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.180
and studios with giant backlots pumping out
film after film.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.280
Most of those associations really began sometime
between the 1920s and the 1950s.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.770
Once audiences could hear actors speak, listen
to pre-recorded musical scores, and enjoy

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.510
sound effects, film cemented its place as
the main medium for mass communication, art,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.510
and commerce.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.740
And as important as Hollywood was during the
Silent Era, nobody could compete after the

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.740
arrival of sound.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.980
New major film studios emerged, each with
their own style and favorite celebrities:

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.460
before George Clooney and Jennifer Lawrence,
there was Clark Gable and Janet Leigh.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.210
This cascade of films led to more technological
innovations, too, like color film and the

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.239
widescreen formats we still use today.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.179
This was the Golden Age of Hollywood.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.560
[singing] Hollywooood ba-ba-da-ba-d– OK,
I’ll stop.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:58.660
[Opening Music Plays]

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.350
After the Stock Market Crash in October of
1929, most parts of the American economy took

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.350
a real hit.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.350
But not Hollywood.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.880
And at the height of the Great Depression
in 1933, roughly a quarter of the American

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.310
workforce couldn’t find a job, and millions
of others were barely making ends meet.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.960
So you’d think that the last thing people
would do with their hard-earned money was

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.960
go to the movies.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.229
And yet, the Depression was one of the best
things to happen to the American film business.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.250
That’s depressing...

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.829
In fact, more films were released by the major
studios during the 1920s and ‘30s than any

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:27.799
other decade – averaging about 800 a year,
compared to less than 500 per year today.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.890
It was cheaper to go to the movies than a
play or a concert, and cinema became a means

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.890
of escape.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.719
As we’ve talked about, films are an illusion
of reality.

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.140
And that illusion was super attractive to
people whose day-to-day reality was often

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.140
pretty bleak.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.460
Genre films became more popular – things
like gangster films, musicals, westerns, and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.460
screwball comedies.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.450
Anything to take people’s mind off their
own struggles and celebrate good old American

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.939
values of optimism, resilience, ambition,
and courage.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.070
At the height of Hollywood’s Golden Age,
five film studios ruled the town.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.460
All five were vertically-integrated, just
like the major studios of the Silent Era.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.009
They each had their own distinct reputations
and focused on different kinds of films.

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.600
First up, we have Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer – or
MGM – which was the biggest studio in the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600
1930s.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.969
Louis B. Mayer ran MGM with his business partner,
Irving Thalberg.

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.460
Mayer was the savvy businessman of the two;
he approved the budgets and oversaw the distribution

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.460
and marketing.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.690
Thalberg, on the other hand, was a former
producer, and the mind behind the stories

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.690
and actual production.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.890
Together, they made slick, big-budget musicals,
comedies, melodramas, and literary adaptations

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.820
– sparing no expense on sets, costumes,
extras, and the biggest movie stars.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.950
Think of The Wizard of Oz, Gone with the Wind,
and Mutiny on the Bounty.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.750
I’m talking opulence, people!

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.730
Next is Paramount Pictures, which was known
as the most “European” studio, because

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.190
they lured a lot of filmmakers away from Germany
and the U.K.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.190
They also gave these filmmakers more leeway
to put their own stamp on movies – hits

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.780
like Shanghai Express, The Sign of the Cross,
and Morocco.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.170
Our third player, Warner Brothers, branded
itself as the studio of the working class.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.690
They churned out low-budget melodramas, gritty
gangster movies like The Public Enemy with

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.660
James Cagney, and musicals set in the Depression
like Footlight Parade, with James Cagney.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.660
The fourth major studio was 20th Century-Fox,
which made its reputation thanks to its chief

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.580
director and its most profitable star, not
James Cagney

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.670
That director was John Ford, who won back-to-back
best director Oscars for The Grapes of Wrath

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.430
and How Green Was My Valley, while Shirley
Temple sang and danced her way through a string

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.430
of wholesome hits.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.910
And lastly, RKO was the home of the extremely
popular Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.420
Can I do a dance number Nick?

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.420
Nick: Nope.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.980
RKO also took a lot of chances, producing
everything from Howard Hawks’ screwball

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.480
comedy Bringing Up Baby, to the 1933 version
of King Kong, and one of the most influential

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.910
films of all time, Citizen Kane.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.910
Never heard of it.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.720
Now, all five of these studios dominated the
production, distribution, and exhibition of

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.970
films – for a while.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.840
But a U.S. Supreme Court Case in 1948, along
with the coming of television, signaled a

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.890
major turning point.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.410
In the case, known as United States versus
Paramount Pictures, the government argued

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.230
that the major studios were in violation of
antitrust laws.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.440
In other words, by owning both the production
studios and the movie theaters, they were

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.330
exercising an unfair monopoly and stifling
competition.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.430
The Supreme Court agreed, and forced the studios
to break up their businesses, sell their theaters,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.830
and focus on just production and distribution.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.300
Hollywood continued to lead the global film
market for another 10 or 15 years, but that

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.610
near-complete control over the industry was
ending.

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.180
We’ll talk a lot more about this next time.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.300
Now, the Golden Age of Hollywood saw some
major technical leaps in the film business,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.120
too, including: color.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.680
Filmmakers had been experimenting with color
since the dawn of cinema.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.620
The earliest techniques involved hand-tinting
individual frames, a painstaking process that

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.550
had to be repeated for each print of each
film.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.550
Not great.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.620
Over the next few decades, engineers found
ways to use stencils to tint films much faster.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.730
They also developed other means of adding
color, like bathing the film stock in dyes

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.100
that fit the mood of the scene, called toning
– red for violence, blue for sorrow, green

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.100
for...grassy.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.710
By the mid-1920s, nearly 90 percent of Hollywood
films were either tinted, toned, or some combination

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.710
of the two.

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.220
Which was great, except the color itself looked
wildly artificial.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.460
And once Hollywood converted to sound-on-film
technology, the tinting interfered with the

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.760
film stock’s ability to record proper sound.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.260
Crash Course Film History, tl;dr: it’s hard.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.140
So filmmakers needed to figure out color cinematography
– capturing color with the image.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.790
As early as 1861, a Scottish physicist named
James Clerk Maxwell – who we talked about

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.180
in Crash Course Physics (well, I didn’t,
Shini did) – built the foundations of color

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.180
photography.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.150
The light all around us is made up of a spectrum
of different wavelengths, some of which we

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.460
see as visible colors.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.940
Knowing this, Maxwell figured out that all
those colors can be derived from some combination

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.910
of red, yellow, and blue.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.280
Beginning in 1906, artists and engineers tried
for 15 years to use this knowledge to achieve

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.450
color cinematography.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.190
But, much like me in high school, they kept
failing.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.300
Their experiments were unreliable or too expensive.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.210
Then along came Technicolor.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.740
In 1922, the Technicolor Corporation saw its
first success with a special beam-splitting

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.889
camera that could make two separate negatives.

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.280
The light entered the camera and was split
into different wavelengths, just like how

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.639
sunlight hits a prism and splits into a rainbow.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.260
Half continued straight ahead, while the other
half was diverted 90 degrees, to produce two

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.380
film negatives.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.520
These negatives were chemically treated, dyed
either blue or red, and cemented together.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.210
Then you could run that final film strip through
a regular projector, and voilà!

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:46.300
Even though they weren’t spot-on, the colors
in these films were more reliable and accurate

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.770
than any of the earlier attempts.

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.790
And while that beam-splitting camera was expensive,
at least theaters didn’t have to buy new

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.530
projectors to show color films.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.050
Over the next decade, Technicolor expanded
its system into a three-color process, with

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.540
a camera that recorded the original image
onto three separate negatives – red, blue,

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.540
and green.

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.200
And by 1932, this process created such high-quality,
vibrant results, that Technicolor ended up

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.010
with a virtual monopoly on color film for
the next 20 years.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.390
Throughout the 1930s, filmmakers and studios
gradually began playing around with Technicolor.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.680
By the middle of the decade, producer David
O. Selznick turned a corner by casting big

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.690
stars in color films for the first time.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.530
And as the 1930s came to a close, Hollywood
released a series of high-profile hits that

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.110
proved color was here to stay.

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.310
These films that used Technicolor ranged from
the Errol Flynn swashbuckler The Adventures

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.230
of Robin Hood, to classics like The Wizard
of Oz and Gone with the Wind, and even animated

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.650
features like Disney’s Snow White and Pinnochio.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.990
Advances in color cinematography would continue
to develop over the years, but the basics

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.290
stayed the same until film stock gave way
to digital video in the 21st century.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:41.040
Now, a third technical element of cinema was
standardized during the Golden Age of Hollywood.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.900
It’s something called aspect ratio – that’s
the ratio of the movie screen’s width to

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.900
its height.

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.910
Back in 1932, the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences – the folks who give out

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.420
the Oscars – established a standard aspect
ratio of 4:3, which looks like this.

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:56.650
Also known as the Academy aperture, this ratio
isn’t a square, but it’s closer to one

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.860
than we’re used to these days.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.741
That’s because most movies we see today
are shot in an aspect ratio of 16:9, which

00:07:01.741 --> 00:07:03.090
looks like this.

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.450
That’s more like it!

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.650
We often call this widescreen.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.361
And so much film and TV is shot at this ratio
that most new screens are built to fit it.

00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:11.449
But those are just two possible aspect ratios.

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:15.760
Back in the 1950s, some filmmakers experimented
with an extreme widescreen ratio called Cinerama.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.120
This process involved shooting a film with
three separate synchronized cameras hooked

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.840
together in an arc, and projecting it from
three synchronized projectors.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.840
Weird.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.860
The screen was shaped in a similar arc, kind
of wrapping itself around the audience.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.710
Y’know, for a real immersive experience.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:32.930
And the final aspect ratio of Cinerama was
about 8:3, which looks like this.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.600
The most famous film shot in Cinerama was
the western epic How the West Was Won.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.570
But, as you can probably guess, this process
was too expensive and complicated to achieve

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.570
widespread use.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.480
And it was bad for performer’s necks.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.710
On the heels of Cinerama came CinemaScope.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.490
Rather than shooting with multiple cameras,
CinemaScope utilized something called an anamorphic

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.490
lens.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:53.710
This was a special lens for cameras that recorded
a wider image, but squeezed it laterally so

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.460
that everything would fit onto standard 35mm
film stock.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.860
When the film was projected, a similar lens
attached to the projector would “unsqueeze”

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.750
the image, expanding it back out, and projecting
it up onto the screen.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:06.140
The result was an impressive 2.55:1 aspect
ratio.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.760
Audiences got their first taste of it in the
1953 biblical epic The Robe.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.830
And by the end of that year, every major Hollywood
studio except Paramount was licensed to make

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.949
CinemaScope films.

00:08:14.949 --> 00:08:19.460
Over time, the ratio was reduced to 2.35:1,
and in the mid-1950s, the American film industry

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.410
had almost entirely converted to shooting
anamorphic widescreen films.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.080
It took some time for filmmakers to adjust
to widescreen shooting.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.080
When you move from an aspect ratio of 4:3
to 16:9, that’s a whole lotta extra room

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.080
to fill.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.080
So what do you do with it?

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.320
Well, we fill it with, like, knick knacks
and stuff.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:37.060
Close-ups, especially of faces, became difficult
to frame, while landscapes got easier.

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.919
At first, widescreen films rewarded composition
and long takes over editing.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:44.259
Filmmakers built their stories by filling
the frame, rather than cutting to new images.

00:08:44.259 --> 00:08:47.649
Genres like the western, the musical, and
large-scale epics all lent themselves to these

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:49.300
kinds of world-building possibilities.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.170
In the end, the technical advancements of
sound, color, and an aspect ratio that could

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.140
surround the audience made the powerful Hollywood
studios the center of the cinematic universe

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.360
from the late 1920s to the late 1950s.

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.509
It was a Golden Age whose echoes are felt
in our films today.

00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:05.779
Today we learned about how the the American
studio system took advantage of sound film

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:07.930
and the Great Depression to achieve global
dominance.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:11.760
We discussed the development of color cinematography
and what it meant for filmmakers and film

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.019
audiences.

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:17.029
And we examined aspect ratio, and how the
move to widescreen cinema affected films being

00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:18.029
made.

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:20.860
Next time, we’ll learn about how filmmakers
in Europe and the United States reacted against

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:24.970
the formulaic movies coming out of Hollywood
and created a new wave of gritty, irreverent,

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:26.120
and innovative cinema.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.779
