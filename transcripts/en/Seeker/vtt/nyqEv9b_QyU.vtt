00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.330
Do you know who is hitching a ride home with
you for the holidays?

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.310
Well they’re tiny and buggy and they look
like this: [Image of dust mite]

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.950
Hello everyone, Crystal here for DNews.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.240
microscopic hitchhikers are everywhere.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.820
We have millions of bacterial species crawling
all over us right now but in addition to germs

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.320
and bacteria several species of creepy crawlers
are taking advantage of our visits to grandma’s

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.360
house and skipping town themselves.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.779
This may explain the findings of University
of Michigan researchers when they examined

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.269
the genetic connection between house dust
mite populations in the United States and

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:37.269
South Asia.

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:41.749
While genetic differences can still be detected
in both populations, there is enough similarity

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:46.309
to conclude that mite populations are indeed
linked genetically through migration across

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.309
continents.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.579
This is important because house dust mites
thrive in the mattresses, sofas and carpets,

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.899
of even the cleanest homes, and they are known
to cause allergic reactions in more than 65

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.089
million people worldwide.

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.429
Gaining more information about genetic similarity
and diversity in the dust mite population,

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:06.619
especially when looking at variations in the
protein responsible for human allergic reactions,

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.390
will give scientists a better chance at addressing
how and why these allergies occur.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.229
The scientists involved in this international
effort chose to study the geographical diversity

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.259
of the group 1 allergen gene because this
gene encodes for the most important allergy-causing

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:22.970
protein in house dust mites.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.200
An inactive form of this protein is what is
used as part of the standard skin-prick test

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
for allergies.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.340
Making the test more specific by including
the regionally appropriate genetic variant

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.000
of the inactivated protein could make the
allergy test more accurate and help more people

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.929
identify the cause of their allergy symptoms.

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.710
Interestingly, according to the authors of
the study, geographical variation in group

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.550
1 allergen proteins has not been extensively
studied (at least not in the U.S.).

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.570
The researchers examined genetic sequences
from American house dust mites (Dermatophagoides

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.100
farinae), and identified 14 mutations along
the length of the group 1 allergen gene.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.359
Most of the mutations didn’t affect the
proteins’ structure or function, but the

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.170
unexpected result was the discovery that American
dust mites have bred with mites from South

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.240
Asia!

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.100
We know this because a rare mutation in the
allergen protein, previously only seen in

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.890
a single population of South Asian dust mites
popped up among the American population.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.630
So the next time you sit down on an airplane
to travel to somewhere exotic, take a moment

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.420
to think about all the hitchhikers you’re
bringing with you, and the ways you might

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.030
unknowingly be contributing to genetic diversity
and advancing allergy science!

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.730
How do you feel about bugs sharing your seat
on the plane?
