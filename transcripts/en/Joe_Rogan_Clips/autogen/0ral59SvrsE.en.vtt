but they think that it might be a false

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
but they think that it might be a false
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990
but they think that it might be a false
positive because apparently there's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
positive because apparently there's
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.460
positive because apparently there's
something else that they would consume

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
something else that they would consume
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.679
something else that they would consume
back then that would make you test

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
back then that would make you test
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.499
back then that would make you test
positive for cocaine I don't know yeah

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509

me is what was the mote like where was
 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:38.939
me is what was the mote like where was
the theory like would the theory come

00:06:38.939 --> 00:06:38.949
the theory like would the theory come
 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:39.560
the theory like would the theory come
from

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570
from
 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.740
