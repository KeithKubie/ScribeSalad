00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.230
Let's see if we can
calculate 2.91 times 3.2.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:07.020
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.180
and try it out on your own.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.030
So the way I'm going to
think about it is 2.91

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.655
is the same thing as
291 divided by 10.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.620
Or not divided by
10, divided by 100.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.660
And we know that if you
divide something by 100,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.451
you are going to move
the decimal place two

00:00:29.451 --> 00:00:31.770
places to the left-- one, two.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.310
And you would end up at 2.91.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.720
It also make sense, if I take
2, and I multiply it by 100,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.830
I'd get 200.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.970
Or if I take 200 and divided
by 100, I would get 2.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.140
So it makes sense that
2.91 is the same thing

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.210
as 291 divided by 100.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.780
Similarlarly-- I can
never say that word-- 3.2

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.050
can be rewritten.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.850
It's the same thing
as 32 divided by 10.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.120
Now, why is all of
this interesting?

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:20.020
Well, I could rewrite 2.91 times
3.2 as being the same thing as.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:30.290
Instead of 2.91, I can
write 291 divided by 100.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.560
And then times--
instead of writing 3.2,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.510
I could write 32 divided by 10.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.480
And this can be
rewritten as-- this

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:55.310
is going to be equal to 291
times 32 divided by 100.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:04.700
I'm just reordering this--
divided by 100, divided by 10.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.622
Or I could rewrite this.

00:02:08.622 --> 00:02:12.316
This is equal to 291 times 32.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.320
If I divide by 100 and
then I divide by 10 again,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.076
I'm essentially
dividing by 1,000.

00:02:21.076 --> 00:02:23.610
So this part right
over here, I could

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.750
rewrite as dividing by 1,000.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.260
Now, why is this interesting?

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.570
Well, I already know how
to multiply 291 times 32.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.340
And then we know how
to move the decimal

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.140
so that when we divide by 1,000.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.200
So let's calculate 291 times 32.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.990
Let me write it right over here.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.498
291 times 32.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.690
Notice, I've just
essentially rewritten this

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.940
without the decimals.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.797
So this right over
here-- but of course,

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:54.630
these are different
quantities than this one

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.421
is right over here.

00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:57.250
To go from this product
to this product,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.960
I have to divide by 1,000.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.637
But let's just think about this.

00:03:00.637 --> 00:03:02.720
We already know how to
compute this type of thing.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.870
2 times 1 is 2.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.810
2 times 9 is 18.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.500
Carry the 1.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.900
2 times 2 is 4, plus 1 is 5.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.240
And now we can
think about the 3.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.280
3 times 1-- oh, let
me throw a 0 here.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.100
Because this isn't a 3.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.210
This is now a 30.

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.790
So this is in the tens place.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.295
So that's why I put a 0 there.

00:03:24.295 --> 00:03:28.800
So 30 times 1 is 30.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.610
That's why we say 3
times 1 is 3, but notice,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.430
it's in the tens
place right now.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.410
And then 3 times 9 is 27.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.294
Carry the 2.

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:45.980
3 times 2 is 6, plus 2 is 8.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.185
And now we can add.

00:03:49.185 --> 00:03:51.250
And we would get 2.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.810
8 plus 3 is 11.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.471
6 plus 3 is 13.

00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:57.860
And then you get 9.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.070
So you get 9,312.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:09.626
So this is going to be equal
to 9,312 divided by 1,000.

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:12.390
And what's this
going to be equal to?

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.180
Well, if we start
with 9,312-- and let

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.790
me throw a decimal there.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.450
Dividing by 1,000 is
equivalent to moving

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.130
the decimal over three
places to the left.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.660
So you divide by 10, divide
by 100, divide by 1,000.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.085
So that's going to be 9.312.

00:04:31.085 --> 00:04:44.247
So if you divide by 1,000,
you will get to 9.312.

00:04:44.247 --> 00:04:45.705
Let me write the
decimal in purple.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.550
Now, there's something
very interesting here.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.550
In our original, when
we wrote the expression,

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.780
we had one, two, three total
numbers behind the decimal.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.180
And then over here,
we have one, two,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.330
three total numbers to
the right of the decimal.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.850
Why is this?

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.330
Well, let's think about it.

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.410
We re-expressed this
as 291 divided by 100.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.662
And this is 32 divided by 10.

00:05:25.662 --> 00:05:28.110
Dividing by 100 and
dividing by 10--

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.740
this essentially accounts for
these three decimal places.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.300
So we essentially get rid
of those decimal places.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.210
But then we have to reintroduce
those three decimal places

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.490
by dividing.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.150
Or we have to shift-- here we
shift the decimal an aggregate

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.520
to the right three times--
one, two, and then three.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.820
Now, in order to make sure
we get the right product,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.190
we've got to shift
it back to the left.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.830
So we're shifting
it one, two, three.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.800
So we went from this to this.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.156
For the whole product,
it was like multiplying.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.860
We essentially, to go from here
to here, we multiplied by 100.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.870
To go from here to here,
we multiplied by 10.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.900
So in aggregate, we
multiplied by 1,000,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.730
if you think about
both of these.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.080
And so now we have to divide by
1,000 to get the right value.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.100
So that's why three spaces
to the right of the decimal

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.527
here, three digits to the
right of the decimal here.
