00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.760
- [Instructor] Kangaroos can jump

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.140
up to three times their height

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.800
and they can't walk backward.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.990
Well the way that it's phrased right now

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.730
feels a little bit
like, a little bit weird

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.500
'cause it's saying kangaroos can jump

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.800
up to three times their height.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.580
Well that's an impressive thing

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.730
and then they're saying and
they can't walk backward

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.510
which is like, okay, they're
listing another thing

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.920
but this is more of a,
this is like a limitation

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.981
'cause you're like, whoa, most animals

00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:25.730
know how to walk backwards.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.200
Very few can jump three times their height

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.690
but most can walk backward,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.440
so this actually kind of feels like

00:00:31.336 --> 00:00:36.336
it's listing something impressive
but then they're saying,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.903
but they can't do everything awesome.

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:40.040
That they do have limitations.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.450
So, I don't like the use of and here.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.150
And kind of puts them as comparable things

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.250
and they're really not.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.560
One is something impressive

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:49.730
and then I would expect something like

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.350
a but they can't do something
that everyone else can do.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.700
So, I'm not liking no change.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.330
Let's see, this one is kangaroos can jump

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:58.980
up to three times their height

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.780
meaning they can't walk backward.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.780
Well, that doesn't make any sense at all.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.010
Because you jump three times your height

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.460
doesn't mean you can't walk backwards.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.940
Kangaroos can jump up to
three times their height

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.890
but they can't walk backward.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.550
Well, that feels right because
you're listing something

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.000
very impressive but then
you're saying well look,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.350
they can't do everything awesome

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.180
but they can't walk backward.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.000
They can't do what normal, a
lot of other animals can do.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.980
Let's look at this last one.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.330
Kangaroos can jump up to
three times their height

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.210
since they can't walk backward.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.740
Well, not being able to walk backwards

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.710
doesn't allow you to jump up high

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.860
so this just doesn't
make any sense either.
