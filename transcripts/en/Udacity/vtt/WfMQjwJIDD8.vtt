00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now that we have 3 pieces of information,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
let's put these pieces together.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So the first two that we will put together

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is the statement here on the second line

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and this one here on the third line.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So we know that the length of the tour computed by the algorithm

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is exactly two times the weight of the minimum spanning tree.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now we will use the piece of information that we will have up here,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
so let's make a little bit more space down here.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We know that the length of the shortest tour is larger than

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the weight of the minimum spanning tree,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so we can put this part down here.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now isn't that beautiful.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
At least I think so.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So the length of the shortest tour must lie somewhere

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in between the weight of the minimum spanning tree

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and the solution that you have just computed,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which is twice the weight of the spanning tree.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And this means that the algorithm I specified here is actually

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
a constant factor approximation algorithm for shortest tour.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Oh, I forgot to write the factor here.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Well, of course I did that deliberately

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
because this is going to be your final quiz

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
for this algorithm.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Please tell me what is the approximation factor,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
using this information we've just figured out,

00:01:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that this algorithm has for shortest tour?
