00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:37.760
SERENA AMMIRATI: Looking
at this book page by page

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.820
and trying to decipher, read,
and transcribe whatever is

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.920
there takes an enormous
amount of time.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.070
It would require an
army of paleographers.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.980
ELENA NIEDDU: What I am excited
the most about machine learning

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.800
is that it enabled us to
solve problems that up to 10,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.040
15 years ago we
thought unsolvable.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.700
ELENA NIEDDU: Before using any
kind of machine learning model,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.130
we needed to collect data first.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.920
You have thousands of images of
dogs and cats in the internet,

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.810
but there's very little
images of ancient manuscripts.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.130
We built our own custom web
application for crowdsourcing.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.380
And we involved high school
students to collect the data.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.900
I didn't know much about
machine learning in general.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.710
But I found it very easy
to create a TensorFlow

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:46.820
environment.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.800
When we were trying
to figure out

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.430
which model worked best for us,
Keras was the best solution.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.060
The production model runs on
TensorFlow layers, an estimator

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.170
interface.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.950
We experimented with
binary classification,

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.730
with fully connected networks.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.240
And finally, we moved to
convolutional neural network

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.190
and multiclass classification.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.200
ELENA NIEDDU: When it comes to
recognizing single characters,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.200
we can get 95% average accuracy.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.130
SERENA AMMIRATI: This will
have an enormous impact.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.660
In a short period
of time, we will

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.720
have a massive quantity
of historical information

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.680
available.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.470
ELENA NIEDDU: I just think
solving problems is fun.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.580
It's a game against myself,
and how good I can do.
