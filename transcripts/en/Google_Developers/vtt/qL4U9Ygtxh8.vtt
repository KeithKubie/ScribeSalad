00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:05.440
GLEN KEANE: Good morning.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.330
Thanks for making it here
early in the morning.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.410
You, know, looking at some of
those pictures of me years ago,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.280
I noticed something that
was kind of missing now.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.610
Yeah.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.360
All these characters
I've been animating--

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.540
Pocahontas and
Rapunzel-- it's like I'm

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.729
making up for the lack
of something in my life.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:36.120
I'm not sure what that would be.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.780
But I've got this strange
belief that the characters

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.940
that I've animated,
created, designed

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.550
exist before I draw them.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.720
And that was the case with the
Beast, which I'll show you.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.230
I didn't know what the Beast
was going to look like,

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.460
and my assistant, who is
standing just like where Jason

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.710
is-- he didn't have a camera--

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.085
but he said, so what's the
Beast going to like look like?

00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:11.380
I don't know.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.230
It's going to--

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.750
I kind of like this
buffalo-like like head shape.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.010
There's kind of a
sadness to the buffalo.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.850
And I had the buffalo
head on my wall.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.890
Maybe that's why it looked sad.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.300
I don't know.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.110
But there's this bear-like
body and the crest

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.090
of a gorilla's head, and
a gorilla expressive brow

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.810
like that.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.740
And as I was explaining
to my assistant,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.780
it's like, I like the
muzzle of a wild boar

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.440
with the hair coming back, and
these tusks that are coming up,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.820
and the beard
though of a buffalo.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.280
But Belle's got to hug
him, so let's give him

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.750
this mane like a lion there.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.010
And the horns-- and
I've been studying

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.020
a lot of different
horns, and they'll

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.840
be like a combination
of these horns.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.790
And it was just like this.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.750
I was drawing it, just kind
of feeling it out like that.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.300
And then I started
thinking, but wait a second.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.300
Belle's not going to fall
in love with this guy.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.342
This isn't going to work.

00:02:32.342 --> 00:02:35.530
Nobody is going to believe this.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.900
I'll give him cow ears.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.250
That'll make him a little
friendlier, like that.

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.670
But inside-- there's a
prince trapped inside,

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.380
and the eyes are the
window to the soul.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.420
And so you can see
the prince looking out

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.410
from inside this
body of this beast.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.100
And as I drew him
I said, that's him.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.820
There he is.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.470
I mean, just as long as it took
me just now to draw it for you,

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.010
it did that day, and
Beast suddenly appeared.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.250
And that's kind of the
magic of creativity.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.700
I think the key to it is
thinking like a child.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.590
There's something wonderful--
this is my granddaughter

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.020
Matisse and she's drawing there.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.720
The secret to her drawing is
either in that bottle of milk

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.970
or the glass of Merlot,
I'm not quite sure.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.650
But there was this little
six-year-old girl, and she--

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.550
she said to her dad, Daddy,
where do you go all day?

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.025
And he was a professor of
drawing at a university.

00:03:55.025 --> 00:04:00.010
He said, well, sweetheart, I
teach big people how to draw.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.890
And she said, oh,
you mean they forget?

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.320
Picasso said, when I was
young, I could draw and paint

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.090
like Raphael.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.599
But it's taken me a lifetime
to learn to draw like a child.

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:16.266
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:04:16.266 --> 00:04:16.891
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:16.891 --> 00:04:23.880
If you watch him draw, it's
a pretty wonderful thing.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.040
It's not rushed.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.360
It's as if he's having
a conversation with what

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.035
he's making.

00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:33.910
He's listening to it.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.530
It says, over here,
and he responds.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.040
It's not a one-way thing.

00:04:44.287 --> 00:04:44.870
[END PLAYBACK]

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.280
I think this is how--

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:52.890
whether you are writing
music, writing code, painting,

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.280
drawing, whatever--
it's a conversation

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.010
you are having with
what you are making.

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.940
You have to be open to it.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.910
And drawing is a really
interesting thing.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.880
If you ask yourself,
so what is drawing?

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.860
If you hold a pencil, a pencil
is an amazing little tool.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.030
It's what I would say is--

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.510
simplicity is the
ultimate sophistication.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.320
You hold it.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.890
It makes a mark at
this end, and there's

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.660
a line that goes straight
down my arm to my heart,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:42.250
where what I feel, what I
see, I can communicate to you.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.450
You can't see it.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.230
It's hidden inside of me.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.180
And for whatever it
is that you're doing,

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.930
we all have something
inside of us

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.560
that we are wanting to
touch other people with.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.110
We're wanting to
communicate it somehow.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.870
And the tools that we use
to express that hidden thing

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.660
are incredibly important.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.900
But this is really simple,
and the simplicity--

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.340
the clarity-- that the tool
can communicate what is hidden

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.140
is really, really important.

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.630
If you look at my
drawings, my drawings

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.650
look like that when
I first animate.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.670
I mean, I think of drawing
as a seismograph of my soul.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.590
It's like the line.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.510
It's just this explosion.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.710
So first I draw like this,
and then it becomes like that

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.150
as I tie it down.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:41.150
But it first started as
that rough explosion.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.710
And I want to show this little
clip from "The Little Mermaid,"

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.370
and it's back from the '80s.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.300
So it's ancient
technology on video,

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.390
and it's the pencil version
of "Part of Your World."

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.870
It's just a little bit.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:55.495
But there's this one
part where Ariel--

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.110
longing to be up on
the surface and not

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:07.060
be down under the water, and
she wants more than anything

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.340
to be part of that world--

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.890
and I was a 33-year-old
guy, and I'm

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:15.540
being a 16-year-old mermaid.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:17.170
And at a certain
point, I realized

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:20.110
Ariel wants to swim up
straight to the camera, looking

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.580
at the audience, and reach
out and then drift back down,

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.860
and I started getting
kind of nervous,

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.160
like this is really cheesy.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.480
Everybody's going to know
how sentimental I am.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.310
And I was like, I can't do that.

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.490
But I couldn't stop Ariel.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.260
She did it anyway.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:42.313
So take a look at this
little clip of animation.

00:07:42.313 --> 00:07:42.980
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:09:08.796 --> 00:09:09.810
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:12.235
Years after I'd animated that--

00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:12.980
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:14.893
Thank you.

00:09:14.893 --> 00:09:15.875
Thank you.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.130
So years after I
animated that, I

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.390
was speaking at Cal Arts, the
animation department there,

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:30.320
and one of the students came
up to me and said, Mr. Keane,

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.965
there is this animation
from "The Little Mermaid,"

00:09:34.965 --> 00:09:36.340
and it's in "Part
of Your World,"

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.990
where Ariel reaches out.

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.630
I don't know if you remember it.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:39.422
And I said, no, no.

00:09:39.422 --> 00:09:40.300
I remember that.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:41.900
Yeah.

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:47.000
Well, I was four years old,
and I was in the movie theater,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.780
and as Ariel was
reaching out, I stood up

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.900
in the middle of the theater
and reached my hands out

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:58.102
to take her hands because she
wanted to be part of my world.

00:09:58.102 --> 00:10:00.830
And I said, thank you.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:03.650
Thank you.

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:07.040
See, because the thing
is, that thing that

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.560
makes us us, as I
was feeling funny,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.660
like I didn't want to
do that, because I felt

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.490
like I was exposing myself--

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.740
I was being vulnerable--

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.290
and that part of
us that is hidden,

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:23.368
that's the very thing that
you have to put out there.

00:10:23.368 --> 00:10:25.410
The thing that you think
you're the only one that

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:28.320
feels that way--

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.660
that's what you have
to go out and say.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.000
The thing that makes you
kind of uncomfortable,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.740
like, what would
people think of me--

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.030
that's the thing that you
need to do in whatever field

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:42.100
you are in.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.730
One point.

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:45.235
Ollie Johnston, one of
the mentors at Disney--

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.360
he had done "Pinocchio"
and "Snow White,"

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.830
and many of these films--

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:56.540
he said, Glen, you're going
to do greater things than us

00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:58.092
someday.

00:10:58.092 --> 00:11:01.450
And I was like, oh, I
wish he'd never said that.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:04.310
Like, I mean, how are you going
to do greater than "Pinocchio"

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.130
or "Bambi" or "Fantasia"?

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.130
And I carried that around
with me for many years.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:14.520
And after about 40
years at Disney,

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.610
I felt like something
new was calling to me,

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:19.160
and I didn't know what it was.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.650
Behind my house,
there was this field,

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:24.800
and I took this picture
of that little trail,

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.440
because I felt like that's my
feeling right now that there's

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:31.970
something beyond that
I can't see what it is.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.340
But what am I going to do?

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:35.810
I've been there 40 years.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:38.850
This is like, this is my life.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:41.030
How can I take that step?

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.680
My wife saw how I was feeling.

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.890
She said, well, what would you
do if you weren't at Disney?

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.640
Where would you go?

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.370
I said, I don't know.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.900
Google?

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.030
She said, Google?

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.560
They don't do animation.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.950
I know, but wouldn't it be
cool if you took animation

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.470
to someplace that
they don't do that?

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:06.790
And I read this quote.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.760
"Until one is committed,
there is hesitancy,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.590
the chance to draw back--

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.590
concerning all acts of
initiative and creation,

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.140
there is one elementary truth--

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.470
that the moment one
definitely commits oneself,

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:22.900
then Providence moves too.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.200
A whole stream of events
issues from the decision, which

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.440
no man could have dreamed
would have come his way.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.730
Whatever you can do, or
dream you can do, begin it.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:37.780
Boldness has genius,
power, and magic in it.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.230
Begin it now."

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:44.960
So I left, and the first
thing that happened

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.300
was Google called.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.860
And we came up here,
and it's just amazing

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:57.160
how something like that
would seem so impossible

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.920
suddenly was because
I took that step.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.480
And we were working with
Regina Dugan at ATAP,

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.770
and they had this new technology
where you could animate and see

00:13:08.770 --> 00:13:10.570
your animation on a
phone, and there's

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:14.000
no limit to what you were doing.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.320
And it was at 60 frames
per second, not 24,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.440
and we did this little
film "duet," a story

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.570
about two little babies--

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.160
a little boy and a little girl--

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.220
and they keep crossing paths
and it's a circular story

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:33.050
as they grow up, and you
can follow one or the other.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:37.030
Regina described it as
like a double helix.

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:42.250
Instead of a linear story, it
was like two spiral staircases.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:43.870
And I was thinking, this is--

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.280
I've never done this before.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:53.810
Picasso said, I'm always
doing that which I cannot do,

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:56.220
in order that I may
learn how to do it.

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:02.880
It's such an important
truth for us to get.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:10.710
Not knowing how to do something
is a great reason to do it.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.410
Well, what's really important
is the intention-- the desire.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.470
Do you have a desire
to do something?

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:20.390
Do you do want to
accomplish something,

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:23.450
but you don't know how?

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.800
You've already got the
most important part,

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.230
which is the desire.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:30.290
It's about taking that
step, and everything

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.820
starts coming together.

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.490
When we came up here to
Google to do this animation,

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.130
I had no idea, but
found in working

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:40.730
with this wonderful
group of programmers--

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:44.690
folks that were just as
creative in their field

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.820
as I was in mine--

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.380
we started to work
together at night.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.290
I would teach them
figure drawing,

00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:53.870
and then they would teach
me about algorithms.

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:00.928
And we did this
little film "duet,"

00:15:00.928 --> 00:15:02.720
which I'll show you a
little piece of here.

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:03.370
By the time Kobe
called and asked

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:10.060
if I would animate a letter that
he wrote to basketball called

00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:14.480
"Dear Basketball," I realized
that what Ollie Johnson had

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.750
said to me, that you're going
to do greater things than us

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:23.770
someday, I was wrong about
that, that he wasn't talking

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.310
about greater in quality.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:27.910
He was talking about
greater in application.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:29.770
To take the things
that you learned

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:35.710
and apply it in places and
ways that Ollie and those nine

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:38.800
old men never could
have imagined.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:46.110
And here was Kobe inviting me
now into NBA to do basketball.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:47.070
I told Kobe.

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:49.710
I said, look, you've
got the worst basketball

00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:51.360
player on Earth animating you.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.890
He said, no, that's good.

00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:56.730
That way, everything you
learn about basketball

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:58.330
is going to be
through studying him.

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:01.770
And it was.

00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:04.980
So he wrote this letter,
really from the point of view

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:11.050
of a six-year-old thanking
basketball for giving him--

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:12.460
this little six-year-old boy--

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.600
his Laker dream.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.500
And I think that this
is a wonderful truth

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:24.420
that that six-year-old version
of you is still with you now.

00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.540
We all have that
six-year-old kid

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:32.400
that had something to do with
why you are sitting here today,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.650
and who you are, and
what you are doing.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:36.930
That six-year-old--
that child that

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:39.960
has that spark of
creativity that

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:43.290
is that essential
thing-- is still there,

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:47.070
but sometimes we
become so professional.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.500
We become so good at
what we do, we forget.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.740
We forget who we are--

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.160
that little six-year-old.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:59.980
So listening to Kobe talk--

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:04.300
I have a little clip here
where Kobe is talking about

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:08.720
hand-drawn, and John Williams,
who did the music for it,

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.260
who's talking about
thinking like a child,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:16.450
and it's this wonderful
blend of these things that--

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:20.140
take a listen here to
Kobe and John's talk.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:22.210
Apparently, Kobe can call
anybody in the universe

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:25.300
and get him to work on his film,
because he got John Williams

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.703
to do the music for us.

there has to be a level

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:31.510
of hand-drawn touch to it.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.010
You know, it has
more texture to it.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:34.990
It has more soul to it.

JOHN WILLIAMS: It's so
personal, this thing.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.110
Leonard Bernstein used to
always talk about music

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:45.925
and inspiration, and he
would reference the idea that

00:19:45.925 --> 00:19:49.600
an artist should be always in
touch with his childish self--

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:53.410

really understood what was up

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:54.490
and down--

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.470

a sense of discovery--

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:02.008
when you reinterpret a piece of
music, or you conduct, or sing,

00:20:02.008 --> 00:20:02.550
or whatever--

kind of openness and exposure

the thing that as we get older,

don't know how to do this.

keeping you on the edge.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:55.970
I always felt like the one
thing we all have in common

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:59.090
is that if anybody knew
how much we're faking it,

00:20:59.090 --> 00:21:01.830

GLEN KEANE: Thank you.

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:51.250
That was a lot of fun.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:55.150
I knew nothing about
basketball, but I've

00:25:55.150 --> 00:26:00.250
got to say, after I animated it,
I'd been studying Kobe's jump

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:06.100
shot, and one night on
the Lakers training court,

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.070
I got out there and grabbed
one of the basketballs,

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:10.930
and I thought, I'm
going to do this.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:12.460
I know how to do it.

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.100
It's like, there's-- you throw--

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:17.160
you jump up and
you're leaning back.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.000
You've got your left
hip out a little bit.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.970
Your right hip is back, and
then you get a 90-degree angle

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:22.780
with your hand.

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:23.560
I studied it all.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.550
I knew it.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:28.120
And I jumped up and phew--

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:32.890
from way out, a three-pointer,
and the ball's just like,

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:36.610
I couldn't believe it-- it was
just straight for the basket,

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:40.400
and it fell 10 feet short, but--

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:44.700
but for a moment,
it was so cool.

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.810
So I want to leave
you with this term--

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:47.535
sprezzatura.

00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:57.740
It's a word that was
coined about 500 years ago,

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:03.900
and it was used to describe the
difference between Michelangelo

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.600
and Raphael.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.140
This is an art critic, and
he saw that Michelangelo had

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.100
such a knowledge of anatomy.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.330
It was all out.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:16.960
It was on the outside.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.720
You could see all the muscles
and the structure, and--

00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:29.070
whereas Rafael, who knew the
same anatomy as Michelangelo,

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.160
it was all hidden, as he would
paint "Madonna and Child," it

00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:35.110
was very smooth forms and--

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:38.200
And so he came up with
this term, sprezzatura.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.590
That means art
that hides its art.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.170
It's really the art
of becoming invisible.

00:27:49.495 --> 00:27:52.475
And I thought,
wow, this is really

00:27:52.475 --> 00:27:53.660
a pretty wonderful thing.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:28:02.690
It means that taking that
invisible thing inside of you

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.880
and make it can become visible--

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:11.310
the better you are
at taking that thing

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:15.010
and making it become
visible, the more visible

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:19.860
it becomes and the
more invisible you are.

00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:21.910
And that's the goal.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:22.970
It's not about you.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.000
It's about the thing
that you're making.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.990
It's about you
touching somebody else.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:35.760
And I don't think I really
understood that until one day

00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.023
at Disneyland.

00:28:38.023 --> 00:28:38.690
I was going to--

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:44.055
I have a Silver pass, so I
can get in anytime I want.

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:47.730
It comes after 40
years at Disney.

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:51.960
So my wife had family
and friends come out

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.230
from Minnesota, and we were
walking up to Disneyland,

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.820
and there's a big line of
people to get into the park,

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:01.800
and our friends got in
the back of the line.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:02.440
And I said, no.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:02.940
Come on.

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.110
Follow me.

00:29:04.110 --> 00:29:05.970
So we walk up to the
front of the line,

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:13.100
and I pull out my
wallet, and I realize

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.620
I forgot my Silver pass.

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:19.170
I can't get in without--

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:21.360
so I said, look.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.820
Excuse me.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.637
I have a Silver pass,
but I left it at home.

00:29:28.637 --> 00:29:30.220
The guy said, sorry,
you can't get in.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.660
I said, yeah, well.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.160
Look.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.000

up on your computer?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:36.610
Here's my Disney ID.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:37.700
And he said, nope.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:38.200
Sorry.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.570
Can't do that.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:41.458
And our family and
friends are coming around.

00:29:41.458 --> 00:29:42.250
What's the problem?

00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:43.050
I said, no, no.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:43.675
It's all right.

00:29:43.675 --> 00:29:45.010
It's all right.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:48.900
And this voice in my head
is saying, don't do this.

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.840
But I couldn't not.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:30:01.496
And I said, look, did
you see "Aladdin?"

00:30:01.496 --> 00:30:05.530
The guy says-- he
didn't say anything.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.510
He just kind of looked at me.

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:09.140
I did that.

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.500
That design of that
character, that was me.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:14.750
No reaction.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:21.560
I said, well, did you
see "The Little Mermaid?"

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.300
Still like this skeptical look.

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.520
And I said, that was me.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.960
I designed and animated Ariel.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:31.730
Still no reaction.

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:35.540
And then I said, well, did
you-- and before I could even

00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:38.313
get the third one out he said,
look, I don't care who you are.

00:30:38.313 --> 00:30:40.730
You're going to get in the
back of the line like everybody

00:30:40.730 --> 00:30:41.230

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.960
There's all the family
and friends around there,

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:53.740
and I said, I guess we've got
to go in the back of the line.

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.580
And they're all
following me, kind

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.170
of like, yeah, Glen, big deal.

00:30:57.170 --> 00:30:58.280

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:02.730

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:05.000
Got in line, got
up to the front,

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.820
bought the tickets from
the guy-- thank you--

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:12.930
and then went into the
park, and I was just, oh!

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:13.430
OK.

00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:14.360

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.550

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.630
I've got to cool off.

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:19.961
So I sat on the bench--

00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:21.570
the Disney park bench there--

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:28.170
and along comes the Beast--

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:29.880
the park Beast.

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.170
Boom, ba-dum,
boom, ba-dum, boom.

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.200
And he stops, and
he looks towards me,

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.050
and he comes walking
straight towards me,

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:43.260
and he sits on the
bench next to me.

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.750
So it's me and the Beast.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:46.630
I say, hi, Beast.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:54.015
I'm thinking, isn't this ironic?

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:57.730
I designed you.

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.660
I can't even get into the park.

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.810
It's just like, oh.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:05.420
And then I hear
this little girl.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:06.230
Beast!

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:07.520
Beast!

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.050
And she comes running up--

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:13.010
running straight up to Beast--
and jumps up onto his lap,

00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:16.850
hugs him, and starts
kissing his tusks.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.160
I mean, the very tusks
that as I was drawing them,

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.690
I was remembering,
I was thinking,

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:23.870
Belle's never going to
fall in love with this guy.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:29.280
Here's this little girl
just loving the Beast.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.450
I didn't even understand
that lesson of beauty

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:34.210
is only skin deep, you know.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.390
I didn't understand
it, but now I

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:41.090
did, and here's this little
girl believing in the Beast.

00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:47.980
I never felt so invisible and
just so happy to be invisible.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:53.710
Beast was real, and that
little girl saw him that way.

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:56.220
And the rest of the
day at the park, I

00:32:56.220 --> 00:32:58.240
had the best day
of my life there.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.770
It was wonderful.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:03.570
And I think this is the thing.

00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:07.150

thing inside of us,

it, to touch somebody else.

bringing technology

00:33:20.587 --> 00:33:21.670
into a new way of drawing.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:26.070
For me, I've never seen drawing
as just a flat piece of paper.

00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:30.250
I've always imagined it
as sculptural drawing,

wonderful tilt

draw in virtual reality,

I see it in my head anyway,
