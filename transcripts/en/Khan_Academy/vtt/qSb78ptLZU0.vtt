00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.441
- [Voiceover] Part C, evaluate
the second derivative of y

00:00:03.441 --> 00:00:05.132
with respect to x squared

00:00:05.132 --> 00:00:08.879
at the point on the curve
where x equals negative one

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.343
and y is equal to one.

00:00:12.343 --> 00:00:14.604
Alright, so let's just go to the beginning

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:15.816
where they tell us

00:00:15.816 --> 00:00:18.652
that dy dx is equal to

00:00:18.652 --> 00:00:21.442
y over three y squared

00:00:21.442 --> 00:00:23.282
minus x.

00:00:23.282 --> 00:00:25.183
So let me write that down.

00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:27.169
So dy

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.699
dy dx is equal to

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.959
y over three y squared

00:00:34.959 --> 00:00:36.099
minus x.

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:39.225
Three y squared minus x.

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:41.118
And now what I wanna do is essentially,

00:00:41.118 --> 00:00:43.913
take the derivative of both sides again.

00:00:43.913 --> 00:00:46.670
Now, there's a bunch of ways
that we could try to tackle it,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.113
but the way it's written right now,

00:00:48.113 --> 00:00:50.299
if I take the derivative
of the right-hand side,

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:53.061
I'm gonna have to apply the quotient rule,

00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:54.965
which is really just comes
from the product rule,

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:56.901
but it gets pretty hairy.

00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:59.985
So, let's see if I can
simplify my task a little bit.

00:00:59.985 --> 00:01:01.752
I'm going to have to do
implicit differentiation

00:01:01.752 --> 00:01:02.824
one way or the other,

00:01:02.824 --> 00:01:04.270
so what if I multiply both sides

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.376
of this times three y squared minus x?

00:01:06.376 --> 00:01:10.778
Then I get three y squared minus x

00:01:10.778 --> 00:01:14.400
times dy dx

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.391
is equal to,

00:01:16.391 --> 00:01:19.267
is equal to y.

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:21.728
And so now, taking the
derivative of both sides of this

00:01:21.728 --> 00:01:25.295
is going to be a little
bit more straightforward.

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:26.685
In fact, if I want,

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:27.575
I could,

00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:30.161
well actually, let me
just do it like this.

00:01:30.161 --> 00:01:31.362
And so, let's,

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:34.428
let's apply our derivative
operator to both sides.

00:01:34.428 --> 00:01:36.286
Let's give ourselves some space.

00:01:36.286 --> 00:01:39.442
So I'm gonna apply my derivative
operator to both sides.

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:42.149
We take the derivative
of the left-hand side

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.633
with respect to x,

00:01:43.633 --> 00:01:46.234
and the derivative of the right-hand side

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:48.436
with respect to x.

00:01:48.436 --> 00:01:50.916
And so, here I'll apply the product rule.

00:01:50.916 --> 00:01:53.518
First, I'll take the
derivative of this expression

00:01:53.518 --> 00:01:55.449
and then multiply that times dy dx,

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:57.193
and then I'll take the
derivative of this expression

00:01:57.193 --> 00:01:58.323
and multiply it times this.

00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:01.178
So, the derivative of
three y squared minus x

00:02:01.178 --> 00:02:02.764
with respect to x,

00:02:02.764 --> 00:02:04.615
well, that is going to be,

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:07.425
so if I take the derivative
of three y squared

00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:08.656
with respect to y,

00:02:08.656 --> 00:02:10.680
it's going to be six y,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.557
and then I have to take
the derivative of y

00:02:12.557 --> 00:02:13.601
with respect to x,

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:16.249
so times dy dx.

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:17.138
As we say,

00:02:17.138 --> 00:02:19.035
and this is completely unfamiliar to you

00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:21.108
and I encourage you to
watch the several videos

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.463
on Khan Academy on
implicit differentiation,

00:02:23.463 --> 00:02:25.637
which is really just an
extension of the chain rule.

00:02:25.637 --> 00:02:27.714
I took the derivative of three y squared

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:29.238
with respect to y,

00:02:29.238 --> 00:02:30.617
and took the derivative of y

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:32.035
with respect to x.

00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:33.728
Now, if I take the
derivative of negative x

00:02:33.728 --> 00:02:34.936
with respect to x,

00:02:34.936 --> 00:02:36.167
that's going to be negative one.

00:02:37.227 --> 00:02:38.397
Fair enough.

00:02:38.397 --> 00:02:39.696
And so, I took the derivative of this,

00:02:39.696 --> 00:02:40.891
I'm gonna multiply it times that.

00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:44.310
So times dy dx

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.222
and then to that,

00:02:45.222 --> 00:02:47.800
I'm going to add the derivative of this

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.752
with respect to x.

00:02:48.752 --> 00:02:50.763
Well, that's just going to
be the second derivative

00:02:50.763 --> 00:02:53.184
of y with respect to x

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:54.208
times this.

00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:56.388
And all I do is apply the product rule.

00:02:56.388 --> 00:02:59.154
Three y squared minus x.

00:02:59.154 --> 00:03:00.795
Once again, I'll say it a third time,

00:03:00.795 --> 00:03:03.243
derivative of this times this

00:03:03.243 --> 00:03:05.366
plus the derivative of this

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:06.603
times that.

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:07.317
Alright.

00:03:07.317 --> 00:03:08.431
That's going to be equal to,

00:03:08.431 --> 00:03:09.543
on the right-hand side,

00:03:09.543 --> 00:03:11.752
derivative of y with respect to x

00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:15.154
is just dy dx.

00:03:15.154 --> 00:03:15.954
Now, if I want to,

00:03:15.954 --> 00:03:19.553
I could solve for the
second derivative of y

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:20.912
with respect to x,

00:03:20.912 --> 00:03:22.317
but what could be even better than that

00:03:22.317 --> 00:03:25.901
is if I substitute
everything else with numbers

00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:27.464
because then it's just going to be a nice,

00:03:27.464 --> 00:03:30.637
easy numerical equation to solve.

00:03:30.637 --> 00:03:31.571
So, we know that,

00:03:31.571 --> 00:03:33.260
what we wanna figure out,

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.072
our second derivative,

00:03:34.072 --> 00:03:36.375
when y is equal to one.

00:03:36.375 --> 00:03:38.297
So y is equal to one.

00:03:38.297 --> 00:03:40.160
So that's going to be equal to one

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.474
and this is going to be equal to one.

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:46.245
X is equal to negative one.

00:03:46.245 --> 00:03:48.106
So, let me underline that.

00:03:48.106 --> 00:03:50.075
X is equal to negative one.

00:03:50.075 --> 00:03:52.424
So x is negative one.

00:03:52.424 --> 00:03:53.908
Are there any other xs here?

00:03:53.908 --> 00:03:55.884
And what's dy dx?

00:03:55.884 --> 00:03:57.058
Well, dy dx,

00:03:58.088 --> 00:03:59.832
dy dx

00:03:59.832 --> 00:04:01.712
is going to be equal to

00:04:01.712 --> 00:04:05.682
one over three times one,

00:04:05.682 --> 00:04:07.564
which is three,

00:04:07.564 --> 00:04:11.767
minus negative one.

00:04:11.767 --> 00:04:13.300
So, this is equal to one fourth.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.120
In fact, that's I think where
we evaluated in the beginning.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.480
Yep, at the point negative one comma one.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.130
At the point negative one comma one.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.070
So that's dy dx is one fourth.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.936
So this is one fourth,

00:04:26.936 --> 00:04:28.982
this is one fourth,

00:04:28.982 --> 00:04:31.468
and this is one fourth.

00:04:31.468 --> 00:04:33.943
And now, we can solve for the second

00:04:33.943 --> 00:04:36.163
can solve for the second derivative.

00:04:36.163 --> 00:04:38.343
Just gonna make sure I don't
make any careless mistakes.

00:04:38.343 --> 00:04:41.683
So if six times one times one fourth

00:04:41.683 --> 00:04:44.684
is going to be one point five,

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:45.573
or six,

00:04:45.573 --> 00:04:47.810
well, six times one times
one fourth is six fourths,

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.479
minus one is going to be,

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.498
so six fourths minus four
fourths is two fourths,

00:04:52.498 --> 00:04:54.370
so this is going to be one half

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.339
times one fourth,

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:57.627
times one fourth,

00:04:57.627 --> 00:04:59.270
that's this over here,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.007
plus the second derivative of y

00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:03.844
with respect to x,

00:05:03.844 --> 00:05:06.752
and here I have one minus negative one,

00:05:06.752 --> 00:05:07.681
so it's one plus one,

00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:08.956
so times two.

00:05:08.956 --> 00:05:10.615
So maybe I'll write it this way.

00:05:10.615 --> 00:05:13.670
Plus two times

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:15.820
the second derivative of y

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.262
with respect to x

00:05:17.262 --> 00:05:21.244
is equal to one fourth.

00:05:21.244 --> 00:05:22.596
And so let's see,

00:05:22.596 --> 00:05:25.492
I have one eighth

00:05:25.492 --> 00:05:29.422
plus two times the second derivative

00:05:29.422 --> 00:05:32.089
is equal to one fourth.

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:33.138
And let's see,

00:05:33.138 --> 00:05:35.637
I could subtract one
eighth from both sides.

00:05:35.637 --> 00:05:37.552
So let's subtract one eighth.

00:05:37.552 --> 00:05:39.612
Subtract one eighth.

00:05:39.612 --> 00:05:40.406
These cancel.

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:42.927
I get two times the second derivative of y

00:05:42.927 --> 00:05:44.441
with respect to x

00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:45.249
is equal to,

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:46.851
one fourth is the same
thing as two eighths,

00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:48.995
so two eighths minus one
eighth is one eighth.

00:05:48.995 --> 00:05:50.915
And then I can divide both sides by two,

00:05:50.915 --> 00:05:52.772
and we get a little bit
of a drum roll here,

00:05:52.772 --> 00:05:54.235
we divide both sides by two,

00:05:54.235 --> 00:05:57.195
or you could say multiple
both sides times one half,

00:05:58.095 --> 00:06:00.323
and you are going to get,

00:06:00.323 --> 00:06:01.713
you are going to get

00:06:01.713 --> 00:06:04.523
the second derivative of y

00:06:04.523 --> 00:06:06.500
with respect to x

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.283
when x is negative one

00:06:08.283 --> 00:06:09.761
and y is equal to one,

00:06:09.761 --> 00:06:13.401
is one over 16.

00:06:13.401 --> 00:06:14.924
And we're done.
