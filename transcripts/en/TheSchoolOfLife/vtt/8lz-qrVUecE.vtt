00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.960
We tend to reproach ourselves for staring out of the window.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.160
You're supposed to be working or studying or ticking off things on your to-do list.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.500
It can seem almost the definition of wasted time.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.920
It appears to produce nothing, to serve no purpose!

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.800
There is not prestige in it.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.080
We don't go around and say: "I had a great day, the high point was staring out of the window"

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.660
But maybe, in a better society, that's just the sort of thing people would say to one another.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.440
The point of staring out of the window is - paradoxically - not to find out, what's going on outside.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.640
It is rather an exercise in discovering the contents of our own minds.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.180
It's easy to imagine we know what we think, what we feel and what's going on in our heads.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.620
But we rarely do entirely.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.080
There is huge amount of what makes us who we are, that circulates, unexplored and unused.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.460
It's shy and doesn't emerge under the pressure of direct questioning.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.820
If we do it right, staring out of the window offers us a way to listen out

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.240
for the quieter suggestions and perspectives of our inner natures.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.240
The philosopher Plato suggested a metaphor for the mind.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.040
It's full of ideas, like a birds fluttering around in the aviary of our brains.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.920
But, in order for the birds to settle, Plato understood that we need periods of calm.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.440
Staring out of the window offers such an opportunity.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.540
The potential of daydreaming isn't recognized by societies obsessed with productivity.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.200
But some of our greatest insights come when we stop trying to be purposeful

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.680
and instead respect to the creative potential of reverie.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.960
Window daydreaming is a strategic rebellion against the excessive demands

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.440
of the immediate -but ultimately insignificant- pressures,

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.200
in favor of the diffuse, but very serious search for the insights of our deeper selves.
