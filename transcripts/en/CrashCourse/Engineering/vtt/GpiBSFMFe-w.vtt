00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.560
In 1912, the Titanic set off for her maiden
voyage across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.210
The ship’s builders were convinced that
even in the most disastrous collision at sea,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:17.150
the ship could float for two to three days,
enough time for nearby ships to come to its rescue.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.660
But on April 14th, the Titanic struck a massive
iceberg and in just three short hours the ship had sunk.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.660
The collision fractured the ship’s hull,
cracking it like a china plate, as well as 
shearing off the rivets holding it in place.

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:31.439
And as we all know, it was an absolute disaster.

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.350
One of our most important tasks as engineers
is to try and avert catastrophes like these.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.640
You see, when it comes to structures, tools
and equipment, we need to make sure they’re
made of the right stuff.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.800
That means taking a closer look at the materials
they’re made of.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.540
So this episode is really going to test your,
uh mettle.

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:58.780
[Theme Music]

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.280
If a material exists, there’s a pretty good
chance an engineer has thought about using
it at some point.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:12.400
As far back as two and a half million years ago, early
humans were using the materials around them, primarily
stone and wood, to build tools like hammers and axes.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.170
These days, we’ve developed totally new
materials.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.260
There’s aerogel, for example, which is an
ultra-light substance that can withstand high
temperatures.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:28.040
Not to mention graphene, a one-atom-thick sheet
of carbon atoms that’s stronger than steel and
superb at conducting heat and electricity.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:36.060
While those advanced materials might be used more
widely in the future, today, most materials that engineers
work with can be categorized into three groups.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.219
Metals and their alloys; ceramics and glass;
and polymers.

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.680
Which material is best suited for a job depends
on its properties, and how those properties 
affect it in practice.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.120
More specifically, whatever we’re using, it’s
vital to know the material’s mechanical properties.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.420
Mechanical properties relate to how a material’s
shape changes when a force is applied to it.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.560
To make better sense of this, it helps to
have a concrete example in mind.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.720
But we’re not actually going to use concrete.
At least not yet.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.009
Instead, we’ll consider a steel beam, like
the kind widely used in civil engineering
and construction.

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.580
Of course, we could make beams out of all
kinds of materials, and the resulting beams would
have different properties.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.080
But no matter what you’re making them
out of, there’s one important thing to know:
no material is perfectly rigid.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.970
As long as you apply a large enough force,
a beam will deform and change shape, even
if only internally.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.980
Some things you encounter in everyday life
might seem totally rigid because the change
in shape is so small.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.480
But when that stops being the case, it can
have dramatic consequences.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.180
Something that all engineers aim to avoid
is failure .

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.319
Not in the sense of whether or not you do
things exactly right all the time.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.660
Even engineers aren’t perfect, and sometimes
we get things a little wrong.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.260
It’s all part of the learning process.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.000
When it comes to materials, the word ‘failure’
describes the point at which a material breaks.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.360
And unlike messing up a few problems on
your math homework, this is the kind of failure
that isn’t worth the learning opportunity!

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.680
In a system like a car, where everything depends
on the structural integrity of the materials, the
outcome could be fatal.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:06.540
So to prevent critically dangerous situations,
engineers characterize a material’s mechanical
properties so they can prevent it from failing.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.470
If you’re using a beam to construct a building,
those properties are crucial for keeping the
structure standing tall.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.830
This is where stress comes in.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:21.450
We touched on what stress means in an engineering
context when we looked at fluids: it’s the force
applied over a particular area of the material.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.820
We can apply this type of stress to our beam
in three distinct ways:

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.900
There’s compressive stress, which pushes
in on the ends of a material.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.560
Then there’s tensile stress, which stretches
and potentially elongates it.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.100
And finally, there’s shear stress, where
you push sideways on a material in opposite
directions.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.360
To measure the effects of this stress on our
beam, we look at its strain.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.540
Strain is how much the beam’s length changes
in a particular direction.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.100
When we were discussing stresses on liquids, the
level of deformity was linked to the liquid’s viscosity:
how easily it flowed in response to pressure.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.340
In a materials context, the level of deformity
is a little more complicated.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.320
But like so many things in engineering, visualizing
it as a graph can help.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:06.040
Let’s take the beam and put it in an extensometer, a piece of equipment with an awesome name that will apply tensile strength to the beam and measure its strain.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.220
To graph what’s happening, we’ll put the
level of stress we’re applying, represented by
the greek letter ‘sigma,’ on the vertical axis.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.720
Then we’ll put the strain on the horizontal
axis.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.740
When the stress we’re applying is perpendicular
to the ends of the beam, as in the extensometer,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:22.380
the resulting change in length is called the
normal strain.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.960
That’s represented with the letter ‘epsilon.’

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.920
As we increase the stress on the object, the
material will begin to display signs of strain,
changing its length.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.360
The amount of stress a material is subjected to before
it undergoes a particular amount of strain –

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.700
in other words, the slope of the line – is
known as the modulus of elasticity.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.280
That quantity is a measure of how resistant
our material is to bending and stretching.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.120
The closer the line is to vertical, the higher
the modulus.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:52.420
To make sense of the units here, stress is
measured in gigapascals because it’s a force
applied over an area,

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.020
which gives it the same dimensions as pressure.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.180
Strain, meanwhile, is a ratio of two lengths,
so it’s a dimensionless quantity – it has no units.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.000
Putting that all together, the modulus of
elasticity has units of gigapascals.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.060
But what does the modulus actually mean?

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.410
Let’s compare beams made of two different
materials: rubber and concrete.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:17.660
Rubber has a modulus of elasticity of just 0.01
gigapascals, while concrete has a modulus of 30.

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:25.160
That means for a given amount of stress applied
to each material, the rubber will have a proportional
change in length 3,000 times that of the concrete!

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.880
That’s not surprising, right?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.280
We know it’s easier to stretch rubber than
concrete.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.580
So the modulus of elasticity, which you can
measure from the stress-strain diagram,

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.760
gives you an idea of how much the material
resists a change in shape under an applied stress.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.840
For example, in units of gigapascals, the
modulus of glass is around 50, while brass
is around 100.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.240
Steel is higher still, at around 200, while
diamond clocks in at a whopping 1,220 gigapascals!

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:58.280
So far, all the lines on the stress-strain
diagram have been straight, with constant slopes.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:06.720
But as you apply even more stress, that relationship
breaks down, and the material will begin to deform and
stretch along its cross section as well as its length.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.740
We call that point the yield stress.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:17.540
For example, apply enough tensile strength to a bar
of clay and eventually it gets thinner in the middle as it
stretches to meet the demands of high tensile stress.

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.740
Finally, if we apply enough tensile stress, the
material breaks apart entirely and undergoes failure.

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.100
And the exact same thing can happen to our
steel beam, too!

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:33.100
The stress-strain curve tells you about another
important property for avoiding failure and determining
a material’s suitability: its toughness.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.460
A material’s toughness is the amount of
energy it can absorb before it undergoes failure.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:44.320
On our diagram, that’s represented by the
total area under the curve for the material,
from the origin to the failure point.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.360
If you know a bit of calculus, you’ll recognise
this as the integral of the stress-strain curve.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.660
Toughness isn’t the same as strength, though!

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:57.830
A material might be very strong, with a very
high modulus of elasticity, but break after only
a small amount of strain.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.700
On the other hand, a material might be able
to strain a long distance without breaking,

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.980
but have a very low modulus of elasticity,
like Play-Doh.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.040
Toughness is a balance between the two.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.380
And while a tough material might be useful
for making the foundations of a building,

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.370
in other applications it might be something
you want to avoid!

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.480
For example, by adding carbon to the steel
beam, you can give it a greater yield stress.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.960
It barely deforms under a single impact, but
that also makes it more brittle.

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:29.680
Meanwhile, low carbon steel has a low modulus
of elasticity, it will deform much more quickly

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:35.030
because it has a low yield stress, but that
makes it more ductile, so it’s more useful
for shaping and welding.

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.910
But neither of those options maximizes the
toughness of steel!

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.490
Toughness would be finding the middle ground
where you maximize the area under the curve,

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:46.780
so the steel is able to absorb as much energy
as possible before fracturing.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:50.660
A measurement that comes in handy for measuring
this is the Charpy impact test,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:54.180
which tells us the toughness of our material by
whacking it with a hammer.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.180
No, seriously.

00:07:55.180 --> 00:08:01.900
The Charpy test measures toughness by taking
a small sample of material and striking it with a
hammer on a pendulum and trying to break it.

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:06.740
The height you drop the hammer from and
the height that the hammer swings up to after
smashing through the material

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.300
can determine how much energy the
hammer lost breaking the sample.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.380
And that tells you how tough the material
is.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.420
While not all material tests are quite as
fun to perform,

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:23.040
there are lots of different mechanical properties to
consider in materials that could make them totally
great for the job at hand or just completely useless.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:30.240
For example, there’s hardness, which is
how much your material deforms in a particular
location – that is, how easily you can dent it.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:38.900
Measuring hardness is simple enough: you use
a device called an indenter to apply a localized load
to your material and see how much it gets dented.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.060
Pretty straightforward!

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.800
Another mechanical property which can be a
good or a bad thing, depending on the situation,
is creep strength.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.600
Which thankfully has nothing to do with the
Minecraft monster.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:55.640
Creep strength is how much a material resists
deforming or, to use the engineering term, resists creep
under long term stress or extreme temperatures.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.560
In some cases, a low creep is a good thing.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.120
In the blades of a propellor, too much creep
could elongate the blades and make them hit
the casing, damaging them.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.720
But in a concrete structure, some amount
of creep can be useful since it prevents the
concrete from cracking outright.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:16.200
There’s also fatigue strength, which measures
how many times a material can endure a certain
amount of stress before it fails.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:24.250
Sometimes even applying small loads of stress
well below the yield stress still leaves tiny impacts,
like microscopic cracks in the material.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:31.180
If that small amount of stress is applied
repetitively, the cracks can deepen and spread in
the material until they eventually cause fracture.

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:37.310
As you’d expect, a material might be able
handle lots of little bits of stress applied
to it over time before it fractures.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.880
But it might only survive failure under a
few large stresses.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.250
The fatigue strength is the highest possible
stress a material can withstand a given number
of times before undergoing failure.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:52.820
Of course, hardness, creep strength, and fatigue
strength are just some of a material’s mechanical
properties.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.960
We might also need to consider how the surface
of our chosen material reacts with its environment,

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.680
how much it costs to produce and obtain, and
even what it looks like.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.750
And while all of those are important, it isn’t
much use considering those other properties

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:11.420
until you’re sure the material is mechanically
up to the task of handling the stresses and
strains the world is gonna throw its way.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.100
And knowing about the the strengths of the
materials you use will add to your strengths
as an engineer.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:20.260
In this episode, we’ve started considering
the materials that are used in engineering.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:27.000
We looked at mechanical properties of materials,
which describe how much strain a material undergoes
given a certain amount of stress.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.940
From stress-strain diagrams, we found useful
properties that could be measured like the
modulus of elasticity and toughness,

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.580
and described other material properties
like hardness, creep strength, and fatigue
strength.

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:44.040
Next time, we’ll get into the real substance
of things and discuss the materials themselves
in a bit more depth,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.540
starting with what makes a metal a metal.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:50.580
