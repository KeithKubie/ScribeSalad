00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:00.970
Great.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.085
Now you've seen how Packer can make
it easier to be sure you're running

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:08.789
the exact same software from
development to production without

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:10.996
worrying about changes sneaking in.

00:00:10.996 --> 00:00:12.888
&gt;&gt; And no matter where your development
and production environments go,

00:00:12.888 --> 00:00:14.725
you can expect a standard
compatible environment.

00:00:14.725 --> 00:00:16.755
Whether you're running on
servers in your closet, or

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:21.095
a hosting provider's data center, or on
a cloud provider, it'll work the same.

00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:24.265
&gt;&gt; Up ahead in lesson three, we'll take
a look at automating some of the grungy

00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:28.215
work taking freshly written code
from a repository, testing it and

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:29.755
building it out for deployment.

00:00:29.755 --> 00:00:30.255
&gt;&gt; See you then.
