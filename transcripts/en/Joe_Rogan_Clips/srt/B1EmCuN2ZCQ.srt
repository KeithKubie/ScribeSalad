1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,420
Yeah.
Um,

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,790
they were trying to do cowboy
versus Connor and apparently the,

3
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:09,690
the sticking point was that it
was going to be a co main event.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:11,910
How dare they,

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,100
I think the idea is that they have to
have world titles as a, as a main event.

6
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,860
Is there a paper says Ooh that's my,

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,910
if I west DW get your head out of
your ass. You guys one the main event.

8
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:29,020
Shoot him a text set on I don't have his
number symbol heart. Did he block too?

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,240
I think so. We're not seeing that
shit. I actually like the guy.

10
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:36,600
We have no problem.
I know I tried to get you guys together.

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,810
I gave it my best shot.
I get my fucking you tried man.

12
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:43,380
Sometimes just getting my level best.
Yeah, I don't understand it man.

13
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,600
It's weird when you have friends
that don't like each other,

14
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,620
you know when you're good friends with
both of them and they're like fuck that

15
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:52,470
guy and be like all right man.
I don't have to tell you but I don't,

16
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:54,390
I don't talk bad about him.
No you don't.

17
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:59,391
I criticize some like the UFC decisions
cause I do a show but then I have no

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,540
issue with the metal. I like
that though. I mean look,

19
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:07,950
part of the thrill of these things,
it's gotta be raging owl.

20
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:11,510
Cowboy was in my office yesterday.
You know him white said he wants a fight,

21
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:14,460
is ready to fight again. Let's fight
against working another opponent for him.

22
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:17,760
Maybe rage now sit does not specify
who's her want to be fighting next.

23
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:21,900
So it says, dude, you're
telling me Connor was like, no,

24
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,760
I'm not taking the fight
if I'm co main event.

25
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,970
Why in the fuck would you
make that are coming up? Yeah.

26
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,910
Said he could be out of action
until the fall. Mcgregor could be,

27
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:34,500
you know the other things. But Gregor
as a fun, so long, he hasn't fought MMA.

28
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:38,940
It's so long. Good. That's fine. We'll
skip the last fight was Khabib right?

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,540
But he, ted takes like almost
to two years off, right?

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,410
He fights Khabib. He gets smoked by
Khabib and then he has, how long was that?

31
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:51,480
I was that November was a long
time off. It's not good. No,

32
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,670
he needs to be active,
like really act.

33
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:55,820
It's hard to be active when
you're making that much money off.

34
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,570
That's the problem.
The whiskey,

35
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,740
the whiskey and a made like $100 million
off the Floyd Mayweather fight he's

36
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:05,550
making but popo popup up buying
prop whiskey. I'm proud of him.

37
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:09,420
He's doing great type move.
Look between you and him,

38
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,700
I mean him while he's in the middle
of his career and you post career.

39
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,900
I mean you've guys have laid
some interesting blueprints
for fighters. So yeah.

40
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,770
The um, it was October, October of 2018.

41
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:27,360
That's quite a lot long time ago. That's
not good. If trade is not that far.

42
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,510
November, December, January,
February. I was like five months ago.

43
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:34,200
It seems like a long time ago though,
doesn't it? But he has nothing coming up,

44
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,370
so nothing. Let me fighting me another
year. That was his last fight. Yep.

45
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:42,270
In two years before that was
his previous fight. Yeah.

46
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,490
It's not good. It's not good. Especially
if you want to be Creme de la creme.

47
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,420
You just can't fight like that. I think
he's only interested in big fights.

48
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,630
Like things that excite him now,
you know,

49
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,430
because he's got so much
money and so much success.

50
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,680
It's just one of those things. Can
you play mum? But here, look at that.

51
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,670
That main event, the main event of
that fight was a non title fight.

52
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,930
Conor versus Nate Diaz, that was non
title. Both. Both times they fought in,

53
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,710
but the last one, the, the fact
that it was a non title fight,

54
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:14,980
it was also the biggest
paper view of all time. Dude,

55
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:18,270
whoever recommended that he be
co main event against Galbally,

56
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,720
she get their mouse piston.

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,440
That's why Dana does it like,
well,

58
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,190
I don't know who that was amended that.

59
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,660
I'm just saying say that I disagree
with your decision. You're up.

60
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,960
I believe I can fly. God. Ugh.
