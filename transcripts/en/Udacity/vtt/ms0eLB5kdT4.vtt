00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.200
Speaking of specific prices, Grant quickly
realized that there was one small issue

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:08.225
that he hadn't dealt with yet. He hadn't
had a chance to think about how much his

00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:12.145
products should cost. I randomly picked
the numbers $5 for wipers and $3 for a

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:16.120
nozzle but he's probably going to want to
make a little bit more money than that.

00:00:16.212 --> 00:00:20.095
For some reason, his friends who had
promised to buy his products didn't seem

00:00:20.107 --> 00:00:24.647
particularly worried about how much they
would cost. But he wanted to get closer to

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:28.825
crunching some numbers so he could figure
out what kind of fortune his Gleaming

00:00:28.837 --> 00:00:33.086
Glasses products would give him. So right
now, we have this very general equation

00:00:33.098 --> 00:00:37.223
that we came up with in the last quiz for
the total amount of money that Grant's

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:41.294
going to make, but as we can see there
aren't any numbers in this yet. What we

00:00:41.306 --> 00:00:46.263
want to do is get the actual price of each
product to be involved in this equation in

00:00:46.275 --> 00:00:51.151
some way. So what other information do we
already have about this situation? Well,

00:00:51.254 --> 00:00:55.602
we learned that 36 people want to buy
glasses wipers. We also know that 11

00:00:55.614 --> 00:01:00.185
people each want two nozzles. What we
don't know yet, is the price that Grant

00:01:00.197 --> 00:01:05.852
should set for each product, a set of
wipers and one nozzle. Similar to what we

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:10.838
did before, let's pick one variable to
represent the cost per wiper set and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.482
another variable to represent the cost per
nozzle. I think I'll pick w to represent

00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:21.831
the cost per wiper set and I'll pick n to
represent the price per nozzle. Looking

00:01:21.843 --> 00:01:25.877
back up at this equation we came up with
in the last quiz, let's just start by

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:29.939
focusing on the amount of money that
Grant's going to earn from selling wiper

00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:34.101
sets. So for now, we're just going to
ignore the part of the equation about the

00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:38.503
nozzles. So, which of these expressions
down here do you think should replace this

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:42.615
question mark? How much money is Grant
going to earn from selling wipers to 36 friends?
