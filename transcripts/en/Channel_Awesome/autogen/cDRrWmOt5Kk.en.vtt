00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
when we do a film we really want to
 

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
when we do a film we really want to
throw<00:20:59.650><c> a</c><00:21:00.040><c> lot</c><00:21:00.700><c> of</c><00:21:00.940><c> money</c><00:21:01.150><c> at</c><00:21:01.450><c> it</c>

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:01.810 align:start position:0%
throw a lot of money at it
 

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.870 align:start position:0%
throw a lot of money at it
and<00:21:01.900><c> I</c><00:21:02.290><c> think</c><00:21:02.350><c> there</c><00:21:02.740><c> is</c><00:21:02.860><c> something</c><00:21:03.130><c> to</c><00:21:03.550><c> at</c>

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
and I think there is something to at
 

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.210 align:start position:0%
and I think there is something to at
least<00:21:04.150><c> what</c><00:21:04.360><c> I've</c><00:21:04.450><c> seen</c><00:21:04.690><c> with</c><00:21:04.870><c> like</c><00:21:05.220><c> the</c>

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:06.220 align:start position:0%
least what I've seen with like the
 

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.180 align:start position:0%
least what I've seen with like the
Pokemon<00:21:06.700><c> movie</c><00:21:06.880><c> and</c><00:21:07.680><c> actually</c><00:21:08.680><c> the</c><00:21:08.830><c> digit</c>

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:09.190 align:start position:0%
Pokemon movie and actually the digit
 

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
Pokemon movie and actually the digit
those<00:21:09.490><c> three</c><00:21:09.910><c> Digimon</c><00:21:10.570><c> movies</c><00:21:11.020><c> you</c><00:21:11.470><c> know</c><00:21:11.680><c> I</c>

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:11.710 align:start position:0%
those three Digimon movies you know I
 

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.830 align:start position:0%
those three Digimon movies you know I
think<00:21:11.860><c> if</c><00:21:12.340><c> they</c><00:21:12.490><c> just</c><00:21:12.520><c> let</c><00:21:12.940><c> them</c><00:21:13.150><c> play</c><00:21:13.330><c> on</c>

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
think if they just let them play on
 

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
think if they just let them play on
their<00:21:14.230><c> own</c><00:21:14.380><c> you</c><00:21:14.950><c> know</c><00:21:15.100><c> actually</c><00:21:15.520><c> the</c>

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:15.610 align:start position:0%
their own you know actually the
 

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.710 align:start position:0%
their own you know actually the
animation<00:21:16.030><c> would</c><00:21:16.120><c> have</c><00:21:16.210><c> been</c><00:21:16.330><c> decent</c>

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
animation would have been decent
 

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.990 align:start position:0%
animation would have been decent
probably<00:21:16.960><c> would</c><00:21:17.050><c> have</c><00:21:17.140><c> been</c><00:21:17.260><c> okay</c><00:21:17.590><c> um</c><00:21:18.000><c> you</c>

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
probably would have been okay um you
 

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.430 align:start position:0%
probably would have been okay um you
know<00:21:19.090><c> especially</c><00:21:19.420><c> by</c><00:21:19.660><c> the</c><00:21:19.750><c> time</c><00:21:19.960><c> it</c><00:21:20.110><c> came</c><00:21:20.230><c> out</c>

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
know especially by the time it came out
 

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.170 align:start position:0%

but<00:21:20.800><c> yeah</c><00:21:21.100><c> I</c><00:21:21.130><c> think</c><00:21:21.190><c> when</c><00:21:21.460><c> that</c><00:21:21.520><c> Pokemon</c><00:21:21.970><c> movie</c>
