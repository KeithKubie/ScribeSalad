00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.320
Most famous scientists picked a thing.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.550
But a few polymaths, like Aristotle and Ibn
Sina, picked everything.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.450
Francis Galton, one of the most important
thinkers in the generation after Darwin, fell

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.960
into column B.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.960
Hardcore.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.150
Galton was a co-founder of a range of scientific
disciplines, including meteorology, psychology,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.650
forensics, and above all statistics.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.789
He was an active member of the influential
British Association for the Advancement of

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:32.789
Science.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:34.010
He made the first weather map.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.960
Mostly, though, he is remembered for something
that we don’t even count as science today:

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.510
Galton was the father of eugenics, the idea
that the gene pool of the human species could

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.309
somehow be improved, if certain people with
different abilities didn’t have kids.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.960
Where did Galton come up with such a terrible
idea?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.940
Partly, from the work of his half-cousin.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.220
Charles Darwin.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:04.640
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.930
When Darwin and Wallace proposed their theory

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.560
of evolution by natural selection, it was
based on observing differences produced by

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.340
thousands of years of gradual changes.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.340
But we, as short-lived humans, can’t observe
thousands of years of evolutionary change

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.530
first-hand.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.520
So it was hard to know what to do with natural
selection.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.840
In the late 1800s, no one really understood
how heredity worked.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.720
But many biologists, most notably Herbert
Spencer, argued that “survival of the fittest”

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.820
applied to humans, just like other species.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.950
So they figured there must be a technical
way to use that knowledge…

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.960
Spencer, for example, argued against all laws
that limited class conflict, which he saw

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.440
as tests of fitness—including basic child
labor laws.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.130
Spencer’s idea, called social Darwinism,
influenced a lot of people in the late 1800s.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.719
And one of them was Darwin’s younger cousin,
Francis Galton.

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.450
Born in 1822 to a prominent Quaker family,
Galton was a child prodigy.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.420
Like Darwin, Galton was largely self-taught—a
“gentleman of science.”

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.160
Also, like Darwin, he never did well in school,
suffered from nervous breakdowns, and traveled

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160
widely.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.480
Unlike Darwin, Galton was not a shy scholar.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:22.020
He was obsessed with the idea of genius—whether
it was a product of good hereditary luck or learning.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.551
For Galton, as for most Victorians, nature

00:02:24.551 --> 00:02:26.330
held all of the cards.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.870
He got this idea from his cousin’s hit book.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.150
On the Origin of Species blew Galton’s mind.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.970
After 1859, Galton focused on the social implications
of Darwin’s work.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.230
He argued that an organism’s most important
characteristics must be biological, rather

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.829
than shaped by the environment or experience.

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.170
And, like Darwin, he sought evidence for his
theory.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.109
The first step was to pick some trait to track
over time.

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:57.120
He selected “eminence,” which today you
might think of as basically awesomeness.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.079
Galton thought that, if human traits can be
inherited, then tracking the descendants of

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.570
obviously eminent men—and of course they
were men—should show a decreasing level

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.370
of eminence over time, as intermarriage with
non-eminent people diluted this trait.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.280
So he gathered all of the historical evidence
he could on eminent British men and their

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.260
descendants, and indeed found that eminence
seemed to decrease over time.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.519
The resulting book, Hereditary Genius, published
in 1869, contains the first use of the phrase

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.310
“nature versus nurture.”

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.520
The book also, by the way, includes a chapter
on eminent “Wrestlers of the North Country.”

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.019
!!!
Hereditary Genius popularized the practice

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.790
of historiometry, or studying human traits
by tracking ancestry information.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.780
But Galton knew that he was barely scratching
the surface of heredity.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.040
He needed more evidence.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.140
So he did what his cousin would have done:
he turned to a model from nature.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.430
This time, twins and peas instead of pigeons
and barnacles.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.590
In 1875, in the paper, “The history of twins,”
he proposed studying twins, which he saw as

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.890
a natural experiment.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:08.570
By the mid 1900s, twin studies became the
foundation of behavioral genetics, or how

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.590
heredity affects behavior.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.540
Galton realized that twins presented a “natural
experiment”: if nature is more powerful

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:21.030
than nurture, then twins should be more similar
than not, even if they’re raised apart.

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.290
But if nurture is more powerful, then twins
should behave differently when raised apart.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.740
Galton didn’t conduct his own twin studies,
but he outlined what future research should look like.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.130
Galton also developed statistical methods
to research inheritance, and in doing so,

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.690
he created the quantitative science of human
behavior.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.950
ThoughtBubble, show us how:

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.660
Galton also started breeding sweet peas, comparing
the sizes of the offspring of different seeds.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.760
Galton’s work with peas led him to conclude
that traits tend toward a statistical average.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.210
Galton couldn’t figure out why, but he
could use statistics to model the general

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.590
pattern of how traits were distributed over
time—in this case, in a “normal” distribution,

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.000
a bell curve.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.100
In 1884, Galton took his pea model to the
International Health Exhibition in London.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.770
Visitors to his “Anthropometric Lab” paid
to have Galton measure their bodies, minds,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.750
and senses in various ways.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.230
He produced many new instruments in order
to measure, for example, eyesight.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:26.240
Visitors received the results, and Galton
also kept a copy to add to his library of

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.580
research on variation in humans.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.600
This practice, known as anthropometry—or
literally, measuring humans—became common

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.030
across many disciplines.

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.030
Galton also pioneered the use of fingerprinting
in forensics.

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.050
He classified the features that we still look
for: loops, whorls, and arches.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.140
Thanks ThoughtBubble.
So Galton built on Darwin’s work to invent

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.890
a statistical science of life.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.070
But now it gets weird.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.860
And, frankly, difficult.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.900
Because Galton decided that, based on his
investigations of inheritance, good traits

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:03.280
such as genius and morality were diluted down
to some norm over time.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.820
In 1883, one year after Cousin Chuck passed
away, Galton published Inquiries into Human

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.070
Faculty and Its Development, in which he coined
the term “eugenics”—the discipline of

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.620
“good breeding,” or literally making “good
families,” in humans.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.231
Galton was not the first to suggest that smart
people should have kids with each other, or

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.860
that cousins should avoid marrying.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.340
What Galton did was argue—based on what
he saw as scientific evidence—for the public

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.800
to do something about these ideas.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.460
He wanted “families of merit” to grow,
and he thought the government should incentivize

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.860
this growth.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.270
This was called “positive eugenics.”

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.360
Galton pointed out that many well-born Victorians
married late and had few kids, compared to

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.389
the lower classes.

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:54.950
If this fear of the weakening of supposedly
“good stock” by new, poor, or different

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.310
people sounds familiar, that’s partly because
Galton’s so-called “science” of eugenics

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.560
quickly gained traction.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.860
The First International Congress of Eugenics
was held in 1912, the year after Galton died.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.020
And it was around this time that nations began
passing “eugenical” laws.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.910
Particularly the United States.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:17.910
Driven by a fear that births of supposedly
inferior people would lead to weak or criminally

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:23.660
“degenerate” adults, some states introduced
forcible sterilization laws starting in 1907.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.590
These were mostly used to justify the sterilization
of already incarcerated groups and those with

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:29.950
different abilities.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:34.360
This was “negative eugenics,” which was
not something Galton had explicitly argued for.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.440
The metaphor used by eugenicists was drawn
from Darwin, but modified: a family or nation

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.160
was a tree, and its branches sometimes needed
“pruning.”

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:48.500
A famous example of this thinking in the United
States was psychologist Henry Goddard’s

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.139
1912 book about a family from New Jersey called
the “Kallikaks.”

00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:57.350
This was a made-up name for a real family
whose genealogy Goddard studied to understand

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.490
what he called “feeblemindedness,” or
intellectual disability.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:05.449
In the book, Goddard compared the branch of
the Kallikak family that was descended from

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:10.050
its founding father’s legitimate marriage,
and the branch descended from that founder’s

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.340
affair with a “nameless feeble-minded girl.”

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:18.880
Goddard concluded that feeblemindedness was
strongly heritable and a danger to democracy.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.590
Although he later admitted this was a flawed
study, it was a hit, and his terms for different

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.860
levels of intelligence became common: “moron,”
“imbecile,” “idiot.”

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.950
Goddard’s attempts to quantify intelligence
weren’t at the fringes of science.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.630
His ideas are creepily still with us in the
form of intelligence quotient or IQ tests.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:42.760
Goddard, who was a big-time fan of Galtonian
eugenics, translated the work of three major

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.210
French psychologists in 1910.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:49.670
This translation was picked up by Lewis Terman
at Stanford University, who adapted the work

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:54.160
of the French to create the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales in 1916.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:58.020
Goddard and Terman then worked with Robert
Yerkes to develop an IQ test

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:00.050
for the US Army in 1917.

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:04.640
The US Army introduced aptitude tests to place
soldiers in different roles.

00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:09.180
But the tests were highly discriminatory,
privileging white candidates from educated

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.180
backgrounds.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:15.670
The trial of the test showed very low results
for non-Northern European whites and non-whites.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.920
Goddard spent much of the rest of his life
publicizing these results—even though they

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.750
were contested in his own day as shoddy science.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:27.690
There were sooo many other serious, Galton-inspired
scientists who did creepy research on human

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.470
difference and argued for terrible policies,
we could do a whole creepy spin-off show.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.260
Instead, let’s just talk about some of the
worst.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.130
A lawyer and zoologist named Madison Grant
wrote a book called The Passing of the Great

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.320
Race in 1916, citing Galton.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.190
Grant subdivided Caucasians into three types,
claiming that the great “Nordics” were

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.520
being rapidly outbred in the United States
by inferior types of whites.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:58.150
Meanwhile, Charles Davenport, a very influential
zoologist, founded the Eugenics Record Office

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.120
at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in 1910.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.050
He collected data to help people check whether
a potential marriage was suitable.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.050
And, maybe unsurprisingly,

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.320
Davenport was a fan of the Nazis.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.910
But probably the eugenicist most well known
to us today was the nurse who coined the term

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:20.440
“birth control” and opened the first US
birth control clinic in 1916: Margaret Sanger.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:24.600
Sanger founded the American Birth Control
League to educate people about safe abortion

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.450
procedures and contraceptives.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:30.670
She gave lectures on birth control to many
groups, including the KKK in 1926.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:37.220
In the 1920s and ‘30s, Sanger thought that
eugenics would give her movement legitimacy.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.730
Eugenics became a dominant theme at her birth
control conferences, and she spoke publicly

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:45.000
of the need to put an end to breeding by the
unfit.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.149
By the late 1920s, eugenics had been recognized
as bad science by most practicing biologists.

00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:56.600
But as a source of policy for many lawmakers
in the United States, Germany, and elsewhere,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.320
eugenics was still very much alive.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:03.280
In the 1800s, science had become much more
important for states.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.470
They wanted to understand their populations…
and, now, shape them.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:12.520
Compulsory sterilization was challenged in
the US Supreme Court in 1927 in the famous

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.730
Buck v. Bell case.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:18.710
But the decision, written by Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes, Jr., sided with the eugenicists

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:21.140
and has never technically been overturned.

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:26.550
In fact, forced sterilization was still happening
in California prisons until it was banned

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.110
in 2014.

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:33.750
Did Galton think that studying human difference
would lead to bad science and even worse laws?

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.750
Not necessarily.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.040
But in some ways, his legacy -- a legacy of
comparing humans quantitatively -- is still

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040
with us.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.710
Next time—we’ll see what’s going on
in a less creepy area of the life sciences:

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:48.380
it’s time for Pasteur, Koch, and the birth
of microbiology!

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.940
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:56.190
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.190
Thought Cafe.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.959
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:02.459
If you wanna keep imagining the world complexly
with us, you can check out some of our other

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:05.320

free for everybody, forever, you can support
