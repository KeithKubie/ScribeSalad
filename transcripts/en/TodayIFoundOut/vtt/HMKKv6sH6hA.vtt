00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.180
On Monday, December 14, 1903, the Wright brothers
took the Wright Flyer out in their first attempt

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.180
to fly it.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.919
The plane “flew” only for a few seconds,
stalling when Wilbur pulled up too sharply

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:24.280
as soon as the plane was in the air.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.540
Three days later, after repairing the damage
done to the craft, Orville took his turn at

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.520
the controls and achieved a slightly more
successful flight, though he too underestimated

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.300
the elevator sensitivity, resulting in him
flying in something of a sinusoidal pattern

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.990
before crashing.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:43.740
Before his “landing,” though, he managed
to fly the plane for about 12 seconds and

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.200
a distance of around 120 ft.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.770
After minor repairs, the two took turns with
the longest flight of the day lasting 59 seconds

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.050
and covering 852 feet.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.140
Unfortunately, the Flyer was damaged after
this flight.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.760
Before the two could repair it for future
flights, a gust of wind came up and toppled

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.829
the craft, damaging it beyond immediate repair
(though it was many years later mostly repaired

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:07.640
for display in museums).

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.050
Whether these constituted the real first manned,
powered flights is up for debate.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.341
Many people before this had developed successful
gliders (including the Wright brothers), some

00:01:16.341 --> 00:01:21.439
developed successful powered craft (though
not manned), and there are a few others with

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.729
reasonably credible stories that claimed to
have created and flown manned, powered aircraft

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.780
before the Wright brothers.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.770
Whether they were the first or not, what set
the Wright brothers’ craft apart from many

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.009
other claimants of the day was that their
craft was not only powered and capable of

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.580
carrying a person, but it was also fully controllable,
and the three-axis system they developed to

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.450
achieve this is not too dissimilar to the
way planes are controlled today.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.820
As for the Flyer II, it was more or less the
same as the Flyer I except it was equipped

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.119
with a more powerful motor and made from a
different type of wood.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.420
This flew 105 times and the brothers were
able to achieve flight times as much as five

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.579
minutes long, often showing off their innovative
control system via flying in full circles.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.690
With the Flyer III, they did even better,
including one flight where Wilbur flew in

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.330
circles for 39 minutes straight for a total
distance of twenty-four miles on October 5,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.330
1905.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.129
By 1908, five years after they took their
legendary powered flight, the Wright brothers

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:30.100
were traveling all over the United States
and Europe demonstrating their fabulous flying

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.629
machine and taking various people up with
them in the demonstrations.

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.390
Everything went well-until September of that
year.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.629
That was when Orville Wright was demonstrating
their machine at Fort Myers, Virginia.

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:48.250
At this time, the U.S. Army was interested
in purchasing aircraft from the Wright brothers.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.349
It was the job of the younger Wright brother
to show how safe and practical their plane

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:53.349
was.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.430
On September 10th, he took Lieutenant Frank
D. Lahm with him on a flight.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.690
Two days later, Orville flew Major George
O. Squier around for 9 minutes.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.200
These first two flights went swimmingly, but
the next was a catastrophe.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.489
takeoffOn September 17, 1908, Orville Wright
took 26-year-old Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.760
up for another demonstration.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.650
A cheering crowd of an estimated 2,000 people
gathered to witness the flight.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.060
Selfridge waved to the crowd as the plane
took off.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.790
Wright flew a few laps over the parade ground
at approximately 150 feet without incident,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.340
but then disaster struck.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.659
In his own words,

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:33.319
On the fourth round, everything seemingly
working much better and smoother than any

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.989
former flight, I started on a larger circuit
with less abrupt turns.

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.239
It was on the very first slow turn that the
trouble began.

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.450
… A hurried glance behind revealed nothing
wrong, but I decided to shut off the power

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.959
and descend as soon as the machine could be
faced in a direction where a landing could

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:50.959
be made.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.359
This decision was hardly reached, in fact
I suppose it was not over two or three seconds

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.510
from the time the first taps were heard, until
two big thumps, which gave the machine a terrible

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.330
shaking, showed that something had broken.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:07.269
… The machine suddenly turned to the right
and I immediately shut off the power.

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.519
Quick as a flash, the machine turned down
in front and started straight for the ground.

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.969
Our course for 50 feet was within a very few
degrees of the perpendicular.

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:21.170
Lt. Selfridge up to this time had not uttered
a word, though he took a hasty glance behind

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.740
when the propeller broke and turned once or
twice to look into my face, evidently to see

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.920
what I thought of the situation.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.770
But when the machine turned head first for
the ground, he exclaimed ‘Oh!

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.680
Oh!’ in an almost inaudible voice.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.291
Under normal circumstances, Orville may have
been able to simply glide the plane in, but

00:04:39.291 --> 00:04:43.900
unfortunately the broken propeller struck
the wire that was bracing the vertical rudder,

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.290
which is what caused the sudden nose dive.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:51.100
Wilbur did manage to recover some semblance
of control in the end, but wasn’t able to

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.540
land the plane normally, hitting the ground
nose first and throwing the two passengers

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.880
forward in the wreckage.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.470
Unfortunately for Selfridge, in the process,
his head struck a piece of the wood frame

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.520
of the airplane, cracking his skull.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.900
Flyer_crashThe pair were soon extracted from
the wreckage and miraculously they were both

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.260
still alive, though a bit bloodied up.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.650
But whereas Orville was still conscious, Selfridge
was not.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.010
Both men were rushed to the nearby hospital
on stretchers and Selfridge was quickly operated

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.010
on.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.010
Despite this, he didn’t make it, with the
official cause of death being listed as complications

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.030
due to a fractured skull.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.260
And so it was that Thomas Selfridge gained
the dubious honor of being the first person

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.820
to die in an airplane crash.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.820
He was subsequently buried with military honors
at Arlington National Cemetery (which by the

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.820
way has a surprisingly fascinating history).

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.770
It is generally thought that had he been wearing
a helmet, he likely would have survived the

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.550
crash as the rest of his injuries, while non-trivial,
were not considered life-threatening.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.440
Because of his death, when the army started
sending pilots up in planes, they required

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.310
that they wear thick headgear for protection.

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.600
As for Orville, he escaped death, but did
suffer a broken left leg, fractured and dislocated

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.440
hip, several broken ribs, cuts on his head,
and bruises all over his body.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.310
After about a month and a half in the hospital,
he was released on October 31st.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.780
Although he was to walk and fly again, he
did suffer pain from the fractures to his

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.100
hip for the rest of his life, which turned
out to be a long one.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.280
While his brother, Wilbur, died just four
years after this incident, in 1912, Orville

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.330
made it all the way to 1948, getting a chance
to see the airplane industry go from a couple

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.560
of bike mechanics in an empty field to a form
of transport that came to dominate long distance

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.900
travel and became essential in various military
exploits, the latter of which Orville was

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.750
not at all happy about.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.930
He stated after WWII,

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.310
We dared to hope we had invented something
that would bring lasting peace to the earth.

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:45.460
But we were wrong….No, I don’t have any
regrets about my part in the invention of

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.830
the airplane, though no one could deplore
more than I do the destruction it has caused.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.020
I feel about the airplane much the same as
I do in regard to fire.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.460
That is I regret all the terrible damage caused
by fire, but I think it is good for the human

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.800
race that someone discovered how to start
fires and that we have learned how to put

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:20.440
fire to thousands of important uses.
