00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.040
Everyone talks about how amazing the human
brain is, but you know what gets no credit?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.040
The spine.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:22.820
C’mon spine, show some backbone!

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.000
Hey there my veritable vertebrates, Julian
here for DNews.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.481
We’ve talked a lot on this show about how
the human brain is incredible, It’s your

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:34.260
own personal computer that can solve problems
and feel love.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.940
It’s basically what I hope siri will be
by the next iphone.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.530
But the brain ain’t nothing without the
spine.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.079
It’s your spine that sends the motor signals
from your brain to your limbs so you can walk

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.300
and pat yourself on the back.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.510
Thanks spine!

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.480
Sensory signals travel back up your spine
to your brain, so you can feel when you’re

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.219
getting a hug or a high five.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.280
Way to go, spine!

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.210
The spine can even operate without the brain
in some cases.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.870
The spine can store or learn reflexes.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.220
When the doctor makes your knee jerk, or a
hockey goalie catches a puck going 100 miles

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.600
an hour, that’s all spine, baby.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.140
Otherwise it would take too much time for
the brain to react and send the signal to

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.540
the limbs, and the puck would be in the net.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.690
So because the spine does so much more than
prop you upright, it’s bad news when it

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.690
gets damaged.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.500
The spine and the brain both exhibit neuroplasticity,
meaning they can adapt and rewire themselves

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.500
when they’re injured.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.610
By the way, longtime viewers of the show know
when we say the word “neuroplasticity,”

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.130
the DNews drinking game has begun.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.070
However the spine’s neuroplasticity is very
limited compared to the brain’s neuroplasticity.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.409
If the damage is severe enough, glial scars
form that inhibit the regeneration of nerve

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.600
fibers or axons and communication with the
brain is cut off past that point.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.210
But there’s been a breakthrough.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.280
Derek Fidyka has been paralyzed from the chest
down since being stabbed in 2010.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.990
Because our damaged central nervous system
doesn’t generate new axons, scientists basically

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.979
hacked the human body to restore Fidyka’s
spine.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.770
They took Olfactory Ensheathing Glia, which
stimulate the growth of Olfactory Axons in

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.070
your nose, put them in his spine, and boom!

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:14.000
After just 6 months of 5 hours of exercise
and therapy 5 days a week, he can walk using

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.110
leg braces and parallel bars.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.320
Ok it’s not instant gratification.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.709
In fact it’s a lot of very hard work that’s
physically and emotionally exhausting.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.940
But it’s worth it just to be able to walk
again, and to me the guy’s a hero.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.260
He’s like, Axon Jackson.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.959
So if you can walk, don’t take it for granted.

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.860
Be grateful and hug a spine today.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.860
With the spine owner’s permission, obviously.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.860
If you’d like to learn more about neuroplasticity,
Anthony covers that here.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:36.860
in fact learning from that video will actually
make use of neuroplasticity.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.470
What are some simple things your body does
you’re grateful for?

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.690
I’m grateful to my liver every time we do
a video involving neuroplasticity.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.330
Let us know in the comments and thanks for
watching DNews…

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.360
