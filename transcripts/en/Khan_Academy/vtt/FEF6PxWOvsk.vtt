00:00:00.294 --> 00:00:01.710
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:08.160
give a very high-level overview
of the four fundamental forces

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.280
of the universe.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.795
And I'm going to
start with gravity.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.310
And it might surprise some of
you that gravity is actually

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.640
the weakest of the four
fundamental forces.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.590
And that's surprising
because you say, wow,

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.220
that's what keeps us glued--
not glued-- but it keeps us

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.800
from jumping off the planet.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.220
It's what keeps the Moon
in orbit around the Earth,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.770
the Earth in orbit around
the Sun, the Sun in orbit

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.290
around the center of
the Milky Way galaxy.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.970
So if it's a little
bit surprising

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.810
that it's actually the
weakest of the forces.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.110
And that starts to make
sense when you actually

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.460
think about things on maybe
more of a human scale,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.840
or a molecular scale,
or even atomic scale.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.190
Even on a human scale, your
computer monitor and you,

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.290
have some type of
gravitational attraction.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.540
But you don't notice it.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.450
Or your cell phone and
your wallet, there's

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.590
gravitational attraction.

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.923
But you don't see them being
drawn to each other the way

00:01:00.923 --> 00:01:03.830
you might see two magnets
drawn to each other

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.140
or repelled from each other.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.723
And if you go to
even a smaller scale,

00:01:06.723 --> 00:01:08.800
you'll see the it
matters even less.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.840
We never even talk about
gravity in chemistry,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.950
although the gravity is there.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.370
But at those scales,
the other forces really,

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.580
really, really
start to dominate.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.020
So gravity is our weakest.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.950
So if we move up a
little bit from that,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.510
we get-- and this is maybe
the hardest force for us

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.190
to visualize.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.540
Or it's, at least, the least
intuitive force for me--

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.820
is actually the weak
force, sometimes called

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.210
the weak interaction.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.250
And it's what's responsible
for radioactive decay,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.850
in particular beta minus
and beta plus decay.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.720
And just to give you an example
of the actual weak interaction,

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:55.660
if I had some cesium-137--
137 means it has 137 nucleons.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.230
A nucleon is either a
proton or a neutron.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.310
You add up the protons
and neutrons of cesium,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.970
you get 137.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.301
And it is cesium, because
it has exactly 55 protons.

00:02:07.301 --> 00:02:08.759
Now, the weak
interaction is what's

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.260
responsible for one of
the neutrons-- essentially

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.690
one of its quarks flipping
and turning into a proton.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.940
And I'm not going to go into
detail of what a quark is

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.090
and all of that.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.347
And the math can
get pretty hairy.

00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:21.930
But I just want to
give you an example

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.346
of what the weak
interaction does.

00:02:23.346 --> 00:02:26.630
So if one of these neutrons
turns into a proton,

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.815
then we're going to
have one extra proton.

00:02:28.815 --> 00:02:31.930
But we're going to have the
same number of nucleons.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.370
Instead of an
extra neutron here,

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.420
you now have an
extra proton here.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.260
And so now this is
a different atom.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.430
It is now barium.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.480
And in that flipping,
it will actually

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.550
emit an electron and an
anti-electron neutrino.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.290
And I'm not going to go
into the details of what

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.670
an anti-electron neutrino is.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:56.430
These are fundamental particles.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.690
But this is just what
the weak interaction is.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.830
It's not something that's
completely obvious to us.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.960
It's not the kind of this
traditional things pulling

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.730
or pushing away from
each other, like we

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.964
associate with the other forces.

00:03:09.964 --> 00:03:11.630
Now, the next strongest
force-- and just

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.080
to give a sense of
how weak gravity

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.020
is even relative to
the weak interaction,

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.035
the weak interaction
is 10 to the 25th times

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:24.035
the strength of gravity.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.080
And you might be saying,
if this is so strong, how

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.890
come this does it
operate on planets

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.470
or us relative to the Earth?

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.902
Why doesn't this apply to
intergalactic distances

00:03:38.902 --> 00:03:39.776
the way gravity does?

00:03:39.776 --> 00:03:43.310
And the reason is the weak
interaction really applies

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:50.100
to very small distances,
very, very small distances.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.280
So it can be much
stronger than gravity,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.380
but only over very,
very-- and it really

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.520
only applies on the
subatomic scale.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.690
You go anything beyond
that, it kind of

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.870
disappears as an actual force,
as an actual interaction.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.430
Now, the next force
up the hierarchy,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.530
which is one that we
are more familiar with,

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.540
it's what actually dominates
most of the chemistry

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.760
that we deal with
and electromagnetism

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.975
that we deal with, and that's
the electromagnetic force.

00:04:19.975 --> 00:04:29.820
Let me write it in magenta,
electromagnetic force.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.541
And just to give a sense,
this is 10 to the 36 times

00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:35.540
the strength of gravity.

00:04:38.082 --> 00:04:40.040
So it kind of puts the
weak force in its place.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.540
It's 10 to the 12th times
stronger than the weak force.

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.040
So these are huge
numbers that we're

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.831
talking about, either
this relative to that

00:04:45.831 --> 00:04:48.539
or even this
relative to gravity.

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.080
And so you might be
saying, well, you

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.150
know the electromagnetic force,
that's unbelievably strong.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.890
Why doesn't that apply over
these kind of macro scales

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:59.790
like gravity?

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.310
Let me write it
there, macro scales.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.170
Why doesn't it apply
to macro scales?

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.595
And there's nothing about the
electromagnetic force, why

00:05:08.595 --> 00:05:12.830
it can't, or it actually does
apply over large distances.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.550
The reality though, is you don't
have these huge concentrations

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.830
of either Coulomb charges or
magnetism the way you do mass.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.310
So the mass that you have
such huge concentrations,

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.690
it can operate over
huge, huge distances,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.450
even though it's
way, way, way weaker

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.850
than the electromagnetic force.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.650
The electromagnetic
force, what happens

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.740
is because it's both
attractive and repulsive,

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.440
it tends to kind
of sort itself out.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.970
So you don't have these huge,
huge, huge concentrations

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:42.930
of charge.

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.971
Now, the other thing you
might be wondering about

00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:47.820
is, why is it called the
electromagnetic force?

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.130
In our everyday life, there's
things like the Coulomb force

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.740
or the electrostatic force,
which we're familiar with.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.810
Positive charges or
like charges want

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.810
to repel-- if both of
these were negative,

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:02.280
the same thing
would be happening--

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.170
and different charges
like to attract.

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:07.500
We've seen this multiple times.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.330
This is the Coulomb force
or the electrostatic force.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.240
And then on the other
side of the word, I guess,

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.720
you have the magnetic part.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.710
And magnets, you've played
with magnets on your fridge.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.850
If they're the same
side of the magnet,

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:25.364
they're going to
repel each other.

00:06:25.364 --> 00:06:27.280
If they're the opposite
sides, opposite poles,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.780
they're going to
attract each other.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.332
So why is it called one force?

00:06:30.332 --> 00:06:32.290
And it's called one
force-- and once again, I'm

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.970
not going to go into
detail here-- it's

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.670
called one force
because it turns out,

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.180
that the Coulomb force,
the electrostatic force

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.210
and magnetic force are
actually the same thing viewed

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.922
in different frames
of references.

00:06:46.922 --> 00:06:48.380
So I won't go into
a lot of detail.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.880
But just keep that in the
back of your mind, that they

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:50.520
are connected.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.978
And in a future
video, I'll go more

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:54.330
into the intuition of
how they are connected.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:07:00.800
And it's more apparent
when the charges are moving

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.550
at relativistic frames
and you have-- well,

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.350
I won't go into a
lot of detail there.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.933
But just keep in
mind that they really

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:10.060
are the same force, just
viewed from different frames

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.010
of reference.

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.060
Now, the strongest of
the force is probably

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.480
the best named of them all.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.770
And that's the strong force.

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:24.340
That is the strong force.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:26.670
And although you probably
haven't seen this yet

00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:28.320
in chemistry
classes, it actually

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.040
applies very strongly
in chemistry.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.450
Because from the get-go, when
you first learn about atoms--

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:35.580
let me draw a helium atom.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:42.350
A helium atom has two
protons in its nucleus

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.380
and it has two neutrons.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.920
And then it also has two
electrons circulating around.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.850
So it has an electron.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.890
And I could draw the
electron as much smaller.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.890
Well, I won't try to do
anything in relative size.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:55.830
But it has two electrons
floating around.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.730
And one question that may or may
not have jumped into your mind

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:01.610
when you first saw
this model of an atom

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:04.290
is like, well, I see
why the electrons are

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:05.780
attracted to the nucleus.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.680
It has a negative
Coulomb charge.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.570
The nucleus has a net
positive Coulomb charge.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:12.140
But what's not so
obvious and what

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.790
tends not to sometimes be
explained in chemistry class

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.410
is these two
positive charges are

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.970
sitting right next
to each other.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:21.257
If the electromagnetic force
was the only force in play,

00:08:21.257 --> 00:08:23.340
if the Coulomb force was
the only thing happening,

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.280
these guys would just
run away from each other.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.874
They could repel each other.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:29.290
And so the only
reason why they're

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:31.680
able to stick to each
other is that there's

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.730
an even stronger force than
the electromagnetic force

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:37.900
operating at these very,
very, very small distances.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.000
So if you get two of these
protons close enough together,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.090
and the strong force only
applies over very, very, very

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:47.760
small distances,
subatomic or I should even

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.480
say subnucleic distances,
then the strong interaction

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.460
comes into play.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:56.360
So then you have the strong
interaction actually keeping

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.880
these charges together.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:02.100
And once again, just to keep
it in mind relative to gravity,

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:09.100
it is 10 to the 38th times
the strength of gravity.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.505
Or it's about 100 times stronger
than the electromagnetic force.

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:13.880
So once again,
the reason why you

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.710
don't see the
strong force, which

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:17.360
is the strongest
of all the forces,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.310
or the weak interaction,
applying over huge scales

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.700
is that their strength
dies off super, super fast.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.630
Even when you start going
to a larger radius nucleuses

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.920
of atoms, the strength
starts to die off,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.674
especially for the strong force.

00:09:32.674 --> 00:09:35.340
The reason why you don't see the
electromagnetic force operating

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.050
over large distances, even
though in theory it can,

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.230
like gravity, is
that you don't see

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.370
the type of charge
concentrations the way

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.130
you see mass concentrations
in the universe.

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.820
Because the charge
concentrations

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:47.917
tend to sort them out.

00:09:47.917 --> 00:09:48.875
They start to equalize.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.020
If I have a huge
positive charge there

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.130
and a huge negative
charge there,

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.890
they will attract each
other and then become

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:04.110
essentially a big lump
of neutral charge.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.280
And once they're a big
lump of neutral charge,

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.100
they won't interact
with anything else.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.170
And gravity, if you have
one mass and another mass,

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.540
and they attract
each other, then you

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.040
have another mass
that's even better

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.480
to attracting at other masses.

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.810
And so it'll keep
attracting things to it.

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:21.690
So it kind of
snowballs the process.

00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:24.440
And that's why gravity operates
on these really, really

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.710
large, large objects
in our universe

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.290
and on the universe as a whole.
