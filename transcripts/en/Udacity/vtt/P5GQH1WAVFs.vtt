00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.480
Let's start off by looking at two important

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.750
data relationships when you do modeling in data

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.480
store. They are ancestor relationships and has-a relationships.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.960
Starting off with the ancestor relationship in data store

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.190
it is possible to specify that an entity

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.970
has an ancestor entity. There are two important

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.180
rules for ancestor relationships. First of all, it

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.620
needs to be assigned when the entity is created.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.860
And secondly it can never be changed so

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.060
those are things to think about when you model

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.960
an ancestor relationship. And given those rules, please note

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.860
that the ancestor relationship is not the same as

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.900
the is-a relationship in object oriented modeling. In conference

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.790
central, we will use the ancestor relationship for the

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.130
conference kind that you will create shortly. Where the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.030
ancestor will be the user who created the conference.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.270
Technically speaking though since the users are identified

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.720
through their profile entities, so in this case the

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.740
conferences will have the key of the profile

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.120
entity as their ancestor key. The other relationship we

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.770
will be using is the has-a relationship. We

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.020
will be using this relationship to model conferences which

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.560
users are attending. To do this we will

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.460
add a property to the profile entity which specifies

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.150
the attended conferences. So each profile will have

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.970
a property that contains the conferences that they are

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.128
attending, observe that this relationship can easily change.

00:01:29.128 --> 00:01:32.040
We can deregister from conferences and register to new

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.000
ones, so it is not bounded by the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.570
strict rules of the ancestor relationship. So those are

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.010
the basics of these relationships and that's also

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.330
enough theory for now. Time to do some coding.
