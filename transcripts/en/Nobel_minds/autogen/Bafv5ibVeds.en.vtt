00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.570
Adam Smith calling from nobelprize.org
and congratulations thank you very much

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580
and congratulations thank you very much
 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.360
and congratulations thank you very much
it must be quite a day you're suffering

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370
it must be quite a day you're suffering
 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.870
it must be quite a day you're suffering
yes still at the University of London

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880
yes still at the University of London
 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.509
yes still at the University of London
somebody is taking care of me well up so

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
somebody is taking care of me well up so
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:30.259
somebody is taking care of me well up so
they that's nice yeah okay so just a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
they that's nice yeah okay so just a
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.420
they that's nice yeah okay so just a
couple of quick questions you have been

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430
couple of quick questions you have been
 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.850
couple of quick questions you have been
awarded in part because of your

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860
awarded in part because of your
 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.860
awarded in part because of your
development of vitrification of water

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
development of vitrification of water
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.200
development of vitrification of water
and people try so people know about

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
and people try so people know about
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.260
and people try so people know about
liquid water and they know about ice but

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270
liquid water and they know about ice but
 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.760
liquid water and they know about ice but
I guess most people don't know about

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
I guess most people don't know about
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.540
I guess most people don't know about
vitrified water yes if you cool water

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550
vitrified water yes if you cool water
 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.619
vitrified water yes if you cool water
it's become eyes it would be great if

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
it's become eyes it would be great if
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.770
it's become eyes it would be great if
you could cool the water and immobilize

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
you could cool the water and immobilize
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.470
you could cool the water and immobilize
the molecules so keeping the structure

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480
the molecules so keeping the structure
 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.479
the molecules so keeping the structure
because when it's frozen when it's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
because when it's frozen when it's
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.820
because when it's frozen when it's
immobilized you can have it in the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
immobilized you can have it in the
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.250
immobilized you can have it in the
electron microscope and the water will

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
electron microscope and the water will
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.130
electron microscope and the water will
not evaporate because in the electron

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
not evaporate because in the electron
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.230
not evaporate because in the electron
microscope it must be on the vacuum and

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240
microscope it must be on the vacuum and
 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.840
microscope it must be on the vacuum and
water at root normal temperature

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
water at root normal temperature
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.230
water at root normal temperature
evaporates so that when it was possible

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
evaporates so that when it was possible
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.070
evaporates so that when it was possible
to vitrified biological materials you

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080
to vitrified biological materials you
 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.249
to vitrified biological materials you
could have it in the microscope in the

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259
could have it in the microscope in the
 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.460
could have it in the microscope in the
vitrified state and observe it quietly

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470
vitrified state and observe it quietly
 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.280
vitrified state and observe it quietly
in the electron microscope this was the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
in the electron microscope this was the
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.609
in the electron microscope this was the
beginning and so if you had have it in

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
beginning and so if you had have it in
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.469
beginning and so if you had have it in
ice or if you have it without water the

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479
ice or if you have it without water the
 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.130
ice or if you have it without water the
the molecules like fish or dead yes

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140
the molecules like fish or dead yes
 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.590
the molecules like fish or dead yes
beautifully said and this the Nobel

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
beautifully said and this the Nobel
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.330
beautifully said and this the Nobel
Prize will put a lot of public attention

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340
Prize will put a lot of public attention
 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.569
Prize will put a lot of public attention
on you how do you feel about that and

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579
on you how do you feel about that and
 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.550
on you how do you feel about that and
about the responsibility of scientists

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
about the responsibility of scientists
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.350
about the responsibility of scientists
who interact with the public that's

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
who interact with the public that's
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.010
who interact with the public that's
interesting I've been during the 20

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
interesting I've been during the 20
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.929
interesting I've been during the 20
years I was at the University of

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939
years I was at the University of
 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.870
years I was at the University of
Lausanne I devoted a lot of effort to

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880
Lausanne I devoted a lot of effort to
 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.869
Lausanne I devoted a lot of effort to
curriculum biology and society and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
curriculum biology and society and
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.240
curriculum biology and society and
London at that time was unique

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250
London at that time was unique
 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.970
London at that time was unique
in developing this curriculum for all

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
in developing this curriculum for all
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.210
in developing this curriculum for all
our student it was not a kind of

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220
our student it was not a kind of
 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.490
our student it was not a kind of
additional piece of education it was a

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500
additional piece of education it was a
 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.660
additional piece of education it was a
core program in the study of biology and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670
core program in the study of biology and
 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.330
core program in the study of biology and
it still continues tomorrow morning I

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340
it still continues tomorrow morning I
 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.210
it still continues tomorrow morning I
give a talk at that course and the idea

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220
give a talk at that course and the idea
 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.120
give a talk at that course and the idea
of this course is to make make sure that

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130
of this course is to make make sure that
 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.010
of this course is to make make sure that
our students are as good citizen as they

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020
our students are as good citizen as they
 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.699
our students are as good citizen as they
are good biologist I can tell you that

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709
are good biologist I can tell you that
 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.570
are good biologist I can tell you that
this is very close to my to my heart

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580
this is very close to my to my heart
 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.479
this is very close to my to my heart
how wonderful so in a way for 20 years

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489
how wonderful so in a way for 20 years
 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:03:00.240
how wonderful so in a way for 20 years
