00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:02.752
NARRATOR (VOICEOVER): For

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:05.046
America have fled their
homes to seek a better

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:07.716
life in the United States.

00:00:07.716 --> 00:00:10.969
Between 1980 and
2013, the population

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.638
of people in the US
born in Central America

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:18.226
grew from just around 300,000
to over three million.

00:00:18.226 --> 00:00:21.980
The majority came from a region
known as the Northern Triangle,

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.065
which includes the
nations of Guatemala,

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:26.234
El Salvador, and Honduras.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:28.278
During this time,
these nations suffered

00:00:28.278 --> 00:00:31.740
from economic and political
instability, corruption,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.576
crime, poverty, and violence.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:38.580
One of the major causes of
such strife, the Cold War.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.625
From 1947 through 1991, the
period now known as the Cold

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:45.420
War, the US adopted
interventionist

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.340
foreign policies in an effort
to stop the spread of communism.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.094
These policies led to the
Korean War and the Vietnam War.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:56.848
They also led to US
intervention in Central America.

00:00:56.848 --> 00:01:00.477
The US provided funding,
arms, and military training

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:04.606
to nations and groups fighting
communism like Guatemala.

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:06.357
After World War
II, Guatemala was

00:01:06.357 --> 00:01:08.318
one of the few Latin
American countries

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:10.695
that operated as a democracy.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.531
In 1951, Guatemala
democratically

00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:16.284
elected Jacobo Arbenz,
who aimed to fight

00:01:16.284 --> 00:01:18.870
poverty and inequality
by redistributing

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.622
property more fairly.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:25.043
At the time, 75% of the arable
land was controlled by only 2%

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.795
of the population.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.631
One of the largest landowners
was an American corporation

00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:31.966
known as the United
Fruit Company

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:35.303
with about 600,000
acres of property.

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:39.224
Arbenz's policies would
reduce their power and profit.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:42.477
So the US declared these
progressive land reforms,

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:45.688
as well as Arbenz's legalization
of the Communist Party,

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:48.316
as a threat to democracy.

00:01:48.316 --> 00:01:51.986
In 1954, the CIA aided
in a military overthrow

00:01:51.986 --> 00:01:56.491
of the Arbenz government,
leading to a civil war in 1960.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:59.994
The war would go
on for 36 years.

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:02.038
A series of military
regimes supported

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:06.000
by the US employed death
squads, utilized torture,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.503
and massacred Mayan villages.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:11.172
Documents declassified
in the 1990s

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:15.552
revealed the CIA knew about
it, but did nothing to stop it.

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:18.221
In the end, approximately
200,000 people

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:20.765
were killed or disappeared.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:25.228
The Civil War ended in 1996,
but the economic, societal, and

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:27.689
personal damage
would last decades,

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.441
prompting many to flee the
instability and violence

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:32.402
for the United States.

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.195
Guatemala's neighbor,
El Salvador,

00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:36.281
suffered a similar fate.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:40.201
In the 1980s, El Salvador
became embroiled in a civil war,

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.120
pitting the right wing
military government

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.372
against Marxist guerrillas.

00:02:44.372 --> 00:02:46.457
The United States sided
with the government,

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:48.209
sending billions
of dollars in aid

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.713
as well as military advisors
to help the Salvadoran military

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:53.131
fight the war.

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:56.551
The war, like that in
Guatemala, was brutal.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.220
In early 1980,
archbishop Oscar Romero,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.723
the leader of the Catholic
church in El Salvador,

00:03:01.723 --> 00:03:04.893
wrote a letter to then US
President Jimmy Carter, begging

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.562
him to stop funding the
Salvadoran military,

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:10.815
which had been terrorizing
the Salvadoran people.

00:03:10.815 --> 00:03:14.485
On March 24th, 1980, one month
after sending the letter,

00:03:14.485 --> 00:03:17.906
Romero was assassinated
while celebrating mass.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:22.410
The killer had been hired by
right wing military officers.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.915
More than 75,000 Salvadorans
were killed in the conflict.

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:29.918
Students and other
revolutionaries were shot.

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.129
Their bodies left on
roadsides as warnings.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.090
Peasants trying to
flee were shot in mass.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.844
In one massacre in
1981, as many as 1,200

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:44.349
civilian women, children,
and old men were massacred.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.644
Once again, documents
declassified in the 1990s

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.772
showed the US was aware of
some of these atrocities,

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.650
but overlooked them for
common policy goals.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.818
Through the 80s,
thousands of Salvadorans

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:58.154
fled for their safety.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:01.616
From 1980 to 1990, the
Salvadoran immigrant population

00:04:01.616 --> 00:04:07.956
in the United States increased
from 94,000 to 465,000.

00:04:07.956 --> 00:04:11.626
The war was over by 1992,
and with its resolution

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:15.713
came a decline in immigration
to the US, but not an end.

00:04:15.713 --> 00:04:19.050
A 1990s US policy deported
Salvadoran immigrants

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.053
with criminal records,
sending members of LA gangs

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:24.514
back to El Salvador,
where the gangs took hold

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:27.141
and became even more violent.

00:04:27.141 --> 00:04:30.645
As of 2018, Salvadoran citizens
continue to seek asylum

00:04:30.645 --> 00:04:34.232
in the US, as democratic
El Salvador still struggles

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:37.318
with the corruption, crime,
and gang violence set in motion

00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:39.862
by the decades of conflict.

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:42.031
El Salvador's eastern
neighbor, Honduras,

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:45.326
also suffered in the American
War against communism.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.370
Under the Reagan
administration, the US

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.081
sought to overthrow the
communist Sandinista government

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:53.668
in neighboring Nicaragua
by supporting the Contras,

00:04:53.668 --> 00:04:56.337
a right wing
guerrilla rebel force.

00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:59.215
The US temporarily
stationed several hundred

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:02.093
American soldiers in
Honduras and constructed

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:05.555
a number of joint Honduran
US military bases.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.515
With the help of the
US, Honduras soon

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.768
became a militarized state,
creating the conditions

00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:13.354
for political
repression, corruption,

00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:15.106
and government violence.

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:18.359
The US also used its power
to push for deregulation

00:05:18.359 --> 00:05:21.029
of the coffee trade,
benefiting US businesses,

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:25.116
but ultimately harming Honduras'
most vulnerable, its farmers

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:27.535
and its poor,
sending many fleeing

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:31.372
to the US for both economic
and safety reasons.

00:05:31.372 --> 00:05:34.208
The rise in Central Americans
immigrating to the US,

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:37.712
like nearly every large influx
of immigrant groups in US

00:05:37.712 --> 00:05:40.256
history, can be traced
back to instability

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:41.883
in their home country.

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.719
For the Irish in the
1840s, it was famine.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:47.930
For the Jews in the early 1900s,
it was political oppression

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.474
and poverty.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:52.393
For the Central Americans,
it's a complex story

00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:56.064
of internal unrest partially
influenced by US intervention

00:05:56.064 --> 00:05:57.398
during the Cold War.

00:05:57.398 --> 00:05:59.108
But since the
founding of the US,

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:02.487
immigration has been a central
part of the American story,

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:05.448
and remained so until this day.
