Welcome to the national
book festival.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.610

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.730
Come on. I am here to
introduce Chris Grabenstein,

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.680
who is a number one New York
Times bestselling author

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.370

aware, and he also has Welcome

Award for Best Children's and
Young Adult Novels four times,

and from what I can tell,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.750
he also has a wickedly
fun sense of humor.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.070

big surprise for you guys.

&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Thank you.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.530
&gt;&gt; Jill Garcia: You're welcome.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.010
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
Thank you so much.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.610
Thank you guys for coming out.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.950
It's great to be here
in our nation's capital.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.590
They put my slide up on
the, I need my slides now.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.720
Okay. Do we have any fifth
graders here in the audience?

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.020
Any fifth graders.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.990
Up on that screen
right now is my picture

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.050
when I was in the fifth grade.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.570
Have any of you been able
to figure out which one

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.830
of those kids I was when
I was in the fifth grade?

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.630
Anybody want to guess
who thinks they know?

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.930
Yes, which one was I?

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.920
&gt;&gt; On the top row.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.220

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.370
On this side.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.670
Oh, the guy with the blond hair?

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.970
No, his hair is blond.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.660
What color is my hair?

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.050
[ Inaudible Comments ]

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.480
What color did my
hair used to be.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.560
Black. It used to be black,
so you're looking for someone

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.350
with black hair up there.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.510
Yes, which one was I?

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.520
The second row in the
little turtle neck.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.370
He's got a receding hairline,
looks like he's going bald?

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.670
No, it's not me.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.770
I didn't start going bald
until like ten years ago.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.310
That kid was going bald
in the fifth grade.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.850
By the time we got
to sixth grade,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.390
we all called him Chrome Dome.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.310
Now since I mostly
write mysteries,

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.810
I'm going to give you
guys a clue right now.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.750
When I was in fifth grade,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.570
my eyesight was better
than it is today.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.570
I did not wear glasses when
I was in the fifth grade.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.990
Who seems to know?

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.290
Yes, which one was I?

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.290
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.590
The one in the red T-shirt?

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.180
Oh the one T-shirt,
no his hair is blond.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.990
Have any of you read
any of my books?

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.120
Has anybody here
read one of my books.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.250
I'm giving you another
clue right now.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.210
Have you read my books?

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.570
Yes, the young man
in the red shirt.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.590
Which one do you think I am?

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.000
The one in the red shirt.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.130
Yes. That was me
in the fifth grade.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.510
Let's give this guy
a round of applause.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.060
So I show you that picture
for a couple reasons.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.320
One, to prove before my
hair started going gray,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.620
thank you very much
for notice that.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.180
Before it started going
backwards on my head,

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.670
I was actually at one point
in my life 10 years old

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.220
and in the fifth grade,
and in the fifth grade is

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.360
when I first started
having fun writing.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.890
I used to do these
little comic books

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.840
where I'd draw the pictures
and make up the stories

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.290
and pass them out to my friends.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.590
And when I was in fifth grade,

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.810
I grew up in a little town
called Signal Mountain,

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.680
Tennessee, which is outside
of Chattanooga, Tennessee,

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.900
and the local Lions Club had
an essay writing contest.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.800
I entered and won first prize.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.700
That was my first
writing award ever.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.790
It was a cream puff
day in our house.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.290
Then I went to Junior
High School,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.720
and I got the bowl
haircut going guys.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.020
I recommend that look.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.320
It's a good look.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.620
You just put a bowl
on your head.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.920
The chicks dig it.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.180
And I worked on the
school newspaper,

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.620
and I had a really
good English teacher.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.310
And her name was Mrs. Garrett.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.630
Are there any teachers
here today?

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.880
Teachers, you have the power.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.630
Let's give a round of
applause for teachers.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.820
They don't get enough
love in this country.

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.410
Let's hear it for teachers
because Mrs. Garrett,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.270
my own goal, whenever we
did a homework assignment,

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.870
I wanted to make Mrs. Garrett
laugh, because I wanted to write

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.150
like Art Buchwald or
Dave Berry or somebody,

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.450
just to make her laugh.

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.560
And she liked my essay so much
that she wrote in the margins

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.120
of one of my papers, you
will make your living

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.080
as a writer someday.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.680
And when a teacher tells you
something, you know it has

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.090
to be true, because teachers
everywhere, take a solemn vow

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.740
to never ever lie to children.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.040
Isn't that right teachers,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.340
you all remember
that day in college.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.640
You had to raise
your right hand.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.060
Plus, you know, my parents,
if they said, oh Chris,

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.820
you're so talented, you could
be a writer, I would have said,

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.750
you're my mother and
father, you get paid

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.350
to say nice things about me.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.970
But when a teacher tells
you something, you go,

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.440
ooh, maybe that's true.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.230
Maybe I've got a little talent.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.900
So by eighth grade I had
made up my mind that I wanted

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.350
to be a writer when I grew
up, and I can prove it,

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.790
because my mother saved my
eighth grade composition book,

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.740
and every year when
I was in school,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.750
we had to write the same essay.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.500
What do you want to
be when you grow up?

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.220
And I used to say I wanted
to be a doctor or a lawyer

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.700
or a chemical engineer like my
father, but in eighth grade,

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.680
inspired by my seventh grade
teacher, this is what I wrote.

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.110
But now my mind wanders to a
new thought, to be a comedian

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.690
or a writer is my quest.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.340
If this flops, I would be
content to be a millionaire

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.900
and run Grabenstein's
department stores

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.510
if I could ever fit
the name on a sign.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:38.810
Got a B plus on that.

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.640
I'm looking for a
retroactive A minus at least.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.970
I got a B plus on that.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.060
So now, I am living
my eighth grade dream.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.520
These are all the
books I've written

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.060
so far for guys your age.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.510
I start out writing a bunch

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.190
of ghost stories called
the haunted mystery series.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.380
And then I wrote the
island of Dr. Libris.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.980
Some of you have read
the island of Dr. Libris,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.550
that's one of my favorite.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.770
And then this guy named
James Patterson called up.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.370
He needed a little
help and said,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.860
could you help me
write a couple books.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.200
And I said, yeah, sure
Jim, what the heck.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.780
He was actually, James Patterson
and I go way back to 1984.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.300
He was my first boss
in advertising

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.850
at the Jay Walter Thompson
Advertising Agency.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.320
So before we wrote about
treasure hunters or funny kids

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.020
or houses filled with robots,

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.730
we wrote about flame broiled
whoppers for Burger King.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.030
Good times, good times.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.260
So we've got I think
22 books tog,

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.240
and some of you have read Escape

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.000
from Mr. Lemoncello's
Library, is that right?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.570
Ooh, thank you.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.040
Any of you from Virginia,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.090
because it won a book
award in Virginia.

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.670
So, thank you all,
you Virginians.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.240
Thank you very much.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:47.310
And that book was turned
into a movie on Nickelodeon.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.240
A little bit of advice,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.560
never write your book
report based on the movie.

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.860
They're always a
little bit different.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.160
Read the book please.

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.730
And that was kind of fun
because it starred this kid,

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.400
Casey Simpson, who stars in that
Nickelodeon show Ricky Dickey

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.030
Donkey Dorky Dooky--

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.050
That's it, I can never
remember the name of the show.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.490
And also Brianna Edie was
in the show, and I got to go

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.060
out to Hollywood and got to
be on the set with everybody.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.360
And it was a lot of fun.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.660
There were great actors.

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.100
And then I got to go
to the movie premiere

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.990
and walk the orange carpet

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.800
because it was Nickelodeon,
everything is orange.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.610
So that was great and,
but now I'm going to share

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.210
with you guys before,
we're going to go

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.620
to questions right away
because I know there's a lot

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.920
of questions.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.840
I'm going to share with you
guys some coming attractions

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.140
for next year.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:35.440
First off, James Patterson

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.910
and I have a new book called Max
Einstein, the genius experiment,

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.630
all about a girl
named Max Einstein.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.780
I think it's the first book
endorsed by the Einstein estate,

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:46.080
so it's kind of exciting.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.550
And then, for you Lemoncello
fans, in October there's going

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.770
to be a three-book box
set that comes out,

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:56.330
and inside that box set there
will be a bunch of bonus puzzles

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.630
and stuff that you can play,

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.930
because we're always
getting asked,

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.230
can I have some more
rebus puzzles,

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.460
so there will be some
bonus puzzles in there.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.720
And then, the fourth
book in the Welcome

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.050
to Wonderland series
comes out in April,

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.530
and it's called beach
battle blowout.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.110
And then James Patterson

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.560
and I have another book next
April called Cat Versus Dog,

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.860
which was a lot of fun.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:19.620
But now, for the first
time ever, I can announce

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:23.830
that there will be a
fourth Lemoncello book.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:30.030
[applause] No one in the world
has seen this cover until today.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.330
Until today.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.630
This is big.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:38.900
So this is Mr. Lemoncello's
all star break out game.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:44.780
[applause] And it will be
coming out in, I think in May.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.250
I never know when these
things are coming out.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.930
It's coming out in May, and how
many of you read the third book?

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.640
How many have read-- so that
was all about nonfiction.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.520
The fourth book is all going to
be about the power of fiction.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.450
That's why there are windows,
doors, and mirrors on the cover

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:04.210
because if you read a book, you
get to live someone else's life

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.210
and walk in their shoes
for a little while.

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.310
So Kyle and his friends
are going to be

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.260
in something called the
fictionasium in the fourth book.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.900
So that should be a lot of fun.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.590
So I didn't want to
yammer all day long.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:17.180
I'm going to have some
questions from you guys,

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:18.780
because I know a lot
of you have questions.

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:21.930
They have two cool microphones
here, so why don't you line

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.390
up on the microphone so I
can hear your questions.

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.690
I'll get some water too.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.330
Yay. Yes, sir?

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.870
Oh there you go.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.170
I think I just heard it come on.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.270
&gt;&gt; What was your inspiration
for Mr. Lemoncello's Library.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:42.570
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.410
Mr. Lemoncello's Library
was inspired by the fact

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.750
that when I was a kid
librarians were all

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.690
about protecting the
books from the children.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.240
You'd go into a library,
and they go, shhh be quiet.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.540
You'll wake up the books.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.490
Or get your sticky
fingers off the books.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:09:59.240
And then I started
doing school visits

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.120
when my haunted mysteries
came out,

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.910
and I met all these really
kind of fun librarians,

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:07.220
and the library became the
center of activity in schools,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.170
and I said, where
were these librarians

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:10.740
when I was growing up.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.510
And then I went on a
school visit to a school

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.810
in Brooklyn called PS10.

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:16.540
It's in Brooklyn, New York.

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:17.900
It was made out of red brick.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.200
It's three stories tall,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.060
been there since
1932, forget about it.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:23.030
So I say, it looked
like ordinary school,

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:26.730
but then I went upstairs, and
they had a brand new library.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:29.780
And I asked the librarian how
did you guys get this brand new

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.040
library in your otherwise kind
of old-fashioned building,

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.340
and she said, oh,

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.650
a very generous millionaire
donated it to us.

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.750
So that day on the
subway ride home I took

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.780
out my writer's notebook
and my pen and I wrote

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.080
down the two magic words

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.710
that have started every book
I've ever written, what if,

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.720
what if a very generous

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:52.780
and somewhat loony bazillionaire
donated a library to the town

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.560
where he grew up, and that's
how the whole thing got started.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.860
Good question.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.160
Thank you.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.460
We'll go over here now, yes.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:00.760
&gt;&gt; How much books do you have?

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.060
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: How
many books have I written?

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.620
Thanks to my friends at
the Library of Congress,

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.330
they just told me I have 62
books in the Library of Congress

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.190
because I started out
writing books for adults,

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.730
and I wrote like
nine or 12 mysteries

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:16.220
and thrillers before I
started writing books for kids.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.350
So I have 62 books in
the Library of Congress.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:23.110
I'm going to go over there
and look at them some day.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.520
It's kind of exciting.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.820
Yes?

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.700
&gt;&gt; Have you ever had, have
you ever had writer's block?

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.000
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Have
I ever had writer's block?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.500
No, and if I was doing
my school presentation,

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.370
I would show you how to
never have writer's block.

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.900
Do you ever have writer's block?

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.200
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.500
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
Here's the problem.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:42.300
We all sit down and try to make
what we wrote perfect the first

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:43.600
time through.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.810
Well, you know that book Escape
from Mr. Lemoncello's Library?

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.110
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:48.410
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: I worked
on that book for two years,

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:51.420
and I rewrote 50 percent
of the entire book

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.590
at least eight different times.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:54.890
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.900
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: So nobody
gets it right the first time,

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.730
and if you quit trying to
make it right the first time,

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.430
you will never ever ever ever
have writer's block again.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.030
So remember, the first
draft is just for you.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.990
Give yourself permission to
write a really bad, terrible,

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.670
stinky, no good first draft,

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:10.890
and you'll never have
writer's block again.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.190
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.630
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
There you go, yeah?

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.130
&gt;&gt; What was the inspiration
for Charles Chiltington?

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.010
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
Charles Chiltington.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.760
Well, when you write
a book that you have

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:23.530
to have two characters at least.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:24.830
One is the protagonist.

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:26.130
That's the hero.

00:12:26.130 --> 00:12:27.430
You're going to follow
them through the story,

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.880
but they've got to butt
heads with an antagonist.

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.680
So I tried to make Charles
the opposite of Kyle,

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.690
where go you remember the
very first time you meet

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.990
Charles Chiltington?

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.290
Where was he?

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:40.870
Do you remember where he was?

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:42.740
&gt;&gt; In his study.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:45.340
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: In
his library in his house.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:47.570
So does he even need
a public library?

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:50.090
No. He has all the
money in the world,

00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:54.280
so Kyle's attitude is knowledge
not shared remains unknown.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:58.700
Charles Chiltington and his
family think knowledge is power.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.970
I'm not going to
share it with anyone.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.270
So when you write a book,

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.280
it's almost like you're
doing a wrestling match,

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.580
and you got to have a good guy
and a bad guy, and they're going

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.880
up against each other.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.480
So that's where Charles
came from, and he was based

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.750
on every snobby person I've
ever met in New York City.

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:14.050
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.410
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: And
we have a lot of them.

00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:16.710
Yes?

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:20.290
&gt;&gt; What was your inspiration
for The Great Library Race?

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.940
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
The Great Library Race.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.040
I wanted to, you know,
I was with a teacher.

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.390
I get a lot of my ideas
when I go on school visits,

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.320
and I was with a librarian
or a teacher who picked me

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.310
up at the airport or
whatever, and she said,

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.910
I wish you would do a
book that taught kids

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.910
that research means you
go back and you re-search.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.190
You don't take the
first answer you find.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:43.490
And when she told me that,

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.200
the little lightbulb
went off in my head.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.410
What if in this game they
discovered some fake news

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.660
about Mr. Lemoncello, would they
believe the first they found,

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.760
or would they dig deeper
and find the truth?

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.030
So I wanted to do a fun
story about research and how

00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:59.620
to do proper research.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:00.920
Good question.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.220
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Oh, yes.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.520
Over here.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.820
&gt;&gt; What's it like to
be a successful author?

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.350
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: I'll let
you know when it happens, no.

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:09.870
[laughter] I never think
of myself that way.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:13.060
I just have a lot of fun writing
stories and making stuff up,

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.360
and it's thrilling for me

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.970
to see this many people
have read my books.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.640
So, yeah, the first time my
book became a New York Times

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.210
bestseller, we did
a little dance.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:22.510
I think it was the happy dance.

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.210
So that's kind of exciting,
and it was fun to see a movie.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.700
Because my mom, who is
92 years old, she said,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.730
I remember when you were a
kid, I said one day I'm going

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:35.540
to see your name on that TV
screen, and I did last night.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.130
So that kind of stuff is cool.

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:38.710
But thank you for
calling me successful.

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:40.010
Thank you.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:41.310
Yep?

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.610
&gt;&gt; How long does it take
you to write a book?

00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:43.910
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Too long.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:45.210
No. How long does it
take to write a book?

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.510
I write faster than most people,

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.130
which is why I do
eight books a year,

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:53.120
but each book probably takes
about six months to a year.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.960
I can write the first draft
in four or five months,

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.810
but am I done when I
do the first draft?

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:00.990
No. I have to rewrite
it to make myself happy.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.290
Then I show it to my wife.

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:03.910
And I rewrite it
to make her happy.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:07.120
Then I show it to my editor,
and an editor is like a teacher,

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:09.790
and they'll read your paper,
and they'll send you a letter.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.510
It's known as an
editorial letter,

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:14.770
and the last one I
got was 13 pages long,

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.070
and there's always one
paragraph that goes, oh,

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:18.720
Chris, you're such a genius.

00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.780
This is going to be a
great book, great book.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.040
And then there's 12 pages of,

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.510
but you might want
to think about.

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:27.560
Then it wraps up with
a, but you're a genius,

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.270
it's going to be a great book.

00:15:29.270 --> 00:15:31.890
They call it the
compliment sandwich.

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:34.060
They put the compliments
on either end like bread,

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:36.050
and then they stuff
it with all the meat.

00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:37.800
And so will go back and forth.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.040
My wife and I just finished
writing a book together,

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.870
and we did six major rewrites
on it, and now it's all done.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:45.170
So it's a fun process.

00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:47.960
I'm lucky I've had really
good editors who only want

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.370
to make the book the best it
can be, so it's a fun process.

00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.670
Yes?

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:58.070
&gt;&gt; I love writing, and I
wanted to know what was,

00:15:58.070 --> 00:16:02.820
what was the age you were when
you first wrote your first book?

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.120
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
My first book?

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.740
Well, I wrote, I've been writing
since I was ten years old

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:08.950
in the fifth grade, then
I moved to New York City,

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:11.520
and I did improvisational
comedy with a troupe.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.100
We had a guy named Bruce
Willis in our troupe.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.890
He shaved his head,
moved to California.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.220
We don't know what
happened to him.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.390
And I did that for
like five years,

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:21.620
and then James Patterson hired
me at J. Walter Thompson,

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.420
so I wrote commercials
for almost 20 years.

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.670
Then I started writing
movies and stuff.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:33.180
My first book was published two
days before my 50th birthday.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.820
So it's a really good sort of
second career or third career

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.540
for anybody who thinks
about being a writer,

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.080
because the average age of
every New York Times bestselling

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.110
author is 56 years old.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:44.590
So I still had six years to go.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:46.790
So I was 50 when the
first book came out,

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.440
but I didn't get
started till late.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.950
You know, I didn't think I
could write a book until,

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:53.990
again if there's any aspiring
writers here in the adults,

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:56.030
read Steven King's
book on writing.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.160
That's what inspired me
to think I could do it.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.460
Yes, over here.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.650
&gt;&gt; What's your favorite of the
Mr. Lemoncello's Library books?

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.220
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
I love them all.

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:06.790
They are my children.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.720
It's like asking me to
pick her favorite son,

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.830
and she had five
boys in seven years.

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.130
She'd pick me.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.430
I guess I love them all.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.670
Probably the first
one would still be my,

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:18.600
will have a special place always
because it was the first book

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.070
of mine that anybody
ever heard of.

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.920
I was at a book festival
in Atlanta, Georgia,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.350
and I had 30 books published,
but Mr. Lemoncello came out,

00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.040
and it was a New York
Times bestseller.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.580
I think it's won 42
different state book awards,

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:32.420
and they introduced
me as, here he is,

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.970
debut author, Chris Grabenstein.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:37.520
It was like the first
book anyone ever heard of,

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.040
so that will always have a
special place in my heart.

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:41.340
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.640
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Yes?

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.320
&gt;&gt; When you wrote your
eight grade composition,

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.920
what you wanted to be
when you were older,

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.860
did you really expect like that
you would be an author now?

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.430
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: I
didn't think I'd be an author.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:55.430
I knew I would probably be a
writer, because I wrote skits

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.890
for my friends to act in, and
I acted in a lot of plays,

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.120
which is another good thing, any
of you guys want to be writers,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.030
see if you can work with the
drama club or act in plays,

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.510
because that's all about
dialogue and character,

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.200
but I thought I might
be a writer,

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.970
but I thought I would
work in journalism,

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:12.660
which is what I studied
in college or television

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.140
or advertising, because
I had to make a living.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:18.770
It's very hard to make a living
as an author when you start out.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.070
Yes?

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:24.170
&gt;&gt; When you won the essay
contest in fifth grade,

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:27.920
was it a cake day at your house?

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.220
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Well,

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.520
you've read the second
Lemoncello book.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.360
That's good for you, because
in the first Lemoncello book I

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.000
talked so much about balloons

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.110
that every school I visit,
they'd have balloons.

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:40.450
So, when I was a kid, if one
of us did something exciting

00:18:40.450 --> 00:18:43.950
like got in an honor society
or won the science fair,

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.400
my mother would make
these cream puffs.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.620
So we literally called
them cream puff days,

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.030
and I remembered that when I
was writing the second book,

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.200
and I said, I'm going to
establish cake days for Kyle.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.120
That way when I go
visit a school,

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:59.390
there will always be
sheet cake waiting for me,

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:01.690
and there has been, and that's
why I've gained 20 pounds.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.560
Okay. Yes?

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.500
&gt;&gt; How hard was it to
write a lot of books?

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.800
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
How hard was it?

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.600
Well, at first it
was really hard.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.190
Have you ever given
anything to your teacher

00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:15.270
and they've given it
back to you and said,

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.460
you can do better than this.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.780
Have you ever been rejected?

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.080
&gt;&gt; No.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.760
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Oh, well
I was rejected for four years.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.010
I quit my job in advertising.

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.670
I was living off my savings,
and I wrote my first book.

00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:30.970
It took a year.

00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:32.330
We sent it out to every
publisher in the New York,

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:33.690
and guess what they all said?

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:36.500
No, we're not going
to publish this.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.250
You have been rejected.

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.920
And then I wrote another
book, took another year,

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:44.960
and they all said, you
have been rejected again.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.580
Then I worked for a third
book for a third year

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.870
and got rejected again.

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:53.190
But fortunately during this time
I had Chinese food for dinner,

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.430
and one night I cracked
open my fortune cookie,

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:58.520
and inside was a slip of
paper that said get knocked

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.830
down seven times,
stand up eight times.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.610
So I took that fortune
cookie, and I taped it

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:05.550
on my computer, and
I kept going.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.970
And my fourth book
that I wrote four years

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.820
after I started was the
first one that got published.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.020
So, yeah, there's a lot of
rejection along the way,

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.590
but if you love doing
it, it's a lot of fun.

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.470
Yes, over here?

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:22.550
&gt;&gt; So in the Nickelodeon movie
for Mr. Lemoncello's Library--

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:23.850
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Uh-huh.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:28.580
&gt;&gt; We watched it in
class, and we all,

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:33.370
whenever we stopped it,
we all were like, no.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:39.560
And then we, the next day
our teacher was like only

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.170
if you be good, then you can
watch it, and so we all tried

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:45.810
to our best, and we got it.

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:50.510
And one of my favorite
parts was the hover books,

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:59.360
and also loved the part
when, what's his name?

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.110
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
Charles or Kyle?

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.410
&gt;&gt; Ky--

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:04.210
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
Kyle's the main guy--

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:07.950
&gt;&gt; Who's the mean guy?

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:10.430
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
Kyle and Akimi.

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:12.130
&gt;&gt; Akimi, I think.

00:21:12.130 --> 00:21:14.990
He set off all the things.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:16.470
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
Yes, they set it all off.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.770
&gt;&gt; So, yeah, and--

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.070
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
It was a fun movie.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.370
It was kind of nice to
be used as a reward.

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:21.670
I'm boosting education.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.160
But you know what
I like even better?

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.240
I hear stories that sometimes
teachers will be reading the

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.640
book aloud and the bell will
ring and it's time for recess,

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.490
and the kids will go, we
don't want to go to recess.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:34.420
Read us another chapter.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.720
So that's good.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.020
Well, I'm glad you
enjoyed the movie.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:38.320
Thank you so much.

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.620
We'll go over here
because I just got

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.920
like five minutes left I see.

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.220
Yes?

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.520
&gt;&gt; Why did you decide to
do a silly book instead

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.820
of a normal book?

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:46.700
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Why did
I decide, you've known me now

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:48.540
for 15 minutes, and you're--

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:50.830
I've been a silly
person my whole life.

00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:54.120
When I was a kid, we
didn't have books in school.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.300
Well, we kind of did,
but it was all things

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.600
like Red Badge of Courage.

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.900
We had something called SRA.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.260
Anybody else old
enough to remember SRA,

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:02.820
the color-coded essay?

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.160
So we didn't get to read
books like you guys did,

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.140
so when I was a kid,
I read Mad Magazine.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.060
I got my first subscription
to Mad Magazine

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:13.460
when I was ten years old,
and I would watch Rocky

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:15.050
and Bullwinkle cartoons,

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:18.130
and that made me a
permanently silly person

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.500
for the rest of my life.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.250
So I don't think I can
write a serious book.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:22.770
Yes?

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:28.210
&gt;&gt; So what gave you the idea
of making a book about robots?

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.510
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein:
A book about--

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:30.830
whenever I write
with James Patterson,

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:32.510
he comes up with the
ideas, and he gives me

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:35.540
like a really big outline,
so that was his idea,

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.460
and I suspect though, when we
were kids, because James is

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:40.760
about ten years older than
me, but when we were kids,

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:43.230
there was a cartoon
show called the Jetsons,

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.820
and we were all promised robots
were going to be taking care

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.550
of everything and we'd be
flying hover cars and stuff.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.660
So I think he just said
what if there was a house

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.270
that was filled with all those
robots that we were promised.

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:54.570
So that was his idea.

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.430
I don't know exactly
where he got that one,

00:22:56.430 --> 00:22:59.790
but most stories start
with a big what if.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.390
Yes, over here?

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:04.630
&gt;&gt; Have you ever
thought of teaming

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.610
up with different authors?

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.010
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Have
I ever thought about teaming

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.310
up with different authors?

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:11.940
Well, I've known James
Patterson since 1984,

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:15.230
and I have now teamed
up with my wife,

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.230
and we've written
a book together,

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:19.820
and she's much more
attractive than James Patterson,

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.750
I will say that right now.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.050
[laughter] Yes?

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:26.050
&gt;&gt; How much of James
Patterson's books do you write?

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:27.910
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: I
work on, the way he does it,

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:30.110
he comes up with the whole
story, which to me is more

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.730
than 50 percent of a book.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.360
He'll give me like
an 80-page outline,

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:38.570
and then my job every month is
to send him like 10,000 words.

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.010
Then he gets on the phone,

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.120
and the best ones are
great, keep going.

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.380
The worse conversations are,
do you have a pen and a pad

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:48.340
of paper, because that means
he's got like lots of notes.

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:50.610
So then I'll make those
changes, and I'll go back

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:51.910
and forth like four times.

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:55.570
So I basically write the first
draft based on his outline,

00:23:55.570 --> 00:23:58.060
and then he does the final
draft all by himself.

00:23:58.060 --> 00:23:59.370
When the book I Funny came out,

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.830
there was two characters
named Zits and Useless,

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:03.130
and I went, who are they?

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.600
Oh, Jim made up those names.

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:08.900
So he is, the guy, I've
worked with him since 1984.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.160
He is a workaholic in the
best sense of the word.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.600
He's always up at
5:00 in the morning.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.320
He writes every day.

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.960
The man is a maniac.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.460
Yes?

00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:24.940
&gt;&gt; Hi, in your opinion, what's
the best book you've written?

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.230
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: What's
the best book I've written.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.440
Ooh, that's a tough one,
because I do love them all.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.960
I think that's better
for you to decide.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.910
Because some of them are
different, like the I Funnies

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:37.020
and the Wonderlands might
appeal to kids who--

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:39.260
well when I was a kid, they
called me a reluctant reader,

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:41.050
and I loved books
with illustrations

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.030
because you would read a
page or two and go, ooh,

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:44.370
a picture, I can take a break.

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.620
And then you'd read two more
pages and see a picture.

00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.330
So I love those because
they reach some kids I

00:24:48.330 --> 00:24:49.630
otherwise wouldn't.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:51.440
The best book, I don't know.

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.960
Like my first one, The
Crossroads, I wrote for kids,

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.940
I just reread that recently.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:58.610
It's pretty creepy, so I
like that one a lot too.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:59.910
I like them all.

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:01.980
No bad books is my motto.

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:03.280
Thank you.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.580
Yes, over here?

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:07.010
Oh, probably the last
question I think here, yes.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:10.620
&gt;&gt; How do you work together
with James Patterson?

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.940
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Very
well, don't you think?

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:17.740
No, we, he does the outline, and
I execute and send him pages,

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:19.830
and then he does the
final draft like that.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.130
So we're not in the room.

00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:22.430
I will do one more
question over here,

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:23.730
and then I'm going
to wrap it up.

00:25:23.730 --> 00:25:26.150
&gt;&gt; How do you think of
the clues for the books?

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.450
&gt;&gt; Chris Grabenstein: Oh, yes.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.080
Everyone thinks I'm a genius for
coming up with all those puzzles

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:30.640
and stuff, but you know what?

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.140
It's like a teacher,
when they write a test,

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.930
they know the answer
they're looking

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:36.880
for when they write
the question.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.760
So all the puzzles are usually
designed to deliver a clue

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.930
or an answer that I
know, so then it's

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.740
up to me to work backwards.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.740
Whenever you write a mystery

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:50.340
or a puzzle mystery,
work backwards.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.250
Know what the ending is, what
you want, and then you can come

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:55.130
up with the most
complicated fun riddle

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.170
in the world to get that answer.

00:25:57.170 --> 00:25:59.690
Well, thank you guys so
much for coming out today

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.190
and being the first to see
the new Lemoncello cover.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:04.650
That's kind of exciting.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:05.950
Thank you so much.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.240
Oh, I know, someone-- who's
coming, and then I'm going

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.540
to be, at 1:00 I'm going to
be in line 14, I think, yes.
