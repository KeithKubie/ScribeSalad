00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.189
Vsauce! Kevin here.

00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:09.720
In a building, a shelter - expertly designed
by humans, for humans, to protect me, a human,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.180
from nature.&nbsp; So what is this doing here?

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.410
More than half of you keep a non-human creature
in your house. Sometimes in your bed. People

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.550
treat their pets like family - like babies.
Why? Pets almost seem like a cuteness tax,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.050
but our relationships with them today and
throughout history can teach us a lot about

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.410
who we are. And what we think it means to
be a human.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.690
For most of human existence we lived on equal
ground with animals. What we now call “Animism”

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.399
was the foundational worldview held by our
Hunter-gatherer ancestors -- the belief that

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:54.219
non-human entities including rivers, plants
and animals all have a spirit or soul. Hunting

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.270
and killing animals for survival involved
elaborate rituals intended to honor the spirits

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.250
of the natural world. There’s evidence of
Animism worldwide, from the Naskapi of Canada

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.759
having strict rules for consuming caribou,
to the reindeer hunters of Siberia and various

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.119
bear cults including the Ainu of Japan.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.869
Animals taken for survival were revered while
others were kept as pets and made part of

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.990
the family. Pets are so vital and beloved
that indigenous peoples from Australia and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.219
Malaysia to South America and Hawaii included
them in one of the most foundational bonds

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:35.429
of human life by breast-feeding baby animals.
The Awa tribe in the Amazon still do.

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:42.200
The dawn of agriculture and widespread domestication
of animals created a distinction between man

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.950
and beast. After about 190,000 years of relative
parity, humans were now dominating nature.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.989
In 350 BC, Aristotle declared that nature
makes nothing in vain and therefore everything

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:59.999
on Earth had a purpose - to serve humans.&nbsp;
He also proposed scala naturae, or the ladder

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:05.630
of life -- a hierarchy of living things with
human beings on top due to their ability to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.879
reason, a trait he believed came not from
the brain but from the heart.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:15.209
For Rome, man’s dominance of animals was
entertainment. The colosseum games routinely

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.260
involved fights to the death, with some species
like the North African Elephant and European

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.370
Wild Horse being made extinct as a result.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.680
Animals were put to work building and feeding
growing civilizations. Cats were self-domesticated

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.120
during the rise of agriculture, including
themselves in the human food chain by weeding

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.319
out vermin like rats. People appreciated their
service, and house cats were immortalized

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.810
in paintings during the Tang Dynasty in the
7th century.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.579
Anthropocentrism, or the belief that humans
are the most significant creature, was bolstered

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:53.890
by the Earth being declared the center of
the entire universe. Questioning this geocentric

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.650
model, and by proxy man's centrality in the
cosmos, was considered blasphemy. Galileo

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.340
was found guilty of heresy for supporting
Copernicus’s banned heliocentric model in

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.170
1633.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.569
Galileo was imprisoned during the Inquisition,
a campaign in which Roman Catholic orthodoxy

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.310
was enforced by persecuting heretics. Even
pets weren’t safe; they could be branded

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.930
as familiars, or evil spirits that helped
people perform sorcery. Pets suspected of

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.939
aiding in magic were tried and executed if
found guilty.

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.510
We went from suckling baby animals and honoring
beasts felled in the hunt to publicly burning

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:34.980
humans for having pets.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.560
England’s Witchcraft Act Of 1604 made it
illegal to, “consult, covenant with, entertain,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.769
employ, feed, or reward any evil and wicked
spirit to or for any intent or purpose.”

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:51.599
Everything from dogs and cats to rabbits,
toads, and even ants and cockroaches were

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.329
suspected as familiars that could lead to
an alleged witch’s death.&nbsp; Animals were

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:03.029
tortured and executed not only to mete out
justice, but as part of public celebrations.

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:07.689
In The Great Cat Massacre And Other Episodes
In French Cultural History, historian Robert

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:12.719
Darnton explains that an aspect of the Carnival
season of celebration before Lent - involved

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:18.109
passing around cats and ripping out their
fur to create a crude musical instrument of

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:23.680
tortured howls. Dancing around bonfires was
a joyous part of the Summer solstice festivities

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.090
- as was throwing magical objects into them
- like cats tied up in sacks, hung from ropes

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:37.750
or attached to stakes. Burning dozens of cats
in a basket was abolished in Metz in 1765.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.889
So that’s good.

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.560
The context of treating animals like inanimate
objects can be found in the philosophy of

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.080
Rene Descartes, who believed in the superiority
of the human mind. The father of modern western

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.660
philosophy famously stated, “Cogito ergo
sum” -- “I think therefore I am” -- but

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:00.550
he considered animals to be like clocks. In
1648, he referred to beasts as mechanical

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.139
automatons filled with organs that allow them
to function but are devoid of consciousness

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.050
-- lacking a soul.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.490
That marked a departure from how we'd thought
about animals for centuries -- the word animal

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.479
comes from the Latin root "animus," which
means "soul." It took the advancement of science

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:22.560
to return us to our radices. That’s Latin
for roots.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.400
The Age Of Reason brought with it a newfound
interest in natural history, which included

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.830
biology and zoology.&nbsp; By the 1850’s, Alfred
Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin revolutionized

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.349
how we think about animals. Their theories
of evolution placed humans and creatures at

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:44.800
equal points of origin, from which adaptations
for ecological survival arose over millennia.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.330
Darwin’s catalyst for his obsessive study
of nature was his love of dogs.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.020
Evidence of domesticated dogs as beloved pets
goes back to 12,000 BCE with the Natufian

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.349
Grave in Israel - an old man buried with a
puppy. Recent DNA studies suggest gray wolves

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:09.460
and dogs share a common prehistoric wolf ancestor
that went extinct between 9,000 and 34,000

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.180
years ago. Wolves are the most successful,
adaptable non-human predator in the world,

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.209
but they’re now outnumbered over 3,000 to
1 by dogs because dogs partnered with humans

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:26.620
-- an advantage that Anthropologist Pat Shipman
believes helped humans outlast neanderthals.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:33.360
From Mesopotamia, India, Egypt and Mesoamerica
- dogs were symbols of loyalty and companionship

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.590
and were buried with their owners as guides
to the afterlife.

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.270
Humans practiced selective breeding with dogs
to encourage desirable physical traits like

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.210
size, speed and fur length. But over the past
150 years, dogs have been bred to change their

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.970
appearance and highlight features we want
to see -- like shorter snouts, larger eyes

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.930
and floppier ears.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.240
Neoteny is the retention of juvenile features
in an adult animal, and selective breeding

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:04.530
by humans has exaggerated these features in
breeds like Pugs, Bulldogs and the Cavalier

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.610
King Charles Spaniel. In some cases that has
created unintended health problems, driving

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.210
the Kennel Club’s leading geneticist to
believe that the less a dog looks like a wolf,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.930
the less it makes any sense.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:22.000
Neoteny can also be seen in cartoon characters
with huge eyes and large heads - characteristics

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.080
we think are cute because the proportions
are similar to infants - an actual cute character

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:33.979
design rule documented by former Disney animator
Preston Blair in his 1948 book Animation.

00:07:33.979 --> 00:07:39.669
Cuteness is based on the basic proportions
of a baby. In 1971, evolutionary biologist

00:07:39.669 --> 00:07:44.849
and science historian Stephen Jay Gould documented
the neoteny found in the evolution of the

00:07:44.849 --> 00:07:51.460
world’s most famous cartoon character - Mickey
Mouse. And just as Mickey is a brand of Disney,

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.469
Pomeranians are a brand of dog.

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:58.710
During an era in which Gregor Mendel founded
the study of genetics through breeding experiments

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:04.080
with pea plants, dogs were developed like
consumer products with specific beneficial

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.229
traits. Purebred dogs were a common marker
of status, from Pekinese in 7th century China

00:08:10.229 --> 00:08:16.169
to Queen Victoria’s Pomeranians. But a rising
middle class ushered in demand for purebreds

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:22.060
-- the Victorian dog fancy -- and an industry
of breeding to meet that demand.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:27.030
All of the Labradors in the world came from
a small group of families in the British aristocracy.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.509
There’s actually a leather-bound stud book
kept in a safe in Scotland that traces the

00:08:31.509 --> 00:08:36.930
exact origins of the Labrador. It details
the quest to influence the length of the Labrador’s

00:08:36.930 --> 00:08:41.850
muzzle, the spacing of its ears and the size
of its eyes -- like a hereditary recipe book

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:48.590
to generate the perfect Lab, with morbid side
notes of breeding failures like, “Put down

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:50.940
- useless.”

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:57.280
The oldest English book on dog varieties,
Of Englishe Dogges published in 1576, lists

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:04.590
16 different types. Today, there are 340 unique
breeds recognized by the FCI.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:10.310
But why dogs? Yes, they’ve helped humans
hunt since before recorded time by tracking

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:15.790
and retrieving game and guarding mankind with
their superior sense of smell, speed and hearing.

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:21.500
Yes, they have expressive faces and complex
vocalizations that aid in our ability to understand

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:27.010
and communicate with them. But it may be a
fundamentally human quality that solidifies

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:28.880
our relationship dogs.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.670
Dr. Juliane Kaminsky describes pointing as
a triadic communication. There’s a sender,

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:40.220
a receiver and a shared concern. It’s commonly
used in language development in infants - the

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:45.640
baby points at an apple - the parent tells
them it’s an apple - the baby learns apple.

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.590
Michael Tomasello believes this act is a basic
building block of language called “shared

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:55.060
intentionality” -- and it isn’t universal
in the animal kingdom. Despite having fingers

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:59.900
and high-level cognition, chimps and gorillas
don’t understand pointing. Because they

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.990
don’t believe anyone would help them.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:06.880
One of an infant’s most basic instincts
is a willingness to trust its parents and

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:13.560
accept their help. In 4th century BC, Plato
argued that love forms the bonds of human

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.620
society. By the 20th Century, British psychologist
John Bowlby posited that infants’ social

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.400
and emotional development rested on their
relationships with caregivers -- and that

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:29.370
a willingness to form social bonds helped
infants secure their own survival, satisfying

00:10:29.370 --> 00:10:35.180
the foundational elements in Maslow’s hierarchy
of needs. There’s a reason why solitary

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:40.040
confinement and exile are amongst the greatest
punishments for those who break the social

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:44.630
contract - often considered punishments greater
than death.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:50.160
Attachment theory lays the groundwork for
the benefits of cooperation and social exchange.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.870
Instructed in Aesop’s Fables in 6th century
BC -- The Lion and The Mouse -- in which a

00:10:54.870 --> 00:11:01.640
mouse convinces a lion to spare his life and
to trust that someday he can help him.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.370
Science is just now catching up with Aesop.

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:09.630
Oxytocin is a hormone that plays a role in
social bonding - it’s produced in mammals

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:15.540
when they care about someone and has influences
on trust, empathy and attachment. It's released

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:20.690
when humans engage in positive interactions
with one another. Humans and pets release

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:26.990
oxytocin when petting, playing or simply gazing.
Oxytocin was first discovered for its role

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:34.450
in regulating childbirth and breastfeeding
- the facilitation and nurturing of life itself.

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:40.760
Studying communication and relationships between
animals is teaching us about ourselves.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.640
Alex the African Grey parrot spent thirty
years being studied by animal psychologist

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:51.760
Irene Pepperberg. Alex proved that a large
primate brain is not a prerequisite for complex

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:58.000
problem solving and language. Alex could recognize
quantities up to six, identify 50 different

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:05.460
objects and had a vocabulary of over 100 words.
At age 31, almost 30 years short of the average

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:11.210
life expectancy for a parrot - Alex suddenly
passed away. His final words to Pepperberg

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:18.960
were the same he spoke to her every night.
“You be good, see you tomorrow. I love you.”

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.080
Alex gained celebrity status because he expanded
our understanding of animal cognition. But

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:30.360
he also exposed our desire to believe that
devoid of the judgments, pressures and complications

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:36.000
of human existence, pets love you for you.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.550
The Open: Man And Animal describes philosopher
Georg Hegel’s concept of human as only existing

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:48.500
in the transcendence and transformation of
its own animality. By separating ourselves

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.020
from nature - we express what makes us uniquely
human.

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:58.950
But it’s not easy to figure out what that
is. Our ever-changing relationships with animals

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:06.070
affect our understanding of what they are,
but also what we are. In 1947, Psychoanalyst

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:12.120
Erich Fromm wrote, "Man is the only animal
for whom his own existence is a problem which

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.490
he has to solve."

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:20.430
By reconnecting us with nature, pets help
us navigate our existence.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:29.790
Which means scrolling for cat memes is actually
a very serious existential activity.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:48.560
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.070
The Lion and the Mouse.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:55.560
A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great
head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:01.490
came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright
and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:06.470
nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his
huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.970
her.
"Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:13.020
let me go and some day I will surely repay
you."

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.040
The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse
could ever help him. But he was generous and

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.810
finally let the Mouse go.
Some days later, while stalking his prey in

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:26.170
the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils
of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself,

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:31.330
he filled the forest with his angry roaring.
The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:35.160
the Lion struggling in the net. Running to
one of the great ropes that bound him, she

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.800
gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion
was free.

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:43.830
"You laughed when I said I would repay you,"
said the Mouse. "Now you see that even a Mouse

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:47.900
can help a Lion."
A kindness is never wasted.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:58.640
That sounds true but is it? Yes. I hope that’s
true. The world’s a sad place I hope that’s

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:06.630
true. But a kindness is never wasted. Even
if. Never. It seems to be. Never. You can

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:16.890
still know that. Never. Well I agree with
that. Never. Never. Never.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.720
Special thanks to my friends at the BBC for
providing incredible footage of dogs, cats

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:31.980
and wolves. Check out their channels for more.
More videos and stuff. Okay. Thanks.
