00:00:03.234 --> 00:00:04.434
Fletcher: Well,
good day, everyone.

00:00:04.434 --> 00:00:05.534
Luke:
Are we on?

00:00:05.534 --> 00:00:06.534
Fletcher:
Yes, we're on, Luke.

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:07.601
Luke:
Cool.

00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:08.801
Fletcher:
My name's Jess Fletcher.

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:10.234
Mahe:
And I'm Luke Mahe.

00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:11.901
Fletcher: And we're
from the Maps API team

00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:13.334
based in Sydney, Australia.

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:16.300
Mahe: Welcome to this talk about
Designing Maps Applications

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.434
for Usability on
Mobile and Desktop.

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:21.434
So, a little housekeeping?

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:22.534
Fletcher: A little bit
of housekeeping.

00:00:22.534 --> 00:00:23.767
You've probably seen this

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:25.934
in all the talks you've been to
this morning.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.167
There's a link here
to SpeakerMeter,

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:32.234
so we can get some feedback
from the audience on the talk.

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:33.634
You know, you might want
to talk about things

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:36.300
like Luke's haircut.
Mahe: It's pretty bad.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.434
Fletcher: How fat he is,
you know, these sorts of things.

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:42.067
And of course these are
the twitter hashtags to use

00:00:42.067 --> 00:00:44.467
for this session.

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:46.033
Mahe: So, cool?
Fletcher: Cool.

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:47.834
Mahe: All right.
So, a little overview

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:49.534
of what we're going to be
talking about today.

00:00:49.534 --> 00:00:52.434
We'll talk a bit about
what is user experience.

00:00:52.434 --> 00:00:55.234
Fletcher: Yeah, because we're
going to be talking about--

00:00:55.234 --> 00:00:56.934
the title of the talk
is about usability,

00:00:56.934 --> 00:01:00.400
but that's about how the user
actually experiences your site,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.033
and we'll go into a little bit
of detail about what that means.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.167
Mahe: Some of the differences
between desktop and mobile,

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:07.000
not just how people
interact with them,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.801
but the fundamental differences
between the two.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.000
Fletcher: Exactly.
So we're talking about use cases

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.100
and technical limitations
and so forth.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.100
Mahe: And then we'll
talk a little bit

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.367
about the pain points.

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.601
What are some common things
you might run into,

00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:18.267
and then hopefully
offer some suggestions

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:19.567
on how to fix it.
Fletcher: Exactly.

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:21.701
So this is going to be the
main thrust of our talk.

00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:23.701
We're going to identify
a set of things

00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:26.634
that people
can often do wrong

00:01:26.634 --> 00:01:28.801
when it comes to
user experience.

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:30.267
And these are things
that can really make

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:31.868
the user experience suck.

00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:35.334
And we want to identify them
and work through some ways

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:37.000
that you can mitigate.
Mahe: Yeah.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.701
So first, like, Jess,
what is user experience?

00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:41.067
Fletcher:
Well, user experience--

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:43.834
we're talking about
everything to do with the way

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:46.033
the user interacts
with your application.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:49.567
So this is everything
from the user interface,

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:52.667
the way things are laid out,
how they actually

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:54.634
activate your site
and so forth like that.

00:01:54.634 --> 00:01:56.200
But it's also
more subtle things,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.267
and it's to do with
how your users actually go

00:02:00.267 --> 00:02:04.534
about solving the problem that
they came to your site with.

00:02:04.534 --> 00:02:06.701
Mahe: So, firstly,
it's about respecting

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.000
the intent of the user.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.100
They've come to your site
for a reason,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.734
and they may have a problem,
but you respect that

00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:14.767
and will deliver them
a solution for it.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.300
Fletcher:
Exactly.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.701
They've come there expecting
to be able to do something,

00:02:18.701 --> 00:02:21.868
and you have to respect that
and be able to give them

00:02:21.868 --> 00:02:24.000
a solution, which takes us
to our next point.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.400
Mahe: Yes.
Don't give them a problem.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.901
Give them a solution.
Fletcher: Exactly.

00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:29.467
They've already got a problem,
right?

00:02:29.467 --> 00:02:32.167
That's why they're at your site.
You might have something,

00:02:32.167 --> 00:02:33.701
you know,
you want to track ponies,

00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:35.634
you want to do something else
with a mapping application,

00:02:35.634 --> 00:02:36.868
right?

00:02:36.868 --> 00:02:38.501
Mahe: But if they can't find
those ponies--

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:40.834
Fletcher: Then they've got
another problem, right?

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:42.334
And they've
already got a problem,

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:45.000
so you've got to give them
the solution to their problem.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.734
Mahe: And ensure
that their experience matches

00:02:46.734 --> 00:02:48.133
their mental model.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.734
They have an idea in their mind
when they come to your site

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:52.434
of what they want,
and we should match that

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:54.400
and keep the experience flowing
for what they want.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.968
Fletcher: Exactly, and this is
particularly important

00:02:55.968 --> 00:02:57.267
for a mapping application,

00:02:57.267 --> 00:02:59.734
because people have
pretty fixed ideas

00:02:59.734 --> 00:03:02.868
about what they are
going to get into

00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:04.801
when they've got
a mapping application.

00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:06.100
And so you've
got to make sure

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.934
that you match up
with their expectations

00:03:08.934 --> 00:03:11.033
and how they think about things
in their head,

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:13.300
with how they're actually
going to interact

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.434
with your application.
Mahe: And then it's about,

00:03:16.434 --> 00:03:19.133
how does that intent relate
to a mapping application?

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:21.501
Fletcher: Right. So we've talked
a lot about intent now,

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:23.901
and we've talked about
respecting the intent

00:03:23.901 --> 00:03:27.567
and making sure that we can
solve the problem of the user,

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:30.834
but we need to work out now
what we mean by intent

00:03:30.834 --> 00:03:33.334
when we're talking about
a mapping application.

00:03:33.334 --> 00:03:35.167
Mahe: Especially between
desktop and mobile.

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:36.467
Fletcher:
Exactly.

00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:38.634
Mahe: So with that,
we should talk a bit about

00:03:38.634 --> 00:03:40.567
what is desktop
and how is it used,

00:03:40.567 --> 00:03:42.701
and some of the differences
between that and mobile.

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:43.934
Fletcher:
Exactly.

00:03:43.934 --> 00:03:45.167
Mahe: So desktop is usually
used for planning.

00:03:45.167 --> 00:03:47.968
You don't carry your desktop
around with you.

00:03:47.968 --> 00:03:50.100
It's a bit big.
So, it's all about feeling out--

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.100
Fletcher:
I don't know, I've seen you

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.300
carrying your desktop around--

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.434
Mahe: Yeah,
that 30-inch monitor--

00:03:53.434 --> 00:03:54.567
Fletcher: You were
probably stealing it.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:55.601
Mahe: Yeah, well,
it was probably yours.

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:56.834
Fletcher:
Yeah, I think so.

00:03:56.834 --> 00:03:58.634
I did miss my computer
for a while there.

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:00.367
Mahe:
So it's about planning.

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:02.501
It's about kind of figuring out
what you want to do.

00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:04.234
You don't mind sifting
through information,

00:04:04.234 --> 00:04:06.367
usually on a comfy couch.

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:09.334
You don't mind getting
a bit more sent to you

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:10.334
to evaluate the options,

00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:11.868
and then kind of
make a decision.

00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:16.167
Fletcher: Exactly. You've got
a lot more power with a desktop,

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:19.033
so you can show the user
a lot of different options,

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:22.701
and give them things
that they can evaluate.

00:04:22.701 --> 00:04:25.501
Mahe: But then on mobile,
it's more about immediacy.

00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:27.133
It's about now.
I'm out in the world,

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:29.434
walking around,
and I've got a question.

00:04:29.434 --> 00:04:31.100
It's usually where I am.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.033
You've got the context
that the phone can provide.

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:35.167
You know, the location
and that sort of stuff.

00:04:35.167 --> 00:04:38.868
So, it's using that to enrich
their experience and solve that.

00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:42.133
Fletcher: Exactly. And we're
moving here from a planning,

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:45.167
sort of passive stage when
you're on a desktop application,

00:04:45.167 --> 00:04:47.934
to an active stage when you go
to the mobile device.

00:04:47.934 --> 00:04:49.567
It's immediate.
It's about immediacy.

00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:52.767
Mahe: Yeah, so
but those are just how you

00:04:52.767 --> 00:04:54.267
kind of interact with the two,
but there are some

00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:56.033
fundamental differences
between desktop and mobile.

00:04:56.033 --> 00:04:57.534
Fletcher: Right,
and these are things that--

00:04:57.534 --> 00:04:58.767
they're pretty simple things.

00:04:58.767 --> 00:05:00.267
They're things
that you would think about

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:02.200
when you're thinking about
making a desktop app

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.634
compared to a mobile app.

00:05:03.634 --> 00:05:04.667
But it's good to go
through them,

00:05:04.667 --> 00:05:06.834
because often
it's really easy

00:05:06.834 --> 00:05:08.367
to just overlook
one of these things,

00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:10.567
and to make a site
that works great for a desktop

00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:12.634
but just doesn't translate
at all for a mobile.

00:05:12.634 --> 00:05:14.033
Mahe:
And these things are like,

00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:17.300
whether the person is using
a mouse, or a touch device.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.267
You know, you could use
mouse tool tips

00:05:20.267 --> 00:05:21.767
when you hover over them.

00:05:21.767 --> 00:05:23.567
You can change the cursor icon,
but you can't really do that

00:05:23.567 --> 00:05:25.133
on a mobile device.
Fletcher: Exactly.

00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:27.100
And it's things
like not expecting

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.067
that you're going to get
a mouse-over event

00:05:29.067 --> 00:05:30.734
when you're clicking
on an item,

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:32.901
if a user
is using a touch device.

00:05:32.901 --> 00:05:34.767
Mahe: Yeah.
Things like the screen size.

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:38.067
Obviously the screen sizes
vary dramatically

00:05:38.067 --> 00:05:41.801
between desktop and mobile,
and the resolution as well.

00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:44.200
Fletcher: Exactly.
And this is probably

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.200
the most fundamental thing.
It's about screen real estate.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.400
You just don't have
as much space

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.100
to display things
on a mobile device.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.667
And we'll go through
a number of examples

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:51.868
where that becomes apparent.

00:05:51.868 --> 00:05:53.367
Mahe: Yeah, and then
bandwidth, obviously.

00:05:53.367 --> 00:05:55.133
Phones, especially.

00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:57.167
Here they have unlimited data,
but when you're in Australia,

00:05:57.167 --> 00:05:58.467
it costs us money.
Fletcher: I know.

00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:00.000
Mahe: So it's a bit rude
when you start sending me

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.067
5 meg images of ponies
on my phone.

00:06:02.067 --> 00:06:04.334
Fletcher: And I have to
pay for that, you know.

00:06:04.334 --> 00:06:05.701
Mahe: Yeah.
I know.

00:06:05.701 --> 00:06:06.934
Fletcher: He keeps sending me
these photos of ponies

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:08.033
and you know,
it's just chewing

00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:09.267
through my data quota
every month.

00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:11.067
Mahe:
You like ponies.

00:06:11.067 --> 00:06:12.734
Fletcher: I like ponies,
but not that much.

00:06:12.734 --> 00:06:15.133
Not the amount you send me.
Mahe: That's a lot of ponies.

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:18.100
And then it's about location.
Your desktop does--

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.701
you can kind of get within a
city range, usually, on desktop,

00:06:22.701 --> 00:06:24.968
but on a mobile, you can get to
within a couple of meters.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:26.467
Fletcher:
And of course,
this takes us back

00:06:26.467 --> 00:06:28.200
to our active versus
passive theme, right?

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.267
It's the use case and
the capabilities of a mobile.

00:06:31.267 --> 00:06:32.601
Mahe: And then
processing power.

00:06:32.601 --> 00:06:34.367
You find you usually have
a lot less,

00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:36.067
so think about what you're going
to be doing on the phone,

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:37.567
what data you're going
to be sending down,

00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:38.834
and then what you're
actually going to do with it

00:06:38.834 --> 00:06:40.100
compared to what you can do
on the server.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.501
Fletcher: So a key point
of our talk today is,

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:44.834
if you do things naively,
then you can actually

00:06:44.834 --> 00:06:48.100
really hurt yourself when you go
to a mobile environment.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.901
So something that might be
really nice,

00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:52.234
have a lot of nice graphic
transitions and so forth

00:06:52.234 --> 00:06:54.901
on a desktop,
might just slow down the phone

00:06:54.901 --> 00:06:56.501
to the point
that it's not usable.

00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:57.567
Mahe:
And lastly, cache.

00:06:57.567 --> 00:06:59.567
You can't expect
someone on a phone

00:06:59.567 --> 00:07:02.200
that's got a lot less cache
to have everything

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.734
that you sent to them
last time still there,

00:07:03.734 --> 00:07:05.534
so it's kind of being smart

00:07:05.534 --> 00:07:06.767
about what you store
on the phone,

00:07:06.767 --> 00:07:08.067
what you send down,

00:07:08.067 --> 00:07:09.434
and kind of thinking about
what you're doing.

00:07:09.434 --> 00:07:10.868
Fletcher:
Okay, cool.

00:07:10.868 --> 00:07:12.934
Mahe: So, Jess,
why do we care?

00:07:12.934 --> 00:07:13.934
Fletcher:
Why do we care?

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:15.667
So, we've talked a lot,

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:17.934
we've given you a lot of
platitudes so far about,

00:07:17.934 --> 00:07:19.501
you have to have
good user experience.

00:07:19.501 --> 00:07:21.767
What user experience means,

00:07:21.767 --> 00:07:24.200
and what are some of
the problems that--

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.667
the question is,
why do we care, Luke?

00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:28.968
Mahe:
Because.

00:07:28.968 --> 00:07:30.901
Fletcher: Wow. That's
not really an answer, is it?

00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:32.300
Mahe: It's my answer
to everything.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.501
Fletcher: It's your answer,
but you're kind of lazy,

00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:35.200
and you don't really
have a good answer,

00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:36.501
so I've got a better answer
for us.

00:07:36.501 --> 00:07:38.901
Mahe: Okay,
how about this?

00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:42.300
Fletcher: So, the answer is,
if the user experience sucks,

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.767
then the users aren't
going to come back.

00:07:44.767 --> 00:07:46.834
Now, you might have
a really great site.

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:48.200
Like--
Mahe: Ponies.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.200
Fletcher: Right.
Luke and his ponies site.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.667
It might be the greatest
premise ever.

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:56.300
But if people can't actually
use that to track their ponies

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.367
or whatever they're
intending to do,

00:07:58.367 --> 00:07:59.901
then they're not
going to come back.

00:07:59.901 --> 00:08:02.300
They might go there,
trying to do this,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.100
and they just get frustrated
with it, so they go,

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:05.400
"Well, I'm never
going back."

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.701
Mahe: And now they've got
another problem.

00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:07.968
Fletcher: And now they've
got another problem.

00:08:07.968 --> 00:08:09.300
Mahe: We don't want to
give them more problems.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.834
Fletcher:
Exactly.

00:08:10.834 --> 00:08:12.534
Mahe: So keeping that in mind,
we'll just be talking about--

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:16.634
you know, if it's done badly,
then the user experience sucks.

00:08:16.634 --> 00:08:18.300
Fletcher: Okay, so we've got
to identify some things that,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.300
if they are done badly,

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.000
we're going to make the users
frustrated.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.067
We're going to make
the user experience suck.

00:08:24.067 --> 00:08:26.367
Mahe: So, firstly,
the layout, Jess.

00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:29.334
If the layout is done badly,
the user experience sucks.

00:08:29.334 --> 00:08:31.200
Now, what do we kind
of mean by the layout?

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.067
Fletcher: Well, the layout is
probably the most obvious thing

00:08:33.067 --> 00:08:35.100
you think of when you think
of user experience, right?

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.434
It's to do with how things
are put on the page,

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:40.334
how you actually
represent things,

00:08:40.334 --> 00:08:42.734
and some of the problems
that a bad layout

00:08:42.734 --> 00:08:44.400
can give you is clutter.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.968
People don't like seeing
a cluttered webpage,

00:08:46.968 --> 00:08:49.400
and so, if they
immediately see a theme

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.934
that has a million
different things,

00:08:52.934 --> 00:08:54.501
controls all over the place,

00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:56.701
and the map not set up the way
it's meant to be,

00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:58.100
then they're going to get
frustrated.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.934
Mahe: Yeah. And then,
kind of moving buttons

00:08:59.934 --> 00:09:01.167
around and shifting
things between

00:09:01.167 --> 00:09:02.234
when someone did something

00:09:02.234 --> 00:09:03.767
and when they look at it
again.

00:09:03.767 --> 00:09:05.667
You know, it's kind of just
being smart and being consistent

00:09:05.667 --> 00:09:06.901
and doing
those sorts of things.

00:09:06.901 --> 00:09:08.434
Fletcher: And so,
key things to think about

00:09:08.434 --> 00:09:10.868
when you're thinking about
desktop versus mobile here.

00:09:10.868 --> 00:09:13.000
On the desktop because you've
got the screen real estate,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.734
you've got this space,
you can generally have the map

00:09:15.734 --> 00:09:17.934
and the content that you want
to display on the map

00:09:17.934 --> 00:09:19.100
all in the same place.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.767
Mahe: And you can break out
the content.

00:09:20.767 --> 00:09:22.934
You can display more,
you can give users

00:09:22.934 --> 00:09:24.901
the ability to dive in
and kind of filter

00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:27.100
and just expand and explore
their environment.

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.467
Fletcher:
And on mobile,

00:09:28.467 --> 00:09:29.767
you really have to
make the choice, right?

00:09:29.767 --> 00:09:31.200
You can have the map,
because you need the map

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.667
and you're
a mapping application,

00:09:32.667 --> 00:09:34.734
but you've got to show
the content in a clever way

00:09:34.734 --> 00:09:36.634
so that you're not
going to clutter up the map

00:09:36.634 --> 00:09:37.834
when you're there.

00:09:37.834 --> 00:09:39.601
And a classic example
of this,

00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:41.834
and we'll have some examples in
a second, is the info window.

00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:43.267
Mahe:
Yeah.

00:09:43.267 --> 00:09:44.734
Fletcher: So, on a desktop,
an info window is a great way

00:09:44.734 --> 00:09:48.968
to show context and content,
but on a mobile device,

00:09:48.968 --> 00:09:51.767
it just really, really sucks.
Mahe: Yeah.

00:09:51.767 --> 00:09:55.467
So, we'll show you that.
So, here is maps.google.com.

00:09:55.467 --> 00:09:57.200
Fletcher: So, we're
using this as an example

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.601
of what we think
is a good user experience,

00:09:59.601 --> 00:10:03.267
and we think maps.google.com
is a good user experience,

00:10:03.267 --> 00:10:05.834
because you know, we work
for Google, so if we didn't,

00:10:05.834 --> 00:10:07.534
we probably shouldn't
be giving this talk.

00:10:07.534 --> 00:10:08.534
Mahe:
Yeah. Exactly.

00:10:08.534 --> 00:10:11.234
So this is
maps.google.com.

00:10:11.234 --> 00:10:12.400
You can see
it's the desktop version,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.534
so we use up
the whole real estate.

00:10:14.534 --> 00:10:16.801
You've got a big map,
kind of zoomed out so you can

00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:19.133
see the whole world, because
you want to be able to explore.

00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:20.968
So we've got room
for content on the left.

00:10:20.968 --> 00:10:22.501
You've got the search file
always at the top,

00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:25.300
and you've just got everything
kind of just spaced out nicely

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.734
so you can see
everything.

00:10:26.734 --> 00:10:28.334
Fletcher: This is getting at
that kind of mental model thing.

00:10:28.334 --> 00:10:31.267
This is how users expect to be
able to interact with the map.

00:10:31.267 --> 00:10:32.834
Having the search bar
always available,

00:10:32.834 --> 00:10:34.567
no matter what you're doing
with the map, is great

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:36.801
because, you know, that's
what people are there to do.

00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:37.901
They're there to search;

00:10:37.901 --> 00:10:40.534
they're there to
interact with it.

00:10:40.534 --> 00:10:43.033
Mahe: So if we look at the same
thing on the mobile device,

00:10:43.033 --> 00:10:46.334
it's kind of the same,
just a bit simplified.

00:10:46.334 --> 00:10:47.868
Fletcher: A bit simplified.

00:10:47.868 --> 00:10:50.133
And so what we see here is,
we've taken the map,

00:10:50.133 --> 00:10:51.767
we've zoomed it in a lot

00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:53.534
because we've got a lot more
context of course.

00:10:53.534 --> 00:10:54.901
Mahe: We know where they are
so we might as well

00:10:54.901 --> 00:10:56.400
just bring the map as close
as we can go,

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.701
because that way, they don't
have to send as much data,

00:10:58.701 --> 00:10:59.934
they don't have to pan around
as much,

00:10:59.934 --> 00:11:01.334
and we're just respecting
their intent.

00:11:01.334 --> 00:11:03.100
Fletcher:
Exactly.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.467
Mahe: And then
if we move along

00:11:04.467 --> 00:11:07.167
to actually showing data
on the map,

00:11:07.167 --> 00:11:08.968
you can see that we've got
the results on the left.

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:10.934
You can scroll up and down.
You can have more.

00:11:10.934 --> 00:11:12.868
We've got the map
on the right;

00:11:12.868 --> 00:11:14.801
we've got tool tips
when you hover over them.

00:11:14.801 --> 00:11:16.601
It's just a lot more content.

00:11:16.601 --> 00:11:18.634
Fletcher: And this is because
we're in this planning stage,

00:11:18.634 --> 00:11:21.467
remember. We want to show
the users a lot of content.

00:11:21.467 --> 00:11:23.033
We want to give them
a lot of options,

00:11:23.033 --> 00:11:24.834
because they're evaluating
different alternatives

00:11:24.834 --> 00:11:26.534
about what
they're trying to do.

00:11:26.534 --> 00:11:29.033
Mahe: But if we move
this to the mobile,

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:30.300
because the content
is still there.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.000
We did the search;
we found all our results.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.467
They're there.

00:11:34.467 --> 00:11:36.200
But we're just given more
options to get what we want

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.734
rather than having been
bombarded with everything.

00:11:38.734 --> 00:11:41.200
Fletcher: Exactly. So let's
move to the info window example,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.767
and we'll see here,
this is the classic info window.

00:11:43.767 --> 00:11:45.267
It's great when you're
in the planning stage

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:47.300
because it's giving you a lot of
information very quickly.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.701
Mahe: And it looks pretty.
Fletcher: It looks pretty.

00:11:48.701 --> 00:11:49.968
We like the look of
that info window.

00:11:49.968 --> 00:11:52.734
So we've got
the thumbnail there,

00:11:52.734 --> 00:11:56.467
we've got a summary of
the review status, the website.

00:11:56.467 --> 00:11:57.634
Mahe: Connects to the marker,
so you--

00:11:57.634 --> 00:11:58.834
Fletcher:
It connects to the marker,

00:11:58.834 --> 00:11:59.901
so you've got the context.
Mahe: Yeah.

00:11:59.901 --> 00:12:00.901
Jesse:
Of course, you know.

00:12:00.901 --> 00:12:02.033
And of course,
all of the results

00:12:02.033 --> 00:12:03.501
still on
the left hand side there.

00:12:03.501 --> 00:12:05.801
Mahe: And when we do
the same thing on the mobile,

00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:07.767
you see, instead of filling
the whole screen

00:12:07.767 --> 00:12:10.868
with an info window where
you can't kind of figure out

00:12:10.868 --> 00:12:12.100
what you just clicked on,

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.501
we'll just pop it up
at the bottom.

00:12:13.501 --> 00:12:15.968
You can relate it to the marker,
so we just clicked on B,

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.234
so we'll show B down below,

00:12:17.234 --> 00:12:19.167
and because we're
in the active stage,

00:12:19.167 --> 00:12:21.801
we're going to give options
of calling and giving directions

00:12:21.801 --> 00:12:23.567
because that's more what
you're going to be doing.

00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:24.868
Fletcher:
Exactly, this is about--

00:12:24.868 --> 00:12:26.901
this is key about respecting
the intent of the user.

00:12:26.901 --> 00:12:28.734
If someone's out
and they're searching

00:12:28.734 --> 00:12:31.200
for a particular business,
one of the things

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.701
they're probably
likely to want to do

00:12:33.701 --> 00:12:37.000
is to find the phone number
and call it.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.501
Mahe:
Or get directions.

00:12:38.501 --> 00:12:39.767
Fletcher:
Or get directions there.

00:12:39.767 --> 00:12:42.868
Mahe: So moving on,
if the data representation

00:12:42.868 --> 00:12:44.868
is done badly,
the user experience sucks.

00:12:44.868 --> 00:12:46.934
Like, what do you mean
by that, Jess?

00:12:46.934 --> 00:12:49.400
Fletcher: So this is
where we're adding value

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.400
to the map, right?

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.367
So this is
besides the map itself,

00:12:52.367 --> 00:12:56.200
this is adding the content,
the information that you have,

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.200
that you want to display
graphically on the map.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.334
And again, one of the key things
that can go wrong

00:13:01.334 --> 00:13:03.033
if you do this badly
is clutter.

00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:05.834
And this kind of
gets back to our concept

00:13:05.834 --> 00:13:07.567
of doing things naively.

00:13:07.567 --> 00:13:08.968
If you do things naively,

00:13:08.968 --> 00:13:13.000
then you end up
making a sucky user experience.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.334
Mahe: Yeah, like
showing too much data.

00:13:14.334 --> 00:13:15.667
This is easy.

00:13:15.667 --> 00:13:16.801
I like getting all my data
and putting it on the map

00:13:16.801 --> 00:13:17.868
because I don't have to
think about it.

00:13:17.868 --> 00:13:18.868
Fletcher:
I know. We already know

00:13:18.868 --> 00:13:20.767
that you're lazy, right?

00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:22.767
Mahe: So this is about
giving them the information

00:13:22.767 --> 00:13:23.934
that they want.

00:13:23.934 --> 00:13:25.167
We don't want to
load the entire world

00:13:25.167 --> 00:13:26.501
and send it down to them,

00:13:26.501 --> 00:13:28.133
if they're not really interested
in the entire world.

00:13:28.133 --> 00:13:31.367
Fletcher: Exactly. And
the other key point you can do

00:13:31.367 --> 00:13:32.567
when you're representing data

00:13:32.567 --> 00:13:34.267
is breaking their mental model
of the data.

00:13:34.267 --> 00:13:36.801
If they have
a particular expectation

00:13:36.801 --> 00:13:38.601
about how this data
is going to be represented,

00:13:38.601 --> 00:13:40.901
if you give them a really
weird way of doing that,

00:13:40.901 --> 00:13:42.567
then they're going to be
disconnected with it,

00:13:42.567 --> 00:13:43.968
and it's going to
frustrate them.

00:13:43.968 --> 00:13:45.334
Mahe: So I've got
a little demo here.

00:13:45.334 --> 00:13:48.767
This is a little project
I've been working on.

00:13:48.767 --> 00:13:49.901
Do you know
what country this is?

00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:51.167
Fletcher: Yeah,
that's Australia.

00:13:51.167 --> 00:13:52.334
That's where we are.
Mahe: Yeah?

00:13:52.334 --> 00:13:55.100
What do you reckon
of my little project?

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.534
Fletcher: See, I don't know
what to say, Luke.

00:13:57.534 --> 00:13:58.534
That's just terrible.

00:13:58.534 --> 00:14:00.267
What are we even
looking at there?

00:14:00.267 --> 00:14:05.868
Mahe: This is every
public toilet in Australia.

00:14:05.868 --> 00:14:09.534
Fletcher: Okay, so I can see
why you might need that data,

00:14:09.534 --> 00:14:11.300
if you're potentially
in a hurry,

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.234
but that's just not useful
for me.

00:14:14.234 --> 00:14:15.400
I'm looking at that,

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.367
and it's obstructing
the entire map.

00:14:16.367 --> 00:14:17.367
You know,
what are you thinking?

00:14:17.367 --> 00:14:18.801
Mahe:
Yeah, okay.

00:14:18.801 --> 00:14:20.934
I suppose if we think about it
a little bit more,

00:14:20.934 --> 00:14:22.667
we could do something
like this.

00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:24.501
Fletcher: Okay, so this is
a bit more interesting, right?

00:14:24.501 --> 00:14:28.100
This is showing us--
what's this showing us?

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:30.267
Mahe: This is essentially
clustering that information,

00:14:30.267 --> 00:14:33.167
instead of just displaying
every marker in the world,

00:14:33.167 --> 00:14:35.667
we'll just replace that
with just icons

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:37.901
that represent how much data
is there.

00:14:37.901 --> 00:14:39.167
Fletcher: Okay.
Okay, cool.

00:14:39.167 --> 00:14:42.267
So we can see that around
Sydney and so forth,

00:14:42.267 --> 00:14:44.367
we've got about
3,500 public toilets.

00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:45.701
Mahe: And you've visited
almost all of them.

00:14:45.701 --> 00:14:49.300
Fletcher: Yeah.
It's very important to me.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.601
So what if we want to just
show the relative concentration

00:14:53.601 --> 00:14:54.834
of public toilets
around Australia?

00:14:54.834 --> 00:14:56.300
Mahe: You think a bit more
like this?

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.133
Fletcher: Okay, cool.
So this is showing us--

00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:01.200
what's this showing us, Luke?

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.334
Mahe:
This is using Fusion Tables

00:15:02.334 --> 00:15:03.901
to just generate
a heat map instead,

00:15:03.901 --> 00:15:07.000
so this is just
going to render some tiles.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.934
It's much quicker
to send down to the browser

00:15:08.934 --> 00:15:11.200
and we see much
more of a concentration

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.400
of the information.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.067
Fletcher: So this is useful
if I want to see

00:15:14.067 --> 00:15:15.834
what sort of areas
I need to hang around

00:15:15.834 --> 00:15:17.434
if I need a lot of
public toilets around me.

00:15:17.434 --> 00:15:18.868
Mahe:
Yeah.

00:15:18.868 --> 00:15:21.400
And here's another project
I've been working on.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.033
What do you think about it?

00:15:23.033 --> 00:15:24.901
Fletcher: Okay, this is okay,
but what's this?

00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:26.033
What's this doing?

00:15:26.033 --> 00:15:27.300
Mahe: I like to track
zombies as well.

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.300
Fletcher:
You're tracking zombies.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:30.634
Mahe: Yeah, so the hero
and my zombies,

00:15:30.634 --> 00:15:33.067
and they're kind of
coming toward this mall.

00:15:33.067 --> 00:15:34.334
Fletcher:
But I already have

00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:37.100
a mental model of what
zombies are like, Luke,

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:38.801
and these aren't really
matching my mental model

00:15:38.801 --> 00:15:40.968
of what a zombie looks like.
Mahe: Would this help?

00:15:40.968 --> 00:15:42.167
Fletcher:
Ah, see, that looks better.

00:15:42.167 --> 00:15:43.334
See, that's scary.

00:15:43.334 --> 00:15:45.067
I wouldn't
necessarily be scared

00:15:45.067 --> 00:15:48.067
if I just saw
a bunch of markers around.

00:15:48.067 --> 00:15:49.868
I'd just think there was
a lot of Google I/Os--

00:15:49.868 --> 00:15:51.834
Mahe: Giant marker
comes to eat your brains?

00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:53.267
Fletcher:
Yeah, not scary.

00:15:53.267 --> 00:15:56.567
I just think-- you know, yeah.
Okay. But this is a lot better;

00:15:56.567 --> 00:15:59.801
this is matching more up
with my expectations.

00:15:59.801 --> 00:16:01.267
I've been working on
a similar site;

00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:07.701
it's for tracking ninjas.

00:16:07.701 --> 00:16:09.100
That was a really big laugh,

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.834
and I'm actually kind of
disappointed we got a laugh,

00:16:10.834 --> 00:16:13.968
because we used the exact
same joke in our talk last year.

00:16:13.968 --> 00:16:16.133
So obviously people weren't
paying attention last year,

00:16:16.133 --> 00:16:17.567
or they haven't watched
on Youtube.

00:16:17.567 --> 00:16:19.968
Mahe: Yeah.
So moving on.

00:16:19.968 --> 00:16:22.067
If controlling the map
is done badly,

00:16:22.067 --> 00:16:24.400
the user experience sucks.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.467
Fletcher: See, this is
getting very negative, Luke.

00:16:27.467 --> 00:16:28.801
Mahe: I'm not a negative
person, man.

00:16:28.801 --> 00:16:29.767
Fletcher: You're not
a negative person,

00:16:29.767 --> 00:16:31.100
but you're being very--

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.367
you're talking about sucking
and doing things badly.

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:33.601
Can we maybe
switch it up a bit?

00:16:33.601 --> 00:16:35.834
Mahe: All right.
What if we do this?

00:16:35.834 --> 00:16:37.634
If the controlling the map
is done well,

00:16:37.634 --> 00:16:38.701
the user experience rocks.

00:16:38.701 --> 00:16:39.801
Fletcher: All right,
all right.

00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:41.400
Let's make the user
experience rock.

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.534
Mahe: That's what
we're here for.

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:44.033
Fletcher: Okay.
So controlling the map.

00:16:44.033 --> 00:16:48.234
This is actually how the user
interacts with the map itself.

00:16:48.234 --> 00:16:51.801
And this is really getting
at matching up

00:16:51.801 --> 00:16:53.167
with people's expectations.

00:16:53.167 --> 00:16:55.167
There are a lot of
mapping sites out there,

00:16:55.167 --> 00:16:56.601
but they all have
a sort of similar way

00:16:56.601 --> 00:17:00.634
of interacting with the map,
how you can actually do things,

00:17:00.634 --> 00:17:03.901
and if you break them into
a model of how to do this

00:17:03.901 --> 00:17:07.334
and their expectations,
then it's going to really suck.

00:17:07.334 --> 00:17:09.200
And I'm still talking negative.
Mahe: Yeah.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.400
Fletcher: If you do it right,
it's going to rock.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.801
Mahe: It will rock.
And this isn't saying

00:17:12.801 --> 00:17:14.868
that you don't have to
design something cool,

00:17:14.868 --> 00:17:16.567
and just follow
what everyone does.

00:17:16.567 --> 00:17:19.534
It's just thinking about
what people are used to,

00:17:19.534 --> 00:17:22.367
and kind of--you can make
things kind of cool and better,

00:17:22.367 --> 00:17:24.901
but you don't want to make
people really think too hard

00:17:24.901 --> 00:17:27.200
about what they have to do,
because then it's just going to

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.634
become more of a problem
than it's actually--

00:17:28.634 --> 00:17:29.968
Fletcher:
This is simple things,

00:17:29.968 --> 00:17:32.000
things like making
the interactions obvious.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.934
Make it obvious what you can
actually interact with.

00:17:33.934 --> 00:17:35.734
Making your controls
consistent,

00:17:35.734 --> 00:17:37.801
that's particularly the case
for a mobile device,

00:17:37.801 --> 00:17:40.334
where you don't have cues
like you know,

00:17:40.334 --> 00:17:43.234
if you mouse over something
and the hand turns into a click.

00:17:43.234 --> 00:17:44.734
Mahe: Yeah.

00:17:44.734 --> 00:17:47.300
And it's stuff like having
all the buttons the same size,

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.100
so you know just by
visually looking at it

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.501
what is a button
and what isn't.

00:17:50.501 --> 00:17:52.534
And you're making them bigger
so you can touch it

00:17:52.534 --> 00:17:55.434
with your finger,
or with your dialing wand.

00:17:55.434 --> 00:17:57.167
Fletcher: And I have
really, really fat fingers

00:17:57.167 --> 00:17:58.868
so I need a dialing
wand for mine.

00:17:58.868 --> 00:18:01.200
Mahe: And it's things like
removing functionality.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.701
You don't want to remove
functionality.

00:18:02.701 --> 00:18:04.467
You just want
to simplify it.

00:18:04.467 --> 00:18:06.467
Fletcher: And that goes back
to naivety again, right?

00:18:06.467 --> 00:18:09.400
People often build
a great desktop application,

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.868
and then to make
a mobile version,

00:18:10.868 --> 00:18:13.834
they just rip out the guts
of the application, right?

00:18:13.834 --> 00:18:15.934
They make it
a lot simpler.

00:18:15.934 --> 00:18:18.367
But they've actually removed
a lot of the stuff

00:18:18.367 --> 00:18:19.667
that you can do
in the desktop app,

00:18:19.667 --> 00:18:20.934
and you don't want to
do that.

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:22.167
Mahe: Yeah, you don't want to
dumb it down.

00:18:22.167 --> 00:18:23.901
You just want to simplify.
Fletcher: Exactly.

00:18:23.901 --> 00:18:26.367
Mahe: So here's again
the maps example.

00:18:26.367 --> 00:18:28.701
We're going to use this
quite a bit.

00:18:28.701 --> 00:18:29.868
On the desktop version,

00:18:29.868 --> 00:18:32.234
we have the map type
controller on top,

00:18:32.234 --> 00:18:33.968
where you hover over
and it expands out.

00:18:33.968 --> 00:18:35.434
A lot of people
have seen that.

00:18:35.434 --> 00:18:37.167
We've got the overview map
control down at the bottom

00:18:37.167 --> 00:18:38.801
and we've got a slider
for the nav.

00:18:38.801 --> 00:18:40.968
We've got all these cool things
we can interact with,

00:18:40.968 --> 00:18:43.133
and we don't have to be told
to interact with it, do we?

00:18:43.133 --> 00:18:44.701
We can just kind of
explore the interface.

00:18:44.701 --> 00:18:46.167
Fletcher: Exactly.
And make it easy

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:48.868
for the user to explore it.

00:18:48.868 --> 00:18:51.667
Mahe: And then on mobile you see
we've got bigger buttons.

00:18:51.667 --> 00:18:52.968
We can just look at this,

00:18:52.968 --> 00:18:55.701
and easily see what's a button,
and what isn't.

00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:56.701
What we can kind of
interact with.

00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:57.834
Fletcher: Exactly.
The key point is

00:18:57.834 --> 00:18:59.267
that we've got
a consistent scheme

00:18:59.267 --> 00:19:01.734
for everything that the user
can interact with.

00:19:01.734 --> 00:19:03.200
So it's easy
to drag the map around,

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.133
because that's
kind of intuitive,

00:19:05.133 --> 00:19:07.667
but then all of the buttons,
they're styled the same way.

00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:09.067
They're really obvious
that these are buttons;

00:19:09.067 --> 00:19:12.467
these are something you can
click on with your dialing wand.

00:19:12.467 --> 00:19:15.100
Mahe: So, responsiveness.
This is a key thing.

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.200
If the responsiveness
is done well,

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.434
the user experience rocks.

00:19:18.434 --> 00:19:20.200
Fletcher: And this is
getting into something

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:25.000
that people might often overlook
in terms of usability.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.400
Mahe:
So it's, again,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.901
it's about not breaking
the mental model.

00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:31.133
If you're panning a map
with a touch device,

00:19:31.133 --> 00:19:33.234
if you suddenly start doing
all this computation

00:19:33.234 --> 00:19:35.000
and just doing
lots of weird things,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.501
it just won't feel like
it's sticking to your hand.

00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:38.868
And people just
will get kind of confused

00:19:38.868 --> 00:19:40.300
about what they're doing.
Fletcher: Exactly.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.400
A map is a physical thing
in people's minds, right?

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.734
And so if you're
dragging it around,

00:19:43.734 --> 00:19:47.133
especially on a tablet device,
it feels really good

00:19:47.133 --> 00:19:49.868
when it actually interacts
with your fingers

00:19:49.868 --> 00:19:51.834
the way it's meant to, right?

00:19:51.834 --> 00:19:53.501
And if you have
a lot of latency,

00:19:53.501 --> 00:19:54.734
if you have a lot of delay,

00:19:54.734 --> 00:19:58.334
if you have a lot of lag
in the way it does,

00:19:58.334 --> 00:20:00.133
then it really breaks
people's mental model,

00:20:00.133 --> 00:20:01.834
and it really,
really frustrates them.

00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:04.567
Mahe: So we have a couple
of demos that show this.

00:20:04.567 --> 00:20:06.834
So here's a common thing
that we've seen people use.

00:20:06.834 --> 00:20:08.334
They'll put all the data
on a map,

00:20:08.334 --> 00:20:09.701
and then when someone
pans around,

00:20:09.701 --> 00:20:11.667
they'll get rid of every marker
and then load it

00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:14.968
and put it back, and you kind of
just forget what's happening.

00:20:14.968 --> 00:20:17.601
So we'll pan the map,
and see the markers disappear,

00:20:17.601 --> 00:20:19.701
pop in, when you move
a little bit.

00:20:19.701 --> 00:20:20.767
So there was a marker
on the left,

00:20:20.767 --> 00:20:22.300
and I'm kind of
confused and scared.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.167
Fletcher: So this is when you're
re-querying your data

00:20:25.167 --> 00:20:27.267
to update it when a user
drags a map,

00:20:27.267 --> 00:20:28.400
which you might want to do,

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.834
because you want to
show the new data

00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:32.467
where the user has
dragged and so forth.

00:20:32.467 --> 00:20:34.634
Mahe: But then, instead,
doing some simple things,

00:20:34.634 --> 00:20:36.400
like keeping the markers
around

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.901
and then just getting
rid of them

00:20:37.901 --> 00:20:39.567
when they're not
in the screen anymore.

00:20:39.567 --> 00:20:42.901
This just feels like a much more
fluid interaction with it.

00:20:42.901 --> 00:20:44.100
I can see the markers.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.234
If I go too fast so
that nothing is there,

00:20:46.234 --> 00:20:47.601
I can go back
and they're still there

00:20:47.601 --> 00:20:50.834
and it just feels better.
Fletcher: It feels better.

00:20:50.834 --> 00:20:51.834
And this is
another example.

00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:54.734
This is putting
an overlay onto the map

00:20:54.734 --> 00:21:01.100
and this is a great image
I found of the 15th century,

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.167
Augsburg in Germany.

00:21:04.167 --> 00:21:05.567
Mahe: How big
is this image, Jess?

00:21:05.567 --> 00:21:08.000
Fletcher: That's about 5 MB,
and I just found it--

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.434
I decided, "Yeah, I'm going
to plonk that on the map,

00:21:10.434 --> 00:21:11.601
and it's going
to be great-- "

00:21:11.601 --> 00:21:13.234
Mahe: But it doesn't work
too well.

00:21:13.234 --> 00:21:16.968
Fletcher: But it's just really
laggy when you drag it around.

00:21:16.968 --> 00:21:18.501
So you've got to make sure
that--

00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:20.934
and of course you're taking up
our Australian bandwidth too,

00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:22.467
if you do this.
Don't do that.

00:21:22.467 --> 00:21:24.234
Mahe: Yeah. And I've got to use
that bandwidth to find ponies.

00:21:24.234 --> 00:21:25.734
Fletcher:
Yeah, exactly.

00:21:25.734 --> 00:21:26.901
So instead,
what you can do,

00:21:26.901 --> 00:21:30.000
make sure that you get
your overlays

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.300
to the proper resolution,

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:33.567
a resolution
that you can actually render.

00:21:33.567 --> 00:21:35.834
And this one,
we're actually using KML

00:21:35.834 --> 00:21:37.133
to render this as well.
Mahe: Yeah.

00:21:37.133 --> 00:21:38.434
So that just moves
a lot better.

00:21:38.434 --> 00:21:40.167
It's a lot more easy
to interact with.

00:21:40.167 --> 00:21:42.367
I don't feel like
I'm waiting for something.

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:44.667
Fletcher:
Exactly.

00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:46.767
Mahe: So, a good shout out
to "Speedy Maps".

00:21:46.767 --> 00:21:48.267
Fletcher:
Good shout out.

00:21:48.267 --> 00:21:50.767
So, there's a great talk on
tomorrow morning at 10:00 am,

00:21:50.767 --> 00:21:53.834
straight after the keynote,
which is going to go

00:21:53.834 --> 00:21:56.234
into this particular thing
about making your map speedy,

00:21:56.234 --> 00:21:58.367
about making it responsive,
adding a lot more detail.

00:21:58.367 --> 00:21:59.534
Mahe:
Yeah, going right down

00:21:59.534 --> 00:22:00.968
to the like the dawn level
sort of thing.

00:22:00.968 --> 00:22:03.234
Fletcher: Exactly.
So go check it out.

00:22:03.234 --> 00:22:05.100
Mahe: So if the storage
is done well,

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.400
the user experience rocks.

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.968
And I mean, people don't
really think of storage

00:22:07.968 --> 00:22:10.000
when it comes to user
experience, Jess.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.567
Fletcher: But storage--
I mean, you've got data

00:22:11.567 --> 00:22:14.267
that you're representing
that you're putting on the map,

00:22:14.267 --> 00:22:15.467
and if you do it badly,

00:22:15.467 --> 00:22:17.367
there are a lot of things
that can go wrong.

00:22:17.367 --> 00:22:20.367
So we want to make sure that
we're using reliable sources

00:22:20.367 --> 00:22:23.801
for our data,
using a reliable infrastructure

00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:26.434
to put our data on the map
and so forth.

00:22:26.434 --> 00:22:27.934
So we're going to take you
through some examples

00:22:27.934 --> 00:22:31.767
of Google infrastructure
that is great for serving

00:22:31.767 --> 00:22:33.400
and storing your data.

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.100
And so you can make
the user experience rock.

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.534
Mahe: Yeah. So stuff
like reliability,

00:22:37.534 --> 00:22:38.834
always having your data up,

00:22:38.834 --> 00:22:41.267
if someone's put data
on your site,

00:22:41.267 --> 00:22:42.901
for them to be able to
get it back, you know,

00:22:42.901 --> 00:22:43.901
if they put something there.

00:22:43.901 --> 00:22:44.968
If they refresh the page,

00:22:44.968 --> 00:22:46.267
they kind of
expect it to be there.

00:22:46.267 --> 00:22:48.901
Fletcher: Exactly.
Latency, of course.

00:22:48.901 --> 00:22:53.734
If you have your data honed in
a single database in Reykovic,

00:22:53.734 --> 00:22:56.901
then it's not going to be very
useful outside Iceland, right?

00:22:56.901 --> 00:22:58.133
Mahe: Unless
there's a volcano.

00:22:58.133 --> 00:22:59.334
Fletcher: Unless
there's a volcano. Right.

00:22:59.334 --> 00:23:00.567
Well, that's going to be
even worse, right?

00:23:00.567 --> 00:23:02.033
Then everyone else
in the world

00:23:02.033 --> 00:23:04.434
is going to start looking at
your site, your Icelandic site.

00:23:04.434 --> 00:23:06.300
Mahe: You had one that was
about--what was it called?

00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:07.901
Fletcher: The volcano.
Mahe: Yeah.

00:23:07.901 --> 00:23:10.200
Fletcher: Yeah, you pronounced
it the other day.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:13.167
Mahe: It had seven days in it,
that's all I know.

00:23:13.167 --> 00:23:14.367
Fletcher: And of course,
editability.

00:23:14.367 --> 00:23:16.734
So if you want to have
your data editable,

00:23:16.734 --> 00:23:19.367
then there's some key things
you can do

00:23:19.367 --> 00:23:20.901
to get that up and running.
Mahe: Yeah.

00:23:20.901 --> 00:23:22.567
So, we like
Google products.

00:23:22.567 --> 00:23:24.868
We thought we'd use
a couple of Google products

00:23:24.868 --> 00:23:26.400
in these examples.
What was this one, Jess?

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.834
Fletcher: So this is
really simple example.

00:23:27.834 --> 00:23:31.167
This is just serving some KML
directly from App Engine.

00:23:31.167 --> 00:23:33.033
And this is just serving
a static KML file.

00:23:33.033 --> 00:23:35.868
But once you've got the
harnessing power of App Engine,

00:23:35.868 --> 00:23:37.200
you can actually do
a lot of cool things.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.767
You can actually
write an application

00:23:39.767 --> 00:23:43.167
to source data from users
and so forth like that,

00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:45.834
and then serve it in a way
as KML or as JSON

00:23:45.834 --> 00:23:47.000
or however you like,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.968
so you can actually
render it on a map.

00:23:48.968 --> 00:23:50.667
Mahe: And I've been talking
about my pony trackers

00:23:50.667 --> 00:23:51.801
and here it is.
Okay.

00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:53.501
Fletcher: Yeah,
cool, all right.

00:23:53.501 --> 00:23:56.367
So this is an example
of editability,

00:23:56.367 --> 00:23:58.467
if you've got
a crowd-sourced solution.

00:23:58.467 --> 00:23:59.901
And App Engine might be
a bit heavyweight

00:23:59.901 --> 00:24:01.234
for what you're interested in.
Mahe: Yeah.

00:24:01.234 --> 00:24:03.067
So with this I've just used
Google Spreadsheets,

00:24:03.067 --> 00:24:07.033
and it has a JSON feed callback,
so you can query a database

00:24:07.033 --> 00:24:08.868
on a spreadsheet
for some data,

00:24:08.868 --> 00:24:09.934
and it will come back in JSON,

00:24:09.934 --> 00:24:11.200
and then you can put it
on the map.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.601
And you said you saw a pony
the other day.

00:24:12.601 --> 00:24:14.067
Fletcher: I did, I did see
a pony the other day.

00:24:14.067 --> 00:24:15.067
Mahe:
Where did you see it?

00:24:15.067 --> 00:24:17.067
Fletcher:
It was at Bondeye Beach.

00:24:17.067 --> 00:24:18.601
I don't know why
I was at Bondeye Beach,

00:24:18.601 --> 00:24:20.934
because I'm not a British
backpacker, but you know.

00:24:20.934 --> 00:24:23.300
Occasionally
native Sydney-siders

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.667
do actually go to Bondeye Beach,
believe it or not.

00:24:25.667 --> 00:24:27.133
Mahe: There you go,
is that where it is?

00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:28.701
Jess; Yeah, great, okay,
so this is fantastic.

00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:31.167
This is adding a row
to a spreadsheet,

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:33.634
and then we're querying
that to get the location.

00:24:33.634 --> 00:24:34.968
Mahe: Yeah, and Spreadsheets
is really easy

00:24:34.968 --> 00:24:37.100
for people to interact with,
and kind of nice,

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.467
a really simple solution.

00:24:38.467 --> 00:24:40.200
So you know,
I know you didn't like

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.501
my toilet tracker that much,

00:24:41.501 --> 00:24:43.334
so I made a better version
for you, Jess.

00:24:43.334 --> 00:24:44.334
Do you like this?
Fletcher: Oh, okay.

00:24:44.334 --> 00:24:45.801
So, what's this doing, Luke?

00:24:45.801 --> 00:24:47.434
Mahe: So this is just querying
Fusion Tables--

00:24:47.434 --> 00:24:50.067
base, username,
radius, search.

00:24:50.067 --> 00:24:51.868
And I can just say,
given this point

00:24:51.868 --> 00:24:54.734
and within this radius of this,
go query all the toilets.

00:24:54.734 --> 00:24:56.067
Fletcher:
Cool.

00:24:56.067 --> 00:24:58.501
Mahe: Pretty easy for you
when you're at the pub.

00:24:58.501 --> 00:25:00.033
Fletcher:
Fantastic.

00:25:00.033 --> 00:25:02.601
Because you know, I often
need to run off very quickly.

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:04.000
Yeah.
Fantastic.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.801
And the great thing about
Fusion Tables of course,

00:25:08.801 --> 00:25:10.133
is the geospacial query.
Mahe: Yes.

00:25:10.133 --> 00:25:11.501
You can just put
all your data up there

00:25:11.501 --> 00:25:13.734
and just query it, and then--
easy and simple.

00:25:13.734 --> 00:25:14.934
Fletcher:
Of course.

00:25:14.934 --> 00:25:16.033
Mahe: So if your sharing
is done well,

00:25:16.033 --> 00:25:17.901
the user experience rocks.
Fletcher: Cool.

00:25:17.901 --> 00:25:19.501
So let's talk a bit
about sharing

00:25:19.501 --> 00:25:21.634
and what we actually
mean by sharing.

00:25:21.634 --> 00:25:23.701
So it's not just--
so you think about sharing,

00:25:23.701 --> 00:25:26.234
you think about
sharing something

00:25:26.234 --> 00:25:28.334
that you've created
with other people.

00:25:28.334 --> 00:25:30.801
But it's also sharing
between devices as well.

00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:32.434
Mahe: With yourself.
Fletcher: Exactly.

00:25:32.434 --> 00:25:33.701
Mahe:
So if you're on the desktop,

00:25:33.701 --> 00:25:35.267
and you've done something,
and then you go,

00:25:35.267 --> 00:25:36.734
you want to share it
with your phone

00:25:36.734 --> 00:25:39.234
and go between the planning
and active stage.

00:25:39.234 --> 00:25:40.968
Fletcher:
Absolutely.

00:25:40.968 --> 00:25:43.901
Mahe: So it's then being able
to go to your website,

00:25:43.901 --> 00:25:45.534
or go to your mapping
application,

00:25:45.534 --> 00:25:47.467
interact with it,
kind of save your space,

00:25:47.467 --> 00:25:50.133
wherever you were,
and share it on Gmail

00:25:50.133 --> 00:25:52.200
or buzz or any other
social tool out there.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.501
Fletcher: And of course,
once you've done that--

00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:55.267
once you can
share it with devices,

00:25:55.267 --> 00:25:56.734
you can also share it
with other people.

00:25:56.734 --> 00:25:58.868
You know, this is about
planning as well.

00:25:58.868 --> 00:26:03.234
It's about interactive
and sharing it

00:26:03.234 --> 00:26:05.133
wherever else
you can share it.

00:26:05.133 --> 00:26:07.968
Mahe: So, here's an example
that's quite common.

00:26:07.968 --> 00:26:10.634
You were going to find
your backpackers in Sydney

00:26:10.634 --> 00:26:12.300
down at Bondeye Beach.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.400
So if you're on the desktop,
you kind of did a query.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.767
You may have just dragged it
around to go across to--

00:26:16.767 --> 00:26:18.434
Fletcher: Right, well see,
but I'm looking here.

00:26:18.434 --> 00:26:19.734
You know,
I want to change this,

00:26:19.734 --> 00:26:21.400
because this is going
by the cross-city tunnel,

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:24.234
and the cross-city tunnel
is really, really expensive.

00:26:24.234 --> 00:26:26.434
It's like, $7 to use
the cross-city tunnel.

00:26:26.434 --> 00:26:27.834
Mahe:
Which is like, $30 US now?

00:26:27.834 --> 00:26:30.834
Fletcher: Yeah I think so,
$30 or $40, something like that.

00:26:30.834 --> 00:26:33.634
So, you know, we might have
manipulated this a bit,

00:26:33.634 --> 00:26:35.300
and we want to send
the exact directions

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.968
we found
during the planning stage

00:26:36.968 --> 00:26:38.367
and send them
to our mobile device,

00:26:38.367 --> 00:26:40.000
so when we get
the active stage,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.567
we get something
like this again.

00:26:41.567 --> 00:26:42.968
Mahe:
Yeah, like this.

00:26:42.968 --> 00:26:44.868
So, as I said, you've got
your map and your content.

00:26:44.868 --> 00:26:46.801
You can kind of switch back
between the two,

00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:49.167
and it's gone
to the active phase.

00:26:49.167 --> 00:26:51.067
We can easily
change the directions.

00:26:51.067 --> 00:26:52.067
We're out in the world.

00:26:52.067 --> 00:26:53.300
We can kind of see
where we are,

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.234
but it's just going
between the two,

00:26:55.234 --> 00:26:56.334
not changing the experience,

00:26:56.334 --> 00:26:58.834
just making it better
for the devices.

00:26:58.834 --> 00:27:00.901
Fletcher:
Exactly

00:27:00.901 --> 00:27:02.334
Mahe: So we'll give
another shout-out.

00:27:02.334 --> 00:27:04.534
Fletcher: So, we were
going to talk a bit

00:27:04.534 --> 00:27:07.067
about social sharing
and things like that,

00:27:07.067 --> 00:27:09.968
but there's a much better talk
about it tomorrow afternoon.

00:27:09.968 --> 00:27:11.834
Location based
app development,

00:27:11.834 --> 00:27:14.100
and this is using the recently
announced Places API.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:15.434
Mahe:
Yeah.

00:27:15.434 --> 00:27:16.567
So that's really going to be
really interesting.

00:27:16.567 --> 00:27:18.334
Fletcher: At 3pm tomorrow.
Go check it out.

00:27:18.334 --> 00:27:20.868
Mahe: So, if map styling
is done well,

00:27:20.868 --> 00:27:22.400
the user experience rocks.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:25.033
Fletcher: Okay, and we can't
really talk about map styling,

00:27:25.033 --> 00:27:27.534
or--we could,
but we have someone way better

00:27:27.534 --> 00:27:28.667
to talk about map styling.

00:27:28.667 --> 00:27:30.734
So, we'd like to invite
Justin up here

00:27:30.734 --> 00:27:32.267
to talk about that issue.

00:27:32.267 --> 00:27:34.601
Mahe: And he's going to talk
about how styling the map well

00:27:34.601 --> 00:27:37.834
can give a great
user experience.

00:27:43.634 --> 00:27:45.901
Justin:
Good job, good job.

00:27:50.367 --> 00:27:52.534
You guys did a great job.

00:27:52.534 --> 00:27:58.734
I don't know how I'm going to
top that up here all alone.

00:27:58.734 --> 00:28:04.067
As they said,
if the controls are bad,

00:28:04.067 --> 00:28:06.334
the user experience sucks.

00:28:06.334 --> 00:28:08.868
If the sharing is bad,
if the storage is bad,

00:28:08.868 --> 00:28:12.634
if it's not responsive,
the user experience sucks.

00:28:12.634 --> 00:28:17.033
But if the styling is bad,
it's also going to suck.

00:28:17.033 --> 00:28:18.667
It's going to suck a lot.

00:28:18.667 --> 00:28:24.434
So what I want to talk about
is how to style maps,

00:28:24.434 --> 00:28:26.801
specifically if
you're styling a map

00:28:26.801 --> 00:28:29.801
for the purpose of
data overlays, a mashup,

00:28:29.801 --> 00:28:33.000
anything like that,
how you want to style it

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.567
so that your users know
what the map is about.

00:28:37.567 --> 00:28:40.467
And this, it's kind of written
as a companion piece

00:28:40.467 --> 00:28:43.434
to this post
that I wrote in October.

00:28:43.434 --> 00:28:46.300
I don't know if any of you
are familiar with it,

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.901
but I explained
different options you have

00:28:49.901 --> 00:28:52.567
with the different styling,

00:28:52.567 --> 00:28:55.634
and there are a lot of
samples here

00:28:55.634 --> 00:28:59.367
if you want ideas for styling
or if you want to know

00:28:59.367 --> 00:29:03.701
kind of what you can do,
this is a good starting point.

00:29:03.701 --> 00:29:08.801
But we're going to go ahead
and to summarize that article,

00:29:08.801 --> 00:29:11.767
there are basically three things
you can do to Google maps.

00:29:11.767 --> 00:29:14.968
You can remove things,
usually piece by piece.

00:29:14.968 --> 00:29:16.367
You can remove everything
if you want.

00:29:16.367 --> 00:29:19.968
You can remove different
select things.

00:29:19.968 --> 00:29:22.234
You can simplify
a couple of things,

00:29:22.234 --> 00:29:27.467
but that's mainly limited to
the roads and also the cities.

00:29:27.467 --> 00:29:30.567
And you can also pretty much
change the color of everything,

00:29:30.567 --> 00:29:35.501
which I don't always
recommend that you do,

00:29:35.501 --> 00:29:38.300
but you can.

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:42.200
So the goal of all
this is your data.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.734
It's not really the map.

00:29:43.734 --> 00:29:45.834
If you're overlaying data,

00:29:45.834 --> 00:29:48.100
you want your data to be front
and center.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.234
You don't want unnecessary
map elements in the way.

00:29:51.234 --> 00:29:53.367
You want to show off
your data.

00:29:53.367 --> 00:29:59.033
So I want to show some examples
of some really good mashups

00:29:59.033 --> 00:30:03.534
that the styling
was really effective

00:30:03.534 --> 00:30:06.167
at putting the data forward.

00:30:06.167 --> 00:30:10.767
These first styles
mainly removed map elements

00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:14.467
or they simplified them.

00:30:14.467 --> 00:30:19.200
So my first example is a mashup
called Map-loid.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.567
And that sounds
very strange.

00:30:21.567 --> 00:30:25.100
What that is,
is if you go to the site,

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.567
this is the number of jobs
currently available

00:30:28.567 --> 00:30:32.734
in each state, and I don't know
how they know that,

00:30:32.734 --> 00:30:36.000
but they have jobs,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.033
and it looks like Texas
has the most jobs right now,

00:30:38.033 --> 00:30:42.434
so if you're unemployed,
you might want to run there.

00:30:42.434 --> 00:30:48.200
But what's good about this
is how much they removed.

00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.534
So let's look closely
at the map,

00:30:50.534 --> 00:30:52.634
and you see the data,

00:30:52.634 --> 00:30:54.701
and you see the outlines
of the states.

00:30:54.701 --> 00:30:56.968
The whole point of this site
is just to show you

00:30:56.968 --> 00:30:59.534
how many jobs
there are in each state.

00:30:59.534 --> 00:31:03.133
So if they had left all this on,
you wouldn't--

00:31:03.133 --> 00:31:06.834
it's not as clear.

00:31:06.834 --> 00:31:08.634
They made it
much more effective,

00:31:08.634 --> 00:31:10.467
much better presentation,

00:31:10.467 --> 00:31:16.501
removing things
like cities, roads.

00:31:16.501 --> 00:31:18.968
I don't think there's park names
on that one.

00:31:18.968 --> 00:31:20.434
But it's very effective.

00:31:20.434 --> 00:31:26.934
It's much easier to read without
all that stuff on the map.

00:31:26.934 --> 00:31:31.601
Now there's-- the next example
here is this beautiful,

00:31:31.601 --> 00:31:33.801
beautiful example from
the New York Times

00:31:33.801 --> 00:31:35.734
that they did
for the 2010 census here

00:31:35.734 --> 00:31:39.300
in the United States.

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:42.434
On this map here,
this is the population change

00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:46.100
from the year 2000
to the year 2010.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.934
The blue counties are counties
that gained population,

00:31:49.934 --> 00:31:53.100
and the kind of tan counties
are counties

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.634
that lost population.

00:31:55.634 --> 00:31:58.934
Like the Map-loid mashup,

00:31:58.934 --> 00:32:02.934
they removed a significant
amount of the data on the map.

00:32:02.934 --> 00:32:06.434
Cities, roads--
all that's out of the way,

00:32:06.434 --> 00:32:10.133
so you can get a great picture
of the data.

00:32:10.133 --> 00:32:12.467
The data is front and center,
and that's what you see.

00:32:12.467 --> 00:32:18.000
There's nothing getting
in the way of it.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.767
If you zoom in,
still the data.

00:32:20.767 --> 00:32:24.968
It looks beautiful,
nothing really in the way.

00:32:24.968 --> 00:32:26.868
And then,
as you keep zooming in,

00:32:26.868 --> 00:32:28.701
cities are added
for reference points,

00:32:28.701 --> 00:32:32.868
but there's no highways because
who's going to be using this

00:32:32.868 --> 00:32:35.801
to find driving directions
to Grandma's house?

00:32:35.801 --> 00:32:38.968
No one. This is a map of
population change,

00:32:38.968 --> 00:32:43.534
so you don't need that.
It's really beautiful.

00:32:43.534 --> 00:32:46.234
You zoom in a little more,
roads show up,

00:32:46.234 --> 00:32:47.934
but they're simplified.

00:32:47.934 --> 00:32:52.300
These are the simplified roads;
they don't have casings.

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.634
There's no signage
for the roads,

00:32:53.634 --> 00:32:56.267
there's no highway shields,
there's no text.

00:32:56.267 --> 00:33:01.834
It's all very plain, so that
the data can come forward.

00:33:01.834 --> 00:33:06.367
Here side by side, what Google
maps normally looks like,

00:33:06.367 --> 00:33:07.934
and what
their mashup looks like,

00:33:07.934 --> 00:33:13.200
and you can kind of see
all that they took off.

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:16.133
It's really stunning.

00:33:16.133 --> 00:33:20.267
Data's just front and center.

00:33:20.267 --> 00:33:23.534
Now one more mashup
I want to show you,

00:33:23.534 --> 00:33:25.434
and this is the prettiest one.

00:33:25.434 --> 00:33:29.300
This is-- it's
Trulia's price reduction map.

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:33.334
It's real estate prices,
and how quickly they fell.

00:33:33.334 --> 00:33:36.434
And with this,
they removed everything,

00:33:36.434 --> 00:33:38.100
everything except
the state boundaries

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.100
and the lakes and oceans,
and it is gorgeous.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:45.834
It's a really pretty map.

00:33:45.834 --> 00:33:47.200
The data's just
front-and-center.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:50.067
It leaves a very memorable,
compelling impact

00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:53.100
on anybody who sees it.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:57.167
And instead of having city names
or anything like that on here,

00:33:57.167 --> 00:33:59.901
it's just divided
into zip code tracks,

00:33:59.901 --> 00:34:03.434
and you simply hover over,
and you can see the information,

00:34:03.434 --> 00:34:04.968
you can locate your city.

00:34:04.968 --> 00:34:07.634
And they've also put
a search dialogue up there

00:34:07.634 --> 00:34:10.901
that you can use to jump
to a certain city.

00:34:10.901 --> 00:34:16.534
But this is really beautiful,
really compelling.

00:34:16.534 --> 00:34:19.501
Now let's talk a little bit
about changing colors,

00:34:19.501 --> 00:34:22.868
which this is very easy
to abuse,

00:34:22.868 --> 00:34:28.968
but I'm going to show you some
masterful examples of this.

00:34:28.968 --> 00:34:31.467
The first one I want to show you
is also from the New York Times.

00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:36.200
They seem to have a really good
graphic department over there.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:43.200
This one is regarding ethnicity
populations within urban areas.

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:46.033
Or actually, I think
it's of the whole US.

00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:48.934
The dots on the map,
the different color dots,

00:34:48.934 --> 00:34:51.367
signify the different
ethnicities,

00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:54.033
and they have muted
everything on this map,

00:34:54.033 --> 00:34:58.267
so that the only color you see,
other than the water of course,

00:34:58.267 --> 00:35:00.901
are the ethnicities.
You don't see anything here.

00:35:00.901 --> 00:35:03.501
You don't see parks;
you don't see anything of color.

00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:05.634
The roads aren't colored,
nothing.

00:35:05.634 --> 00:35:09.267
You see the data.
It's very clear.

00:35:09.267 --> 00:35:12.200
Easy to make patterns,
easy to browse.

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.300
It's really beautiful.

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:20.634
One more shot, and the impact
that it has is just amazing.

00:35:20.634 --> 00:35:23.501
if they had colored the roads,
you wouldn't see--

00:35:23.501 --> 00:35:27.968
the data would not stand out
as much.

00:35:27.968 --> 00:35:32.934
One more example,
and all the gray,

00:35:32.934 --> 00:35:36.901
it really works well.

00:35:36.901 --> 00:35:39.400
This is a different mashup.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.033
This is from
the Wall Street Journal.

00:35:42.033 --> 00:35:44.167
This is their guide
to the New York marathon,

00:35:44.167 --> 00:35:46.934
and it was also a guide
to the San Francisco, Chicago,

00:35:46.934 --> 00:35:49.334
and Boston marathons.

00:35:49.334 --> 00:35:53.501
What they did here
is they took the roads

00:35:53.501 --> 00:35:57.667
and they made them all white
so that the path of the marathon

00:35:57.667 --> 00:35:59.934
is incredibly clear here.

00:35:59.934 --> 00:36:02.267
You see the whole path.

00:36:02.267 --> 00:36:05.868
There's nothing
competing with it.

00:36:05.868 --> 00:36:09.067
Here's their map of
the San Francisco marathon.

00:36:09.067 --> 00:36:11.000
And it's just--
there's nothing there,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.300
getting in the way.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:16.234
You see really clearly
where the path of this is.

00:36:16.234 --> 00:36:19.467
Really well done.

00:36:19.467 --> 00:36:22.934
Now, this technique
is very widespread.

00:36:22.934 --> 00:36:26.934
Google uses it
in their own bicycle maps.

00:36:26.934 --> 00:36:30.901
When you turn the bicycle layer
on, all the roads turn white,

00:36:30.901 --> 00:36:34.167
and the bike paths and trails
are overlaid in green.

00:36:34.167 --> 00:36:36.434
It allows you to see
very clearly

00:36:36.434 --> 00:36:38.968
where all the bicycle paths are.

00:36:38.968 --> 00:36:42.234
If you're making a mashup
of any kind of trail,

00:36:42.234 --> 00:36:45.834
any kind of route,
anything like that,

00:36:45.834 --> 00:36:47.367
consider making the roads--

00:36:47.367 --> 00:36:53.334
if your mashup isn't important
for automobile navigation--

00:36:53.334 --> 00:36:56.534
consider making the roads
all white,

00:36:56.534 --> 00:37:01.400
because the impact
is really good.

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:03.801
I want to share with you
just a couple of tips

00:37:03.801 --> 00:37:07.601
that may help improve some
mashups you may be working on,

00:37:07.601 --> 00:37:11.334
or may be working on
in the future.

00:37:11.334 --> 00:37:17.267
The first tip is don't be afraid
to take stuff off the map.

00:37:17.267 --> 00:37:20.267
I'm serious about this.
Don't be afraid to.

00:37:20.267 --> 00:37:23.367
Case in point:
this mashup here.

00:37:23.367 --> 00:37:26.534
I ran into this mashup for
the first time the other day.

00:37:26.534 --> 00:37:31.534
It's a weather mashup,
and what it's doing here

00:37:31.534 --> 00:37:36.968
is there are little boxes there

00:37:36.968 --> 00:37:39.634
with temperature numbers
in them.

00:37:39.634 --> 00:37:42.901
But it's very hard
when you look at this

00:37:42.901 --> 00:37:46.133
to see the temperature numbers
because the route numbers on.

00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:48.200
And you see
the route numbers,

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.901
and it competes with
the temperature numbers.

00:37:49.901 --> 00:37:52.300
You can't really
glance at this map

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.701
and see the temperatures
without also seeing the roads.

00:37:54.701 --> 00:37:56.400
There's all these numbers
on here

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.834
kind of looking you in the face,
and you've got to really discern

00:37:59.834 --> 00:38:02.434
what's a temperature
and what's a route number.

00:38:02.434 --> 00:38:04.834
Don't be afraid to take stuff
off the map.

00:38:04.834 --> 00:38:07.300
I don't think anybody's going
to be using this temperature map

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.501
to find their way home
or to find directions

00:38:10.501 --> 00:38:16.067
to Google IO in San Francisco
or anything remotely like that.

00:38:16.067 --> 00:38:21.701
Another example
from the same site is these--

00:38:21.701 --> 00:38:23.200
I don't know
if you can even see them.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.567
They're these
white labels.

00:38:24.567 --> 00:38:28.634
They made the labels for
the parks on this map white,

00:38:28.634 --> 00:38:32.434
which I thought was
a very unusual decision.

00:38:32.434 --> 00:38:35.534
You can barely read it,
and I just wonder

00:38:35.534 --> 00:38:37.067
instead of making them
white like that,

00:38:37.067 --> 00:38:39.367
why not just
take the parks off?

00:38:39.367 --> 00:38:41.634
I mean,
it's a weather map.

00:38:41.634 --> 00:38:43.367
I don't know how important
the parks would be.

00:38:43.367 --> 00:38:44.968
I mean, obviously cities
should be left on,

00:38:44.968 --> 00:38:50.834
but the parks, I don't know.
Very hard to read.

00:38:50.834 --> 00:38:53.868
However, one point
I want to make with this

00:38:53.868 --> 00:38:58.133
is don't hesitate
to remove the maps' roads

00:38:58.133 --> 00:39:01.334
if your mashup has nothing
to do with navigation.

00:39:01.334 --> 00:39:05.634
The roads always seem to set
kind of the color for the map.

00:39:05.634 --> 00:39:06.868
If the roads are red,

00:39:06.868 --> 00:39:08.901
your map will kind of look pink
from far away.

00:39:08.901 --> 00:39:10.400
If your roads
are yellow or orange,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.767
your map will kind of
look yellow from far away,

00:39:12.767 --> 00:39:15.100
and that will compete
with your data,

00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:19.934
especially depending
on what color it is.

00:39:19.934 --> 00:39:22.767
Here's a good example,
here.

00:39:22.767 --> 00:39:28.100
This map has clearly no roads,
and it doesn't need them.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.968
It's simply for showing
employment information,

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:33.701
or the number of jobs
in all these states.

00:39:33.701 --> 00:39:36.601
That was a good decision
to leave them off.

00:39:36.601 --> 00:39:39.200
But you have to be
very careful.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.434
These are examples
that I'm going to show you

00:39:41.434 --> 00:39:43.334
of things that I've
actually seen in the wild,

00:39:43.334 --> 00:39:47.033
which is very perplexing.

00:39:47.033 --> 00:39:53.033
Here's the first one.

00:39:53.033 --> 00:39:55.767
Yeah.

00:39:55.767 --> 00:40:01.400
And there was data on top
of here, so kind of confusing.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.434
Let's go to another one.

00:40:04.434 --> 00:40:06.067
I guess you're supposed
to find the cities

00:40:06.067 --> 00:40:08.267
based on how big
the dots are.

00:40:08.267 --> 00:40:09.334
I mean, I can kind of tell

00:40:09.334 --> 00:40:11.734
where Sacramento
and San Francisco are,

00:40:11.734 --> 00:40:15.767
but this was a hard one
to follow.

00:40:15.767 --> 00:40:17.300
I can't remember
what data they had on it,

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:21.000
but it was--
I don't know.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.367
I've seen this
quite a few times.

00:40:35.968 --> 00:40:41.601
I don't know.
Maybe there was a reason.

00:40:41.601 --> 00:40:42.701
This one, too.

00:40:42.701 --> 00:40:49.901
I think this one
I've seen the most.

00:40:49.901 --> 00:40:54.467
So this, by the way,
this is what not to do.

00:40:54.467 --> 00:41:00.901
Just so you users
can understand your map.

00:41:00.901 --> 00:41:03.968
Another thing that I want
to encourage you to do

00:41:03.968 --> 00:41:08.434
is to sketch out your ideas.

00:41:08.434 --> 00:41:10.901
It helps me a lot, you know.

00:41:10.901 --> 00:41:13.367
Play with it.
Play around with your ideas.

00:41:13.367 --> 00:41:16.033
This is a good tool
for doing that.

00:41:16.033 --> 00:41:17.801
I don't know how many of you
are familiar with this,

00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:21.100
but you can manipulate
the little map there,

00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.400
change all sorts of things.

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.634
You could take everything off,
change the colors.

00:41:25.634 --> 00:41:28.968
There's also another tool
that I like to use.

00:41:28.968 --> 00:41:31.467
This one allows you to do it
full-screen.

00:41:31.467 --> 00:41:33.367
If you want to see what the map
would look like

00:41:33.367 --> 00:41:34.400
taking up the whole screen,

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.534
this is actually
a good solution.

00:41:36.534 --> 00:41:42.267
This is scribblemaps.com.,
and you'll be--

00:41:42.267 --> 00:41:44.000
as soon as you land
on this site,

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.868
you'll see this dialogue box
right there.

00:41:46.868 --> 00:41:49.000
You press on the style map,
and there'll be a dialogue.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.200
You can basically do anything
with the map.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:54.467
Take everything off;
put everything on;

00:41:54.467 --> 00:41:58.267
make all the roads
look like Skittles.

00:41:58.267 --> 00:42:00.968
Whatever you want to do.

00:42:00.968 --> 00:42:03.534
And with that I'm going to
invite the other two gentlemen

00:42:03.534 --> 00:42:05.534
to come back up.

00:42:05.534 --> 00:42:10.667
We'll answer whatever questions
you have.

00:42:10.667 --> 00:42:18.267
Thanks.
Thanks for coming.

00:42:18.267 --> 00:42:20.701
Mahe: So if you have questions,
just come to the mike.

00:42:20.701 --> 00:42:22.267
Yes, we have one in back.

00:42:22.267 --> 00:42:23.968
man: Where would you guys
fit tablets

00:42:23.968 --> 00:42:26.968
into the desktop/mobile
paradigm?

00:42:26.968 --> 00:42:29.501
Mahe: The question is,
where would we fit tablets

00:42:29.501 --> 00:42:31.367
into the
desktop/mobile area?

00:42:31.367 --> 00:42:32.934
Fletcher: That's a really
interesting question,

00:42:32.934 --> 00:42:34.501
because you've got
more screen real estate,

00:42:34.501 --> 00:42:37.667
but you don't necessarily
have the processing power,

00:42:37.667 --> 00:42:42.734
the bandwidth, so you've got
to make those decisions

00:42:42.734 --> 00:42:44.634
side by side,
on a case-by-case basis.

00:42:44.634 --> 00:42:46.200
Mahe: I think
it's about your app.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:49.467
If you're doing something
that's more mobile-ish,

00:42:49.467 --> 00:42:50.701
like someone's got something

00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.033
where I'm going to be
out in the world,

00:42:52.033 --> 00:42:55.334
and you try and aim more
toward the mobile experience.

00:42:55.334 --> 00:42:56.968
But if you're doing more
searching or planning

00:42:56.968 --> 00:42:59.033
sort of stuff, you might try
to be able to shift

00:42:59.033 --> 00:43:00.367
all the data
all over the place.

00:43:00.367 --> 00:43:02.067
Fletcher: Another key point
to remember

00:43:02.067 --> 00:43:05.601
is to not necessarily think
of this as a dichotomous thing.

00:43:05.601 --> 00:43:08.734
Don't necessarily think of it
being desktop versus mobile,

00:43:08.734 --> 00:43:12.601
because then as you say, where
does a tablet fit into this?

00:43:12.601 --> 00:43:15.000
Think about it in terms of
the capabilities of the device

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.234
that the user
is viewing it on.

00:43:18.234 --> 00:43:23.701
man:
Thank you.

00:43:23.701 --> 00:43:25.601
man: Hi. Actually,
is there anything planned

00:43:25.601 --> 00:43:31.400
for speed improvements
in terms of local caching for--

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.334
or, actually
there's a second question.

00:43:33.334 --> 00:43:37.834
What is being done by you guys
in terms of vector-based

00:43:37.834 --> 00:43:40.667
rendering of the map tiles,
or text on the map?

00:43:40.667 --> 00:43:41.901
Mahe: The question is
what are we doing

00:43:41.901 --> 00:43:44.234
about vector-based map tiles
in the API?

00:43:44.234 --> 00:43:46.067
Fletcher: And the answer
is we can't comment

00:43:46.067 --> 00:43:50.934
on any future plans or anything
like that, I'm afraid.

00:43:50.934 --> 00:43:53.834
So I'm sorry
that's a non-answer.

00:43:53.834 --> 00:43:54.901
Justin: It's a good question
though.

00:43:54.901 --> 00:43:56.968
Mahe: It is a good question.
Yes.

00:43:56.968 --> 00:44:01.868
woman: I thought
I saw some 3D mapping

00:44:01.868 --> 00:44:05.300
in the honeycomb demos
where a certain gesture

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:08.834
would open up
a different type of map.

00:44:08.834 --> 00:44:11.200
Could you comment on that,

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:16.934
and if that's available
for a desktop display?

00:44:16.934 --> 00:44:20.467
Mahe: Not--
so the question was,

00:44:20.467 --> 00:44:24.300
on the honeycomb tablet that
you've got the new maps with,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.300
it's all threaded,
and you can spin around

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.801
and use gestures
and that sort of thing.

00:44:27.801 --> 00:44:31.067
That won't be as part
of the API--

00:44:31.067 --> 00:44:33.200
it's not delivered at the moment
as part of the API

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.501
sort of thing.

00:44:34.501 --> 00:44:37.434
It kind of relates
to the vector style of maps,

00:44:37.434 --> 00:44:39.734
and I don't think you can
at the moment

00:44:39.734 --> 00:44:44.067
incorporate that mapping
into a native application

00:44:44.067 --> 00:44:49.067
on the Android.

00:44:49.067 --> 00:44:50.601
Yes, on desktop.

00:44:50.601 --> 00:44:52.634
Well, that's part of the API
and those sorts of things,

00:44:52.634 --> 00:44:57.167
and the answer is not yet.
Fletcher: Not at the moment.

00:44:57.167 --> 00:45:00.200
man: When adding different types
of layers such as KML

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.267
and other types of
custom overlays,

00:45:02.267 --> 00:45:07.234
you can't change the zed index
or whatever of the KML

00:45:07.234 --> 00:45:09.701
to put it underneath
your other layers,

00:45:09.701 --> 00:45:12.701
causing quite a big issue
if you want to have

00:45:12.701 --> 00:45:15.234
a mashup of different
types of data.

00:45:15.234 --> 00:45:17.234
Is that something you guys
are planning on fixing,

00:45:17.234 --> 00:45:20.367
and one other small thing.

00:45:20.367 --> 00:45:22.467
Are you planning on sorting--
at the moment,

00:45:22.467 --> 00:45:27.701
KML behaves very differently
in Google Earth to on the Maps.

00:45:27.701 --> 00:45:30.367
You lose a lot of functionality,
and in fact I've had--

00:45:30.367 --> 00:45:31.868
we've had to pull it
from our site,

00:45:31.868 --> 00:45:34.567
because it was
actually quite buggy

00:45:34.567 --> 00:45:37.534
in terms of displaying
a large set of polygon data,

00:45:37.534 --> 00:45:38.834
and you would click
on one polygon

00:45:38.834 --> 00:45:42.667
and it would actually show data
for the other polygon.

00:45:42.667 --> 00:45:46.434
Mahe: You want to repeat
the question.

00:45:46.434 --> 00:45:47.767
Fletcher: So let me
get that right.

00:45:47.767 --> 00:45:49.267
So there's two parts
to the question.

00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:53.868
The first part was whether
it's possible to reorder

00:45:53.868 --> 00:45:56.868
the layering that's done
through KML for example,

00:45:56.868 --> 00:45:59.601
right down to the bottom.
Mahe: I'm not 100% sure.

00:45:59.601 --> 00:46:00.701
If you'll see me after,

00:46:00.701 --> 00:46:03.000
we'll be able to
find out for you.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.567
Fletcher: And the second part
of the question was about--

00:46:05.567 --> 00:46:08.167
Mahe: KML differences
between API and Earth.

00:46:08.167 --> 00:46:09.300
Fletcher:
Ah, yes.

00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:13.033
So KML was obviously
written for Earth,

00:46:13.033 --> 00:46:17.033
and we only support a subset
of the features for it.

00:46:17.033 --> 00:46:18.434
It doesn't really make sense

00:46:18.434 --> 00:46:21.267
for most of the mapping
applications

00:46:21.267 --> 00:46:24.968
to support the full subset,
because it just includes things

00:46:24.968 --> 00:46:27.601
that don't make sense
on a two-dimensional map,

00:46:27.601 --> 00:46:30.200
but that being said,
who knows?

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.734
We can't really comment
on future things

00:46:31.734 --> 00:46:33.000
that might be coming up.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.467
Mahe: I mean, if there's
anything in particular,

00:46:34.467 --> 00:46:36.300
you can file a feature request,
or bug about specific bugs,

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:38.033
and then we can look at that.

00:46:38.033 --> 00:46:39.200
Fletcher: And that's
a really good point

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.300
to bring up to the group.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.033
If you have questions,
if you have feature requests,

00:46:45.033 --> 00:46:46.434
file them with the group,

00:46:46.434 --> 00:46:49.934
and that's where we sort
of look at things to do next.

00:46:49.934 --> 00:46:52.767
Mahe:
Yeah.

00:46:52.767 --> 00:46:53.934
Fletcher:
I think that's it.

00:46:53.934 --> 00:46:55.701
Any other questions?
Mahe: Cool. Thank you.

00:46:55.701 --> 00:46:58.067
Fletcher:
Okay, great. Thanks.

00:46:58.067 --> 00:46:59.601
Justin:
Thank you.
