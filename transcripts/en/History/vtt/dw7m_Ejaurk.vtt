00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.544
- Eleanor Roosevelt
had an active

00:00:02.544 --> 00:00:04.337
political career
in her own right.

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:06.256
She pushed the boundaries
of what it meant

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:07.924
to be a First Lady.

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:10.844
(upbeat music)

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:13.763
- Eleanor Roosevelt came from

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:16.224
a New York aristocratic family.

00:00:16.224 --> 00:00:18.393
Her father was Teddy
Roosevelt's brother.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.687
She meets Franklin Roosevelt.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.106
They get married in 1905.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.024
Franklin Roosevelt
is her fifth cousin.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.944
She gave birth to six children.

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:32.365
In 1918, she discovers her
husband is having an affair

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:35.618
and that is when
childbearing and marital

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.203
intimacy come to an end.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:38.955
- She lived a separate life.

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:41.207
He lived a separate life
but the relationship

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:42.625
with her husband
evolved where they were

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:44.961
well and truly partners.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.297
- Eleanor Roosevelt
really innovated

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:50.425
the First Lady's role as
a public communicator.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:53.303
- She wrote thousands
of columns, 27 books.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:56.890
She participated in
hundreds of radio shows.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.141
- When she came into
the White House,

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:00.560
one of the first things
she did was to establish

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.562
women-only press conferences.

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.105
So all the reporters
who covered her

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:05.648
who came to the White
House were female.

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:08.943
- She would give them tidbits
about White House life

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:11.905
that the male press
corps wasn't getting.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.325
It saved a lot of
newspaper women's jobs.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:19.078
- During World War II she
traveled to the front lines

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:22.665
in Europe and in the
Pacific to support soldiers.

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.835
- She met with
servicemen in hospitals,

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:29.130
took notes and even
contacted their families.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.840
There were some
individuals that thought

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.176
that she should stay at
home and be the hostess

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:34.260
and nothing else.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.595
That was not her.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.933
- Eleanor Roosevelt's
biggest accomplishments

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:42.018
were the public
stances that she took,

00:01:42.018 --> 00:01:44.020
especially about civil rights.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.023
She went to Alabama
for a conference.

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:49.108
She requested a
chair of her own,

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:53.488
placed it squarely between
the aisle for whites

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:55.156
and the aisle for blacks.

00:01:55.156 --> 00:01:59.160
It was a very visible
way to take a stand

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.497
in opposition to the Jim
Crow laws in the South.

00:02:02.497 --> 00:02:04.958
- The work that she
did for equality

00:02:04.958 --> 00:02:08.545
continued after she was
no longer First Lady.

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:12.298
- Harry Truman appointed
her as delegate

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:16.386
to the United Nations and she
was absolutely instrumental

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:20.640
in drafting the U.N.
Declaration of Human Rights,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.227
which still informs human
rights around the world today.
