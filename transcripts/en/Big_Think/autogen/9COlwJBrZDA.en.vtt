people of color anywhere else in the
country at that time so it was a very

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280
country at that time so it was a very
 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.570

relations and you know I've described it

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889
relations and you know I've described it
 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.440
relations and you know I've described it
as being both of the most races in the

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450
as being both of the most races in the
 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.300
as being both of the most races in the
least racist place I've ever been and

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310
least racist place I've ever been and
 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.290
least racist place I've ever been and
and I think that is true in my

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300
and I think that is true in my
 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.870
and I think that is true in my
experience I've certainly found a kind

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880
experience I've certainly found a kind
 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.360
experience I've certainly found a kind
of deeper and crueler racism in other

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370
of deeper and crueler racism in other
 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.790
of deeper and crueler racism in other
parts of the country just because people

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800
parts of the country just because people
 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.219
parts of the country just because people
don't you know they never see a person

don't you know they never see a person
 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:30.270
don't you know they never see a person
of color and when they do it's this it's

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280
of color and when they do it's this it's
 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.490
of color and when they do it's this it's
it's something special it's not it's not
