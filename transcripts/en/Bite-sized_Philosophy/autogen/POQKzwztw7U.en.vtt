that's the thing is that this order is

there's progress in moral order and and

there's progress in moral order and and
it<00:00:58.980><c> was</c><00:00:59.100><c> defined</c><00:00:59.460><c> properly</c><00:01:00.239><c> by</c><00:01:00.390><c> Piaget</c><00:01:00.719><c> the</c>

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 align:start position:0%
what's the ultimate in order well it's
 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.910 align:start position:0%
what's the ultimate in order well it's
not<00:01:20.159><c> this</c><00:01:20.430><c> obviously</c><00:01:21.590><c> because</c><00:01:22.590><c> it</c><00:01:22.740><c> can</c>

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
not this obviously because it can
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.420 align:start position:0%
not this obviously because it can
collapse<00:01:23.189><c> and</c><00:01:23.610><c> it's</c><00:01:24.540><c> not</c><00:01:24.720><c> this</c><00:01:25.159><c> because</c><00:01:26.159><c> it</c>

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 align:start position:0%
collapse and it's not this because it
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.370 align:start position:0%
collapse and it's not this because it
can<00:01:26.610><c> collapse</c><00:01:26.880><c> and</c><00:01:27.270><c> so</c><00:01:27.750><c> then</c><00:01:27.900><c> you</c><00:01:28.020><c> think</c><00:01:28.229><c> well</c>

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
can collapse and so then you think well
 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.719 align:start position:0%
can collapse and so then you think well
there's<00:01:28.560><c> no</c><00:01:28.710><c> ultimate</c><00:01:29.159><c> order</c><00:01:29.340><c> even</c><00:01:29.579><c> though</c>

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 align:start position:0%
there's progression but then you have to
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.370 align:start position:0%
there's progression but then you have to
move<00:01:32.040><c> it</c><00:01:32.159><c> up</c><00:01:32.250><c> one</c><00:01:32.280><c> level</c><00:01:32.670><c> of</c><00:01:32.850><c> abstraction</c>
