00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.780
The San Francisco Bay Area is home to more than 7 million people.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.720
Nearly a half million of them are undocumented immigrants.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.420
It’s also home to several sanctuary cities,

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.540
which are meant to be safer places for undocumented people to live.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.380
And that’s caught the eye of the federal government.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.180
California better hold on tight. They’re about to see a lot more special agents,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.260
a lot more deportation officers in the state of California.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.240
President Trump is ramping up ICE raids and threatening to withhold federal funding from cities that don't

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.520
cooperate with ICE. In the face of these
threats, officials from sanctuary cities

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.760
like San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose
say they'll still protect undocumented immigrants.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.340
At a time when local
officials are defying the federal

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.220
government, just how safe is a sanctuary
city under Trump?

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.800
At the start of this year, California
became the first sanctuary state in the

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.670
country when it enacted a law to
drastically limit state and local law

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.960
enforcement's cooperation with ICE. And here in Oakland, the City Council took things a step further.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.340
In January, they
passed a unanimous resolution banning

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.460
police from cooperating when ICE is trying to arrest and detain undocumented immigrants.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.500
The move came not long after
the Oakland Police Department received

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.720
backlash for an August 2017 raid in
which they provided traffic support for ICE.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.340
Now, cooperation with immigration
officials in civil and criminal cases is

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.200
prohibited in Oakland. That's the first
time this has ever happened in a U.S. city.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.360
Oakland's mayor, Libby Schaaf, has even

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.960
said she'd go to jail to protect immigrants.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.720
So you're ready to go to jail over this?

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.920
Yes. We are here to protect all of our residents, regardless of where they came from.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.480
The issue of sanctuary
cities is polarizing, thanks in part to

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.780
Trump's repeated claims that they're
unsafe and hotbeds of crime. He's pointed

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.979
to a high-profile San Francisco case in
which an undocumented man was charged –

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.760
and later acquitted – in the shooting
death of Katie Steinle right here on this pier.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.340
But the data shows that
sanctuary cities are actually safer, with

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.959
significantly lower crime. On average,
there are 35.5 fewer crimes committed

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.420
per 10,000 people in sanctuary counties
compared to non-sanctuary counties.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.780
Undocumented immigrants in the Bay Area are still getting deported, even from sanctuary cities.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.560
Although they are safer jurisdictions, whether you get

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.400
turned over to ICE often comes down to
decisions made by local police.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.420
Take the case of Pedro Figueroa-Zarceno. He's an undocumented man from El Salvador who

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.459
was turned over to ICE after coming to
this local police station to report a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.840
stolen car. He then sued the city for violating its own sanctuary laws, and won a settlement.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.940
But despite his legal victory, Pedro's still in deportation

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.060
proceedings. And although his settlement was surprising, how police handled the case is not.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.430
Say you get pulled over for
a busted taillight or an unpaid traffic

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.720
ticket. If police take you in, your name
and fingerprints are automatically

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.660
entered into the system. If you're undocumented, ICE gets alerted.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.300
Police can then hold you
for up to 48 hours, which is enough time

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.660
for ICE to come get you. Or they could
choose to let you go.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.540
Since Trump took office, the number of undocumented people without criminal convictions who are

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.160
arrested by ICE nearly tripled compared to 2016.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:24.340
Meanwhile, California's not only trying to shield 2.3 million people as a sanctuary state, it's also proposed

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.840
extending health care and financial aid
to the undocumented.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.920
Attorney General Jeff Sessions called California's new sanctuary state status "unconscionable."

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.760
And Trump threatened to cut the state's federal grant money, which the Democrats called "blackmail."

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.260
California is technically the sixth biggest economy in the world,

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.000
but that doesn't mean it can afford to lose federal help.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.260
So, in August of 2017, state and San Francisco city officials sued the Trump administration, claiming

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.220
the president's threats to withhold funding were unconstitutional and violated residents' rights.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.020
A federal judge agreed and blocked
Trump's attempts, for now.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:04.240
But despite all the efforts being taken by California, and specifically the Bay Area,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.100
to protect undocumented people, they still can't stop ICE from conducting raids or deporting people.

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.160
Already this year, we've
seen major sweeps of businesses in

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.560
Northern California – the largest such
workplace raids since Trump took office.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.460
And ICE acting director Thomas Holman
has called for a "400 percent increase" in

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.920
workplace raids, making it clear that even sanctuary cities aren't safe.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.960
California has shown it isn't backing down from its sanctuary fight with the federal government.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.900
But for the people whose lives are at stake, the fear has

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.140
intensified as they wait to see how much
sanctuary they'll actually receive.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.020
Hey guys, it's Dena. We've done a lot of reporting on immigration this season.
