00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.100
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, there's been a lot of discussion
here about the Middle

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.749
East.
I was on the panel on the balance of power

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:10.250
in the Middle East yesterday
because one of the world's most retractible

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.630
problems is the conflict
between Israelis and Palestinians that's went

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.930
on for such a long time.
So there is a lot of discussion here about

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.910
what to do about that
because the Palestinian Prime Minister, Mr.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.410
Fayyad, the Prime Minister
of Jordan, the King of Jordan is coming here.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.970
And we are really looking in the coming year
for some new impetus

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.710
behind the Middle East peace process.
President Obama really put some effort behind

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.840
that in 2009, it hasn't
borne a lot of fruit yet.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.290
So we really need an incoming British government,
whoever wins the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.290
general election in a few months time, also
needs to put some new

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.540
momentum behind that process.
Not so much there are new ideas here; there

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.330
aren't really any new ideas
in Middle East peace matters.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.700
It's how to get agreement on Israelis and
Palestinians discussing

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.780
things properly together again.
