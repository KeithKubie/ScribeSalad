DOUG KRAFT: So I
invite you to imagine

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.440
a pretty human ancestor-- furry,
lemur-like creature living

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.040
furtively in the
primordial forest.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.500
And so he's walking
through the forest.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.490
And he sees
something attractive.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.780
Maybe it's some food or a
potential sexual partner.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.780
And there is this wired instinct
that draws all his attention

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.950
right down to that object,
whatever it is, and prepares

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.745
his body to move towards it.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.280
And then he notices something
that's uncomfortable.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.750
Maybe it's a large predator.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.580
And the same instinct
draws all his attention

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.930
right down to that beast,
blots out everything else,

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.830
and prepares his body
to get out of there.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.140
So this instinct gives him an
obvious evolutionary advantage.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.630
To be effective, it
has to be very fast.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.840
And to be fast, it
has to be simple.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.750
And to be simple, it
doesn't figure out

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.660
what to do about the food,
or the mate, or the predator.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.610
It just says, this is good.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.940
Figure it out.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.990
This is bad.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.610
Figure it out.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.820
And you'll notice that
the instinct directs

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.130
all its attention out
there into the world

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.670
to whatever is going on
there, rather than inside

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.420
and how it feels about it.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.680
And if you think
about it a little bit,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.230
it makes lot of sense.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.450
If he just got really
caught up-- oh, that lady.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.810
She's hot.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.220
I feel so lovely inside.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.860
I feel light and joyful.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.950
Oh, it's so wonderful.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.690
He gets all caught
up in how he feels,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.449
she's likely to move on
before his DNA gets a chance

00:01:55.449 --> 00:01:55.990
to reproduce.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.990
And if he gets all caught
up in oh that ugly beast.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.870
I was having such a good day.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.110
And now I just feel my
stomach's all tied in knots.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.000
And I don't like to
have sweaty palms.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.630
If he gets all tied up in how
it feels to be so frightened,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.385
he and his DNA are much
more likely to get eaten.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.920
So this instinct is the
opposite of introspection.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.510
Puts all our attention out
there, rather than in here.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.960
We humans have such an instinct.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.560
I don't have scientific data
as to its evolutionary origins.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.060
But it certainly behaves as if
these speculations are true.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.360
It is fast.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.650
It is simple.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.990
It is pre-cognitive,
it's pre-verbal.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.080
And it focuses
all our attention.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.080
It just narrows our
attention down to one

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.470
object out there,
whatever that is.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.210
We have lots and lots of
names for this instinct.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.870
Desire.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.150
Attraction.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.030
Attachment.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.870
Fixation.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.070
Disliking.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.010
Revulsion.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.680
Disgust.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.280
Fear.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.083
Anger.

00:03:09.083 --> 00:03:09.583
Uptightness.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.890
It's the feeling that gives
rise to the thought I like it.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.140
I don't like that.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.400
I want more.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.010
Get me out of here.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.100
But the instinct
itself is pre-verbal.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.170
I can't say this enough.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.340
It is pre-verbal.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.890
It is pre-cognitive, and
arises so quickly inside us

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.190
that we don't have
any control over it.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.560
It just comes in uninvited.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.070
So perhaps a better term
for it is getting hooked,

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:46.900
or even the devil made me do it.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.830
In Tibet, the word for
it is shempa, or shempa.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.800
If any of you are
familiar with any

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.070
of the writings of
Pema Chodron, you

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.720
may have come across this term.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.615
But in the earliest Buddhist
text it is called tanha.

00:04:06.615 --> 00:04:10.080
T-A-N-H-A. Tanha.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.290
Tanha is the so-called second
of four ennobling truths

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.029
of the Buddha, which says that
our experience of difficulty--

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.230
not necessarily the
stimulus for it--

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.830
but the roots of our
experience of difficulty

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.180
inside is this instinctual type.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.470
And the third
ennobling truth says

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.245
that we can release it
and relax regardless

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:40.120
of our circumstances.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.490
I'm a bit of a
Buddhist geek, so I

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.720
could go into all kinds
of technical detail.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.190
But what I would like
to do this afternoon

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.830
is come at this in
a little broader,

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.590
for a more practical
frame of reference.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.280
I want to reflect with
you around this question--

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.380
how can we thrive
during difficult times?

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.680
It's not how do we survive.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.900
How do we manage.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.630
How do we get by.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:17.900
How do we stumble through.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.400
No.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.460
It's how do we-- are there
ways that we can actually

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.860
thrive during difficult times?

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:32.490
Are there ways in which we
can navigate rough waters

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.700
and still have our lives
feel deep and enriched,

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.150
and our hearts feel open?

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.540
And I think the key to answering
that question is actually

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.900
tanha, this
instinctual tightening.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.210
But the sense it focuses
all our attention

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.790
out there in the world,
it is surprisingly

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.910
elusive, surprisingly
difficult to see

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.910
in our everyday experience.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:03.100
So I want to start today by
spending some time talking

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.590
about just how to recognize
it in our daily experience.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:09.034
And then we'll
take a little time

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:11.450
at looking at what are some
of the things that trigger it,

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.070
and bring it forth in us.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.040
And then that will
set the stage for us

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.380
to look at this-- the
more crucial question.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.750
How do we release
it and relax so

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.590
that we can feel enriched
even in difficult times?

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.120
And as David mentioned, I
talk about this at more length

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.530
in my book "Buddha's Map."

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.560
So if you're interested in
it, you can pick that up.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.860
How's that for very slyly
sneaking in a commercial?

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.700
So start with how
to recognize it.

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.230
I was trying to think of
a good analogy for what

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:54.920
it's like to recognize this
instinctual tightening.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:07:00.230
And what came to me was my
boys when they were little,

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.940
searching for Easter eggs.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.740
So on Easter Sunday
morning they would run out

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.560
in the yard looking
for Easter eggs.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.140
They were hidden out there.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.430
And they would look
inside little boxes

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.300
and behind trees and in holes.

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.570
And they just couldn't find any.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.470
Because the Easter
Bunny-- my wife and I--

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:27.810
always hid the Easter
eggs in plain sight.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.320
We'd take a yellow
one and put it

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.410
in a batch of yellow
flowers, and a green one

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.550
in a tuft of green grass,
and a bright red one

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.040
on the little fire
truck in the sandbox.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.490
So they were placed so they were
easy to see, but in such a way

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.200
that they blended
in with the yard.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.500
So in their excitement, my boys
would overlook the obvious.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.970
And then after a few
minutes they got it.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:59.510
And they would stop,
relax, and look around.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.524
And they would see
them everywhere.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.280
So this instinctual
tightening is like that.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.910
It is in plain sight.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.980
But since it diverts
our attention

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:15.720
out there rather than in
here, we overlook the obvious.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.670
But if we just stop
and look carefully,

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:22.401
we begin to see it everywhere.

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:27.110
I was talking earlier
before some of you came in.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:30.070
Had the experience-- well, I
did this actually this morning,

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.049
driving in from Sacramento.

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:36.240
I was going down, the
traffic was moving fine.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.780
It was thick, but it was moving.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.844
And some guy came
in on the on ramp.

00:08:42.844 --> 00:08:44.260
And I don't know
what you learned,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.576
but I learned they're
supposed to yield.

00:08:47.576 --> 00:08:50.010
At least that's my little
righteous attitude inside.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.610
Well, he had just
squeezed himself in

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.068
And without even
thinking about it,

00:08:53.068 --> 00:08:56.130
I could feel my hands tightening
on the steering wheel.

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:59.220
That's tanha.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:03.560
Or maybe you're in a gentle,
free-flowing conversation

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.010
with a colleague or a friend.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.380
And then her eyes cloud
over and she looks away.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.785
And you say, did I
say something wrong?

00:09:11.785 --> 00:09:12.850
And she says, no.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:13.740
Everything's fine.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.468
I have to go.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:20.990
So you just witnessed that
instinctual tightening,

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.025
completely unnamed.

00:09:23.025 --> 00:09:23.900
But you saw it there.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.446
Other examples.

00:09:28.446 --> 00:09:29.820
You're talking on
your cell phone

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.840
as you're walking
down the sidewalk.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.510
And you go to cross the street.

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.010
You're carrying on
the conversation.

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:38.570
But your eyes just look up and
down the street for a moment.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.200
You don't even think about it.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.980
That instinctual
tightening is just

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:48.350
directing you to look
for traffic danger.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.097
Here's another place where you
can always recognize tanha.

00:09:54.405 --> 00:09:54.905
Complaining.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.075
Any time there is complaining.

00:10:00.075 --> 00:10:02.200
When you find yourself
complaining about something,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:06.540
just go ahead and finish
it out, because you

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:07.760
may enjoy it on some level.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.000
But just sort of
watch and you'll see,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.680
you'll feel the
places tightening up

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:13.270
in you a little bit.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:20.260
I was on my way home, and
stopped into the grocery store.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.910
We needed some-- every morning
I have a protein smoothie

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:25.827
with milk and bananas.

00:10:25.827 --> 00:10:26.993
And we were out of all that.

00:10:26.993 --> 00:10:29.390
So I needed some milk and
bananas and a few other things,

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.150
just about five or six things.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.320
So I went in the grocery
store, put them in the basket.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.820
And as I was heading
for the checkout line,

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:40.620
there must have been
five or six checkout

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:43.080
counters that were working.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.700
And all of them were backed
up three or four carts,

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.830
except for one that was empty.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.770
So I navigated towards it.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:56.210
And as I did, I noticed a woman
coming from the other side

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.720
with this overflowing basket.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.100
And she was headed for it too.

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.100
So my pace-- I didn't
even think about it-- just

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.058
picked up a little bit.

00:11:03.058 --> 00:11:04.080
Oh, did I cut you off?

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:04.580
I'm sorry.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:05.080
Oh no.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.460
That's OK.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.526
So that's a little bit of tanha.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:19.310
Oh I was considering going
to bed early one night,

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:21.430
when my wife said
that she wanted

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:27.810
to check her emails on the
computer in the bedroom.

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:30.470
And so I said to her, OK.

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.067
I'll just stretch out in the
other room for a few moments.

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:33.900
And she said, oh no.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:34.820
I don't want to drive you out.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.258
I'll check it out
in the morning.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.589
Sounds like a very civil
adult conversation.

00:11:42.589 --> 00:11:44.130
But if you had
actually witnessed it,

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:47.372
you would have noticed that my
voice was just a little pouty.

00:11:47.372 --> 00:11:49.819
Oh, I'll go sit
in the other room.

00:11:49.819 --> 00:11:51.360
And her voice was
a little irritated.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.055
Both of us had contracted a
little bit into that tanha.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:10.840
I picked up a ream of paper off
the shelf in the office supply

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:12.710
store.

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.244
And rather than go
to the checkout line,

00:12:15.244 --> 00:12:16.910
I just started wandering
down the aisles

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:19.368
a little bit to see if there
was something else, you know--

00:12:19.368 --> 00:12:20.170
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:20.850
Oh, pens.

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:21.350
No.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.370
I've got enough pens.

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:25.094
Maybe-- oh, labels.

00:12:25.094 --> 00:12:27.010
And then suddenly I
realized what I was doing.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.250
There was this little place
that contracted just a little

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:34.460
that was looking for something
that would feel good to buy.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.240
You ever done that?

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.270
So I recognized that little
bit of tightening inside me.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.400
And when I did, I couldn't
help but smile and kind

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.900
of laugh at myself internally
and just head for the checkout

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.040
line.

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:53.490
The Dalai Lama was at a
conference in Los Angeles.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.420
This a number of years ago.

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.920
And he was staying
at a hotel that

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.389
was 10 blocks from
the conference center.

00:13:01.389 --> 00:13:03.180
So every morning and
every evening somebody

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.430
drove from back and
forth from his hotel

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.270
to the conference room.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.910
And in that ten-block
stretch, there

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:15.759
were about five blocks that were
filled with electronics stores.

00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:17.300
And I don't know if
you know anything

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.440
about the Dalai Lama,
particularly his early years.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.920
But he's always been fascinated
with Western technology.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:27.480
So in his opening remarks one
morning at this conference

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.860
center, he said, looking out
the car window this morning,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.140
I wanted things without
even knowing what they were.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.350
So if you worry
about having tanha,

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:42.460
just know you're
in good company.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:45.600
The Dalai Lama has it too.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:51.700
So this tightening, it feels
like a tug, or an urge,

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.000
or a drive.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.880
It kind of pushes
us a little bit.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.010
And it's uncomfortable.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:03.140
It gets our attention
by creating attention,

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:08.070
and then pushing us to
do something about it.

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.260
And if there's nothing
we can do to resolve it,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:15.149
then we're left with a
kind of an unnamed edginess

00:14:15.149 --> 00:14:16.315
just begging for resolution.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.530
You know that place?

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:25.156
Talking here before we started,
a lot of you feel that.

00:14:25.156 --> 00:14:26.530
You're not quite
sure what it is.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.686
It's just a kind of
accumulated edginess.

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:34.490
While this instinct
was obviously

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:38.390
very helpful in
primal situations,

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.650
and is still helpful today
in simple situations,

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:48.230
in the complexities and
nuances of modern life,

00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:52.310
sometimes it really is
not terribly helpful,

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:57.161
because what it does is it gets
us to focus in on one detail.

00:14:57.161 --> 00:15:00.070
It just goes whoosh.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.771
When the resolution to a lot of
the issues we're dealing with

00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:04.270
are really complex,
where you really

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:05.900
have to see the whole forest.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:09.864
You have to have this
broad vision to see that.

00:15:09.864 --> 00:15:12.030
I'm just assuming all of
you know what I talk about.

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:14.730
It's seeing people-- it's
hard to see in ourselves,

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.350
but you see other people
dealing with the situation.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.450
And they just latch on
to some little detail.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.474
And it's never going
to be solved that way.

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.750
Or if you want some real
live examples of all this,

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.646
just watch the
political campaigns.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.475
I don't recommend it.

00:15:36.475 --> 00:15:37.850
But you know,
they're always sort

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.880
of latching on some detail
and point to it for blame.

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.070
So this tanha, this
instinctual tightening,

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:50.500
to a greater or lesser degree,
I think colors almost all

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:55.020
of human experience to
some degree or another.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.260
And when you get
too much of it--

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.070
If you have absolutely none,
then life gets kind of dull.

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:05.060
But when you get
too much, there's

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.400
just an edginess that you don't
know quite what to do with.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.500
So let me shift
gears here and turn

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.360
from what it feels like to
look at some of the things that

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.470
trigger it in us.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.880
Some of the triggers are really
obvious-- just large things.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.720
Job stress.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.870
Relationship difficulties.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.820
Economic hardship.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.600
Medical problems.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:38.740
Our children's difficulties.

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.660
Economic insecurity.

00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:42.550
War.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.300
Political inanity.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.020
Do any of you have ever
watch the campaign and think,

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:52.670
oh, this is so lovely to watch?

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.790
Grr.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:56.550
So those are the
obvious triggers.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:58.400
But there are very
subtle ones that

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.300
can set it off in us as well.

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:03.960
Loneliness.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.230
You know, soft annoyances.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.374
Quiet worries.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.679
A sense of meaninglessness.

00:17:14.679 --> 00:17:18.510
Why am I doing this now?

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.436
Purposelessness.

00:17:21.436 --> 00:17:23.589
It can be very quiet
and hard to see.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:29.230
But it creates that little
discomfort in there,

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:31.510
wanting something, or wanted
to be rid of something

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.460
we have can create it as well.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.510
So let me just ask.

00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:39.950
What are some of the sources
of stress or difficulty

00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:40.580
in your life?

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.038
I just want to see
if we can create

00:17:42.038 --> 00:17:43.340
a list of with a variety.

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:46.562
What is it that hooks
you or gets to you?

00:17:46.562 --> 00:17:47.770
You don't have to explain it.

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:48.811
We'll just start calling.

00:17:48.811 --> 00:17:49.980
Or maybe it's not for you.

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.018
Maybe it's a loved one.

00:17:51.018 --> 00:17:52.518
You don't want to
identify yourself.

00:17:54.675 --> 00:17:55.675
AUDIENCE: Relationships.

00:17:55.675 --> 00:17:58.637
DOUG KRAFT: Relationships.

00:17:58.637 --> 00:18:01.012
AUDIENCE:
Interpersonal conflict.

00:18:01.012 --> 00:18:02.470
DOUG KRAFT:
Interpersonal conflict.

00:18:05.015 --> 00:18:06.541
AUDIENCE: Taxes.

00:18:06.541 --> 00:18:07.291
DOUG KRAFT: Taxes.

00:18:11.892 --> 00:18:13.790
AUDIENCE: Workload
and the work demand.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.950
DOUG KRAFT: Workload
and the work demand.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.850
Release dates.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:23.530
I remember I worked as a high
performance graphics programmer

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:25.710
back in the eighties
for a little while.

00:18:25.710 --> 00:18:29.430
And the first release I was on--
you know, at the last minute,

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:31.367
it's like we're--
last week and a half,

00:18:31.367 --> 00:18:33.700
it's like everybody is just
working like banshees trying

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:35.070
to get this thing out.

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:36.240
We finally got it out.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.510
We're all going to go out
and have lunch together.

00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:42.840
And this note came around from
our boss that said, great.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.740
Good work.

00:18:43.740 --> 00:18:44.390
Good product.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.250
You did wonderful.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.080
Go out, celebrate, and be
back in a half an hour,

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.075
because we're already
behind for the next one.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:55.350
So other types of things
that trigger this.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.139
What gets to you?

00:19:01.139 --> 00:19:02.055
AUDIENCE: Selfishness.

00:19:02.055 --> 00:19:03.054
DOUG KRAFT: Selfishness.

00:19:03.054 --> 00:19:03.765
Yeah.

00:19:03.765 --> 00:19:05.306
AUDIENCE: Wondering
if I'm doing what

00:19:05.306 --> 00:19:08.730
I'm doing for the right reasons,
or out of fear of other people.

00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:09.600
DOUG KRAFT: Right.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:10.100
Right.

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:13.080
Sometimes you can be inspired
to do something and be

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.690
afraid about not doing
it at the same time.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:18.350
At least I can.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:19.873
Other things.

00:19:19.873 --> 00:19:21.170
AUDIENCE: Misunderstandings.

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.186
DOUG KRAFT: Misunderstandings.

00:19:23.186 --> 00:19:27.177
They happen all the time.

00:19:27.177 --> 00:19:30.446
What else?

00:19:30.446 --> 00:19:31.850
AUDIENCE: Feeling rushed.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.320
DOUG KRAFT: Feeling rushed.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.420
Yeah.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:34.920
Yeah.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.900
Sometimes it's nice to just
sort of take your time.

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.900
And somebody is pushing.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.400
And you can be doing
the same thing.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.060
And doing it one way is fun.

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:44.680
When it's rushed,
it becomes no fun.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.210
It's almost like
you feel cheated.

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:48.710
[INAUDIBLE]

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:49.652
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:49.652 --> 00:19:51.540
Emotional isolation.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:52.910
DOUG KRAFT: Emotional isolation.

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.850
That's a huge one.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:55.350
Yeah.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.050
That's a huge one.

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:57.730
OK.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:59.290
You've got the idea.

00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:07.330
So the question is, the question
is, what do we do about these?

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.500
What we do about them?

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.261
Now remember, this tightening
focus all our attention out

00:20:14.261 --> 00:20:14.760
there.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.180
That's what the instinct is.

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:20.290
And sometimes that makes sense.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:22.810
I mean, I assume
that all of us here

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.630
have some commitment to
living life out in the world.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:31.970
Anybody here live in a convent,
or monastery, you know?

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.210
So we embrace the
interdependent web.

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:36.490
And so oftentimes
to solve problems,

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:41.430
we like to just deal with
them on their own terms.

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:49.060
So you get sick or have an
injury, have a concussion.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.090
What do you do?

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:52.960
Rather than just
pray or meditate,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.480
you go to a doctor or a
health care professional,

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:01.070
or look at diet or rest
or exercise, or something

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:05.270
to work with the body
on its own terms.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:11.710
Or if your job is in
trouble, what do you do?

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:18.050
Well, talk to the boss
or refresh your resume.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:22.220
Or look towards getting
some more education,

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.660
increasing your job
skills, networking,

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:31.560
dealing with the job
somehow on its own terms.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:32.960
Or relationship difficulties.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.990
What's the first advice
we usually give somebody?

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.222
Like, have you
talked to the person?

00:21:42.222 --> 00:21:44.687
Have you actually
talked to them?

00:21:44.687 --> 00:21:46.270
And if it's difficult
to talk to them,

00:21:46.270 --> 00:21:50.310
maybe talk to a counselor or a
good friend or a support group,

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:56.160
or something that deals with
relationships on its own terms.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.480
Or just a very simple thing.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.090
You want something.

00:21:58.090 --> 00:21:58.840
You have enough money.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:21:59.465
What do you do?

00:21:59.465 --> 00:22:01.870
You go out and buy it.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:07.930
So if these strategies resolve
the problem, that's great.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:09.580
That's great.

00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:11.850
Cure the disease.

00:22:11.850 --> 00:22:13.930
Find a new job.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:18.190
Resolve our kids
of streperousness.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:20.800
Buy that piece of music.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.980
And that's great.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:30.490
But there are some times
when we do everything we can.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.880
And the problem just lingers.

00:22:36.380 --> 00:22:40.660
I moved to Sacramento
in the summer of 2000.

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:42.740
I was living on the East Coast.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.960
And I was called to come
out to serve a large church,

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.190
a large progressive church.

00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:50.560
And at that time,
our youngest son

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.130
was just about to go into his
senior year of high school

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.080
in this charter school
in Massachusetts

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:00.550
that he had helped found
and poured his heart into.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:03.330
So the first year
I came out alone.

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:06.560
And he and my wife stayed
back in Massachusetts

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:10.600
so he could finish up his high
school year in this community

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.690
that he knew.

00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:17.440
And mostly it was OK.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.320
You know, I missed them.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.350
But I was busy getting
to know a new community.

00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:23.110
There was a lot
for me to do there.

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:26.970
And I knew the separation
was going to be temporary.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:30.950
But I have to tell you,
Friday evenings were hard.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.070
Fridays had been family time.

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:38.570
Used to play board games
or go to a movie or just

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.400
hang out together.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.170
And so you know,
Friday afternoon,

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.530
as the twilight
began to settle in,

00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:51.340
I could feel this sort of aching
in the center of my chest.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.854
So I would call them and
talk to them on the phone.

00:23:53.854 --> 00:23:59.450
But it wasn't, that
wasn't quite the same.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.690
Sometimes the
pangs of loneliness

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:03.334
felt just intolerable.

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.896
Sometimes there is no
cure for the disease.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:19.080
Sometimes there are no
appropriate jobs for us.

00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:24.730
Sometimes, most of
the time, we really

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:29.540
don't have a power to
solve the political scene.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.179
Sometimes-- well,
not sometimes-- the

00:24:34.179 --> 00:24:34.970
loved one who died.

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:39.874
They're just not coming back.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.210
Sometimes our kids have
difficulties that just

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:49.870
don't have an easy solution.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:50.757
They just don't.

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:57.496
These are the truly
difficult times.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.460
Sometimes the stress
that we're feeling,

00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:03.750
we do everything that we know.

00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:07.170
And it's just not enough.

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:08.400
What do we do then?

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.644
What we do then?

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.400
There are three
popular strategies

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.830
for dealing with
unsolvable problems.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.890
Grab something.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:23.760
Push something away.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.110
Space out.

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.100
The Buddha talked about them.

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.290
They are current with us.

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.100
I think they've been
all in between years.

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.660
They will be around for
hundreds of more years.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:34.320
Grab something.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.010
Push away.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:36.440
Or space out.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:41.400
So let's talk a little bit
about each of those strategies.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.630
So the first strategy is
to just grab for something.

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:52.020
Or maybe we become kind of
needy, feel a little needy.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:54.300
So this unresolved
tightening oftentimes

00:25:54.300 --> 00:26:00.870
does feel like a hunger, or
a thirst, or an emptiness.

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:04.580
And so we look for something
to fill that vacuum,

00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.360
that space inside.

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:17.850
I remember, it was the beginning
of my senior year of college.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.590
And I broke up
with a girlfriend.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:23.310
And it was the
right thing to do.

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.430
And I knew it had to be done.

00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:27.780
But I was really upset about it.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:30.140
And I just don't know
what to do with myself.

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.220
So I went out and I
bought a record album.

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:35.870
Anybody remember those?

00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:38.900
Anyway, what I actually bought
was Simon and Garfunkel's

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:42.190
"Bridge Over Troubled Waters."

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:43.230
And it was soothing.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.460
Many people get in
the habits of shopping

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:52.820
as a way of trying
to feel better.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.824
Or rather than get
stuff, some of us--

00:26:54.824 --> 00:26:56.240
I'm more inclined
this other way--

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.060
is to actually
collect experiences

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.694
that will distract us.

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:07.960
There's a variation on
this strategy that I'm

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.970
sure all of us have seen,
which is rather than do stuff

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:17.230
ourselves, we try to get other
people to do things for us.

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:19.060
Many people try
to control others

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:22.590
as a way of handling
their own discomfort.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:25.060
None of you do that, I'm sure.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:26.912
We've all seen people
become controlling.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.810
And sometimes these strategies
are actually soothing and help

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:37.180
us relax a little bit.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.842
But if they don't
address the true hunger,

00:27:41.842 --> 00:27:44.258
they're not going to have any
really lasting or sustaining

00:27:44.258 --> 00:27:46.920
value.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:50.975
So grabbing something
is the first strategy.

00:27:50.975 --> 00:27:53.450
If that doesn't work,
sometimes what we do

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:56.390
is we try to do the opposite.

00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:59.830
Rather than grasping
things, we push things away.

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:02.890
We become irritable or angry.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.970
We've all seen this in others.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:06.450
We've all felt it in ourselves.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.110
We snap at people more readily.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:13.650
We become less tolerant
of their foibles.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:18.070
We lose our temper,
criticize more readily.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.190
Things that used to
roll off our back

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.508
now kind of get under our skin.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:30.740
So expressing that irritation
can help feel a little better.

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:37.770
But again, if it doesn't
deal with the real problem,

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:41.210
it's not a lasting solution.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:42.730
You could be mad
at people at work

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.370
and come home and kick the
dog until the dog dies.

00:28:45.370 --> 00:28:47.310
But unless you deal with
whatever [INAUDIBLE],

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.210
it just doesn't work.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:55.820
So the third strategy
then is to space out.

00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:56.930
There is nothing I can do.

00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.150
So I'm just not going
to think about it.

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:02.750
Always stay busy, or
medicate ourselves

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:06.190
with alcohol or something else.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:13.660
Or just don't pay attention
to how lousy you feel inside.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.832
We just numb out.

00:29:18.919 --> 00:29:19.960
All of us have done this.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:29.240
And it can be helpful
sometimes for a short term,

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.450
for a temporary situation.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:35.000
But as a long-term strategy
for a long-term difficulty,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.310
it is disastrous.

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:40.353
Makes us all vulnerable
to addictions.

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.990
I have done a lot of things.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:52.360
I worked as a psychotherapist
for about a dozen years.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.300
And the clients that
came to me were all

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:57.800
using one of these
strategies, or sometimes

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.180
a combination of them.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:01.350
So my job was to
listen carefully

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:04.290
and attentively to what
was going on with them so

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:06.990
that together we might
find more effective ways

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:10.450
that they could
enrich their lives.

00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:16.490
And when I listened
carefully to their stories,

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:21.490
it frankly didn't surprise me
that they felt so messed up.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:23.510
What astounded me was
that they weren't all

00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:28.510
locked up on the back ward
of psychiatric hospital.

00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.260
If we listen deeply
to what many of us

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.020
have gone through as
children or adults,

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:40.590
it's amazing that we're
as healthy as we are.

00:30:40.590 --> 00:30:42.330
I mean, truly.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:43.100
Truly.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:47.870
The human spirit is
incredibly resilient.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:51.740
It's amazing the depth
of pain and suffering

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.050
that we can experience
and still come out

00:30:55.050 --> 00:30:57.060
the other side with
hearts and minds

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:59.070
that are open and
supple and alive.

00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.570
Yeah.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:01.190
We may feel the pain of it.

00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:05.270
But it's amazing what we can go
through without being crippled.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:12.370
But there's one
thing that brings us

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:17.030
down faster than anything else.

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.980
There's one thing that causes
us to crash and burn more

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:22.925
quickly than anything else.

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.497
Isolation.

00:31:28.497 --> 00:31:28.996
Isolation.

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:35.370
When we're not alone,
our natural wisdom

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:39.310
and compassion and
empathy can flow even

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:41.428
during very, very
difficult times.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.540
And there's one person
whose good attention

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:51.960
we need more than anyone else.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.578
It's the person we spend the
most time with night and day.

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:00.100
Ourselves.

00:32:00.100 --> 00:32:01.440
Ourselves.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.270
So if we're busy
grasping at things,

00:32:04.270 --> 00:32:06.770
or being irritated
with other people,

00:32:06.770 --> 00:32:08.840
pushing things away,
or spacing out,

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.280
we're not truly
present with ourselves.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.970
We have abandoned our hurt.

00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:15.360
For have abandoned our grief.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.034
We have abandoned our
loneliness, our fear.

00:32:18.034 --> 00:32:19.200
We have abandoned ourselves.

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:26.110
So if we want to thrive
during difficult times,

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:32.390
it is crucial that we learn
to be present to ourselves

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:36.780
more and more and more.

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:42.550
I remember one Friday,
my little apartment,

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:45.840
I had to talked to Eric and
Dana, my wife and my son,

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.279
on the phone.

00:32:48.279 --> 00:32:49.820
And I thought about
going to a movie.

00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.310
But somehow that night
it just seemed empty.

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:55.590
It just seemed vacuous.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:57.790
I could've called some
people in Sacramento.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:01.580
But that wasn't
the same as family.

00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:05.280
So I put some music
on, which both soothed

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:06.655
and stimulated my loneliness.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.530
And then I found
myself just pacing

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.077
around my little apartment.

00:33:14.077 --> 00:33:16.160
From the living room to
the bedroom to the kitchen

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.159
back to the living room.

00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:20.570
Just pacing faster and faster,
feeling more and more frantic,

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.200
knowing there was
nothing I could

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:27.260
do to assuage this aching
that I was feeling.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.310
There was nowhere to run.

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:30.770
And then I finally got it.

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:32.061
There was no where I could run.

00:33:32.061 --> 00:33:33.020
So I just stopped.

00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:37.230
I remember standing
still right there

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:41.940
in the middle of my living
room, my little living room.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:47.550
And I realized that
at that very moment,

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.930
just as in this
moment right now,

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:57.920
there are millions of people
around the planet feeling just

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.590
as lonely as I was, maybe more.

00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:07.220
There are hundreds of millions
of people right now grieving

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:10.489
the loss of a loved one.

00:34:10.489 --> 00:34:13.730
There are countless
people who are worried

00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.850
about their children,
concerned about how they're

00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:24.000
gonna make ends meet,
frightened by disease,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.949
cowering before violence.

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:31.017
And most of them weren't
doing anything wrong.

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.555
Things just don't work out
in this life sometimes.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:43.550
Everything we love is going to
be taken from us at some point.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:46.316
We all die.

00:34:46.316 --> 00:34:47.739
We all die.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:51.770
Our society does us an
incredible disservice

00:34:51.770 --> 00:34:55.550
by reassuring us that we
are captains of our ship.

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.580
We are directors of our fate.

00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:02.530
We are in charge of our future.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.160
That's bonkers.

00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.830
We have some influence.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:08.740
Yeah, we can influence things.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:13.790
But bad things happen to
good people all the time.

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:16.780
So standing there in my living
room, I thought, oh, yeah.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:17.820
That's right.

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.280
That's just how
life is sometimes.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.350
Everything breaks.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:25.560
Sometimes things just-- I'm
not bad for feeling bad.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.280
Stuff happens.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.590
So I stopped running.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:38.430
And I sat down in a chair in
the living room to just feel it.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:39.770
I couldn't run from it.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:44.756
I just sat down to feel
it, just be present.

00:35:44.756 --> 00:35:47.780
I wasn't trying to talk myself
into or out of anything.

00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:49.442
Just trying to be present.

00:35:49.442 --> 00:35:53.058
And you know what?

00:35:53.058 --> 00:35:55.665
It didn't feel very good.

00:35:55.665 --> 00:35:58.100
It felt pretty awful.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:01.260
But at least I had myself.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:06.350
At least I had one person in the
room, one friend in the room--

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:09.200
me.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.170
And with that, the loneliness--
how can I say this?

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.310
It began to soften.

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:17.625
It didn't go away.

00:36:17.625 --> 00:36:19.660
It didn't go away.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:22.710
But since I wasn't fighting
against it anymore,

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:27.020
it was like it began to
spread out and soften.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:35.970
And I began to feel poignant
and moist and alive, rather

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.780
than dry, dusty, and barren.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:49.250
If we want to thrive
during difficult times,

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:55.270
it is so important to recognize
this instinctual response

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.450
on its own terms.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.680
It's not a thought.

00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.910
It's not an idea.

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:01.530
It's not a religious creed.

00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.430
It's not a
metaphysical principle.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:06.990
It's not a philosophical axiom.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.550
It's none of that.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:14.770
It's a wired-in, pre-vebal,
pre-conceptual biological

00:37:14.770 --> 00:37:15.270
reflex.

00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:21.340
A mental, emotional, and
sometimes physical tightening.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:25.720
And it focuses all our faculties
out there into the world,

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:29.100
rather than in here.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:32.266
The instinct is
very, very simple.

00:37:32.266 --> 00:37:34.880
And I mean that simple
both in the sense

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.680
that it's not very complicated.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:39.283
And it's also simple in the
sense that it's kind of stupid.

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:47.070
If there's nothing that we can
do to resolve the situation,

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.720
it doesn't know how to let go.

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:56.820
We can lie awake at night in
this endless loop of thoughts

00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.210
about our health, our
relationship, our situation.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:03.824
Go around and around and around.

00:38:03.824 --> 00:38:04.990
Anybody here ever done that?

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:06.406
Anybody here not done that?

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:10.720
It goes round and round.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.410
And you just don't know
how to let go of it.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:16.910
It just doesn't know
how to let go of itself.

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.830
In these cases I think
it's so important

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.810
to shift our attention
from the story line,

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:25.680
from the ideas, from
what the situation is,

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.080
to just notice just in
the simplest terms, what's

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:34.800
going on inside, just to see
the inner holding directly.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:38.370
Because this is magical.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:43.970
Because when we see it
fully, it tends to soften.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.500
And if it doesn't do that,
we can invite it to soften.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.870
You just be with
it, the same way

00:38:55.870 --> 00:38:59.785
you would be with a child who
wakes up from a nightmare.

00:38:59.785 --> 00:39:00.410
What do you do?

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:01.240
You don't sit there.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.906
You don't try to talk
the kid out of it.

00:39:02.906 --> 00:39:04.570
They had the experience.

00:39:04.570 --> 00:39:07.460
You're just present
in a heartful way.

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.275
And as we do that,
some of the swirl

00:39:14.275 --> 00:39:21.310
and the thoughts and the
emotions start to wind down.

00:39:21.310 --> 00:39:22.780
It's very, very simple.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.840
But it's very difficult
to do, because it

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:31.220
goes against this evolutionary
reflex to look out there.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:34.410
So when you do it
with yourself, it's

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:38.860
very important to be kind
and gentle and patient,

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.840
to just be there.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:44.920
But as we relax
that inner tautness,

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.330
we don't start
thriving overnight.

00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:52.100
But without the tension, the
spinning begins to slow down.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.405
It's the tension
that drives all that.

00:39:54.405 --> 00:39:55.960
If you can just release it.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.550
Forget about the stories,
just release the tension.

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:01.525
And they start to
run out of gas.

00:40:01.525 --> 00:40:03.105
And they slow down a little.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:09.700
And with this,
there is something

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:15.220
deeply mysterious and deeply
human that begins to emerge.

00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:25.570
We begin to notice a poignant
well-being that has nothing

00:40:25.570 --> 00:40:26.808
to do with fixing anything.

00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.980
We begin to touch, or get just
a sense of a wholeness that

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:39.062
doesn't depend on us
controlling anything.

00:40:44.090 --> 00:40:47.920
Some people would call this
well-being God, or the divine,

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:49.270
or spirit.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:52.860
Other people would call it
human essence, or Buddha nature.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.810
I don't care what you call it.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:59.920
I really don't, because
it's not an idea.

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:05.790
It is a-- it's just
this wired-in reflex.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:08.090
It's pre-verbal.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.010
It's pre-verbal.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:16.960
All we have to do is just
notice this elusive holding

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.880
on its own terms.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:22.520
And it starts to soften.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:24.760
And this doesn't make us
transcend the world out

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.530
into some other realms.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:28.870
But what it does
do is it gives us

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:32.510
some of the courage,
the patience, the heart,

00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:38.292
and the intelligence that come
more fully back into this life.

00:41:38.292 --> 00:41:39.750
And to do what we
can for ourselves

00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:41.343
and for our fellow creatures.

00:41:44.590 --> 00:41:51.270
And as we do that,
our sense of self

00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:55.130
begins to expand and
soften a little bit.

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:58.000
And we think, you
know, maybe I'm

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.885
not this shrunken peach pit of
a self that I thought I was.

00:42:02.885 --> 00:42:04.670
And the whole sense
of self begins

00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:08.820
to expand out a little bit.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:13.760
And with this we
are truly on a path

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:19.154
towards striving, even in the
most difficult of situations.

00:42:25.090 --> 00:42:29.950
So before I open up for
questions and comments,

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:34.300
can we just spend a few
moments in silence together?

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:37.110
I want to invite you to close
your eyes or let your eyes rest

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:38.110
someplace undistracting.

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:49.290
And let your awareness
drift inward.

00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.790
Just see if there is any
tightness or tension in there,

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:03.410
tension in your body,
edginess in your emotions,

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:05.510
holding in your mind.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:07.120
Just see.

00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:07.828
No judgments.

00:43:07.828 --> 00:43:08.824
Just see.

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:20.220
And if you notice any tension,
don't try to change anything.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:25.080
If your thoughts are rambling
or your attention is wandering,

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.940
let them ramble and wander.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:30.526
Just notice any tightness
and invite it to soften.

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:49.250
And if there's no
tension, that's great.

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:53.440
Just notice the peace,
well-being, and spaciousness.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:57.224
And let it radiate
naturally from you.

00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.590
Let's let it flow out.

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:36.990
Just notice the
flux inside, too,

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:42.890
how things will rise,
and then softly pass.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:47.920
Just let it be what it
is, relaxing tension.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:53.340
And sending out well-being to
your fellow human creatures

00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:56.886
around you, and all creatures.

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:02.916
out there in the world.

00:45:22.342 --> 00:45:23.340
Thank you.

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:40.910
I welcome comments, questions.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.550
If you'd just rather stay
with the inner space,

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.522
that's fine, too.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:50.650
Yes.

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:50.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.478
So--

00:45:51.478 --> 00:45:53.639
AUDIENCE: Is there a mic?

00:45:53.639 --> 00:45:54.264
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:54.264 --> 00:45:54.746
Yeah.

00:45:54.746 --> 00:45:55.246
Sure.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:10.350
So you talked about
the quality of anxiety

00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:13.783
without fixation on external
thing to explain it.

00:46:13.783 --> 00:46:14.616
DOUG KRAFT: Without?

00:46:14.616 --> 00:46:17.650
AUDIENCE: Without the
fixation or the obsession

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:22.260
with something external to
explain it, which I think

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:23.690
is a really interesting idea.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:27.440
I'm curious what
your thoughts are on

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:34.520
whether that's just-- is
that just an innate part

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.200
of being a human being?

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:39.000
Or is that-- because
like psychotherapy,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.530
for example, or
psychoanalysis, would

00:46:41.530 --> 00:46:43.860
suggest that there
is some underlying

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.890
cause for that anxiety.

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:50.830
Whereas other methods
of thought seem

00:46:50.830 --> 00:46:53.261
to explain it as just
sort of an innate element

00:46:53.261 --> 00:46:54.260
of the human experience.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:57.200
So I'm wondering what your
interpretation of that is.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:57.950
DOUG KRAFT: Yeah.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:00.390
The Eastern and Western
models of where that come from

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:02.840
are a little bit different.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:06.170
And I think there's some
value in all of them.

00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:12.410
I don't think the tension
is innate to our essence,

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:16.800
but that we all
collect it from places.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:20.310
Little difference between the
Eastern and Western psychology

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.190
is that the Western
psychology looks

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:27.660
more for the causes and history,
et cetera, that trigger it.

00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.790
The Eastern psychology--
and I include

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:32.140
the meditative
disciplines in this--

00:47:32.140 --> 00:47:36.630
they're more interested in the
quality of the mind that is

00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:40.070
looking at whatever's going on.

00:47:40.070 --> 00:47:43.380
So just to give
you a simple model.

00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:46.930
Here is like clear, relaxed--
I call it pure awareness.

00:47:46.930 --> 00:47:49.330
Awareness that doesn't
have any agenda.

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:51.840
Here is what you
see in the world.

00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:56.010
And that awareness looks through
all the attitudes in the mind.

00:47:56.010 --> 00:48:01.100
So if you are uptight or
anxious about something,

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:04.500
it can color your
perception of everything.

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:08.120
And so what you
are uptight about

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:11.310
may not be what you
think you're seeing.

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:13.410
And so what I'm
actually suggesting

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:20.100
is that where we get
the most mileage is

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:23.190
by looking at the qualities
that are in the mind heart,

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:25.270
regardless of where
they came from.

00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:28.360
Because as those can
relax a little bit,

00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.800
we can actually see more
clearly what's going on.

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:34.600
If there's a lot of
anger, a lot of fear,

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:36.220
a lot of depression
or something,

00:48:36.220 --> 00:48:39.410
that colors everything
that we experience.

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:42.470
And they get all caught
up in the stories.

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:45.090
And yeah, they
probably do have causes

00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:47.980
and et cetera, if
we had brains that

00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:50.440
were 17 times the
size of ours, we

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.820
might be able to
figure all that out.

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.490
But in terms of
just practically,

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:58.970
of how you live day
to day, being aware

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:01.320
of the quality of a mind.

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.500
So example, as you're sitting
here, you can feel this.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:05.950
Does your awareness feel light?

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:07.230
Does it feel sleepy?

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:09.030
Does it feel tense?

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:11.480
Does it feel excited?

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:16.140
It's just actually being aware
of the quality of the mind

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:20.670
so that you bring-- it's
a tricky language here.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:27.590
Tradition is called wholesome
qualities, awareness, patience,

00:49:27.590 --> 00:49:33.320
kindness, compassion, joy,
peacefulness are qualities

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.690
of mind that have very
little tension in them,

00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:39.200
or lead in the direction
of less tension.

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.520
And so as you bring
more of those,

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:45.110
as you just invite
more of those in,

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:47.057
then you see more
clearly what's going on.

00:49:47.057 --> 00:49:49.390
And if there's some insights
into a particular situation

00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:51.871
that you need, they will just
show up all by themselves.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.430
But if we become
Sherlock Holmes,

00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.360
go in and try to
figure things out,

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:01.240
when we're trying to
figure things out,

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:05.480
we are working from
our assumptions

00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.430
about-- working from what
we already understand.

00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:16.600
Ouspensky wrote-- he said
the chief difficulty he found

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:19.400
was that most people keep
translating what they hear

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:23.840
into their habitual language so
that they cease to think they

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:27.200
can ever hear anything new.

00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:31.300
And so as you relax all
that and see things fresh,

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:34.075
there are fresh
insights that come up.

00:50:34.075 --> 00:50:34.950
Does that make sense?

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:37.790
Am I making it too esoteric?

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:45.600
So what you decide to do about
something has a lot of effect

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:48.130
just on that particular
moment how you

00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:50.810
look at it, how you hold it.

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:53.960
Whether you bring patience and
kindness and openness to it,

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.770
or anger and judgment, has
a big effect down the road,

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:00.750
has a big effect down the road.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:03.094
So this is really in
it for the long run.

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:10.140
So it's a lot of difficulties
recurring in your life.

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.610
Greed wants to solve
and fix it right now.

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:16.650
And as you go for that, you
just add more tension to it.

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:21.090
But if you actually
sit back and say, wow.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.060
I haven't been this
depressed in a long time.

00:51:24.060 --> 00:51:24.970
Far out.

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:28.080
You know, it's like just get a
little bit of space around it,

00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:30.810
bring a little kindness
and patience to it,

00:51:30.810 --> 00:51:32.810
that actually opens the
mind and heart out more,

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:34.350
so it can see more clearly.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:36.710
When it can see more
clearly, we become wiser.

00:51:39.530 --> 00:51:42.690
When we have lot of
tension, we get stupider.

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:50.560
So it's just a way--
wisdom is perception.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:52.550
That's all it is.

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:54.150
Cleverness is
figuring things out.

00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:56.110
But the wise person
is one that can just

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.246
see into the heart
of the situation,

00:51:58.246 --> 00:52:00.140
or see to the heart of a person.

00:52:00.140 --> 00:52:02.580
So we're actually trying
to cultivate wisdom

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:09.770
by allowing the mind to
be softer and more open.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:10.750
Thank you.

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:12.220
That's a great question.

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.822
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:52:17.822 --> 00:52:19.280
AUDIENCE: Can you
provide some tips

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:22.740
on how to break out of
those habits we often

00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:25.350
get stuck in using
things like for me

00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:28.200
I think it's just keeping
myself incessantly busy,

00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:30.470
whether it's in work
or personal life.

00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:33.110
And I think partly that's
maybe avoiding or not

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:36.180
figuring out how to deal with
what it is that's going on.

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:39.260
And even when I
try and meditate,

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:40.860
it's fighting the
noise in my head

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:44.910
and not being able to
quite break past it.

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:46.920
I'm sure there's no
easy solution to it.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.510
But any new insights or
thoughts would be appreciated

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:52.497
on how to make the change.

00:52:52.497 --> 00:52:54.580
DOUG KRAFT: There are lots
and lots of techniques.

00:52:54.580 --> 00:53:01.230
But let me just say a
couple general things is

00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:03.900
that in meditation-- this
is the mistake people make.

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:06.810
In meditation our job
is not to fix anything.

00:53:06.810 --> 00:53:08.143
It's not to get rid of anything.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:12.580
Here is an esoteric
secret that ought

00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.270
to be obvious to everyone.

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:16.050
If you have an
unwholesome quality,

00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:18.900
let's say anger, or
aversion, or fear.

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:23.910
And you have wholesome
qualities like peace, awareness,

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:29.350
mindfulness, in the mind at
the same time, which one wins?

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:37.354
The wholesome always wins.

00:53:37.354 --> 00:53:39.530
We get very cynical about it.

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:42.320
But you can feel it.

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.070
So if you're feeling
some tension,

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:51.100
and then if you can just step
back and see it clearly, oh.

00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:52.600
Look at that tension.

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:57.550
It has a subtle tendency
to relax a little bit.

00:53:57.550 --> 00:54:00.190
So what that means when you
meditate is rather than trying

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:04.810
to get rid of all those
rambling thoughts,

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:08.230
is to just let them run.

00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:12.640
But just relax any tension
that you feel within them.

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:15.020
And then what happens
is those thoughts

00:54:15.020 --> 00:54:16.560
will gradually run out of gas.

00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.784
It's the tension
that fuels them.

00:54:19.784 --> 00:54:23.260
If you relax around it, and
it's got a full tank of gas,

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.570
it'll keep going for a while.

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:26.030
But you're not putting
more gas in the tank.

00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:27.470
So it will gradually run out.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:34.480
If you try to stop,
then it's like me,

00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:37.207
as I was talking before
about my cat Bailey.

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:38.040
When it was hissing.

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.880
You know, it's like slapping it.

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:42.939
That's not going
to calm him at all.

00:54:42.939 --> 00:54:44.730
But if I scratch him
and I get him purring,

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:45.720
[INAUDIBLE] it's OK.

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.920
Then it opens up.

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:52.160
So I think it's really
important to bring

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.890
a lot of heart, a
lot of patience,

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:58.650
and to cut ourselves
a lot of slack.

00:54:58.650 --> 00:55:04.901
My little organization-- I had
to put together a nonprofit

00:55:04.901 --> 00:55:06.650
because people were
giving me money that I

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:07.775
was giving to other people.

00:55:07.775 --> 00:55:09.490
So I needed to keep
it all transparent.

00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:12.410
And so but I call Easing Awake.

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:14.030
Easing Awake.

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:17.380
That the key to
awakening is actually

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.300
cultivating a certain
amount of ease,

00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:24.050
because when the mind is
relaxed, it is very sensitive.

00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:27.500
There's a little flicker
over there, you see it.

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:31.410
You know, when you're like this,
[GROWLS] then a train runs over

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:33.044
and you hardly notice it.

00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:40.440
The difficulty with
this in the beginning

00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.030
is that there's
no reason for you

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:44.870
to trust that this is
actually going to work.

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:46.370
I mean, you can
take my word for it.

00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:49.920
But that's just my--
I mean, who am I?

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.680
But you have to try it enough.

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.510
And then as you begin
to feel it working,

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:57.380
then actually it's faith,
confidence builds up.

00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.470
OK.

00:55:59.470 --> 00:56:02.130
That the peace and
well-being we're looking for

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:06.350
is actually here all the time.

00:56:06.350 --> 00:56:09.380
I'll give you my
little image of it.

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:12.370
You have a classroom
filled with kids.

00:56:12.370 --> 00:56:14.240
And they're throwing
knives and books,

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:16.980
and yelling, and playing boom
boxes and all that stuff.

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:21.070
And over there in
the corner, there's

00:56:21.070 --> 00:56:23.590
a kid who's writing poetry.

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:28.710
And you wouldn't know it
because of all the hubbub.

00:56:28.710 --> 00:56:31.700
But then you come
in class very early.

00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.130
And the kid is the
only one there.

00:56:33.130 --> 00:56:35.210
And so you go over and
you sit down next to her.

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:36.376
Maybe you talk a little bit.

00:56:36.376 --> 00:56:38.184
Or maybe you just
kind of sit together.

00:56:38.184 --> 00:56:40.600
And then as the other kids
come in, they rattle the chairs

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.650
and create all this noise,
and all that stuff is there.

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:45.380
So everything comes back.

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:48.440
But now you know what
that's like over there.

00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:53.840
And even in the hubbub, you can
actually feel that over there.

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:55.840
And that's when you start
the little confidence.

00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.820
And then rather than
fight all the hubbub,

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:03.640
you just sort of relax
into that peaceful place,

00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.530
and then allow whatever
insights come out of that.

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:12.631
So that's a quick answer.

00:57:20.310 --> 00:57:25.500
AUDIENCE: So in order to
maintain the relaxed mind

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.500
in your day-to-day
life, like for example,

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:32.470
like when you're in the grocery
store or something like that,

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:36.315
how do you respond to
tension you come across?

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.530
DOUG KRAFT: The most
important thing is to see it.

00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:47.460
To take the broader
frame of your question,

00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:50.260
I think it's really
helpful to have some type

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:53.050
of spiritual practice.

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:54.410
So I meditate every morning.

00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:57.700
And part of that is, quite
frankly, what it is, is it's

00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:01.050
putting myself in a
quiet room without any

00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:02.880
of those other
distractions, where

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:07.260
it's just easier to actually
feel the kid writing poetry.

00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.800
So I become more
familiar with that.

00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:11.310
And then as that
gets stronger, it

00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:16.130
begins to carry
out into the world.

00:58:16.130 --> 00:58:22.050
We also have a process
that's the most effective one

00:58:22.050 --> 00:58:26.920
I've ever found that we
affectionately call the Six Rs.

00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:30.210
Is when you get distracted
or something pulls you away,

00:58:30.210 --> 00:58:32.530
you recognize what it is.

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:33.030
OK.

00:58:33.030 --> 00:58:33.696
I'm pulled away.

00:58:33.696 --> 00:58:36.520
The mind is jumping,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:38.270
And then you release it.

00:58:38.270 --> 00:58:42.790
And release it just means
you let it be what it is.

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:47.950
Suzuki Roshi-- the Zen
teacher-- said the best way

00:58:47.950 --> 00:58:52.210
to control a cow was to put
it in a very large pasture.

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:57.130
So you just give it a lot of
space, recognize, release,

00:58:57.130 --> 00:58:59.530
then you relax any
tension that you feel.

00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:03.819
And as that tension
goes out, there'll

00:59:03.819 --> 00:59:05.360
be a little bit of
space in the mind,

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:08.180
and all the old habits will
actually pour back into that.

00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.250
So it's recognize,
release, relax.

00:59:10.250 --> 00:59:12.980
And then you want to bring some
uplifted qualities in there.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:18.250
And the easiest way
to do this is just

00:59:18.250 --> 00:59:22.281
smile, just a little bit.

00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:24.280
Like if you do it now you
can feel what happens.

00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.710
What we know from the
way the brain operates

00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:31.560
is when you smile a little bit,
it tends to lighten things.

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:35.210
Recognize, release,
relax, smile.

00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:38.670
And then you go back to engage.

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:41.520
And so the people that are doing
meditation training with me,

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.570
they just got a lot of
experience with that.

00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:49.540
And so what happens is that
becomes a wired-in habit.

00:59:49.540 --> 00:59:52.520
So that when something
comes up, rather than just

00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.580
go strangle, oh.

00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:55.080
OK.

00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:56.090
There it is.

00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:58.760
Let it be.

00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:02.410
And so you just kind of
get a foot in the door.

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:07.560
I am a great believer
in developing

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.640
some spiritual practice.

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.180
It's sort of like
going to a gym.

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:12.460
You know, you work out,
you strengthen muscles.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:15.610
And the point is not to
become good at doing push ups,

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:17.520
but the point is to
strengthen your body,

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.420
you get a stronger body.

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:21.810
It's the same thing
with meditation practice

01:00:21.810 --> 01:00:24.170
is to give yourself a break.

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:27.270
Set up some time periods
in which you can actually

01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:30.640
practice that a little bit.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.690
And even if it's nothing
else than just sitting

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:38.700
for a few minutes, that's
sort of what I did at the end,

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.010
is that little meditate.

01:00:40.010 --> 01:00:42.420
Just knows what comes up,
the most important thing

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.140
is the relaxing the tension.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.190
And so you get some
practice with that.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:49.230
It's unreasonable to
expect that you'll

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:55.195
be able to do something that's
subtle in the midst of a crisis

01:00:55.195 --> 01:00:56.727
at work.

01:00:56.727 --> 01:00:59.060
But as you practice more, it
doesn't become a little bit

01:00:59.060 --> 01:00:59.560
habitual.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.436
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:01:22.372 --> 01:01:25.470
So what do you do when
you're caught up already?

01:01:25.470 --> 01:01:29.295
So you're already in
deep tension or stress.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.860
DOUG KRAFT: OK.

01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:35.900
That's a great question.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:39.130
So one thing you
can do is work real

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:41.140
hard to get rid of the tension.

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:42.986
And that will just increase it.

01:01:42.986 --> 01:01:45.000
Right?

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.612
So our job actually is
not to solve the tension.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.880
Just imagine that maybe
it's not actually a problem,

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:01.860
that if you can cultivate
some wholesome qualities.

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:05.470
So awareness is a very, very
wholesome, very powerful thing.

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:07.490
So if you can just
be a little more

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:10.840
aware that things
are really tense,

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.040
that will tend to drain it out.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:19.020
The difficulty is that
there's this in-between stage.

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.220
Some people call it the
dark night of the soul.

01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:23.980
I call them Alfred
Hitchcock moments.

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:27.500
Where there is enough
awareness that when you're

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:30.030
caught up and angry
at somebody, and when

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:32.700
you want to throttle them,
you have enough clarity,

01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.560
have enough awareness
inside, that says wow.

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:38.810
You know, I just
really-- I lost it here.

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:40.720
But the awareness is
not quite strong enough

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.280
to know what to do about it.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:46.320
So that's the point when
you try to clamp down on it.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:52.730
But actually frankly to
grab for peacefulness

01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:55.767
is just a form of
greed or aversion.

01:02:55.767 --> 01:02:56.600
Maybe it's aversion.

01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:58.090
We get rid of something.

01:02:58.090 --> 01:02:59.850
And so that doesn't help.

01:02:59.850 --> 01:03:03.400
But what you want
to do is to create--

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.470
is to bring in more of
those wholesome qualities.

01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:11.450
And I would say those six
Rs is a really effective way

01:03:11.450 --> 01:03:15.480
to do that, because
it's kind of mechanical,

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:18.540
so that you just start bringing
a little more awareness.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:20.790
Just knowing that particularly
if it's a deep pattern,

01:03:20.790 --> 01:03:23.210
it's not going to
disappear overnight.

01:03:23.210 --> 01:03:26.230
But you can get a
toe in the door.

01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:30.244
And then after you've been
able to do it a few times,

01:03:30.244 --> 01:03:31.910
then you get a little
bit of confidence.

01:03:31.910 --> 01:03:34.710
Then maybe, maybe,
maybe this will work.

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.180
Maybe this will work.

01:03:49.950 --> 01:03:52.230
So as your walking out of
here, and you think, oh.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:56.272
I wish I'd asked that.

01:03:56.272 --> 01:03:57.105
This is your chance.

01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:06.690
AUDIENCE: Is everything
OK at some level?

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:14.040
DOUG KRAFT: On some level, I
mean, that's a great question.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.913
It's actually a
pretty profound one.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:24.020
OK.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.200
Let me throw a curve at you.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.060
But that's a great question.

01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:31.520
So imagine this.

01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:35.720
Every day in your life you walk
into a room, take your clothes

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:39.780
off, they take a picture of
you in a certain posture.

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:42.276
You live 100 years.

01:04:42.276 --> 01:04:44.400
Now you take all those
frames and put them together

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:47.750
into a movie that runs
from, say, 15 minutes.

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:48.590
OK.

01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:50.210
And then just to
make it more fun,

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:53.390
we start the movie a year before
you were born, and run it say,

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.500
five years after your death.

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.020
So I'm watching this film.

01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:01.130
And so at first
there is nothing.

01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.710
And then there is your mother.

01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:03.880
She starts to swell up.

01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:04.900
Pop out you come.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.000
When you're nursing and peeing
and pooping, and not doing

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:08.500
too much.

01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:10.334
You go through all that stuff.

01:05:10.334 --> 01:05:11.750
But your body, you
know, it starts

01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:13.270
to stretch out a little bit.

01:05:13.270 --> 01:05:14.390
Maybe a little baby fat.

01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:15.090
It goes down a little bit.

01:05:15.090 --> 01:05:16.450
And there you are standing up.

01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:19.010
And maybe five
minutes into the film

01:05:19.010 --> 01:05:22.720
you know, you're coming
into adolescence.

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.570
And there's that
sort of vitality

01:05:24.570 --> 01:05:26.750
of youth and young adults.

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:29.740
And the body gets stronger.

01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:33.750
And then there's
a sort of plateau.

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:36.970
And the body sort of
droops a little bit.

01:05:36.970 --> 01:05:39.750
And maybe the eyes are
sparkly, but the skin

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:42.670
is a little blotchy and the hair
starts to gray a little bit,

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:44.680
and it stoops a little bit more.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.160
And then some of the light
goes out of the eyes.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:53.840
And then there's this-- and then
13, 14 minutes into the film,

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:57.480
there's just this
body on the floor.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.660
And the film goes on.

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:04.110
And so the skin
dries up, disappears.

01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:05.060
It's gone.

01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.880
There's just a skeleton.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.700
And then gradually it starts
to crumble, turn to dust,

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.900
and blows away, and it's gone.

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:24.160
So where are you in all of this?

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:27.000
So it begins-- I know
it's a little esoteric.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.780
But if you can
just picture that.

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.554
At any moment in time,
you're obviously here.

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:32.720
You're holding a microphone.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.170
And you know, I'm here.

01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:36.550
We're talking, et
cetera, et cetera.

01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:39.103
But on this larger
spans of time.

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:45.860
So Buddhism is
famous for what they

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:51.980
say is that there is
nothing essential in us

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.540
that separates us
from everything else.

01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:57.130
We are just a process.

01:06:57.130 --> 01:06:59.960
And what happens-- and
this is evolutionary too--

01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:07.680
is we latch onto and identify
with what I feel right now.

01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:11.290
And if our happiness, if
the source of well-being

01:07:11.290 --> 01:07:17.640
is keeping you just like
you are right now forever,

01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.540
you're cooked.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:20.290
It won't happen.

01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:35.540
I remember the first time that
a close friend of mine died.

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:40.825
I was a sophomore or
junior year in high school.

01:07:40.825 --> 01:07:44.610
And Larry was killed
in a car accident.

01:07:44.610 --> 01:07:49.300
And that was pretty weird, just
to actually be with all that.

01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:54.500
The strangest thing about it
all was that the next week we

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.951
had our French midterm
exam right on schedule.

01:07:57.951 --> 01:08:00.362
And I remember sitting in
that French midterm taking

01:08:00.362 --> 01:08:02.320
this, because Larry used
to sit up [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.730
I say, does anybody notice?

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:04.670
Larry is gone.

01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:05.420
What are we doing?

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.190
You know, it's like. [GROWL].

01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:10.290
I wanted to write on the
exam, [SPEAKING FRENCH].

01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:13.070
It's like, does anybody
notice the guy is gone?

01:08:13.070 --> 01:08:14.840
And I got it.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.109
You know, that when
I die, there will

01:08:18.109 --> 01:08:22.290
be a handful of people that
will mourn me for a few years.

01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:24.040
But even they will get
up the next morning

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:27.359
and complain about politics
and everything else,

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:30.319
that life will go on without me.

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:34.290
And so a lot of the base tension
that we have is trying to hold

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:39.229
on to a kind of an eternal
existence that just isn't-- it

01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:41.470
just isn't there.

01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:46.250
And so if you can imagine
sort of really getting

01:08:46.250 --> 01:08:50.630
that, that in not too many
years I'm going to be gone.

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:53.180
And hundred years
from now I don't

01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:57.160
know if there will be any
sign I was ever on the planet.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:00.490
And you can feel how hard
it is to hold that thought.

01:09:00.490 --> 01:09:04.560
But if you can be with
that a little bit,

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:06.770
it's like something relaxes.

01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:07.720
It's like, OK.

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:12.210
You know, we're just part
of an ongoing process.

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:15.050
And it's really OK.

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:18.090
And as you can tap
into that a little bit,

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:21.359
there really is a deep
kind of well-being

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:22.979
that is behind all of it.

01:09:22.979 --> 01:09:23.740
It's not mine.

01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.740
It's not yours.

01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.670
But we're just there with it.

01:09:27.670 --> 01:09:33.950
But we want to hold
onto our job, our body,

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:37.740
anything like that.

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.240
It's a disaster.

01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:49.020
I remember-- oh, God.

01:09:49.020 --> 01:09:51.960
First time I learned
where babies came from,

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.260
I was probably about--
I don't know-- five when

01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:57.087
my mother told me the story.

01:09:57.087 --> 01:09:59.170
You know, the sperm, and
the egg, and the sex act.

01:09:59.170 --> 01:09:59.836
The whole thing.

01:09:59.836 --> 01:10:03.275
And I think I had a pretty
typical five-year-old response

01:10:03.275 --> 01:10:03.775
to it.

01:10:03.775 --> 01:10:05.180
It was like, oh, you're kidding.

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.100
That's gross.

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:11.620
But I remember that night, lying
in bed looking at the ceiling

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:16.550
and thinking, so what if my
mother and father had not

01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:20.770
gone to the University of
Michigan at the same time?

01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:24.640
What if they had not
ever fallen in love?

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.280
What if they hadn't
been in the mood

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.020
to start a baby at a
particular afternoon in 1947,

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.260
or whenever it was?

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:35.470
What if a different one
of those five million

01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:37.350
sperm, whatever it
is, hit the egg?

01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:40.140
I could just think of
a zillion contingencies

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:43.900
in which I would not exist.

01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:46.180
And nobody would notice.

01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:48.332
The wouldn't even miss me.

01:10:48.332 --> 01:10:50.040
They'd probably have
another second child

01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.890
and give him my name.

01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:56.215
You know, that our existence
here is such a fluke.

01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:05.229
And if we really get that,
it's actually-- at first

01:11:05.229 --> 01:11:06.020
it's kind of scary.

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:09.350
But we really get it, it's
actually quite joyful,

01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:10.490
you know?

01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:13.080
Cause every moment's a gift.

01:11:18.817 --> 01:11:19.900
And that can be wonderful.

01:11:19.900 --> 01:11:25.760
And the next moment, I go
back to the prehistoric scene.

01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.110
walking through the jungle.

01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:30.876
There is one guy who is
at one with everything.

01:11:30.876 --> 01:11:31.830
The trees.

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:34.180
The lakes.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:36.250
The saber tooth kitties.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:37.510
The big bears.

01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:39.620
It's all lovely.

01:11:39.620 --> 01:11:42.965
And there's another guy who
is frightened of everything.

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:44.530
A little rustle,
and he runs around

01:11:44.530 --> 01:11:47.970
like a paranoid squirrel.

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:52.160
Guess whose DNA we got?

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.910
I look at the squirrels
running out there.

01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:55.170
You know, it's like whoa!

01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:57.691
They are like so uptight.

01:11:57.691 --> 01:11:59.190
But if they relax
a little bit, they

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:02.030
get eaten by the next
dog that came along.

01:12:02.030 --> 01:12:03.930
So that's been bred into us.

01:12:03.930 --> 01:12:06.230
But it's not metaphysical.

01:12:06.230 --> 01:12:08.970
You know, it's not
how reality is.

01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:14.264
It's just an artifact of
evolutionary processes.

01:12:18.255 --> 01:12:18.755
Wow.

01:12:18.755 --> 01:12:20.751
I didn't expect to [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:25.390
Anything more?

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:26.348
Or have you had enough?

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:39.696
So let me close with my
favorite poem of all time.

01:12:39.696 --> 01:12:42.634
It kind of touches
on some of the things

01:12:42.634 --> 01:12:52.790
you've been talking about, which
is peacefulness, equanimity,

01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:55.890
and where you find it.

01:12:55.890 --> 01:12:57.498
This poem about equanimity.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.220
It was written by
Donald C. Babcock.

01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:06.780
"Now we're ready to look at
something pretty special.

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:12.300
It is a duck, riding the ocean
100 feet beyond the surf.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:13.490
No, it isn't a gull.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:17.260
A gull always has a
raucous touch about him.

01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:19.420
This is some sort of duck.

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:22.670
And he cuddles in the swell.

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:23.670
He isn't cold.

01:13:23.670 --> 01:13:27.410
And he is thinking things over.

01:13:27.410 --> 01:13:29.895
There's a big heaving
in the Atlantic.

01:13:29.895 --> 01:13:33.310
And he is a part of it.

01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:37.060
He looks a bit like a Mandarin
with a Lord Buddha meditating

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.855
under the Bodhi tree.

01:13:38.855 --> 01:13:41.355
But he has hardly enough about
the eyes to be a philosopher.

01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:50.120
He has poise, however, which
is what philosophers must have.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.530
He can rest while the
Atlantic heaves because he

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.786
rests in the Atlantic.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:02.560
Probably he doesn't know
how large the ocean is.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.090
And neither do you.

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:07.850
But he realizes it.

01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:12.070
And what does he do, I ask you.

01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:14.880
He sits down in it.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:19.080
He reposes in the immediate
as if it were infinity,

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:21.070
which it is.

01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:22.430
That is religion.

01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:24.770
And the duck has it.

01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:27.120
He has made himself
part of the boundless

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:32.270
by easing himself into it
just where it touches him.

01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:34.320
I like the little duck.

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:35.812
He doesn't know much.

01:14:35.812 --> 01:14:43.140
But he has religion."

01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:44.850
So thank you all for coming.

01:14:44.850 --> 01:14:48.460
And thank you for your questions
and your good attention.

01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:55.170
And may we all learn how
to sit down in the waves.

01:14:58.230 --> 01:15:02.380
As far back as we can see into
history there have been waves.

01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.060
They will always be there.

01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:08.380
The art is learning how to sit
down in them, to rest in them.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:13.980
That's where the true
peace comes from.

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:14.520
Namaste.

01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.190
[APPLAUSE]
