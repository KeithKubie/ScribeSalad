00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.200
if I lived in Cape Town, I'd be doing
exactly this: Standing in line to collect

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.340
water and a jug like this. And I'm
allowed up to 6 gallons for myself

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.240
from this spring right here. But even
though I'm visiting, I'm still expected

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.870
to adhere to the water restrictions the
city is enacting. In an interview with the

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.199
deputy mayor, he told me they don't want
to deter tourists because they need the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.180
business, they just want them to "act like
a local." But what does that really mean?

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.440
I'm gonna show you what it means to live
on 50 liters, or 13 gallons, of water a day.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.880
When checking into my hotel, I was
reminded by the staff that Cape Town is

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.020
in the middle of an unprecedented
drought and water shortage.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.260
So there's a sign hanging in the shower that says, "Did you know that a two-minute shower uses

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.180
approximately 30 liters of water a day."
Now, Capetonians are restricted to

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.039
using only 50 liters of water a day,
which is about 13 gallons. And just for

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.740
some context, estimates vary, but the
average American uses 80 to 100 gallons

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.580
of water a day. There's a really nice
bathtub in the room, but don't even think

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.149
about taking a bath during a water
crisis like this. You're not allowed to.

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.830
In fact, the hotel staff have removed the
plug so you can't even fill the tub. It

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.610
would be a lot of water, of course.
Estimates are about 36 gallons of water

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.479
just to fill a full bathtub. Newer
toilets can use about one and a half

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.350
gallons of water per flush, but older
ones can use up to 4 gallons per

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.979
flush. And there's one message here in
Cape Town that they're constantly

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.409
reinforcing, and that is: If it's yellow, let
it mellow. So basically the amount of

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.479
water that Capetonians are each being
asked to use per day adds up to: two hand

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.850
washings, to teeth brushings, a two-minute shower, one toilet flush, a half-

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.469
gallon of drinking water and one cooked
meal. To get a sense of how locals are

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:59.600
changing their ways, I visited Anita and got a tour of the conservation system she's implemented in her home.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.880
When we shower, we catch the water and then use

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.549
the water to flush the toilets. We don't
flush the toilet if it's yellow, but if

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.450
it's brown, then we do flush the toilet.
So two or three times a day, maybe, this

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.500
toilet gets flushed, and do it by it's
pouring the water down the toilet like

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.980
that. And what I even do is when we
turn on the shower, you know the first

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.760
shower water is cold. And you're not
standing under it, but it's perfectly

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.630
good water, so I fill up this with the
first shower water and I put it here, and

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.549
we use that for brushing our teeth over
here. And then, as the water gets warm, we

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.000
start to shower and we catch that, and I've got buckets here for the toilet.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.780
What's your showering schedule like now?

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.520
We still shower when we need gray water. So if we're running out of water to flush the toilet,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.860
we have a shower. But it works out to sort of once every two or three days, we'll have a proper shower.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.620
But very fast. When we were practicing, I'd get my

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.549
husband to time me, and I showered in
45 seconds. It takes about a minute if

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.920
I'm washing my hair as well. But you
learn to stop–start your shower.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.880
Prior to the drought, how regularly were you showering?

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.340
Once or twice a day, even, yes.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.440
How has this changed your perspective on how we use water?

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.400
Well, I don't think we'll ever go back to our old ways. I think I'll always reuse my clothes

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.980
now, as much as possible, because it's
actually fine. I think it was just bad habits of

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.040
washing things over and over. Also, I
really don't think I'll ever flush my

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.030
toilet again with beautiful drinking
water. You can think for years we've

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.220
been flushing our toilets with beautiful
drinking water.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.220
You're not the first person to tell me that.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.340
When we wash dishes, I use the spring water. Or cooking, I use the spring water.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.420
I've bought this to help rinse dishes. It's a high-pressure hose. So I give it a bit of ...

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.660
pump it a few times here, you do that, and you can rinse dishes.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.640
Rather than using rather than using the tap.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.420
So for dinner, we've been eating like
this. So eating our food on here, and then

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.160
after dinner just throwing away the plate, and sometimes we've just wipe the plate with a wet wipe.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.680
Same goes for their hands.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.960
So I've given every member of family a little bag like this, and in the bag we've got a little mini bag of

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.860
wet wipes, we've got some tissues and
we've got some waterless hand cleaner.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.340
Anita is now also collecting rainwater.
What level would you say it's at right now?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.060
There.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.760
It's here?

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.380
It's about half, yes.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.040
And if it gets to this point, then ...

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.000
At that point municipal water will come in, yes.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.960
Ideally, what level do you want it at?

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.840
Top all the time.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.040
When was the last time it was this high?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.160
Well, our neighbors have offered us borehole water, so what we do now is I've got a real long hose pipe

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.789
from our neighbor's property
and we bring it across and in and we

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.830
fill it up. What I also do now is, if rain
is forecast, I suddenly start using

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.310
more water because I want to make space in my tank. People talk about rain as if

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.020
we're farmers now, and it's it's wonderful,
this connection we have again with with

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.020
nature and the earth, which I think we lost
in the city.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:08.700
Everywhere I went in Cape Town, I was reminded to conserve. Even in popular tourist areas like the V&amp;A

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.620
Waterfront. Here is this fixture in the
middle of the waterfront that says, "How

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.819
Will the Water Crisis Affect You?" You
actually go inside and it's a bit

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.349
interactive, "Tell us what you're doing to
save water #waterheroes." Here it

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:29.080
gives you an idea of how much water is
used per activity. So laundry uses 14

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.009
liters, cooking 3 liters of water right
there,

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.650
toilet flushing 9 liters. Right next to
it saying, let it mellow if it's yellow,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.610
number one, and flush it with gray
water, so not the clean water. So really

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.969
everywhere you go in this city, you look
up, you look down, there are reminders

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.190
about Day Zero and urging everyone to
reduce their water usage. Public

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:55.449
bathrooms don't even give you the option
to waste water. All the fixtures of the

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.080
sinks have been removed. There are signs
that say that washing hands is

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.370
prohibited. Another sign here pointing
out that due to the drought and water

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:07.719
crisis, showers and some taps have been
disconnected. Instead, people are using

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:13.569
hand sanitizer over there. Some artists
have even created playlists to help you

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:18.490
time your shorter showers. It's all part
of a comprehensive effort to save water

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.620
that I found myself taking part in, like
a local. So if I was a resident and I ran

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:26.860
out of my water, I'd be back here at this
natural spring at the foot of the

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.210
mountain to refill my jugs again. This is
how Capetonians are dealing with their

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.600
water crisis and their severe drought,
and it really makes you rethink

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.480
how you use water and your relationship
to it every single day.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.940
And who knows – my city could be next, and so could yours.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.780
Hi guys, it's Dena. Thanks for watching our

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.020
series from South Africa. Make sure to
come back next Tuesday for another video.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.480
I'm coming to you from Flint, Michigan
where the water crisis here is far from over.
