00:00:00.024 --> 00:00:02.190
What I want to do in this
video is talk a little bit

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.560
about polynomial end behavior.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.310
And this is really
just talking about what

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.230
happens to a polynomial if
as x becomes really large

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.250
or really, really,
really negative.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.700
For example, we're familiar
with quadratic polynomials where

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.440
y is equal to ax
squared plus bx plus c.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.160
We know that if a
is greater than 0,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.811
this is going to be an upward
opening parabola of some kind.

00:00:28.811 --> 00:00:30.560
So it's going to look
something like that,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.240
the graph of this equation,
or of this function,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.200
you could say.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.389
And if a is less
than 0, it's going

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:39.805
to be a downward
opening parabola.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.570
We've spent less time with
third degree polynomials,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.310
but we've also seen
those a little bit.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.020
So for example, if you have
the third degree polynomial,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:59.330
y is equal to ax to the third
plus bx squared plus cx plus d,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.500
if a is greater than 0-- I don't
want to use that brown color.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.710
If a is greater than 0,
when x is really, really,

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.090
really negative, this whole
thing is going to be really,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.360
really, really negative.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.730
And then it's going to increase
as x becomes less negative.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.540
It's going do
something-- it might

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.630
do a little bit of
funky stuff in between.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.400
But then as x becomes more
and more and more positive,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.930
it will become more and more
and more positive as well.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.900
So it might look something like
this when a is greater than 0.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.800
But what about when
a is less than 0?

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.040
Well then, just like
here, we would flip it.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.180
We would flip it so that
if a is less than 0,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.290
when x is really
negative, you're

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.282
going to multiply that
times a negative a

00:01:50.282 --> 00:01:51.990
and you're going to
get a positive value.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.100
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.980
And then it's going
to go like this.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.740
It might do a little bit of this
type of business in between.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.950
But then its end behavior,
it starts decreasing again.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.540
It starts decreasing.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.660
So when we talk
about end behavior,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.330
we're talking about the idea
of what is this function?

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.190
What does this polynomial do
as x becomes really, really,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.300
really, really positive
and as x becomes really,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.680
really, really, really negative?

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.065
And kind of fully recognizing
that some weird things might

00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:19.190
be happening in the middle.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.689
But we just want
to think about what

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:23.440
happens at extreme values of x.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.320
Now obviously for
the second degree

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.630
polynomial nothing really
weird happens in the middle.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.380
But for a third
degree polynomial,

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.600
we sort of see that
some interesting things

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.320
can start happening
in the middle.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.650
But the end behavior for
third degree polynomial

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.300
is that if a is
greater than 0-- we're

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.540
starting really small,
really low values--

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.870
and as a becomes positive,
we get to really high values.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.130
If a is less than 0
we have the opposite.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.620
And these are kind of the two
prototypes for polynomials.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.160
Because from there we can
start thinking about any degree

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.380
polynomial.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.990
So let's just think about the
situation of a fourth degree

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.280
polynomial.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.600
So let's say y is equal
to ax to the fourth power

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.360
plus bx to the third plus cx
squared plus dx plus-- I don't

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.080
want to write e because e has
other meanings in mathematics.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.704
I'll say plus-- I'm really
running out of letters here.

00:03:21.704 --> 00:03:23.870
I'll just use f, although
this isn't the function f.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.230
This is just a constant
f right over here.

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.860
So let's just think about
what this might look like.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.409
Let's think about
its end behavior,

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.700
and we could think about it
relative to a second degree

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.040
polynomial.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.690
So its end behavior, if x is
really, really, really, really

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.400
negative, x to the fourth is
still going to be positive.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.345
And if a is greater than 0
when x is really, really,

00:03:46.345 --> 00:03:48.470
really negative, we're
going to have really, really

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.920
positive values, just
like a second degree.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.274
And when x is really
positive, same thing.

00:03:55.274 --> 00:03:56.940
x to the fourth is
going to be positive,

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.870
times a is still
going to be positive.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.050
So its end behavior
is going to look

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:05.280
very similar to a second
degree polynomial.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280
Now, it might do--
in fact it probably

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.060
will do some funky
stuff in between.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.570
It might do something that looks
kind of like that in between.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.220
But we care about
the end behavior.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.430
I guess you could call
the stuff that I've dotted

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.050
lined in the middle, this is
called the non-end behavior,

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.390
the middle behavior.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.680
This will obviously be
different than a second degree

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.540
polynomial.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.560
But what happens at the
ends will be the same.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.530
And the reason why, when
you square something,

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.321
or you raise something
to the fourth power,

00:04:34.321 --> 00:04:37.470
you raise anything to any even
power for a very large-- as

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.540
long as a is greater than 0,
for very large positive values,

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.040
you're going to get
positive values.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.182
And for very large
negative values,

00:04:44.182 --> 00:04:46.140
you're going to get very
large positive values.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.665
You take a negative number,
raise it to the fourth power,

00:04:48.665 --> 00:04:52.020
or the second power, you're
going to get a positive value.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.300
Likewise, if a is
less than 0, you're

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.070
going to have very similar
end behavior to this case.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.520
For a polynomial where
the highest degree

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.980
term is even-- so this is
a is less than 0-- your end

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.259
behavior when a is really,
really, really, really

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:11.050
negative, this thing
is going to be really,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:12.150
really, really positive.

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.850
We're going to be multiplying
it times a negative,

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.750
so it's going to
be really, really,

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.040
really, really negative.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.350
So it'll look like this.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.992
And likewise, when x is really,
really, really positive,

00:05:20.992 --> 00:05:21.950
you get the same thing.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.366
Because you're going to be
multiplying a positive times a,

00:05:24.366 --> 00:05:26.010
which is negative,
and in between it

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.140
might be doing
something like that.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.090
But its end
behavior, you see, is

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.530
very similar to a second
degree polynomial.

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.320
So if you ignore this, its
end behavior is very similar.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.330
Now the same is true
for a fifth degree

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:45.530
if you were to compare
it to a third degree.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:51.040
And the overall idea here is
what happens to this value when

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.000
we get really large x's
or really small x's?

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.590
Are we taking it
to an even power?

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.240
In which case for either really
negative values or really

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.760
positive values we're going
to get positive values.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.740
And then it depends what
our coefficient a is.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.420
Or are we taking
it to an odd power?

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.380
So the general
idea-- and actually

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.460
let me just do a fifth degree,
just to make the clear.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.100
So if I had something
of the form y

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.209
is equal to ax to the fifth
plus bx to the fourth plus--

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:21.750
and it just went all the way--
I won't even have to write it.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.139
This thing, if a
is greater than 0,

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:28.430
would look something like this.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.420
Its end behavior is very similar
to a third degree polynomial

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.990
where a is greater than 0.

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.310
At the end it would do this.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:45.470
Now, it might do kind of
some craziness like this.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.810
I have to get this right.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:51.580
So 1, 2, 3-- it might do some
craziness like this in between.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.080
But then for really large x's
it will look the same as ax

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.050
to the third when a
is greater than 0.

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.830
So once again, very,
very similar end behavior

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.060
when a is greater than
0, and very similar

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.140
end behavior when
a is less than 0.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.140
It would look like this.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.960
At the ends at a
negative value it

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.699
will be positive
because this part

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:13.990
is going to be really negative.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.073
But then it's going to be
multiplied by a negative

00:07:16.073 --> 00:07:16.830
to get a positive.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.170
And for really positive values
of x, it will be negative.

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:23.270
Because once again, this a
term is going to be negative.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.500
And then what it does
in between-- at least

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.030
for the sake of
this video-- we're

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.590
not really thinking about.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.687
So the big takeaway
here-- and this

00:07:30.687 --> 00:07:32.270
is kind of a little
bit of a drum roll

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.560
here, we're talking
about end behavior--

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.050
if you're looking at an
even degree polynomial

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.120
it's going to have end
behavior like a second degree

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.680
polynomial.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.150
If you ignore what happens
in the middle, what

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.760
happens at really negative
values of x and really positive

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.240
values of x is going to be
very similar to a second degree

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.360
polynomial.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.460
And if your degree
is odd, you're

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.950
going to have very similar
end behavior to a third degree

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.737
polynomial.

00:07:58.737 --> 00:08:00.820
You might do all sorts of
craziness in the middle,

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.695
but given for a given a,
whether it's greater than 0

00:08:03.695 --> 00:08:06.920
or less than 0, you will
have end behavior like this,

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.800
or end behavior like that.
