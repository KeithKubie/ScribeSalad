00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.530
Running.

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.530
Screaming.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:03.570
Terrified squeals.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:04.590
Hoards of feet.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:05.689
It’s the apocalypse.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.839
You know this music, but science thinks we’ve
got the tempo all wrong.

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:13.480
If the apocalypse hits… what would really
happen?

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.570
Would we help each other out and become our
best selves, or fall into horribleness and

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.570
lash out?

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.750
I mean, sure there’s Lord of the Flies,
Walking Dead, and other apocalyptic horror

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:24.750
stories.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.050
But they’re just that!

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.710
Horror stories!

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.430
In reality, tragedy and disaster brings out
more kindness than cruelty.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.809
One study said [quote] “most people respond
positively and generously.”

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.329
For example, in a 1986 study of a theater
fire they found, 44 percent of people didn’t

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.220
even think the fire was real.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.640
In fact, even if they saw smoke most people
took their time escaping the theater, and

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.399
would gather into groups to escape -- it wasn’t
every human for humanself.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.690
On top of that, many went back into the building!

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.550
What the heck!

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.889
Studies find cooperation is inherent to humans,
and cooperation breeds benevolence -- the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:07.689
idea that both the giver and receiver see
a benefit (we’ll come back to this in a

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:08.840
second).

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.490
What you think will happen in horrible situations
is running and screaming -- but what actually

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.380
happens isn’t literal fight-or-flight, but
rather (according to studies) a seeking of

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.590
familiar persons or places.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.229
This is definitely what I saw post-9/11.

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.590
In 2001, everyone called their loved ones.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.590
Every.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.590
One.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.170
Not everyone had a cell phone, but students
(who paid by the minute) shared phones with

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.070
strangers to help them reach out.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.670
This is rooted in attachment theory.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.909
In the 1950s and 60s two psychologists Ainsworth
and Bowlby discovered humans crave social

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:42.909
attachment.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:43.909
I know, right?

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.930
They felt children should experience “warm,
intimate and continuous” relationships to

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.621
thrive... which was the opposite of what people
thought at the time.

00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:57.329
It was a surprise that attachment breeds comfort
and happiness… that social interaction keeps

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.329
us calm.

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.400
We’re getting through this together.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.690
And this is reflected (anecdotally) after
disasters... way more than antisocial behavior.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.070
Sure, panics and negative behavior happen,
but it’s not like everyone (or even a large

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.939
percentage) start being all Game of Thrones.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.490
People help each other waaay more, and LOTS
of reports show this.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.640
Post- 9/11, and the 7/7 bombings; post-tsunami
in Asia, even after the most recent attack

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.069
in Manchester -- people band together.

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.450
Humans volunteer, donate, and help their fellow
humans.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.510
After hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, hotels
and strangers took in homeless families.

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.400
Local volunteers came to clean up.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.959
People put power strips on sidewalks, businesses
gave free food, and neighborhoods held social

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.590
events to improve morale.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.080
After 9/11, homicides in Manhattan dropped
by as much as 60 percent according to USAToday.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.100
What increased?

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.129
Blood donations, first time donors increased
drastically.

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.570
And after the San Francisco earthquake in
‘89, blood donation increased 200 percent.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.850
And remember benevolence?

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.269
Blood donation doesn’t just support the
receiver, it also gives the donor a sense

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.659
of doing good -- maybe hearkening back to
social attachment?

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.480
And sure, some of this could be anecdotal,
there are some people who are antisocial and

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.180
you see them on the news.

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.610
Antisocial societal breakdown gets ratings!

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.210
People like those stories.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:18.690
But the perpetrators are a tiny subset of
the population.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.010
Most humans are calm, caring, and want to
be with their people.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.120
And a recent study supports this even more.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.740
When researchers followed 80,000 people through
an apocalyptic scenario in a video game -- expecting

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.769
panic and breakdown they found [quote] “most
players exhibited prosocial behavior such

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:37.690
as strengthening existing social relationships
and forming new ones” as the apocalypse

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.690
set in.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.710
Plus, remember, out here in the land of the
real, you don’t get a second life.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.799
There are no 1-Ups.

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.739
And they still behaved prosocially.

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.049
Their apocalypse was calm and friendly, without
a single spiked bat to be seen.

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.079
Ours probably would be too.

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.620
Turns Out “Keep Calm and Carry On” is
Scientifically Accurate.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.110
Next time you call your mom after a tragedy,
take solace in the fact, that you’re not

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.530
alone -- on so many levels.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.890
And look, whether or not the apocalypse happens,
people need donations.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.239
Will you still get help if you’re a donor?

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.379
(Yes, you will) What exactly happens to your
organs after you give them up?

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.370
Find out everything in this video!

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.700
Who would you call if you found out an asteroid
would destroy earth next month?

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.970
What would you do?

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.970
