00:00:02.567 --> 00:00:04.867
INTERVIEWER: I'm on my way to
meet a man who has been chosen

00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:08.800
to lead his people in an
epic struggle, one that also

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.467
requires super human endurance.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.567
He's asked me to come to
Devils Tower in Wyoming.

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:27.700
This is Chief Arvol
Looking Horse,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.633
the Chosen One of the Nakota,
Lakota, and Dakota tribes.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:35.000
[music playing]

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:45.400
CHIEF ARVOL LOOKING HORSE:
[non-english speech]

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.000
INTERVIEWER: Aha.
[non-english speech]

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.834
I brought him a gift of tobacco
for his sacred ceremony.

00:00:51.834 --> 00:00:52.867
CHIEF ARVOL LOOKING HORSE: Oho.

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:54.500
Thank you.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.433
INTERVIEWER: So chief, tell
me, why did you want me to meet

00:01:00.433 --> 00:01:03.867
you here at Devil's Tower?

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.967
CHIEF ARVOL LOOKING HORSE: We
call it [non-english speech].

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:07.667
INTERVIEWER:
[non-english speech]

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.266
CHIEF ARVOL LOOKING HORSE: Ah,
that's one of our power points

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.166
of prayer, of worship.

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.900
It's like a church.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.800
This is where white
Buffalo Calf Woman brought

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.333
the sacred pipe to our people.

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:29.900
So the story is that
19 generations ago

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.734
our people were camped here.

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:35.367
At the time, there was no
more food because people

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:36.400
were abusing life.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.934
From a distance
they saw a cloud.

00:01:43.934 --> 00:01:47.367
And then, from that
cloud there's a woman.

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:50.400
She brought the sacred pipe.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.200
She said, I'm bringing
this sacred bundle

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.333
to you that you shall
live in peace and harmony.

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:01.734
[non-english speech]

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:13.100
INTERVIEWER: The White Buffalo
Calf Woman taught Chief Arvol's

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.533
people how to
respect Mother Earth

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:18.133
and worship the Great Spirit
with the sacred pipe she

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:18.834
gave them.

00:02:22.266 --> 00:02:23.266
Does it still exist?

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:24.300
CHIEF ARVOL LOOKING HORSE: Yes.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.166
Since the age of
12 years old, I've

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:31.066
been the keeper of the sacred
White Buffalo Calf Bundle,

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:32.233
or pipe.

00:02:32.233 --> 00:02:34.834
They call me
[non-english speech].

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:36.200
INTERVIEWER:
[non-english speech]

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.633
CHIEF ARVOL LOOKING HORSE:
Mm, [non-english speech]

00:02:39.633 --> 00:02:42.300
INTERVIEWER: The White
Buffalo Calf pipe is so sacred

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300
that Chief Arvol
cannot let anyone

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.600
outside of his tribes see it.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.500
So your grandmother was
the keeper of the pipe.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.867
CHIEF ARVOL LOOKING HORSE: Yeah.

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:57.266
INTERVIEWER: She said that
you were to be next in line?

00:02:57.266 --> 00:02:58.533
CHIEF ARVOL LOOKING HORSE: Yes.

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:03.900
My grandmother, on her
deathbed, she told my family,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.500
we are the crossroads.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.000
Earth changes, climate changes.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.567
And that if the people
don't straighten up,

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:13.734
then he shall be the
last bundle keeper.
