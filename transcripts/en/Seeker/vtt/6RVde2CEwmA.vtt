00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.159
Do glasses really make us smarter?

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.500
Or does our intelligence predict our need
for glasses?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:15.379
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if you’ve
ever seen Revenge of the Nerds, or really,

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.330
any movie ever made - then you’ve probably
wondered, why do the nerds always wear glasses?

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.990
Is their eyesight REALLY worse, or are the
dumb jocks just too proud to wear them?

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.290
Well, like everything else out there - science
has an answer.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.640
And this one - is kinda surprising.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.430
Researchers at the Mainz University Medical
Center have conducted the first population-based

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.890
study on nearsightedness (people who can’t
see far away), and they found that environmental

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.760
factors may have more to do with it, than
genetics.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.710
Now as far as eyesight problems go, nearsightedness
is one of the most common afflictions worldwide.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.470
It can affect children from a very young age,
but our eyeballs continue to grow well into

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.730
adulthood - so even in our 30s, it can still
get worse.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.600
In more severe cases, it can lead to all kinds
of complications, like retinal detachment,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.870
macular degeneration, premature cataracts,
and glaucoma.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.609
So it’s in our best interest to figure out
what causes this, and how we can prevent it.

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:10.200
Unfortunately, the answer - may not be the
one we want.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.530
For their study, researchers examined almost
5,000 patients with nearsightedness, and found

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.530
that myopia - the technical term for the affliction
- becomes more prevalent, the higher your

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.530
level of education.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.960
24% of the patients with nearsightedness - had
no formal high school education, compared

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.969
to 35% of high school and vocational graduates,
and 53% of university graduates.

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.640
What’s more, they found that nearsightedness
actually increases, for each year of school

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.640
completed.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.590
Now it’s commonly accepted that genetics
play a massive role in our ability to see

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.829
- and that’s true to an extent.

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.109
But this study also examined 45 genetic markers
associated with myopia, and found that even

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.719
those have a way lower impact on the severity
of the disease, than education level.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:54.849
So why is this happening?

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.689
Well, the current consensus is that the activities
we partake in at school - like reading, looking

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.679
at a whiteboard, or using a computer - are
rapidly deteriorating our vision.

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.399
But what can be done?

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.149
After all, we can’t “cure” nearsightedness
- we can only correct it, but even things

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.700
like corrective lenses and contacts - are
largely unsuccessful.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.599
Some recent studies, have suggested that the
key to preventing myopia in children - is

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.209
exposure to sunlight.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.360
So they recommend kids spend at least 15 hours
a week outdoors, and try to limit their time

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.870
with close-up activities, like TV and video
games, to 30 hours a week.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.850
Now I know what you’re thinking - only 30
hours a week for video games?

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:31.850
That’s like, nothing!

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.850
You’re right.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.519
And if you agree - then perhaps you’ll appreciate
this blatant plug for another channel I host,

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:37.519
called Rev3Games.

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.689
It’s a channel for gamers, by gamers - and
we do all kinds of stuff, including reviews,

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.400
previews, Casual Friday - which is a show
where we sit around and drink beer and talk

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.269
about what’s happening in the industry…

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.329
It’s a lot of fun!

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.799
And we’re always looking for new subscribers,
so if you like games - please go check us

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:54.799
