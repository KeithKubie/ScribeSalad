Thank you Greg. Now, as you may know, the rate at which we consume energy is

00:00:04.406 --> 00:00:09.282
known as metabolism. When our energy stores and blood sugar levels have been

00:00:09.282 --> 00:00:13.720
depleted, we have drives that tell us to replenish, and we do so by eating.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.610
Hunger has four biological components. And those are the stomach, blood, brain

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:25.127
and hormones and neurochemicals. In addition to CCK, some other hormones

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:30.891
suppress appetite where as others stimulate it. Among those that suppress

00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:36.344
appetite are leptin, peptide yy and insulin. Insulin has a very important

00:00:36.344 --> 00:00:42.254
effect on hunger and its produced by the pancreas. As we eat, our blood glucose

00:00:42.254 --> 00:00:48.138
levels rise, and insulin is produced. Insulin transports glucose out of the

00:00:48.138 --> 00:00:53.920
blood and into the cells for energy use. As a result of increases in blood

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.093
glucose and insulin, hunger decreases.
