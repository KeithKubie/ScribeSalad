have to come to grips with the fact that

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250
have to come to grips with the fact that
 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.220
have to come to grips with the fact that
there are now multiple global languages

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230
there are now multiple global languages

said earlier we have to also know math
