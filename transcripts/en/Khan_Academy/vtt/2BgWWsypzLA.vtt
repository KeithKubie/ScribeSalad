00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.360
Let's say we have the
repeating decimal 0.4008,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.475
where the digits 4008
keep on repeating.

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.850
So if we were to
write it out, it

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.141
would look something like this.

00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:19.790
0.400840084008, and it
keeps on going forever.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.070
What I want you to do right
now is pause the video

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.778
and think about whether
you can represent

00:00:23.778 --> 00:00:26.250
this repeating decimal
as an infinite sum,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.880
as an infinite series.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.770
And then think about
whether that infinite series

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.554
is a geometric series.

00:00:33.554 --> 00:00:35.220
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.840
So let's think about it.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.500
So for each term of
my infinite series,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.310
I'm going to represent one
of these repeating patterns

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.210
of 4008.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.570
So, for example, I will make
this 4008 my first term.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.460
So this could be viewed as 0.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.060
And this 4008 represents 0.4008.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.860
Then I could make this
4008 my next term,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.760
or my next term will
represent this 4008.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:15.130
And this 4008 is the
same thing as 0.00004008.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.140
And then this next
4008, well, that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.200
represents 0 point-- and
we have eight zeroes--

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.380
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 4008, 4008.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.259
And then we would just keep
on going like that forever.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.550
So we're just going to keep
on going like that forever.

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.490
So hopefully there's
a pattern here.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.560
We're essentially throwing
four zeroes before the decimal

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.880
every time.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.026
And we can just keep on
going like that forever.

00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:46.150
So this is an infinite sum.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.750
It's an infinite series.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.770
The next question is, is
this a geometric series?

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.750
Well, in order for it to
be a geometric series,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.290
to go from one term
to the next, you

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.450
must be multiplying
by the same value,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.810
by the same common ratio.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.420
So what are we multiplying when
we go from 0.4008 to this one

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.120
right over here, where we add
four zeros before the 4008?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.960
What are we multiplying?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.490
Well, we moved the decimal
four spots to the left.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.230
So we're multiplying by
10 to the negative fourth.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.980
Or you could view it
as we're multiplying

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.581
by 0.0001, 10 to the
negative 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:26.330
To go from here to
here, well, same thing.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.820
Move the decimal four
places to the left.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.331
So once again, we're
multiplying by 0.0001.

00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:35.830
And so it looks
pretty clear that we

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.540
have a common ratio of 10 to
the negative fourth power.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.750
So we can rewrite
all of this business

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:51.180
as 0.4008 times our common
ratio for this first term

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.980
times our common ratio of
10 to the negative fourth

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.310
to the 0-th power--
so that gives us

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.040
that right over there--
plus 0.4008 times 10

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.840
to the negative fourth
to the first power.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.560
And that gives us that
value right over there.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:19.900
Plus 0.4008 times 10 to the
negative 4 to the second power.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.885
And we keep on going.

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:23.010
And so in this form, it
looks a little bit clearer,

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.400
like a geometric series, an
infinite geometric series.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.150
And if we wanted to write
that out with sigma notation,

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.510
we could write this
as the sum from k

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.825
equals 0 to infinity
of, well, what's

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:38.950
our first term going to be?

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:49.981
It's going to be 0.4008
times our common ratio, which

00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:52.230
we could write out as either
10 to the negative fourth

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.290
or 0.0001.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.450
I'll just write it as 10
to the negative fourth.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.120
10 to the negative fourth to the
k-th power, to the k-th power.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.910
So the next
interesting question--

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.980
this clearly can be represented
as a geometric series--

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.064
is, well, what is the sum?

00:04:09.064 --> 00:04:10.646
You might say, well,
that's just going

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:12.280
to be 4008 repeating
over and over.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.220
But I want to express
it as a fraction.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.936
And so I want you
to pause the video.

00:04:15.936 --> 00:04:17.810
Use what would you
already know about finding

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.269
the sum of an infinite
geometric series

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.390
to try to express this thing
right over here as a fraction.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.960
So I'm assuming
you've had a go at it.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.480
So let's think about it.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.930
We've already
seen, we've already

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.140
derived in previous
videos, that the sum

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.240
of an infinite
geometric series--

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.880
let me do this in
a neutral color.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.620
If I have a series like this,
k equals 0 to infinity of ar

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.500
to the k power, that this sum
is going to be equal to a over 1

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.720
minus r.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.360
We've derived this actually
in several other videos.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.040
So in this case, this
is going to be-- well,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.480
our a here is 0.4008.

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.590
And it's going to be that over 1
minus our common ratio, minus--

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:14.500
and I'll write it like this--
0.0001, 1 ten thousandth.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.040
So what's this going to be?

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.240
Well, this is going to be
the same thing as 0.4008.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.250
If you take 1 minus
1 ten thousandths,

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.545
or you could do this as
10,000 ten thousandths minus 1

00:05:27.545 --> 00:05:42.177
ten thousandth, you're going
to have 9,999 ten thousandths.

00:05:42.177 --> 00:05:44.260
Once again, you could
view-- let me write this out

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.790
just so this doesn't
look confusing.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.770
1 is the same thing
as 10,000/10,000.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.150
And you're subtracting 1/10,000.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.520
And so you're going
to get 9,999/10,000.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.760
And so this is going
to be the same thing

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.690
as 0.4008 times 10,000.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:17.880
So times 10,000 over 9,999.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.460
Well, what's this top
number times 10,000?

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.870
Well that's just going
to give us 4,008.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:31.500
4,008 over 9,999.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.600
And we've just expressed
that repeating decimal

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.860
as a fraction.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:35.740
So we have succeeded.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.400
And you might say, well, maybe
we can simplify this thing.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.907
And so let's see.

00:06:39.907 --> 00:06:41.740
This is already a
fraction, so we've already

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.640
kind of achieved it.

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.500
But if we want to get
a little bit simpler.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.930
Let's see, if we add the
digits up here, 4 plus 8 is 12

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:48.170
and 1 plus 2 is 3.

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.360
So this up here
is divisible by 3.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.150
And this down here is
clearly divisible by 3.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.090
So let's divide
both of them by 3.

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.860
So 3 goes into
4,008-- let's see.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.780
It goes into 4 one time,
subtract, you get a 10.

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.000
3 times 3 is 9.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.720
Subtract, you get another 10.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.980
Goes into 3 times.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.480
3 times 3 is 9.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.550
Subtract.

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:13.740
Bring down an 8.

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.550
3 into 18 exactly six times.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.760
So our numerator is 1,336.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.770
This is no longer
divisible by 3.

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.270
The sum of the digits
is not divisible by 3,

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.090
it's not a multiple of 3.

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:34.760
And if you divide this bottom
number by 3, you get 3,333.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.180
And I think we
have simplified it.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:41.150
I think we can simplified
it about as well as we can.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.470
Well, we could check more.

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.600
Let me know if I didn't.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.290
But either way, we
have now written this.

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:47.240
This was pretty neat.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.924
We saw that a
repeating decimal can

00:07:48.924 --> 00:07:50.840
be represented not just
as an infinite series,

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.040
but as an infinite
geometric series.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.440
And then we were able to use
the formula that we derived

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:57.650
for the sum of an
infinite geometric series

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.840
to actually express
it as a fraction.
