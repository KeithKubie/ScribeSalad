Speaker 1:          00:00          I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and this hour, well the honeymoon's over at Galapagos, this is the place where Darwin began to develop his theory of evolution and it's the place 170 year or maybe 180 years later where our producer Tim Howard landed wearing fishnets and a bad brains tee shirt like to find, to find a very different landscape than what Darwin saw. And we just told you a story about how far humans are willing to go to protect something. This next part, it's about how far we're willing to go to get something back that we've already lost to sort of restore a place and a creature to its quote, wild state. This story unfolds on one of Galapagos is most northern islands where they also had to get rid of some goats. It's called Pinta. Pinta is, was a very special place. This is James Gibbs, professor of conservation biology at the State University of New York. It's one of those islands. It's not part of any tourist visitation site. So there are no people there. And, uh, when you set foot first on Pinto, you immediately sense sure.

Speaker 2:          01:09          [inaudible] birds,

Speaker 3:          01:11          the problem is on a, things were spinning out of control, the vegetation was growing wild, the forest was getting overgrown with the wrong kind of plant and the whole ecosystem was just teetering out of balance.

Speaker 1:          01:28          And one of the reasons for this according to Linda Coyote is that we had an island with no tortoises because tortoises are, are sort of like the lawnmowers, you know, they, they plow down vegetation, disperse seeds, but for centuries had been hunted by those whalers. And in about 1906, the pinto tortoise went extinct. 1906, yeah. Little over a hundred years ago. They don't know the exact date, but then one evening in March of 1972,

Speaker 3:          01:59          Oh yes, this fellow, she h he's a well known tortoise researcher. He was on Santa Cruz island having dinner with some friends on regard to chattering about tours. And one of the people he's eating with says, Hey, uh, I was recently on Pinna island collecting snails and I saw this tortoise

Speaker 4:          02:16          and I thought, do you know what you have done the readout for this is the f a hundred years

Speaker 1:          02:22          he and some national park rangers race out to Pinta

Speaker 3:          02:26          and there it was this beautiful children, one male tortoise, maybe 50 years old. They weren't sure they'd eventually named Him George Lonesome George. But at the time the immediate question was of any mole

Speaker 1:          02:39          because if they could find a female for George, then they could, you know, maybe d extinct the species.

Speaker 4:          02:46          So they poked around in the areas where we got the one and I found a shell of a female dead animal. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Well how had, how had this female tort died?

Speaker 4:          03:00          Uh, someone chopped it in half. No, see the marks where it was just chopped up. I felt violent. I wanted to borrow someone's gun. I'd gone kill the person.

Speaker 1:          03:14          Everyone held out hopes for just finding more tortoises back. James says they kept going back, combing the island with highly trained tortoise, sniffing dogs. But in the end there was just, George then shifted the focus on, now what do we do? We then went to a wolf volcano island next door and collected two females, two females that sort of looked like George but weren't quite the same species. And we put them with George to see if we could get him to breed. He never did, wasn't interested, so they thought, hmm, maybe he needs a pinto lady. So now of course there are no female tortoises on Pinto, but they thought, you know, maybe a zoo somewhere or private collection has on, cause you really never know. So they called around, offered huge cash rewards. People sent in dozens of tortoises. But Linda took one look at them and was like, no, no, no, no, they weren't Pintos.

Speaker 1:          04:04          So then they thought, we've got to take matters into our own hands. Basically what you do is you sit at the back of the tortoise and first you have to get to where they'll allow you to touch them. Um, and eventually you start, um, you know, fondling their, their legs and tails and, and hoping to get them to ejaculate. And had a volunteer working with me. Her name was favorite Greek Joni. She worked with him every other day or so for a few months and was never successful. We were, uh, really starting to get kind of desperate about options and James says, in a way it was a paradox because on the one hand, awesome, we have an actual living Pinta island tortoise, but on the other hand, he might've actually been like the worst possible candidate for last of his kind. He seemed to really like to keep to himself. He never really liked other tortoises much. He didn't seem to like that humans. And maybe that's why he survived. He wasn't curious. Yes. James says a lot of tortoises right here, your footsteps, they raised their heads, they come out to see what's going on and then they get whacked. Yeah. In any case, for about 40 years, scientists read everything humanly possible to get loaned some George to meet with another tortoise so they could resurrect the species and bring Pinta island back to its original state. Nothing worked.

Speaker 5:          05:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:27          until one day in July of 2008. George turns to the two female tortoises that he had been ignoring for years. And he says, doc, inexplicably, he just suddenly decides to mate with both of them, each lay eggs. Two clutches were ultimately laid in his corral and the scientists are like, George got our hopes up dramatically, but they ultimately were in shurtell

Speaker 6:          06:03          mother

Speaker 1:          06:06          in mid eighties. They were having a meeting about this. That's conservation is Josh Donlin again, whole bunch of herpetologists were out there and some island conservationists, and they're talking about what to do Pinta and they can't get lonesome George to reproduce, which are hoping to do because then they could build a Pinta population and put it on panels. And he says that as a meaning wore on, it got tense. Oh, for sure. In fact, one guy spoke

Speaker 7:          06:28          Harry Green. I'm a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University

Speaker 1:          06:32          said that at this meeting there was one guy who just couldn't take it.

Speaker 7:          06:35          Oh, all I remember is him just fuming. He sat there getting more and more and more frustrated. Then finally, he just blurted out, shoot that tortoise and, uh, quit wasting our time.

Speaker 8:          06:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:52          because in his view this, the single individual was holding up this huge conservation [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          06:58          and of course the shock was there was a way went around the room when he said that. I recall seeing sort of second wave as the Spanish translation passed around the room

Speaker 1:          07:07          and really what that guy was specifically saying was, don't be precious as a tourist, as a tourist is a tortoise. Let's just take some tortoises from a nearby island and put them back on Pinto, but there's a much bigger question here that goes way beyond gloves, which is basically like what is the right way to protect nature? Now people are right now throwing beers at each other around what is the right strategy.

Speaker 1:          07:34          Josh says that there are basically two camps right now on the one side you've got this classic like what you might call Eden approach conservation biology. It's foundation is this idea of pristine wilderness from the very beginning. I think all of us, well, I can't speak for other people but, but you always have this idea of wanting to get it back to some kind of pre human condition. Every human being. The operative word and, and if you think about it, we all have this, we all have this, this picture of what we want to bring it all back to, you know, it might be like the planes just covered with buffalo or maybe the Serengeti desert with lions and elephants, or maybe it's 10,000 hammerhead sharks, but whatever the scene is that just doesn't have any people but is carrying that idea, those pictures of your head even like useful anymore.

Speaker 1:          08:27          It's like so Sanuk no, but it just seems so unrealistic. Right? But I mean in the bigger picture, you can make the argument that humans now affect every square meter of the earth. There's no place, no matter how remote we get, you can go to the North Pole. It's been affected by human activity. You can go, I don't know, the depths of the impenetrable jungle. It's been affected by human activity. That's how they dream is she's an environmental law professor at the Berkeley School of law in you're radically remaking the world. And the question is what's our responsibility? And it brings us to our second school of thought, which in its most extreme version goes something like this. We're God, we might as well get good at it and we're going to have to create these ecosystems based on our best science. And you could argue we're going to have to get a whole lot better at making some very, very difficult decisions. Climate

Speaker 9:          09:27          change seems to mean that a lot of species are pretty much doomed, 30% 40% 50% of the species now on the planet in a few decades maybe disappearing. And this is what I think is really the tough question now, is if we can seed that we can't any longer save all the species, then does that put us in the situation of having to decide which ones will save and which ones we won't? And do we have any basis for making those kinds of decisions? Hmm. So you're saying that the, that the, let's go back to when it was good. Let's go back to a better time. That's just silly. I didn't say it was silly. Okay. What did you yeah, I said it was impossible.

Speaker 1:          10:18          Things might not be silly. They might not be stupid ideas, but we still might not be able to do them.

Speaker 10:         10:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:25          okay, so here's um, a wood plaque. It says lonesome George is the last survivor of the dynasty of land. Tortoise is from Pinta island and in fact in 2012 after decades of trying to get him to to breed

Speaker 10:         10:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:45          lonesome, George Dies r I p 24th of June, 2012 and the panda tortoise when extinct. So damn case in point, I guess. No, going back. Yeah, I mean that's what I thought. But then I spoke with this woman. Hello? Hello. Just hello? Do you hear me? Yes, I do. Who kind of scrambled everything up for me? Can I get you to introduce yourself? Yes. My name is [inaudible]. I am a senior research scientist at Yale University and just tell us, come up with kind of a radical idea. I call it the Phoenix project. Here's the backstory. In the mid nineties we started in 94 to Cielo and some folks from their Galapagos National Park. They began taking a census of all the tortoises in the Galapagos population of tortoises on all the islands. They were going to do this big population studies. So they went island by island, took a little bit of blood from all these different tortoises, did a genetic analysis and old pla found something they never expected. A group of tortoise is not on Pinta that had a lot of Pinta DNA. I remember very clearly that moment was very, very, it's like,

Speaker 11:         11:54          yes, look at this. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          11:56          Wait, you're saying this Pinta DNA was on a nother island? Yeah. None on Pinta. No. Well, how would that happen? Um, we don't think it was natural. Gisella thinks it might've been the whalers, either the whalers or the pirates, you know, because like we talked about in the 1718 hundreds these whalers would come along, grab a bunch of tortoises, put them on the ship, and then they would hunt for whales or shoot. And sometimes when they were done in the, the ship was filled with whale products. There's no room down here. They throw a few extra towards his overboard, say a few from Pinta. Maybe those pins does tortoises swim with occurrence to that nearby island set up a little ex-pat community and started breeding with the locals. That's our working hypothesis, which brings us to [inaudible] her idea.

Speaker 11:         12:48          You know on average 50% of your genome comes from your mom and 50% from your dad, but it's an average.

Speaker 1:          12:55          So just sell a thought. Just by chance. Some of these tortoises are going to have a little bit more Pinta DNA from their Pinta ancestors than others. Yes. So what if we took those tortoises and bred them together?

Speaker 11:         13:06          So back then for the next generation so that you can give a push to this process.

Speaker 1:          13:12          She says, if we keep doing this, taking the babies with the most Pinta DNA, breeding them together slowly, surely

Speaker 11:         13:19          in four generations you could have 90% of the painter genome restored. Really? Yeah. But that's four generations of tortoises, not rats, which means at least a hundred years.

Speaker 1:          13:31          But in the meantime, the vegetation on Pinta is growing out of control from an ecological point of view. Pinta can't wait. So in 2009 they come up with a stop gap. They take 39 tortoises raised in captivity and they use them as placeholders. They sterilize them and put them on Pinta. Really? One day. Yeah. Well these are very purest sort of visions. Yeah. They sterilize and 39 of them. They're just basically the lawn mowers. They're not. Exactly and they put them on Pinta and they're just chomping away right now. They're living at their lives really happily on Pinta you know, until the originals that ready.

Speaker 1:          14:12          Now Linda says in the end you don't actually need to do the full aggressive for generation breeding thing. You can just take, I'm Jeff, I'm Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab and this hour, well the honeymoon's over glove vagus. This is the place where Darwin began to develop his theory of evolution and its the place 170 year, maybe 180 years later where our producer Tim Howard landed wearing fishnets in a bad brains tee shirt like to fight to find a very different landscape than what Darwin saw. And we just told you a story about how far humans are willing to go to protect something. This next part, it's about how far we're willing to go to get something back that we've already lost to sort of restore a place in a creature to its quote, wild state. This story unfolds on one of Galapagos is most northern islands where they also had to get rid of some goats. It's called Pinta Pinta as was a very special place. This is James Gibbs, professor of conservation biology at the State University of New York. It's a one of those islands. It's not part of any tourist visitation site. So there are no people there. And uh, when you set foot first on Pinto, you immediately sense sheer abundance.

Speaker 2:          15:29          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          15:30          problem is on Penna. Things were spinning out of [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          15:32          control.

Speaker 3:          15:34          The vegetation was growing wild, the forest was getting overgrown with the wrong kind of plant and the whole [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          15:42          it goes system was just teetering out of balance. And one of the reasons for this, according to Linda Coyote is that we had an island with no tortoises. Yes. Because tortoises are sort of like the lawnmowers, you know, they, they plow down vegetation, disperse seeds, but for centuries had been hunted by those whalers, and in about 1906 the pinta tortoise went extinct. 1906 yeah, a little over a hundred years ago. They don't know the exact date, date, but then one evening in March of 1972.
