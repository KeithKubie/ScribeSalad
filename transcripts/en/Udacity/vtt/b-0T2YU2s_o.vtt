00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.916
So, let's say for example when your studying for this lesson you make an

00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:07.300
outline using headings that are similar to chapters in a book. So first would

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.800
be memory, and probably types of memory like short term and long term. And then

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.768
underneath each of these you'd get more specific. And then you would add things

00:00:15.768 --> 00:00:19.184
on this list that we're going to cover later in the lesson. The biological side

00:00:19.184 --> 00:00:23.390
of memory or forgetting. And under each sub category you get more and more

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.233
specific. This is an example of what? An associative network? A schema? A

00:00:29.233 --> 00:00:33.059
hierarchy? Or a mnemonic device? Select one.
