Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey. What's going on it's Bill Burr. It's time for the Thursday afternoon, just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and just checking in on you so I couldn't give you a big one. I fucked up my voice going all the way back to San Jose Cruz, uh, Beck, the San Jose Gigs. I Dunno what I did. I know what I did. I was imitating somebody yelling. I was having too much fun. I didn't come from my diaphragm and I fucking choked up and I just fucking blew the voice out. That's what I did. I always spent the main rotor and my fucking throat is what had happened. So now I, uh, I gotta go easy. You know, I got drink a little throat coat tea, you know. Um, anyways, what's going on? How are you guys doing? You're feeling good. I get energized and excited about the fucking weekend. Um, I've actually been working out finally. I'm still eating like a fucking moron, so I haven't been dropped that much weight, but I feel better.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       You know what it is. I'm at this fucking age. I swear to God. I have one sip of this, a one bite of that and it just fucks me. It's unbelievable. I swear to God, if I didn't work out, I would be like, I would look like every other fucking war on walking around the mall. That's all it is. I'm really starting to believe that a lot of people now was kid knew we shove a bunch of cake down our throats. I just, I don't, I don't know what the fuck it is. I know. It was just weird how he said that. I eat like a fucking Olympian until about three, four in the afternoon. I work out like a soccer mom, but I eat like a fucking Olympian because my shoulders, my shoulders coming around, by the way. Um, so I'm doing like the elliptical and that type of shit put up for the fight up until about three.

Speaker 1:          00:01:50       I fucking kill it, you know? And then the weakness starts coming in like a fucking cold front, like a rainstorm. The cloud start forming around three or three 30 in the afternoon. And I feel myself getting wheat going, come on, Bill. Come on. Veggies, veggies, fuzzy, shoved down your pie hall. Let's meet baton. That's me putting fucking plywood over the windows. You know, before I do something stupid. And then just, you know, I dunno, I keep trying to do this thing where I'm going to be done eating around six o'clock at night and then just drink waters the rest of the time. And if I get hungry, I'm just going to have a little bit of celery. And I know salaries on the dirty dozen list of fucking pesticides is basically anything where they just spray it directly on like cantaloupes. Good. Cause they spray the shit on, you know the fucking Ebola, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:02:42       The AIDS virus, whatever the fuck they do to keep the mosquitoes away, they spray and spray it right on the fucking cantaloupe. But it doesn't get to the part that you eat and you don't lick the outside of it. You know the way fat show licked is the bottom of his sneakers in the MTV cribs. I will never get over that. It's like, dude, those were made in a sweatshop cause you to walk around New York and we have no fucking idea. Don't get a tetanus shot, John. Um, anyways, uh, fuck was I talking about? And so salary, you know, cause I'll spray it right on it cause it doesn't have a husk or whatever the fuck it is. Um, so this person tells you who just go get organic salary, salary, salary, just get our Kerrick celery. And I wanted it to be like [inaudible] how to fuck you don't know where the fuck any of this shit is.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       I think it all comes from the same God damn farm. And they go, oh that one looks greener than those ones. Call them on organic. That's about ready to go and say that's organic. And they'll think that the reason why it's rotting is because, uh, you know, because it's so fucking fresh. I Dunno. So at night I tried to do like the salary have just a little bit half a spoonful of sugar, no half full, half a spoonful of peanut butter to try to get me through. And, uh, you know, and then you just go to bed like upset. That's what happened. If you're eating right, you go to upset, you're not in a good mood. All right. Now a lot of fucking nutritionists, Dietitians, fucking personal trainers, fucking crossfitters and all that. It'll say like, no, if you really, you shouldn't feel hungry at all because you body will be full of all the new cheesing needs and it will be craving a shut the fuck up. We get tight clothes dressing like a goddamn x men to do fucking curls, workout clothes at the dumbest. It's a stupid as shit.

Speaker 2:          00:04:43       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:04:43       I was watching an old, uh, odd couple Boto Ooh,

Speaker 3:          00:04:47       Ooh, Ooh, Ooh. Two.

Speaker 1:          00:04:52       No. My favorite part of that song is when the horn section kicks in ballet, but that the to to do bow [inaudible] back then when it was actually a fucking orchestra, it wasn't some guy with a laptop fucking pumping his fists like he's going to reboot the Arsenio show for the third fucking time. It wasn't like that. It was actual, it was somebody that practice the fucking trombone since he was knee high. Fight in the dust bowl during the depression right before fucking Pearl Harbor and he had to beat out 50,000 other Tuba players. Everybody trying to put their own stamp on [inaudible] but up buddy, how you know, you sitting out there all fucking nervous known as dad's going to give him the belt if he doesn't fucking book it right?

Speaker 2:          00:05:42       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:05:43       He's on the other side of the door just listening to other people audition, you know, proper proper fuck. That guy nailed it. Um, I was watching, I'm getting off track here. I was watching that show and uh, Oscar, yeah, Oscar w had come from the gym and he just had on a gray sweatshirt and gray sweatpants. He didn't have to go in there all fucking aerodynamic. Like he was doing a time trial in the Tour de France. All of this fucking shit that Nike makes. Who's kidding? Who that children make in the Nike Factory? You know, before they tried to jump out the fucking window. Or is that apple? I have no idea. It's all a legend. I don't they, it, it's fake news is children are happy. They put the nets outside the window because he enjoyed jumping into them. It's a religious holiday. Um, Oh God, I gotta work on my Trump.

Speaker 1:          00:06:41       I got to work my Trump. It's, well, I'll tell you. It's rough, you know. Um, that's all the fuck you need now. Everybody's got all, they got all the fucking, but he's walking around dressed like captain America. Oh my God. I saw a shit show at the mall yesterday and absolute fucking, she, she was such a shit show. I actually was looking around for someone to be trying to film me for my reaction. Um, I had gone to the mall again, that's twice in a week. I never go to the mall twice in a fucking week. And this time I went to the growth. Now if you don't, if you don't live in La, okay. The Grove is basically, it's like going to times square on New Year's Eve, except it's a mall. It's a fucking nightmare. All right. But I was going down there because I'm a man and I, um, Deanna Adler, Steven Adler, his mom who wrote, uh, the wonderful book, we'll actually jump tragic book and then it comes out this sons, you know, it starts off with sunshine, it gets really fucking cloudy for come on pages and then it comes out again.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       It's a great book. Um, called a sweet child of mine and she was doing a book signing and as I said, I was going to be down there and um, you know, so I went down there and the book signing was great. And uh, her sons, Steven and Jamie came down that dude, Steven Adler is fucking hot. Hilarious. It was a huge crowd. Thank you to everybody who showed up to listen to my podcast and went down there. Um, I think, you know, had a couple of am and podcast listeners down there that I ran into. Um, do, he was fucking killing, killing, say whatever he wanted to. Some woman in the crowd. She's, Hi Steve. I do you remember me back in the day? I used to stand out from the rainbow. He's like, I add, I did I fuck you said then Barnes and noble bar, the noble is it?

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       I don't know. I don't read Barnes and noble or nobles, NBA Final Stanley Cup final and the Stanley Cup finals. I can't remember in this fucking bookstore, in a microphone. He said that, um, just complete mind me like a comedian that just didn't give a shit. Um, whether they ever work the club again, it was fucking amazing. And uh, he absolutely destroyed and uh, and they sold a bunch of books. So a order one today. It's an incredible read, man. I'm telling you. It's fucking brutal. It's fucking like if you already read his, his, uh, Stevens was brutal enough, but now to hear the mother's side going through the pain to try and help them out. I tell you, I'm going to be honest with you. I haven't gotten through it yet. That's so fucking brutal. It is. I just got into the part where Stephen starts going off the rails and I'm just, I got mad.

Speaker 1:          00:09:25       I got to go like one chapter at a time. Um, in other words, she pulls no punches. So, uh, definitely check that out if you can. So anyways, back to this shit show. So I'm going to the mall, right? And uh, I Polen I valet right? I valet like a fucking big shot cause this is our, this is to two things or I don't give a fuck. I'm usually a frugal comment. All right. My Malcolm young tee shirt, right. And I don't spend any fucking money cause I know how this business works. Right? When you go out, you buy something flashy. It's a look at him. Look at him, look at that freckled gun. He thinks he made it. Then they come over and they walk in here and get right out from underneath. That's not ongoing out. Uh Huh. Not, not me. Nope. I'm going to buy some strip malls.

Speaker 1:          00:10:15       I'm going to start having some money coming in from outside of this VA me, Hollywood, um, who's was who it's going to be a sad ending just like everybody else's. You know, I'll come walking out one day on some fucking telethon, you know, my jaw fucking quivering uncontrollably. And you guys all going to be like, oh, what happened? Whenever I used to be so young. Right. And all you guys will have to shut it off because I'll look so bad. It's going to remind you of your own mortality. Right? There you go. There's something to look forward to this weekend. Sorry. Anyways, plowing ahead here. Um, so I'm walking to the, to the mall, okay. And a half shirts or back or as they call them, crop tops. All the ladies, all the ladies who fucking eat right or aware, a, you know what I mean? And I'm sure the fatties at some point are going to hate them and say that those crop tops are sexist and you're creating an impossible body image and they're going to blame those women that actually took the time to fucking push themselves away at five o'clock and just sit there eat and salary and shit. Pass that drinking waters hating themselves. You know, here's all the people that are going to resent the crop tops where they, huh? Oh, they're sitting there having a great fucking time to getting gelato. Well, the side a case,

Speaker 1:          00:11:43       that's something fat people do. You know? Oh, I'm low. I'm fucking blowing up this spot. I live with a fatty, I do. I'm telling you I have fat, French, okay. All of that shit. All of those ice creams that you see, those unholy matrimonials of fucking candy bars in ice cream. Like who then now fuck thought of that out. The fat people, fat people, fat people, you don't Pat, right? They all came up with that shit. They all came up with that shit late at fucking night. They're like junkies. Okay. And what happens is, is after awhile doing heroin isn't enough. You gotta put a little coke in there and then you got to speed bullet. So the fat fucking person speedball is when you take and you, if you get fat, you listen to it, you know it's fucking true. You know you shouldn't be doing it. You know, you're excited. You know you're excited, right? When you know you've got the ice cream at home, right? And you stopped at the red light, you look over to the left and it's at seven 11 right in that demon in. You just goes, Hey, are you driving? Then go get a Zag. Not by,

Speaker 1:          00:12:52       he had vanilla ice cream at home. I was kind of playing and he'd need to take it up a notch bond, you know you want to do it, you know, you start crying. Well see him, he likes it. So I'm just going to have the ice cream man. I said make a left turn, drive in there and get her shot. I'm not bar and you fucking turn in there and you buy the fucking thing, right? Like you're going in there or rent a porn back in the 90s and element of shame. You don't want to make eye contact, but you don't want to look away. You know, cause it got a couple of git films in there. You know, you gotta have that. Maybe I'm going to rent sleepless in Seattle. Look on your face, right as you walk into the pawn shop, except it's the seven 11 and you walk past all the other fatties in the fucking people. You know the junkies buying those fucking hot dogs that have been there since fucking Ronald Reagan got shot, right.

Speaker 2:          00:13:45       You fucking go in there.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       Probably grab a couple of healthy things, like maybe one of their fucking bananas. It's still green. You know the hand of the kid that picked it, you know his fingerprints is still fucking on it, right? Then you just walk right up to the cash register at the last second. You try to make it seem like you know it would not be old and you gotta be like, uh, yeah, I'll stop right there. You go the fuck exact nut bar. And then you take that fucking thing home, right? Driving home now excited while hating yourself. Excited. Passing over the Double Line into your fucking house, right? You put on fucking Netflix and then you sit down and what do you do? You've got to take the ice cream out. Now this part's the hardest. It's killing you. You gotta let the ice cream melt a little bit, right? So you can fucking GM at Goddamn candy bar right in there, right? That's what fatty still, I don't want, I'm talking about here. So I'm at the fucking mall. Okay, I'm going to fill up a half hour. Okay. I gotta have some tangents here. You know, you want to do a half hour don't material.

Speaker 2:          00:14:48       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:14:48       You want to try to fill it up a lot. Right. Um, so anyway, so I'm walking through so this fucking, you know, this is another person that I can't stand. You know, cause I'm so goddamned perfect, right? The fucking person just refuses to admit that they're old. You know, I don't mean like just your old, just go sit there on the fucking couch. I don't mean that, you know, definitely get out there. You don't get yourself sitting here, but you know, put on some sunscreen. You old fuck. Okay. The people that you passed a certain age and they're still trying to keep up with young people with the styles and shit. I saw this woman, right? Tragic trauma from fucking 80 yards. You could tell there was no father ever in her life. Okay. Which is sad, but you know, at some point you've got, you know, you've got to put your tips of ways and you gotta look in the mirror and just be like, look, all right, so he wasn't there.

Speaker 1:          00:15:38       Fuck that guy. He's a piece of shit. I'm worth something. This lady did not have that. Okay. She's fucking walking. Okay. She is like, I don't know what age she was. She should have been 33 do something about or said 33 but she looked like 47 and she was in good shape for her fucking aids, but she's wearing the crop top. Okay. And she's doesn't have a flat stomach. She has just that little bit of of uh, it caught belly or whatever you call it. Right. So it's hanging over in the front, it's hanging on the back and she's wearing a fucking crop top and the crop top said bitch on it.

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       She's wearing these little short shorts and these fucking high heels and you know, you know the lady's feet after fucking three decades of sticking yourself in horseshoes, you feed a beat up. You know, you see like the heels, there's like those white circles from like no blood supply and shit. And it's just like, oh my God, get yourself a player of flat shoes. You know, I'll put on a sport coat and you, you, you put on like some, something flowing. You did your time like young people be young. So she fucking walks by and uh, I dunno, the only excuse I can make was maybe she was a hooker. She was a hooker. I don't have a problem with it. God bless her. You know what I mean? If she had it, she had a, uh, a fucking, I don't know what you'd call it. A goddamn I'm charity I would give to it. But if she was just a regular fucking person man, shit show. Right. And once again, half the reason why she was driving me nuts is it just reminded me of how old I was. I was like, uh, I am old enough that I was alive when that woman was still high.

Speaker 4:          00:17:26       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17:27       And I'm not going to apologize, Freddy and this shit, if you're going to walk out, okay, you got to know your age. All of these fucking, you know, you know, people tell you that, you know, you know, being fifty's the new 40, you know, fucking says that 50 year olds, no, 50, 50 put some fucking clothes on. Um, Geez, I'm on a fucking tangent here. Not a rant. It's not a rant. Don't even say it's a fucking rant. All you guys have ruined that word rant. Rant is your complete. You're barely holding your shit to get a rant. Goes with raving like hall and Oates. Rant and raving. All right. This whole thing that, hey, he talked about the same subject and he reasonably calm tone for the last fucking seven minutes. He's on a rant. You don't, you don't see no defines it that fucking millennials.

Speaker 1:          00:18:12       And you know why that is? Cause they wear helmets when they ride bicycles and they had play dates and they had helicopter parents. So then in Denver even know what yelling is. God help us. God help us when Isis that doesn't have a plane or a boat somehow figures out how to fucking get over here from the other side of the world, you know, in their pajamas or whatever the fuck it is they're doing over there. Okay. God help us when they show up in the millennials have to fight him, you know Jesus Christ. Anyways, so here's the good stuff. The good side of it, aside from the fact that DNA ads are sold a bunch of fucking books. Um, there's a store over there out of Detroit, Michigan, and it's called Shinola. So I'm going to shine. I immediately, I got to go in there because of that old school expression. My Dad always said, I'll cry set guy crazy. He doesn't know shit from Shinola.

Speaker 5:          00:19:04       Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:19:06       That was a great one. That one of my, another one of my favorite, my dad got try sec. I could fuck up a free lunch.

Speaker 1:          00:19:18       Oh that one made me laugh every time you fucking said it. Cause he always said it to them about the right person. And then just just doing the math. Like what would you have to do to fuck up a free lunch where you can literally have the person, you know what fuck you go somewhere else to get your food. You know, like what would you have to do? The guy's giving you a free lunch. What would you say to the guy other than thank you. Um, anyways, so there was an expression, it was kind of a Midwest thing, right? I think a, you don't know shit from Shinola. Shinola was a shoe Polish, uh, that was in Michigan, I believe outside of Detroit. So the expression going, you don't know shit from Shinola basically means you would know if you are shining your shoes with shoe Polish or shit.

Speaker 1:          00:20:02       It's basically saying you're a fucking moron. So I'm like, all right, Shinola. I got to go in there. So I come walking in there and the first thing I say to the guy was like, dude, I had to come in here. Are you familiar with the expression? You don't know shit from Shinola? He goes, absolutely. That's how we came up with the name of the store. So evidently this company, they make all these cool shit in America, in Detroit, a city that needs fucking industry, great goddamn city, just waiting for someone to invest in it. Um, they make all of this stuff. So I fucking go in there, dude, you got to look these things up, man. Um, aside from all the watches and all the shit they had and they had these fucking bikes, um, you know, I'm actually gonna post a video and, um, and I say, hey dean, check this shit out because I sending it to Dean del Rey Cause Dean del Rey is, is a, a a a connoisseur of fine shit.

Speaker 1:          00:20:54       The man does not own a lot of shit, but the shit that he owns is fine. She top of the line shit. So they had bicycles in there and um, they look like paperboard bikes from the 1950s, you know, when I fucking did my time from third grade to ninth grade to like fucking, I did it all the way up to high school, you know. Um, so I always liked those bikes even though they look corny too, a lot of people, but it was all modern technology. So when you quickly looked at it, it looked like a peewee Herman style fucking bike, um, with the bell and everything on it. But then it was all this state of the ash shit. It's kind of like a resto mod, but like a bicycle version. And they had this one, it was like an 11 speed bike in all, like the, all the gear changing was like, I can't explain where the fuck or was, it was like a, I guess where you would say the differential would be on a car, but I'm just the part that it's usually just part of the wheel. All the gears were in there. I'm not enough of a gearhead to explain this properly. They had the wires going into the bike. It was all like streamlined. It had fucking disc brakes on the front and the back that things were crazy. Crazy. So, um, wait a minute, I got the fucking pamphlet right here.

Speaker 1:          00:22:07       I swear to God, if I, if I wasn't trying to downsize my life and they weren't so God damn expensive, I would have fucking bought one. Um, yeah, I do these, but these bikes, they're really fucking, you know, a lot of you guys are gonna think these are nerdy looking bugs, but I think they're fucking sick. They got one called the Detroit aero ones, the Bixby and one's the Runwell. Um, and I'll tell you, I'll tell you the chief, you know, but uh, the fucking sick man. That's why I wish, you know, I don't know how it happened. Part of it was because there was sweatshop labor and then you had the unions and the unions became what the fucking cops were. And then everybody just said, you know what? Fuck a union. And they just left the country would, wouldn't it be great if we just made shit in this country again?

Speaker 1:          00:22:48       I'm telling me we got to start with, we'd all right. They got to legalize it on a fucking federal level and we should make the best fucking weed in the world. We export that shit. You get the whole world, you know, fucking buy in are we? They got the best, like the, like the way Cubans got the cigar thing locked down. We should do that with weed. Okay. The government should fucking stay out of it. Just make it legal and walk away and then tax the shit out of it. Okay. And have your eyes wide shut parties and fuck some other woman while you look at your wife getting banged by senator, whatever it is, you upper 1% people fucking do. All right, but just walk away from that Shit. Let us grow the [inaudible]. Couldn't we? In the fucking world. We export it. We make all that fucking money. You get your fucking your skin with the tax, right? Send it to those costs over at the Federal Reserve, whatever the fuck it is they do. And then you know, you pay off the war and then we just, right. Just given the Tesla, we just fucking will drive those fucking cars.

Speaker 1:          00:23:54       Have the fucking blue blood constant run the oil industry. Just slide them over to the electrical shit. They'll still make the same amount of money. Then we don't have to be over in the Middle East. Stick in our fucking nose and all that shit. We all fucking come home. Right? You put on a game, you've got some solar energy, you know you've got some fucking weed. I know, I know. I'm over simplifying all of this. Yeah, I'm over simplifying. All of us. Um, anyways, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about here. Let me, uh, let me do some advertising reads. It's do some advertising reads, man. Um, I got to type in my fucking password. It's of course vulgar. I don't know why, because of this fucking anger that you have in you. I don't know what your problem is anyway. To own, to be the same thing.

Excuse me, that I go to get the hiccups. Um, and all of that shit. All right, so here we go. What can we talk about here in the final couple of minutes? Uh, all the Bruins, the Bruins had their backs up against the wall. We were after having a nice comfortable fucking leave, we would up to like a fifth seat. We tumbled all the way down to an eighth seed one ahead. The Tampa Bay lightning. All right. And I wasn't paying attention to Tampa. I was just watching the Bruins lose. And then I looked at the fucking standards because one night I was watching the lightning play in the Black Hawks and the Blackhawks dog dog, dog. We're up fucking four to one and you know, the lightning started coming back and I'm fucking in it. Oh Shit. Forward it to Oh shit. What the fuck? What a great game. I didn't realize that that was hurting my team. And they ended up winning in overtime. They get two points and they will, they will one point behind us. So we beat the fucking, uh, we beat long island.

Speaker 2:          00:30:17       All right.

Speaker 1:          00:30:18       Long Island be the islanders that playing Brooklyn. Figured that one out. And um, and then Tuesday night we beat the fucking press. So tonight, who do we got? The fucking staff is such a Boston week, predators, stairs. Um, that's who we're playing tonight. And in the lightening have the Detroit Redwings who are not having a good year, but they, you know, they always get some fucking Sergei Federoff next phenom coming up. You know, they kind of like, uh, the Pittsburgh penguins where they just, they got the fucking, they got that down man. Somehow they, you know, I mean the penguins are crazy. Do they had fucking Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jaga then he had like a fucking 10 year drought, 15 year drought or whatever, and then they come back with fucking Gino and sit, you know, and you know something, the Bruins could be like that if we didn't fucking ship 'em out all the time. You know, we had Tyler say again, Hey, what'd you have a fucking cores light a get out of town buddy. That's, so, that's not what we do here in this racist town. This is an upstanding community. So we shipped him out and now look what we got. We got fucking Pasta Knoxx become, uh, you know, he's become a super sa Brad Marshawn, you know, it's just like what a Tyler was still there.

Speaker 1:          00:31:35       You could centrally be rolling in three fucking, I don't know shit about hockey, but I mean, I don't know. We're always doing shit like that. Look at you. Look at all the goals Joel. Joe Thought and scored in San Jose for why they never won shit. We didn't get shit for him in the fucking trade. We just didn't want to pay him. But anyways, anyways, that's an important, we have the stars tonight. Okay. The stars at night are big and by Beekman out of Texas. Um, but Dallas is not deepen our to Texas. It's right out there in the open. So we're going to win tonight, I hope. But you never know. They got Jamie van, they gave fucking Patrick's yet. Patrick shap on the Dallas Diaz. I'm the next f one race by the way, is in, I'm not this Sunday. It's going to be next Sunday. And that's in China in dokie.

Speaker 1:          00:32:22       And by the wait, speaking of China, um, I got satellite radio now. So I finally get to listen to the Howard stern show again. And his wife has some sort of cause. And you know, I'm always worry of a cause dude, I only listened to half of it and I had to turn the fucking channel. How would is describing they got some day over there or I don't know what the fuck they're doing with dogs where they torture them. They scare the shit out of them. They think that they have like adrenaline, you know, high anxiety. It makes the meat taste better. They fucking torture them in front of the other dogs to make them more for the dogs here, the, the, it's, it's going to give you the rest of it. It made me sick to my fucking stomach. So there's a petition that you can sign to try to get the fucking animals that are doing that shit to stop on Howard stern.com you just scroll down and uh, you know, I had to sign that shit cause uh, even if you got to do something about how to you do that to a dog, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:33:17       I know what all you vegetarians, you'd say, well the shit they do to cows and all that, you know what you fucking right. Isn't that a way to just, you know, fucking give a cow to behind the year when it's not even like paying attention. The thing is once you kill one, the other sense it and everyday it's, it's fucking brutal. But you know, then at the end of the day, a fucking hamburgers delicious. I don't know. But do you know you, why don't you fucking have some cows? Maybe it's because they have a billion people over there. So there's not enough cows for people. I don't, I don't fucking know. But I love dogs. So if you love dogs, Howard stern.com sign that fucking petition anyways. And then as far as, um, the motorcycle racing goes, I'm going to try and get into this shit cause he's racist. A nice increase races got a little Christopher Walken.

Speaker 1:          00:34:01       There is rice is there. I'm not going to do Christopher Walken. All right. Listen to fucking Craig. Guests are fucking Jay Moore. Uh, the, the next, uh, I think the first one of that season, if you want to get into racing now, motorcycle racing is fucking insane cause they still bump each other and shit and they're on motorcycles doing that. Don't no fucking 190 miles an hour. That one is on April 9th. Sunday, April 9th in Argentina at 3:00 PM east coast time. I'll actually be in San Antonio. Um, and uh, let's see. So that game will come on from me at two o'clock. For me. It's going to come on at two o'clock and I just have to figure out how the fuck I'm going to, uh, where the hell I'm going to watch it. I think it's on Fox, but uh, I'm totally into this shit up totally into it. All right. All right. That's it. Everybody. Go fuck yourselves. Have a great weekend. You [inaudible] and I'll, uh, I'll talk to you on Monday with, um, also listen to this music here, a little bit of musical or music bed here and then we're gonna play you some, uh, some classic Monday morning podcast that Thursday afternoon just before Friday, Monday morning podcast from a Thursday or a Monday from the year gone by.

Speaker 6:          00:35:17       Um, a lady roommate. Hey Bill, huge fan of the show. Wanted to see if you had any advice for this situation. I found myself in a little over a month ago. I moved to Phoenix and moved in with the friend of Iad. You go up camelback mountain yet. That's a fucking great hike. You got to go up. That one. Somebody dies up there every fucking year, which always me up to be like alone in the wilderness. While you can actually see buildings in the distance. It's got to be so frustrating. Um, little ugly ass fucking roadrunners. All right. A little over a month ago I moved to Phoenix and moved in with a friend from college. No real problems there. But he did have a female college age roommate that he got along with. So we ended up setting settling on a three bedroom. All right, so it's two dudes in a chick. This is already like a sitcom. This is like fucking reverse three's company,

Speaker 7:          00:36:10       Colin. [inaudible]. Well it gives us,

Speaker 6:          00:36:16       I'll fucking, America was just like that, you know, ice and simple. I guess it was probably fucked up then. I was just too young to notice sitting there eating a popsicle. We'll look is his own bloody do Beatty booty. Boop. Larry's upstairs. 50 years old. Fucking everything that moves. Um, all right. I only know a few people in town and my work schedule is grueling. It makes it really hard to meet to too many people over the course of the week. All right, so you're setting up to your excuse to why you're already fucking your friends friend. All right. You know, I work, Lord, I can't get to meet people. Uh, why go out for pussy when it's right next door? I get it buddy. I get it. You know, it's discovery channel. Does the line go after the toughest zebra or the fucking wounded one of the little baby one or the one walking around wearing the fucking juicy shorts.

Speaker 6:          00:37:11       Um, I'm sure by now you've pinpointed the key word in the above paragraph. Female. Yes, I am Sir. Yes I have. So you can see where this is going. My second weekend here, we all go out get sloppy jalopy drunk and she informs me that she broke up with their boyfriend of five years. Ah, wonderful. So of course I do the gentlemanly thing and fuck your brains out. Oh, he goes, oh, of course. Yeah. I do the gentleman thing and fuck her brains out or flop around like a dead fish on top of her. Um, it's one of those too. Once I'm done, I leave, I go to my room and we don't mention in, we don't mention it, don't mention it in the morning. And it's not awkward at all. Ah, if I add the Allah your song, Oh, that's fucking great. Would you guys look down at me if I told you that I was just jealous of this person right now? That's fucking perfect. And the hardest thing is going to be for you to not fuck this up for you not to develop feelings. Okay. You know, that's going to be a hard one. But if you can somehow do it, if you can somehow keep yourself separated, you know, you could just, it would be like a, it'd be like stamps.com having the post office and you fucking apartment. Now you've the post ups should apartment and now you have this blow job machine also there. I mean it's tremendous,

Speaker 2:          00:38:42       you know,

Speaker 6:          00:38:44       and then all you gotta do is just decide what kind of food you're always going out for and you really like and you buy that appliance, be it a Panini maker or a fucking cappuccino maker. You got that stamps.com and the blow job machine down the hall. And I tell you, lets it get the NFL package, call it a life. Um, so anyways, he goes, we've gone about doing this for a few weeks now, but since I'm never home during the week and she works during the day on weekends, we don't exactly see each other. And when we do, we, we literally never say anything about it or hint edited, all et Cetera. Dude, please don't fuck this up. Please don't fuck this up. Okay? He says, my question being as this is the first time something like this has happened, is this a time bomb waiting to happen where all the crazy is going to come flying out like the Ark of the covenant or is she just rebounding?

Speaker 6:          00:39:46       And I'm the free and clear until I settle in and find something else. Keep in mind, keep in mind that Jesus Christ, sorry I didn't go to church today, has died for rose and is risen from the grave. He did it all for you. There's no way for you to thank him once you give us a bunch of money. Um, keep in mind I've never been accused of being good looking and she's pretty cute with the grade a ass on her. Any advice is appreciated and I guess go fuck yourself. Um, okay. All right. You did the right thing. You know, you've got a great situation and you don't want to fuck it up.

Speaker 6:          00:40:32       You know, this is like the first time I went deep sea fishing. I got a bite and I looked at the dude next to me, my doing it right. What do I do? And I let it run a little bit. Let it run a little bit. Hey, bringing it right. You're doing the same thing. All right, so what is your questioning? Is this a time this, this is okay, this, there's the wildcard that she's a psycho, but she, she, she would have shown her colors by now. I would think if she was a psycho, you know, there would have been some sort of, you know, God, you worked so much. I don't get to see you when your 20 [inaudible] going to do on that, you know, fucking twisting your arm here or doing something fucking annoying. Some sort of annoying sort of touching. Right? So she hasn't done that. She's totally putting out the vibe

Speaker 2:          00:41:21       that

Speaker 6:          00:41:23       she's basically in the mindset. It's this thing seems like it's exactly what it is. You know, she was in a relationship for five years, five years. Man. She's got to decompress from that. All right. She likes to go out and get hammered and get fucked and go to bed and not see your dumb ass for the whole week. All right? Just keep it at that. This is the deal. You don't ever bring it up either. You don't have to bring it up or you just keep it the way it is. All right? If she's barely talking to you, you barely talk to her and he'd just have fun with it and this is another thing you do. All right. Have Fun with this shit. What is some things that you always wanted to do with the woman and you haven't done yet? This is the girl you do it with.

Speaker 6:          00:42:08       All right, and she's going to probably do it with you too because she doesn't give a fuck about you, which is a great thing. What you have sir, as a fuck buddy, congratulations. This is your first one. This is what men dream of. This is what men really want for, this is what we want for Christmas. You know? If we could just have a fuck buddy, somebody who was clean with no diseases, you know, and somehow then had this pill they could give you that you drank, you know, you washed it down and it got rid of any sort of fucking guilt. It will be perfect. But you're single do to, there's no guilt. So my thing is just don't, don't open your mouth and fuck this thing up. All right. You got a great thing going. Okay. Just keep doing what you're doing. And uh, the only thing I would correct is this whole thing where you say, you know, I'm not that good looking at guy, you know, work on your self esteem. She's pretty cute. Hey, you know, good for her. She got a nice ass. Why don't you go to fucking do something to it, but not during the week. No fucking during the week you focused on your job, you have a great fucking time. And I know it, you know, I guess eventually if you do meet somebody and you start bringing them around, there's part, there is a potential, but, uh, you just got to nip that shit in the, but I guess you've actually met somebody that you liked, uh, that Jesus. Yeah, I didn't think about that.

Speaker 6:          00:43:40       All right. First, first things first before we even get over to her. Uh, I mean dis, okay. Whole new can of worms here, dude. You have to be cool first and foremost. All right. Because eventually, you know, if she meets some other dude, you've got to make sure that you're not going to flip out. So do not develop any feelings for this girl. And the only way you're not going to develop any feelings with the squirrels. If you see her once a fucking week and your Banger, okay? You don't want to know how many brothers and sisters she has, right? It's like reservoir dogs. You guys shouldn't even know each other's names. Tell you name them to be a fucking, I don't have any name. Yeah. You know, you don't. You want that. All right. All right. You fucking Mr Pink or whatever. She's mister blonde or Mrs Blonde.

Speaker 6:          00:44:27       Uh, sorry. Um, that's the only thing you got to worry about. All right. So, and I've learned to just be totally fucking up front and honest. So if I got some new girlfriend, I would just tell her what's up? What's your deal? Yeah. I'm single. I'm kind of banging my fucking roommate once a week, you know, we don't, you know, just sort of a fuck buddy thing. Oh, does that make you uncomfortable? Well, all right, well then this relationship isn't going to work because you're already uncomfortable with me. Now if I got feelings for you, I wouldn't keep banging her, but you know, I'm not taking it off the table after one fucking trip to Applebee's, Jesus Christ free pussy. That's like free shoes for you, right?

Speaker 6:          00:45:15       You know, I dunno. That's all I all, I can tell you dude, you can't control her. Who gives a fuck? Dude? Someday you're going to be 50 and you've got to be married and she's going to be bitching at you about something. And even if you love or you're at some point, you just can be reminiscent going, you know, where my life was the greatest was when I had that little fucking goddamn three bedroom apartment. All I had to do was make this amount of money a week and I had some check once a week with just fucked my brains out and not talk to me for the other six days. Goddamn dream. You got the dream, sir. All right. And I don't know where you're going to wake up, but enjoy it while it lasts. Okay. I hope I answered your question. I really do. You're in a hell of a situation. Enjoy it. All right. Kudos to you. I am jealous.

Speaker 8:          00:46:09       Hey, what's going on? This is bill bar and this

Speaker 9:          00:46:11       is, uh, this is the Monday morning podcast. This is the official one. That other one that I just left was a, was an unofficial and was not, uh, was not sanctioned by the board of directors of the Monday morning podcast. I've had a crazy day. I've been talking all day long. Uh, trying to be cute, trying to be funny. You're trying to sell tickets from my theater dates this weekend and I am pretty much all fucking talked out. So this is going to be a straight ahead, no bullshit. Let's get right to the meat of the fucking issue podcasts because, uh, I'm going to the ranger game tonight and, uh, I'm going to a bar first, which is stupid. I'm going to get sick, but I don't know how to say no, you know, I don't know how to say no. What the fuck else am I gonna do?

Speaker 9:          00:46:59       You know, so just regard the unofficial podcast, which said that I would be doing this podcast after the hockey game cause I'm not, I just decided fuck it. I'll do a quick 20 minute one within 19 minute intro. Um, if you're new to my podcast, I do one of these every Monday and I do them right here on Bill bird.com and uh, I also do them on my myspace page. No, I am not on Facebook. If you want to know why I'm not on Facebook for a, to the podcast, the one before this. And even though it's unofficial, it is my official feeling of fucking Facebook. Do you like this is footnotes with this podcast. All right. And this is the deal, man. Every week I do one of these and I answer people's questions. I read shit that they find underrated. Overrated. I give people advice, I read stories about revenge and whatever else this thing spins into when I also heightened my gigs.

Speaker 9:          00:47:52       Like for example, this weekend I'm going to be on April 3rd, I'm going to be at the lake shore theater in Chicago, Illinois. Um, all the information is on billboard.com myspace.com/bill burr. It's all up there. And on a Saturday I am going to be at the, uh, Trump marina. Isn't that what it is? I can't remember. I think that's what it is. Yeah. Will be in Atlantic city at the Trump marina. Why doesn't that sound right when it comes out on my fucking mouth or whatever, that's where I'm gonna say I'm going to be a Trump marina. We just added a second show, which is why I've been doing all this media today, which is why I'm fucking half asleep. So I'm going to sign a little bit drunk, but I'm not. Um, that Gig is this Saturday, April 4th, and I will be working with young Joe de Rosa, one of the new stars of the OB and Anthony Show.

Speaker 9:          00:48:46       Um, and he will also be on the opening. Anthony show with me as well. I this whole week, I'm going to be on it on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of this week. That would be March 31st April 1st and April 2nd and Joe to Rose's coming on on April 2nd. So there you go. Look at that. I got all my high-pitch out of the way and like I said, this is going to be really quick. All right. And uh, let's talk about my gig. This past weekend I was working at the house of comedy in Saint Louis and I had a great time, unbelievable crowds all weekend. Uh, my, uh, my eight person fan club showed up to members strong and a, I want to thank them for showing up. Uh, that's the group of people that followed me to Nashville. And you guys remember that story when they went to Kansas City? You want a quick recap because we've patched things up, um, between, it's actually had a blowout with my fan club.

Speaker 9:          00:49:43       There's only, I can't, who the fuck gets into a fight with the fucking fan club? All right. I just like saying I have a fan club. I feel like a teen idol. Like it should be singing some song about teenage teenage anx, you know, no bill. We don't, yeah, you deal with my fucking hair slicked back if I still adhere to slick back, you know, I'm looking over my shoulder like a fucking gay actor trying to be straight and then I fucking cat crashed my car and Mulholland drive is basically what happened. My Fan Club last time they saw me, they went to at least these St Louis Chapter. Um, um, basically they went to Kansas City when I was working the Improv. I'll tell you this story really quick. And, uh, they came in and they were excited and evidently they were being loud. So I'm sitting in the green room and the bouncer, it comes back and says, hey bill, this is a table.

Speaker 9:          00:50:30       People out there that really loud, they seem drunk. Do you want me to tell him to, uh, you know, sort of chill out a little bit before he go up? And I go, sure, that'd be great. And evidently the bouncer goes out there and he says to the fan club, he says, Hey, Bill Burke told you guys to shut the fuck up or something like that. So naturally they were besides themselves and for some reason decided to continue to drink so they could have a nice rational conversation about it after the fucking show. So the show went, next thing you know, I get 20 people come to me with, hey, bill written on their shirt and uh, they're all telling me what a fucking asshole I am. And I had nothing to do with it. And I explained myself on a podcast about it. I don't know when the fuck is was.

Speaker 9:          00:51:08       This was years ago. And uh, but anyways, it's the first time I've met any of them since then. And they were nice. They didn't try to kick the shit out of me. So evidently everything is all good. So I want to say thanks to them for coming out and also thanks to that crew of guys from the University of Kansas. That's right. Mother fuckers. They're sitting right now around a laptop, high fiving each other, probably doing drugs, legal or not legal. I want to thank all those guys, those motherfuckers on college, kid money, you know, drove all the way from uh, basically uh, the other side of Kansas City to come out to my show, which was really flattering on college kid money. Unless they got one rich French, which they probably do. There's always one rich front and you act like you're friends with them.

Speaker 9:          00:51:55       I'm going to blow up this spot right now. Act like you fucking friends with them and you're really not. He just had gas money in the fucking car, you know, then all of a sudden you wreck it. And then what do you do? You have the guy who should be in a biker gang, but for some reason he's still in college, welds a new front end to it and you turned it into a float and then you do a bunch of shit that would be considered a terrorist act in the air with the whole nine 11 Patriot Act. You'd never get away with it, right? Sound familiar? All right. Animal House reference for all you youngsters out there. All right, so this is the Monday morning podcast and this is going to be a lean mean one in these lean mean times of a fucked up economy.

Speaker 9:          00:52:32       Anybody else who do uh, did the right thing with their money and they're sick of people telling them that they have to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. It's like, no I don't. No, I don't. I have to fucking, I have to. What do I have to do? I don't know what have to, I had to pick myself up off the floor because he had done fucking ass. Knocked me down to it. I didn't do anything. You know, this whole all this time and make the front of that MTV cribs lifestyle, I should have been living in everyone else's, doesn't make a fucking difference in the end. You know, I'm trying to figure a way out, man. I'm trying to get off the wheel. I was trying to stop running on the wheel and I can't use fucking bankers. Got The whole thing sewed up.

Speaker 9:          00:53:11       If it go, this is another dick in my face. There's no way to fucking escape this shit. I'm really just going to have to work until I'm 106 and then I'm going to die and then that's going to be the end of it. You know, you think I don't have dreams. I don't want to retire open some fucking stupid ass bar down on the Florida keys. Sit there in a Hawaiian shirt. You know what I mean? It's like fucking sell drinks to convicted felons and a gay mass murderers who are on the run because they killed the fucking, sorry, I can't remember how that one went in front of you. What Andrew Cunanan referenced there? What did he kill Versace? Uh, I saw a really good looking woman sort of down. You don't, you don't like my girl gets like so good looking is so super model looking that they kind of look like an alien.

Speaker 9:          00:53:56       I was actually doing this interview with this Guy John McCarthy who has his own fucking website which escapes me. The name of it escapes me cause I'm half asleep and I did 10 of those interviews today but we were looking at this one. We were like, she's beautiful isn't she said, yeah, she's unique. He's like, is kind of looks reptilian. There's something about like once you're taller than five 11 as a woman and you still are somehow under 120 pounds, you know your eyes get really big. You just, you walk like literally alien. He look, you know what they look like. They're little, they look like big praying mantises praying mantises that you want to fuck. Okay. Um, anyways, let's get to the podcast questions. Like I said, this is going to be a real quick one. Other this, we're only 10 minutes in and Mario on the questions.

Speaker 9:          00:54:42       All right bill, I love this question by the way, cause this question needed to be asked. Bill, what the fuck is the deal with Ed hardy shirts? Can everybody just relax, take a big inhale and then exhale and just be happy that somebody questioned those fucking things? I'm gonna read it again so much. I love this question. Bill. What the fuck is the deal with Ed hardy shirts? Seems like it has become the uniform of the power tool. Am I an ask for not realizing these aren't the, these are the coolest things. Wait a minute. Am I asked for not realizing these are the coolest things ever or am I accidentally smart for realizing that I don't need to wear a dress shirt with a drawing of a dragon fucking Buddha, thanks in advance for help, Todd, you couldn't be more right. I don't, I don't get those.

Speaker 9:          00:55:31       You know what, those things are going to be, you know, every period I'm going to talk about fashion right now, every period has a moment where somebody where you know, a style comes out where you know that you know, 10 20 years down the line when they do the dazed and confused movie of that period, that's like, you know, they'll try to act like everybody was wearing that shit. Jesus Christ built say what you're trying to say. But at this way, I was alive during the 70s but I never worked bell bottoms. You know what I mean? I never had a big pink comb in my back pocket with feathered back hair. Brandon, my hair used to be like a fucking Brillo pad so I couldn't do it. But you know what I'm saying? Well, you know, whenever they do a movie about the 70s everybody looks like that.

Speaker 9:          00:56:17       You know what I mean? Everybody dresses like that. That's what those Ed hardy shirts are. Those are the fashion mistake of a, of this time period did fucking horrific. And not only that, that whole a bunch of drawing on your shirt. I wasn't that in like three years ago. I remember when I was still trying to be young three years ago at a, a at a, at a very, uh, very tipsy 37 years old. I, I, you know, I started wearing shirts like that. It was those shirts where initially for the people who weren't man enough to get a tattoo over their entire torso. And I remember like, literally like I think like a year and a half ago, I was just like, you know what, these, these fucking bedazzled shirts with the eagles and the fucking, uh, I dunno, ant eaters on them, whatever the hell they are with all these like prison tattoo designs, this shit's over.

Speaker 9:          00:57:11       And evidently it isn't. They're continuing with them. And Ed hardy doesn't dare like these. Uh, it's like those awful designs and bright colors, you don't seem like they would wear them. And the growing up Gadi sort of kids seems like they would wear, you know, big Wareham and they'd still get pussy, you know, cause they got the guns, they've got the attitude, you got the end, they go red. Now you get the attitude that movie fast times at Ridgemont High, every movie reference I'm gonna make is gonna be fucking 30 years old at this point. All right, you're absolutely right. I don't know what the deal with Ed hardy shirts are. They fucking horrific and not even Armenian guys wear them. They, at least as far as I know, they seem to wear those other bizarre but there bizarrely designed and they step out of Maseratis or at least to Armenian guys did at a car wash I saw in La. So now that becomes every Armenian guy in my mindset, but that's even fucking make sense. I don't care. Okay. I'm working on five hours sleep and I've been running my mouth. I'll fucking day. Uh, and yes, I will be giving excuses every five seconds for this podcast. All right. Question number two, Bill, I'm recently new to your podcast, but thanks to iTunes or the, the, uh, my podcast question is, do you follow the World Cup soccer in general? If so, do you root for any team specifically? And if not, you should consider the Seattle sounders then come up to Seattle for his show and a game they, Seattle sounders.

Speaker 9:          00:58:40       All right. Just when I thought Ed Hardy was going to be the worst thing I could picture in my mind, I'm just picturing the crew of people who sat around a fucking conference table and came up with a name for your soccer team. Dude, I'm not shitting on soccer before I trashed the name of your team. Let's get back to the first question. Do I follow World Cup soccer now? I don't. I would love to. You know, I, I've tried to follow that uh, w premier league. I tried to get into it cause I think it is cool as hell. And I actually, I actually liked soccer. You know, I actually like it. I know a lot of Americans don't like to shit, but I actually like it. But I don't like American soccer just because Americans don't seem to be into it that much. So it just kinda seems like you're watching the WWE NBA.

Speaker 9:          00:59:26       There's no excitement in the crowd. And you know, I can't get excited if no one else is excited cause I'm codependent. So, uh, the only time I followed the World Cup is when they actually have the World Cup. And when I watch it, I just root for the countries that I am. Um, you know, that my ancestors were, I guess some German Irish with a little bit of English. So I pretty much just, I root for uh, Germany because I think it's funny. It's just funny to root for Jeremy to be in a crowd of people rooting for Germany. It's just so fucking Cliche, like Naziesque, you know what I mean? There's no way to fucking sit there and a crowd full of people be sharing on Germany and somehow not feel like you're advocating the policies of Adolf Hitler. That's what I, that's what I like about Rudy for Germany is the, he just start laughing halfway through it. Like, Hey, wait, am I not be, oh wait a minute. No, no. I'm just waiting for the soccer team. That's right. That's right. And uh, I also root for the teams in South America because evidentaly if they miss a penalty shot, they go home and they get executed. So, um, but you know, there can only be one winner. So getting back to, uh, the Seattle sounders, I get it. What? Because uh, what is, what is outside of us at Puget sound? I know that some sort of sound, I just hate that fucking word. I gotta look it up again. What the fuck is this sound?

Speaker 10:         01:00:53       You don't

Speaker 9:          01:00:54       something? I don't know that I could define any sort of body of water other than an ocean. I know what an ocean is, right? I know what the fucking ocean is. We're trying to psych myself up so I can answer this. And Ocean is a, it's a lot of water. Water between continents.

Speaker 10:         01:01:14       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:01:15       What else does it have? Well, I had sharks that has salt water. I'm a fucking moron. What does this sound? We're just going to type sound in. Let's see what happens here. Sound is a vibration transmitted. That's not what I'm talking about. Hang on a second. Sound. Let's just write sound water. Water, sound effects. Geography. The glacier produces a sound speed of sound. How sound in air differs? Sound water productions. What the fuck?

Speaker 9:          01:01:51       All right, how about this? Let me, let me write it and then you gotta be a moron. This is how you find shit on the Internet. What is a sound? Enter web definition. Sound, sound, investments. You fucking con. I'm spelling it wrong. How do you spell sound for water? Here it is. Sound geography. Let's go to Wikipedia. God knows they're credible and geography sound or a seaway is a large sea or ocean inlet? Larger than a bay. All right. What the fuck is in inland and inlet is a narrow body body of water between islands or leading inland from a larger banal. I'm not going to read the rest of it cause it's just going to get confusing. I like that. An inlet is a narrow body of water between islands. Okay. So if sound is a big inlet, uh, Bay, I don't give a fuck. And then, Oh, Jesus Christ. I like, did she get a definition than every other word is highlighted because they know you're fucking stupid. So geography is sound or seaways a large sea or ocean inlet larger than a Ba. So I guess it is salt water.

Speaker 10:         01:03:08       Huh?

Speaker 9:          01:03:08       Okay. I sort of get what that is. So they're the sounders. All right, let's look up Seattle sounders. Let's look this up. This is exciting, isn't it? Seattle sounder.

Speaker 10:         01:03:23       Jeez.

Speaker 9:          01:03:24       Jesus Christ. You know, it's a small club when they're not even the number one fucking thing there. The third, that third lead on that Seattle sounders and see, do they have history?

Speaker 10:         01:03:36       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          01:03:37       Jesus Christ. You guys are really into that awful green and blue up there. Why don't you guys always have that? What does everything you have to look like? Algae when it comes to your sports teams. You know, given the algae isn't a good team color. Um, all right, let's get, let's get the stop fucking car. I actually liked soccer and I'm trashing that. I mentioned the shadow to the people from Kansas University. Let me get back to fucking anyway. What the fuck are we here?

Speaker 9:          01:04:04       Hmm. All right. Anyways, well here's the kid hyping up the Seattle sounders game. Are there new mls expansion team up here and the atmosphere was electric. I suppose I'm a little bias in the soccer is easily the greatest sport in the world, but having been over in Germany for the 2006 World Cup, the sounders game felt oddly similar. Okay. Now do you work for the Seattle sounders? Are you really going to say going to Germany for the 2006 World Cup that going to a home game for the Seattle sounders was equivalent to that? I don't know. Evidently he is saying that it's a shit and he should have and you only go up there and you have a good time because you'll be surrounded by a sea, not a sound, not an inlet of a of green. That was stupid. Why we just said that. I see. Not a sound, not a bay. That's what I should've said inlet. That didn't make sense. Did it cause an inlet is why she and let does make sense, doesn't it? What does an inlet, I can't even remember. See, this is why something in school and inland and let is a small, straight, sorta fucking body of water between,

Speaker 10:         01:05:14       okay.

Speaker 9:          01:05:16       He didn't want, if this sailor listened to this shoot, I hope you're enjoying this because I know you're fucking laughing, but just know that you dressed like you're in the village people. Alright, let's get onto the revenge stories, shall we. Uh, well, how about we do overrated underwear because I didn't close with the revenge stories cause he thinks he's so fucking long. And not to mention there's a guy talking a little bit of shit about some of your other revenge story. All right, let's get with overrated, underrated. All I have this week is one overrated because this is going to be the stripped down. Send me a text message out, right? The stripped down version. Okay. Over, I gotta end this thing in five minutes, so I got to hurry here. Uh, Ross, I'm going to miss my drinking time. Overrated. Uh, thanks for the end.

Speaker 9:          01:05:55       I'm a little tall kid, then I got an overrated for you fucking relationships. Why in the hell can't guys get it out? Get on the damn boat already. The single guys have it down. Wind them. Dynam fucking and fucking leave. I guess it's like you said, uh, I'm sorry. People like I can't, I, you know, I usually suck at reading them. Just really even worse. Signup Dynamynd you fucking leave. That's all the single guys do it. I guess it's like you said, I think it was two Paul podcasts ago or so. You feel the gravitational pull to get married and have kids. I guess that's guys had the same poll about being dumb enough to try and make a relationship work. Uh, yeah. I think there's a lot of truth to that. I think what you should do is you should just remain signals for your entire twenties, you know, and right time, right about the time you're like 30.

Speaker 9:          01:06:47       Then you know, once you get all your fucking out of your system, then you can just kind of be like, all right, I need to, I need to, you know, you're going to want to hang with somebody at some point. You know, you don't want to be the old guy in the bar like me. Like I'm about to be in 45 minutes, you know, hey, there's sugar, you know, calling women by old old rat pack names. Um, all right, well let's get on to the, uh, the revenge story. I'm going to read this guy's first cause he's talking a little bit of trash and I like this guy's coming up calm and he's coming out really confident. All alright. Revenge story number one, Bill. It seems if all the, it seems like all their events or stories that you've been reading on the podcast lately have been sent sent by a bunch of pansies that take the pussy passive form of revenge and fuck with somebody's car.

Speaker 9:          01:07:35       Shit like that is lame and a pathetic attempt to get back at someone. What they really need to do is take a more aggressive approach. Here is my revenge story and I want you guys to know this. I haven't even reviving read this one yet. All right. I just saw that intro and I'm like, well, with an intro like that, this has to be the best revenge story we've heard so far. So with that, let's all judge this guys revenge story as I read it for the first time and I want you to know that things like fucking nine pages long, Goddamn people take revenge is a quick, what the fuck did I just do? Revenge is not a quick thing here. Hang on. I just accidentally hit the wrong button. All right, I'm back. I'm back. All right, here we go. The revenge story. Hi Phil. This happened a few years ago when I was 17 and working at a fast food joint. One night I was closing the place and I was rolling a blunt at one of the tables to smoke after I got off of work and other words. He was a typical fucking fast food kit. So anyways, a new, a new kid that just started working there a couple of weeks before thinking he was doing the right thing.

Speaker 10:         01:08:43       Oh,

Speaker 9:          01:08:44       did you read? You read, you know, half the shit isn't my problem. You guys don't write in complete sentences. End. It was a new kid just got thrown on a fucking joint, a goddamn table in the new kid. Thought he was doing the right thing and he turned me into the manager on duty that night. The manager laughed at him because he couldn't care less about what I was doing. All the fact that his employees smoked weed. That isn't that Nice. A great manager. Next day when I go into work, that same manager tells me what happened the night before. I'm not pissed, but I'm more like, you know what the fuck does this guy would run to the manager and think that he's some sort of whistleblower. I decide. So I decided that the guy needs to learn his lesson. Jesus Christ. Nice set up so far and I'll see you guys. I'm enjoying this. So anyways, I call up a friend of mine to get what I need and when the kid goes on his break in order to his lunch, when he's not looking, I dropped the two hits of acid. I brought two with me in his drink.

Speaker 9:          01:09:49       Okay, what did I read that wrong? I got two hits of acid. Okay, you're not you guys, can you proofread these fucking things so I don't sound like the dumbest person. You know what he did? He took two hits ass and he dropped him in his fucking fruit punch. So anyways, he sits down and he starts eating and I go back to work and I wait for it to kick in and the entertainment to start.

Speaker 9:          01:10:13       All right, I'm starting to get the guest to the vibe of this story. Evidently when he says your king the car, he doesn't mean that you're a pussy because you didn't do something face to face. Evidently this maniac doesn't think you took it far enough. All right, back to the story and an hour later when he clocks back in, I can tell it's beginning to kick in. Hard I watch is to do good or current starts to trip balls and freaks everyone out. Such a trip balls and freaks everyone out. Nobody else knows what what is going on with the guy, so they lock them in the back manager's office to this is really dangerous because he didn't know he was probably never done drugs. He probably thought he was going crazy.

Speaker 10:         01:10:56       Okay. That's

Speaker 9:          01:10:57       really dangerous and fucking hilarious. All right. When he's in there, he really starts to lose his shit and tear the place apart. My manager calls the cops and when they get there they go back and cuff. They go back and cut them and put them in the back of a squad. There's a lot of confusion in the place and everyone tries to figure out what the hell just happened. The cop starts to question everyone to try and figure out just what went on, but I play it up dumb just like everyone else saying. He just started to act crazy too. What do you have a life of crime? You're playing that shit off, not worry that you're going to get caught or you want to work release from prison. Anyways, after taking everyone's statements, the cops leave and caught the guy off. He never did come back to work or even show his place face in that place again. Don't know if it was out of embarrassment, confusion to what happened. Hang on. Diffusion to what happened or outright fear of the place, so I don't know. Whatever happened to him, it's still is the best 15 bucks that I ever spent. Jesus Christ. Dude, that's fucking hardcore, man.

Speaker 9:          01:12:09       I like you. I you confuses. I Dunno why. I Dunno if he was embarrassed. If he was confused through do you don't think he figured out what the fuck happened and he wasn't able to put fucking one and one together and make to how big? That's what I had to say. Really instead said, rather than say, put two and two together and get four, this is so easy. This is one in one. Let's see. I read it out. I mean people do think he read it out for doing drugs in the last 24 hours. Then all of a sudden he starts fucking tripping. Wow. I'm such a sadistic fuck. Maybe there would be a part of me that would really enjoy that. Especially if he was like, uh, like always doing the right thing. You know what I mean? You know, people who always fuck up in life just really hate people who are doing the right thing.

Speaker 9:          01:12:54       You know? I told them, I talked to you about these people they called [inaudible] and as much as I hate cons, I really am one when it comes to certain kinds of people, I have no tolerance for people who are pussies. I don't, and it's not because I'm a tough guy, probably reminds me of a certain part of my personality that I don't like. But in general, you know who goes on and tell somebody, you know what? Fuck that guy. What was he trying to take you a position at the fryer later so it could be fucking Douche bag of the month that really must've psychologically damaged and made me think about that. You know, his whole life, that Mama's boy, he probably always like, you know, Eddie just said it sandwich. Now we swim and he didn't wait 15 minutes. Oh, that's very good Mike. He always got rewarded for it and then he fucking ratchet you up.

Speaker 9:          01:13:41       Hey, you know that fucking, you know guy over there smoking weed and then the manager. So it's like, yeah, that's what you do. We work in a fast food joint. Do you think this was our dream in life for the love of God? Somebody give me a hit because I can't take the fucking paint a reality anymore. Once you go mop something up your little pussy, that's probably what happened. And the next day's a cheat. If I went home, talked to his mom, I couldn't believe it. I mean, I mean he was doing, he had a marijuana cigarette. Well don't you worry you did the right thing. Okay. And you just stay away from him and you go to work tomorrow and you make sure you doing coach and then he goes to work and he fucked a fucking puts the date rape drug in there at the date rape drug.

Speaker 9:          01:14:29       You know what I'm saying? He puts acid in that Jesus Christ that you've never even had mentioned. You've never even had a sip of beer in. The first thing happens to you is to hit the athlete. I never took assets that God, thank God, thank God I never read it out. Somebody doing drugs. Um, anyways. All right, here's, here's another revenge story. I'm going to read this one, then I got to wrap it up. Uh, hey bill. Uh, I'm with you on the no revenge rule. People suffer. Oh, this wasn't even a revenge thing. This is just a question. This guy needs some advice. This, this, uh, falls into the asset bill portion of the podcast. The advice people like to ask me for advice, even though I'm a fucking moron. Let me just read this whole thing. Cause, uh, anyways, I was writing to you to talk about, okay here, here's the part where he s he needs some advice. Anyway, so I was writing to you and talk about my cousins, have a girlfriend and hopefully to get some advice. I love how con is just become the catchphrase of the podcast here. Anyways, me and my girlfriend have been together for about two and a half years. We knew each other as teenagers. Um, along with some other people she dated. Um, she dated one of our friends and he eventually moved on and got married. Me and her remained friends and eventually we became close. We started dating. She isn't the best girlfriend.

Speaker 9:          01:15:47       I figure that. Consider your calling her a con. Yeah because she had a couple of things that annoyed you. She has the best girlfriend but I have become pretty, pretty comfortable having her around and her two kids not from me. You love or two kids? Not For me. They love me and we have become quite the family. Here is where Shit went wrong recently we visited our friends in New York and we are all partying and shit and I get a horrible headache and sit down on the couch to rest it up. I was out of it, so like 30 minutes and I wake up to a nightmare here. My friend in the kitchen hitting on my girlfriend. Wow. If, if, if that's not bad enough, she's into this shit and encourage him, encouraging him and flirting back. After I had all I could take, I walked into the kitchen and they made the oh shit face when they looked at me, but I didn't say anything.

Speaker 9:          01:16:43       Then I didn't say anything. Then in there the next night for possibly or possibly the same nights since that was hammered. Every day I was there, me and my girlfriend go to bed in the guest room while we are laying there, she gets up to go to the bathroom and after she didn't return, after about 15 minutes, I opened the door and what do I see him and her standing there alone in the hallway, having a quiet conversation. Jesus Christ to this is getting creepy. Here's her story. She was just entertaining herself and it wasn't going to go anywhere. She feels she didn't sleep with him or anyone else. So I'm overreacting. I'm overreacting by considering breaking up, considering all we really, she have to lose. Oh, considering all that you guys have to lose. Yeah. It's really her with the two fucking kids. All right. So anyways, she's been walking around crying and upset about the shit she has told me she's sorry and will never happen again.

Speaker 9:          01:17:41       She has been pretty much worshiping me the last few days and the shit is starting to eat away at me. I also know that I purchased most of the shit in this house and if slash when we separate I'll be taking most of it with me and that is going to make it a lot more difficult and painful for her and her kids at this point I'm like, fuck all of this and I am ready to leave. I'm ready to leave and shit. But honestly I'm starting to feel like a real douche for not being able to get past this shit. The kids will be devastated and they pretty much doomed once I leave because I am pretty much the glue that holds this family together. At the same time, I feel like if she would do this shit after years, we're kind of hope. Does that give us for the future?

Speaker 9:          01:18:22       What kind of relationship can we have app to some shit like this? I would love some feedback on this bill. Even though you never read my letters during the podcast insert guiltier just telling me what you think I should do in this situation. All right dude. A year in that classic halfway point between emotion, you know for your feelings. For the kids. You're in the halfway point between that and knowing exactly what the fuck you need to do and you're doing what you need to do. You need to reach out to people who are going to re affirm what you know in your heart of hearts. What you have to do is you have to get the fuck out of there. You gotta get out of there. All right. Do you think that's the first guy she hit on? You know, and if she's hitting on guys, that means she's probably fucking other guys.

Speaker 9:          01:19:12       And if she's not, she's going to, and right now she's just in a panic mode and she's in a panic mode, not because she's worried about losing you because of all that other bullshit that you mentioned because you sound like you're the most responsible of the people there. And the only fucking hope her kids have is that you'll stick around because she is a, I don't know, she doesn't have her shit together. Um, you got to get out to, you got to get out and you know, you, you might be good for the kids right now, but eventually you're not going to be because of the misery that you're going to have. Being in a relationship with somebody that you can't trust as far as you can fucking throw him is eventually going to rub off on how you feel about the whole situation. And it's going to be really hard for you not to be a fucking douche around, but those kids, you probably gonna start drinking and eventually you're going to start a fucking relationship. And the longer you're there, the more shit you're going to buy.

Speaker 9:          01:20:15       This is what you gotta do. You gotta give yourself fucking six weeks, all right? Just break it up in two week increments. The first two weeks is going to be brutal. Just cry on the floor with a pint of fucking Haagen daas like a little bitch and get through it. And every time you want to call that fucking cunt that you can't trust anymore, you call a friend of yours. Instead, you call a buddy of yours to kind of buddy who's gonna fucking take you out drinking and gets you back in the fucking game. That's what you do. All right? And you do that and turn that time. The last bucket thing you do is get into another relationship. All right? Don't fucking do that. Don't do the J. Lo, we get out of that and you jump into something else. Fuck that. All right? You stay fucking single, you know, and just just get through six fucking weeks in gradually and that after two weeks goes by, you know what I mean?
