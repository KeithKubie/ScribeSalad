[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.620
SPEAKER 1: I want to jump
in at the very start.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.660
How did "Critical
Role," really begin?

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.670
It grew out of the house
game, but how did you

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.000
take it from that to this
massive digital entertainment

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.067
conglomerate that you are now?

00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:22.900
MARISHA RAY: Oh, man,
that's a big question.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.240
MATTHEW MERCER: I think we're
still figuring that out.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.240
MARISHA RAY: Yeah.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.760
SPEAKER 1: Five words or less.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.243
MATTHEW MERCER: Felicia
Day asked us to.

00:00:31.243 --> 00:00:32.159
That's how it started.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:33.770
We were just playing at home.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.270
I've been playing
since high school.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.254
And I dragged this guy
and a few other people

00:00:37.254 --> 00:00:38.920
who had never played
before in for a one

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.289
shot that turn into a home
campaign for a couple of years.

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.580
So in a conversation between
Ashley Johnson and Felicia

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.871
at a party, she mentioned
this D&amp;D game of voice actors

00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:49.537
and they were just ramping up
their content on Geek &amp; Sundry,

00:00:49.537 --> 00:00:51.870
and she went, why don't you
guys do that on the network?

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.540
And we went, what?

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.993
People will watch us play D&amp;D?

00:00:57.993 --> 00:00:58.820
No.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.100
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: We were
more skeptics than anything.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.933
We were like, nobody
is going to watch this.

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:05.290
We'll do it one time,
like 15 people will watch.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.970
And we'll be like,
OK, that was fun.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:07.420
MATTHEW MERCER: And
even then, there

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.310
was like some workshopping,
because the initial idea was

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.910
pre-Twitch.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.045
It was like, you guys will
play the game for a bit.

00:01:12.045 --> 00:01:13.420
And then, for the
boss fight, you

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.040
jump into like the
D&amp;D video game.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.970
And I'm like, no.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.220
We just want to play our game.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.652
This is still our game.

00:01:18.652 --> 00:01:20.110
MARISHA RAY: Yeah,
it was very hard

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.693
describing to people
who didn't really

00:01:21.693 --> 00:01:24.880
play "Dungeons and Dragons"
how that completely

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.360
broke "Dungeons and Dragons."

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.740
And then eventually,
when Twitch came around,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.750
it was just full live format.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.769
We're not changing
anything about our game.

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:37.060
And we're like, OK, that's
pretty much the only way you

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.630
could do this,
but no one's going

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.204
to watch four hours
a week of D&amp;D.

00:01:42.204 --> 00:01:43.870
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
Little did they know.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.328
MATTHEW MERCER:
And now we're here,

00:01:45.328 --> 00:01:48.039
so life is a strange scenario.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.080
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Yeah,
for us as a company too,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.020
it's been sort of perpetual
catch up, we always call it.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.510
We've always been
taken by surprise

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.320
at the fan reaction, the
numbers, how it keeps growing,

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.130
and how it expands
into new things.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.230
So we've just tried to
play catch up as it grows.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.010
Yeah, I got it.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.490
Have you got that?

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.580
MATTHEW MERCER: I got it.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.010
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: OK.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.120
Over here.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.165
I got this one over here.

00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:09.380
We got to bring
people in for this.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.880
Yeah.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.550
MARISHA RAY: Well, and
the Twitch algorithm

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.860
is weird, not to out any of our
friends a Twitch or anything.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.940
But when you only see the
concurrent number of viewers

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.160
watching at a time,
that's a little hard

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.920
to gauge how many
people in total

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.040
are actually aware in
watching your show.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.860
So I think it wasn't until
the first New York Comic Con

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.461
that we went to and we ended up
having a line around the block,

00:02:36.461 --> 00:02:37.210
and we were like--

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.735
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Oh, no.

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:38.710
MARISHA RAY: Oh.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.610
I think more than 10,000
people watch our show.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.700
I don't think that's accurate,
unless all 10,000 are here

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.770
in New York City.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.780
So that took some
time to get used to.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.020
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: What was it?

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.370
It was like a comic
book store, and we're

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.440
like oh, we'll just
take the quarter front

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.051
part of your store.

00:02:55.051 --> 00:02:56.800
And we'll sign some
autographs for anybody

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.450
that happens to come in.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.110
And it was out and around the
corner and that cop came in.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.190
He's like, who's this for?

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.300
What's this like for you?

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.800
Who is this?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.049
And we're like, it's for us.

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:06.965
We're "Critical Role."

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:07.450
MARISHA RAY: We play
"Dungeons and Dragons."

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.200
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
He's like what are you?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.240
[LAUGHING]

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.580
MATTHEW MERCER: It's weird.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.282
SPEAKER 1: Speaking of playing
catchup, as an LA commuter,

00:03:16.282 --> 00:03:18.965
the podcasts have
been a lifesaver.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:19.840
MATTHEW MERCER: Good.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.830
So happy to hear that.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.570
SPEAKER 1: What's been the
inspiration behind some

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.150
of your newer offerings,
"Handbooker Helper,"

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.480
"Between the Sheets,"
"All Work, No Play,"

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.676
what's been the driving
force behind that?

00:03:33.676 --> 00:03:35.800
MARISHA RAY: When we first
branched off and decided

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.670
to do our own
content, I broke down

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.420
into a Venn diagram what
made "Critical Role"

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.580
intriguing and successful.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.760
And it's clearly not
just because we're people

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.180
playing "Dungeons and Dragons."

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.570
There's a lot of D&amp;D
shows, and none of them

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.750
have exploded in the way
that "Critical Role" has.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.700
And so if one half is the
fascinating piece of "Dungeons

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.980
and Dragons," I think
the other half is

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.710
our relationships as friends.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.530
And we've known each
other for so long.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.220
And being voice actors,
we've gotten really good

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.029
at the give and take of
interpersonal relationships,

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.670
both on stream and off stream.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.530
So I wanted to experiment with
what people were engaged in.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.460
So we broke down the content
into three categories, which

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.780
was personality based, which
is like "All Work, No Play" was

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.300
pretty much straight
personality based,

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.097
gaming based, which is what
"Handbooker Helper" is,

00:04:38.097 --> 00:04:39.680
and then kind of
right down the middle

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.810
with "Between the
Sheets," we were talking

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.250
a little bit about how we came
into becoming storytellers

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.440
as professionals.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.730
So it worked pretty well.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.699
We found that people are
engaged in us as personalities.

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:59.240
MATTHEW MERCER:
Which is still weird.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.024
MARISHA RAY: Yeah.

00:05:00.024 --> 00:05:01.940
MATTHEW MERCER: I say
this only because, I'm--

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.200
MARISHA RAY: It's interesting.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.400
MATTHEW MERCER: I have
my own insecurities

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.730
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:05.900
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
I heart you, Matt.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.530
MATTHEW MERCER:
Oh, you're sweet.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.821
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: I heart you.

00:05:07.821 --> 00:05:10.180
MATTHEW MERCER: But it's
been a fascinating catchup

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.680
to try and figure out why things
have gone the way they have

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.270
and breaking them down
and then going, really?

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:16.520
OK.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.360
Cool.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.200
MARISHA RAY: So it
was kind of that--

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.280
so it was why does
our content work?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.850
And then, the other
later half of the goal,

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.400
which is what do we want
to do with our content?

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.950
What is the goal of our content?

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.370
And we discussed
a lot as a company

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.020
that our mission with
"Critical Role," in general,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.220
is to tear down the
barriers into storytelling,

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.520
and to let everybody know that
everyone can be a storyteller.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.680
There's a story
behind all of us,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.557
and don't be afraid to get out
there and tell these things,

00:05:52.557 --> 00:05:54.890
whether it's in your own
personal "Dungeons and Dragons"

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.060
group, whether it's fan
fiction, whether you're trying

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.970
to start a vlog yourself.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:03.740
Try to lower the
barriers to entry.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.980
So that's where "Handbooker
Helper" came from,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.350
was trying to not have
people be so intimidated

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.847
by the players handbook, and
to just get people playing.

00:06:11.847 --> 00:06:13.430
MATTHEW MERCER:
There's nothing harder

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.540
than going to a bunch
of people who have never

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.069
played a role
playing game, like I

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:17.360
want to try out some D&amp;D. Cool.

I was out. uh-uh.

and I was like, nope.

No, thanks.

I want an axe.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.321
Can I hit things?

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:28.820
Cool.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.986
Just tell me as we go along.

00:06:29.986 --> 00:06:31.160
That's all I need to know.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.720
I watched the "Handbooker
Helper" videos and I'm like,

oh.

00:06:35.885 --> 00:06:36.860

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.318
MARISHA RAY: Six
years later, yeah.

SPEAKER 1: But, I mean,
there's so many pictures.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.450
It's practically a
picture book, really,

like all of this player
handbooks, you know?

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.390
MATTHEW MERCER: Oh,
straight up, yeah.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.640
This table is technically
a picture, right?

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.780
Technically.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.380

picture with numbers.

TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: No.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.340
SPEAKER 1: And Marisha, you
were mentioning that all of this

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.298
was about letting people
tell their own stories

00:06:57.298 --> 00:06:58.940
and that's all nice,
but was it really

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.880
just a matter of getting
Sam and Liam into a hot tub

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.710
and recording that?

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:03.740
Is that the main goal?

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:03.980
[LAUGHING]

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.000
MATTHEW MERCER: I mean,
if we're being honest--

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.630
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Oh,
you cut to the core of us.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.750
MARISHA RAY: What can
I subject my friends to

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.126
and say, oh, it's
for production.

00:07:12.126 --> 00:07:12.958
People will love it.

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:13.540
It's great.

00:07:17.084 --> 00:07:17.750
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.580
So I want to touch
on a little bit more

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:22.910
of turning this home game
into this internet phenomenon,

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:29.370
and your own relationships with
D&amp;D as a game and as a system,

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.110
almost.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.240
So how did each of
you start playing D&amp;D?

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.280
What was your
first introduction?

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.690
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Well, I
can say the first time I ever

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.030
played was at Matt and
Marisha's apartment for the very

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:40.770
first game that we ever had.

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.920
I had remembered hearing about
D&amp;D from people, other voice

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.770
actors, like Gary Lowenthal,
and Crispin Freeman.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:52.650
And when they talked about it,
I was always really intrigued.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:54.570
From a video game
perspective, there

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.190
are open sandbox
type games where

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.773
you can go wherever you want to
and engage in certain missions

00:07:58.773 --> 00:08:00.660
as you want, but
you're still limited

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:02.670
by whatever is programmed.

00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:05.220
And the first time
that we played,

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.672
I was very meek and timid.

00:08:06.672 --> 00:08:08.130
And Matt was asking
me things like,

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.338
what's your character's name?

00:08:09.338 --> 00:08:11.340
And I was like oh, shit.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.090
Uh-- Grog.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.720
And He was like, OK, Grog.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.842
What does your
barbarian Goliath do?

00:08:17.842 --> 00:08:19.050
I was like, what do you mean?

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.820
He was like, what's
his back story?

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.580
I was like, he makes
fine leather boots.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.134
And he was like, OK.

00:08:25.134 --> 00:08:25.800
We'll get there.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.680
And later on in the game, when
there was this intimidation

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.730
moment with a tavern keep,
he was like what do you do?

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.650
And I was like, I mean, can
I do it whatever I want?

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.260
He goes, you can certainly try.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.650
And I just-- the first thing
that came off my head and he

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.150
just went with it and rolled
with it, and I was like oh my--

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.335
oh my god, literally, anything
that pops into my head,

00:08:46.335 --> 00:08:47.700
you will try and roll with.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.540
And so the limits off
of like what you can try

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.530
were just taken off.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.240
And that to me, was the
real hook, the real drug.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.460
Because it was like,
oh jeez, yeah, I'm

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.790
not limited in any way.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.080
And I think I had never
viewed "Dungeons and Dragons"

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.214
in that way.

00:09:05.214 --> 00:09:06.630
And then came all
the other things

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.750
with the complex characters
and the storylines

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:14.280
and just keeping up with what
everybody was doing in the game

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.850
and how invested you
become as more clay gets

00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:18.960
slapped on the sculpture.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.220
And so that's where I
fell in love with it.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.670
I was like oh, man, I had
a preset idea about what

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:27.270
this book was and maybe how
it was played because of what

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:32.160
media, back in the '80s and '90s
told us, and I was just wrong.

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.780
MARISHA RAY: Both
Travis and I were

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:39.000
spoiled because Matthew Mercer
was our first dungeon master.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.260
So that's hard to recover from.

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.830
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
Yeah, for real.

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.870
You're Bey.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.720
Matt Mercer is Bey.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.350
MARISHA RAY: Yeah,
I didn't get that

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.670
into "Dungeons and Dragons"
until I moved to Los Angeles.

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.390
Because I'm from Kentucky
and the satanic panic

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.145
is still very much
kind of a thing there.

00:09:59.145 --> 00:10:02.660
It basically eradicated D&amp;D and
now it's slowly coming back.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.910
MATTHEW MERCER: Don't do that.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:04.740
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
Well, Kentucky, Texas,

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.610
we got a Southern thing.

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:06.230
It's--

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.126
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:07.126 --> 00:10:08.100
SPEAKER 1: I'm
Missouri, so I'm down.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.563
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: See there.

00:10:08.563 --> 00:10:09.490
Double woo.

00:10:09.490 --> 00:10:10.209
Slap hands.

00:10:10.209 --> 00:10:12.000
MARISHA RAY: But half
of the country-- woo.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.640
And then I was deeply
interested in trying.

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.490
And we met through
mutual friends.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.470
And just came to you
one day, and we're

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.800
like, can you-- can
you run a game for us?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.350
And then after that, I went
and did a few other games,

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.005
but just kept coming
back to Matt Mercer.

00:10:31.005 --> 00:10:32.130
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Dang it.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:32.930
MATTHEW MERCER:
First one's free.

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.970
MARISHA RAY: Free-- I was going
to say, once you get a taste--

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.210
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Part
of your master plan.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:37.209
MATTHEW MERCER: Exactly.

00:10:37.209 --> 00:10:39.600
I started in high school.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.975
I was a freshman and was just
joining this anime video game

00:10:44.975 --> 00:10:47.100
club called the Popular
Arts Club that I eventually

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.200
became president of and
met Sandra here, actually.

00:10:52.124 --> 00:10:53.790
The guys who were
running it at the time

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.290
were all these like
track and field,

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.785
like really fit,
awesome kind of guys.

00:10:57.785 --> 00:10:59.910
And they're like, hey,
Matt, want to play some D&amp;D?

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.840
I'm like, sure, what's that?

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.339
Whatever.

00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:02.640
I'll do whatever you want.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.840
You guys are cool.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.440
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
Is that homework?

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.370
Am I doing it for you?

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:06.090
What is it?

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.340
MATTHEW MERCER: And so, they
brought me into the game.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.190
And as soon as I started
reading the books--

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:12.790
I'd seen some of
the art and things,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.840
might have had kind
of an interest,

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.173
but never actually dove into it.

00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:17.110
And it just consumed
me entirely.

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:19.330
And so I built this
really elaborate character

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.570
and this whole theme.

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:21.390
And I was so excited to play.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:22.931
And then I started
playing with them.

00:11:22.931 --> 00:11:25.950
And they're great guys,
terrible, terrible gamers.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.170
I love them to death, but
it was really frustrating

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:29.260
because I was the
only one that seemed

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.509
to be trying to push a story,
and they were just like,

00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:33.480
I want roll high
numbers and fool around.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.095
I remade Ryu as a warrior.

00:11:35.095 --> 00:11:36.117
I'm shooting Hadoukens.

00:11:36.117 --> 00:11:37.450
Let's go fight at an In and Out.

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:38.300
I'm like, I don't--

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:38.800
what?

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.780
Really?

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.280
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
At and In and Out?

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:40.950
MATTHEW MERCER:
Yeah, that happened.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.690
We traveled to modern day
and went to an In and Out

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:43.810
and had a burger
and gained a level.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:43.890
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Oh no.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.390
MATTHEW MERCER:
This is legitimately

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:46.960
one of the sessions
that happened.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.130
But I got frustrated
and was like,

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:49.100
I know this can be bigger.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:49.780
I know this can be better.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.071
So I left that game and
started running my own, invited

00:11:52.071 --> 00:11:53.460
two of my good friends to play.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:55.080
And I've just been dungeon
mastering ever since.

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.060
And it's through that
space with my friends

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.940
that I've kind of come out
of my shell as a person.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.510
I'd gotten enough nerve
to start doing theater.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.030
I learned a lot about
kind of honing my ability

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.600
to be social as an awkward
artist kid growing up.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:13.400
So I've been D&amp;D, while you guys
were fully formed human beings

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.230
by that time it came around
to you, for the most part.

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.510
It was very much a
proto experience for me

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:20.610
to figure out who I wanted
to be and take steps

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.370
in that direction.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.844
So I'm very thankful for it.

00:12:23.844 --> 00:12:25.394
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: OG.

00:12:25.394 --> 00:12:26.810
MATTHEW MERCER:
Not as OG as some.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.730
[LAUGHS] I'm always
like, yeah, I played,

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.782
you know, back in the mid '90s.

00:12:30.782 --> 00:12:32.240
And then I meet
guys at conventions

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.239
that are really awesome
and they're like, bitch,

00:12:34.239 --> 00:12:35.540
I've been playing since '73.

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:38.660
And I'm like, yes,
sir, whatever, sir.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.482
Respect.

00:12:39.482 --> 00:12:40.940
SPEAKER 1: Do you
remember what all

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:42.231
of your first characters where?

00:12:42.231 --> 00:12:42.845
We know Grog.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:43.970
MATTHEW MERCER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:45.016
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Yeah.

00:12:45.016 --> 00:12:46.730
MARISHA RAY: I do.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.950
What was her name?

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:52.500
She was a control ranger class.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.000
It was 4E.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.900
MATTHEW MERCER: Right,
because it was fourth edition.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.780
MARISHA RAY: It was weird.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.340
I don't remember
her name though.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.460
But I remember she was
a-- wasn't she a drow?

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.140
MATTHEW MERCER: She
was a drow, yeah.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:00.920
MARISHA RAY: Yeah.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.540
Because everyone's
first D&amp;D character

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:04.179
is always a drow ranger.

00:13:04.179 --> 00:13:05.470
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Mine wasn't.

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.345
SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE]
good drow ranger.

00:13:07.345 --> 00:13:08.990
Did you also use two centaurs?

00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.275
MARISHA RAY: Probably.

00:13:09.275 --> 00:13:10.520
MATTHEW MERCER: A
little panther with you.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.091
[LAUGHS]

00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:11.840
MARISHA RAY: Yeah.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.820
MATTHEW MERCER: I think my first
character wizard was a wizard.

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:18.022
But I imagined the visual
of Gandalf with a sword

00:13:18.022 --> 00:13:18.980
in "Lord of the Rings."

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.610
I'm like, I want a
wizard that uses a sword.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:23.026
And so there was a militant
wizard kit for second edition.

00:13:23.026 --> 00:13:24.320
And was I like, heck yeah.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.030
I'm going to be a wizard with a
sword, so when I'm out of magic

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:27.238
I can get to the front lines.

00:13:27.238 --> 00:13:28.490
That's a bad idea, by the way.

00:13:28.490 --> 00:13:29.906
Second edition
wizards especially.

00:13:29.906 --> 00:13:31.220
You have like three hit points.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.926
You should not go to the front.

00:13:33.926 --> 00:13:35.675
And his name was
Emeritus Trent, because I

00:13:35.675 --> 00:13:37.700
was a big Piers Anthony
Xanth nerd growing up,

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.990
and so I used that name.

00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:40.000
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Wow.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.416
MATTHEW MERCER:
But classic story.

00:13:41.416 --> 00:13:43.790
He was a young,
apprentice wizard,

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.120
but his parents were
mysteriously killed

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.219
and he had-- you know, every
other D&amp;D character ever made.

00:13:50.219 --> 00:13:51.510
So that was my first character.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:53.887
Not my proudest moment,
looking back, necessarily.

00:13:53.887 --> 00:13:55.220
But you have to start somewhere.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:55.910
You have to start somewhere.

00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:57.170
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: It's so
funny how the backstories

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:58.560
are all kind of similar.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.552
I remember before the
second campaign and Matt

00:14:00.552 --> 00:14:02.510
was like, when you're
making up your backstory,

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:04.946
don't be afraid to let
your parents be alive.

00:14:04.946 --> 00:14:05.445
[LAUGHING]

00:14:05.445 --> 00:14:08.120
And I was like, eh, OK.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:10.550
MATTHEW MERCER: Being a hero
is a pretty dangerous career

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:14.360
in fantasy realms, but being a
parent is twice as dangerous.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.250
The minute you have a
kid in a fantasy realm,

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:18.999
your chances of survival
are cut in a quarter.

00:14:18.999 --> 00:14:20.790
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Oh,
you're having a kid?

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:22.170
Oh, sorry.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:27.500
SPEAKER 1: So what would
you say is your, now,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.050
with all of your experience
creating characters,

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.020
creating worlds, what is
the process for which you

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.580
could create another character?

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:39.200
When "Critical Role," season
3 happens, or god forbid,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.100
your character dies?

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:42.260
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: When
we all TPK this week.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.010
MARISHA RAY: Yeah.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.264
MATTHEW MERCER: Shh.

00:14:44.264 --> 00:14:45.680
SPEAKER 1: I'm
only on episode 22.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.640
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
The fear is real.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:47.570
MATTHEW MERCER:
Just be smart, guys.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.611
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: We're
in constant fear of TPK,

00:14:49.611 --> 00:14:50.810
so it's OK.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.210
SPEAKER 1: So what
is your strategy

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.480
to create your characters?

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.679
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Mine-- so
Grog was just one little thing

00:14:58.679 --> 00:14:59.970
and then the next and the next.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:01.550
And then I think I kind
of carried that over.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:04.140
I was one of the last people
to come up with my character.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.060
I just had writer's
block, or whatever.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:08.320
And it was a flight
back from Australia,

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.680
where I was stuck on a plane,
and my wife was asleep,

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.635
and I was like, OK,
write one sentence.

00:15:14.635 --> 00:15:15.510
I wrote one sentence.

00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:18.250
And then I was like,
and then, add to that.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:19.590
And then maybe he has this.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:23.130
And it just kind of like
snowballed from there.

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.910
So that's kind of how I did it.

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:25.860
I don't have a--

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:26.640
there were some
people who were like I

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.560
know the class, the
race, I know exactly what

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.670
I want them to look like.

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:30.641
I'm like, ah.

00:15:30.641 --> 00:15:31.140
How?

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.780
But maybe they're just already
on that ship before it sails.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:35.904
So yeah.

00:15:35.904 --> 00:15:37.320
MARISHA RAY: Yeah,
I think there's

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.080
kind of two basic ways
you can go about it.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.230
You can be inside-out
person, and be like,

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:44.580
I know I want to be a ranger.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.880
I know I want to be a dwarf.

00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.640
I know I want to
be these things.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.990
And then go from there.

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:51.645
Or you can go the
opposite way, and be like,

00:15:51.645 --> 00:15:59.010
I feel like I want to be a
circus roadie and I used ropes.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:16:01.806
And I'm just really
into collecting knives.

00:16:01.806 --> 00:16:03.430
And then you can kind
of go from there.

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:06.870
And then be like, well what
works as like a knife wielding

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:09.120
circus roadie?

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:12.260
And then find a class and
design around that way.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.940
And that's become
the way that I've

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:19.800
become more interested
in building characters.

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:22.860
But it doesn't say that
sometimes I'm just like, uh--

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.380
cleric.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.720
I'll be that.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.360
But when I made Beau--

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.240
because I think Keyleth was
more of an inside-out person.

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.760
I was like I'm going
to be a half-elf druid

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.080
and then go from there.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.910
With Beau I was
like, OK, I know I

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:40.740
want to be a little
bit more tactical.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:45.300
I basically wanted to be
like a D&amp;D Jessica Jones,

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.850
like if Sherlock
Holmes was super

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.970
messed up and kind of a juvie.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.900
And then I went from there
and built around a monk.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.940
MATTHEW MERCER: I've been
DMing most of my life,

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.830
so I don't get to create
a lot of characters.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:02.030
SPEAKER 1: But they create
characters, literally,

00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:02.530
every day.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:03.781
MATTHEW MERCER: Well, that's--

00:17:03.781 --> 00:17:06.280
that's the difference between
trading your player character,

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.480
which is a long investment.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.814
MARISHA RAY: You just made Orly.

00:17:08.814 --> 00:17:09.729
MATTHEW MERCER: I did.

00:17:09.729 --> 00:17:11.390
Well, no, the
community made Orly.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.690
That was a communal effort,
literally, a communal effort.

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.280
MARISHA RAY: You contributed.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.230
MATTHEW MERCER: For
me, when I have played,

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:22.569
I tend to wait till everyone
else creates their characters

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:23.960
and then see what's missing.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.579
I'm a fan of filling that void.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.250
I tend to play support,
in that regard.

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:30.200
I want you guys to all
find what you enjoy,

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.170
and then I know I'll
find fun in whatever

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.960
will make this a well-rounded
experience for everybody.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.860
Besides, there's nothing worse
than going to a gaming table

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.080
and everyone shows up
with the same character.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.163
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Yeah,
see glue is so important.

00:17:44.163 --> 00:17:45.914
And this campaign,
in the first one,

00:17:45.914 --> 00:17:48.080
we were like, make sure
that everybody has something

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.340
that hasn't been repeated.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.010
But I think you were the only
one for this current campaign

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.440
that was like, don't pick that
cause somebody else already

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:54.690
has it.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.030
But we were hiding
it from everybody.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:58.070
And I was like, I want
to build a team though.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.850
I want to make sure that--

00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:59.010
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.384
MATTHEW MERCER: I didn't say
don't pick it somebody else,

00:18:01.384 --> 00:18:03.500
I said you can overlap classes.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.180
Don't worry about
that, because you

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:08.425
can build two of the people
of the same class in very

00:18:08.425 --> 00:18:09.050
different ways.

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.185
And we're seeing that now
with Caduceus and Jester.

00:18:11.185 --> 00:18:12.560
They're both
clerics, but they're

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:15.429
two very different
types of clerics.

00:18:15.429 --> 00:18:17.720
But that also involves having
a little bit of knowledge

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.050
together.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:19.370
And you guys were
all being so secret,

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:20.900
trying to keep your
characters from each other.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.090
I was doing this delicate
dance of like, OK, how

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.180
do I make suggestions or nudge
them so they don't end up

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.000
accidentally showing up
with the same characters,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.510
but not tell them what to make.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.270
So you guys actually
did a pretty good job

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:34.228
of finding different
paths, though, I will say.

00:18:34.228 --> 00:18:35.630
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: We got lucky.

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:36.921
MATTHEW MERCER: Yeah, actually.

00:18:38.527 --> 00:18:40.610
SPEAKER 1: So you haven't
created characters super

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.950
recently, but I am very
interested in hearing

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:45.590
about how you build up a world.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:50.180
You have this amazing
gift to just set the stage

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:53.510
and to create these
incredibly vibrant locales.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.690
You're like a wizard
at Dwarven Forge,

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.270
You have all these skills
to build up environments

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.640
and people and worlds.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:02.942
How do you approach that?

00:19:02.942 --> 00:19:03.650
How do you start?

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:05.800
It's like, well, there's
going to be a town

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.410
and there will be
some people in it,

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:12.270
and then this person is a farmer
who has serious father issues,

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:12.770
or whatever.

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:14.540
How do you do it?

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.860
MATTHEW MERCER: It depends.

00:19:15.860 --> 00:19:18.881
If you're just
building in a void--

00:19:18.881 --> 00:19:20.880
if you're just like, I'm
going to build a world.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.040
I don't a story attached to it.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:22.910
I don't have players
attached to it.

00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.440
I'm just building a world.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:27.832
Then it can be very
overwhelming to think

00:19:27.832 --> 00:19:29.040
of the large scale of things.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.727
Some people do better creating
the cosmic end of it first.

00:19:31.727 --> 00:19:34.310
Let me create the Pantheon and
the gods and the creation myth.

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:35.960
And then from there,
I can work down.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.269
To me, that's very overwhelming
for a lot of people.

00:19:38.269 --> 00:19:40.310
It's much better to start
small, like, all right,

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.330
I want to make a mining town.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.682
And say, this town makes a
lot of money off its mining

00:19:44.682 --> 00:19:45.890
apparently, so there's mines.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.260
It's got other mines nearby.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.160
A lot people here probably
work in some form of mining

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.570
or are selling
supplies and tools.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.361
So I'll make some supply
and general stores

00:19:52.361 --> 00:19:53.540
that work in that avenue.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:55.995
People live here, so they have
to have a means of eating,

00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:57.411
so maybe there
will be some farms.

00:19:57.411 --> 00:20:00.920
And so you start building out
the very, very gentle kind

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:03.634
of ecology of how
that city will work.

00:20:03.634 --> 00:20:06.050
And then you start seeing what
different factions in there

00:20:06.050 --> 00:20:06.640
might work.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.660
If there's miners, they have,
probably, some sort of union

00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:09.650
or a guild that runs them.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.441
And they probably have
competitive elements

00:20:11.441 --> 00:20:12.140
inside there.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.640
And if there is
commerce, of course,

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.080
there is probably going
to be some people that

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.870
work to feed from that commerce,
to try and make a living

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.120
without putting in the effort.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:20.869
Or they couldn't get
a job, so now they're

00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:22.490
trying to do what
they can to survive.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.740
Maybe they're organized as well.

00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.440
So then you start
creating like--

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:25.898
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
See, this is why

00:20:25.898 --> 00:20:28.490
when I hear that you read rocket
science in your spare time,

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.840
I'm not surprised.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:32.970
What?

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:33.470
What?

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:34.710
It's incredible.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.920
MATTHEW MERCER: And when
you have that structure--

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.003
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Oh god.

00:20:37.003 --> 00:20:37.880
[LAUGHING]

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.213
MATTHEW MERCER: Then you start
working on personalities.

00:20:40.213 --> 00:20:42.680
And so, if you work on who
are the heads of these guilds?

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.564
Who are the major players in
the politics of this city?

00:20:45.564 --> 00:20:48.230
Who are the people that would be
the most likely for the players

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:51.260
to encounter to be
positive quest givers,

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.394
or in to draw them into
the narrative of what

00:20:53.394 --> 00:20:55.310
kind of conflicts you've
created in this town,

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:57.740
and what individuals
might be the antagonists?

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.624
What powers outside
of the people

00:20:59.624 --> 00:21:01.790
and the political structure
are threats to the lives

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:02.930
of those that live there?

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:04.610
And how does that
tie into the mines?

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:07.370
And so it's starting
with the small structure

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:09.590
and then just
start rationalizing

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.147
how it would work
together, filling

00:21:11.147 --> 00:21:13.730
in the gaps of what's missing
to make it feel like it's living

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:15.188
and breathing, and
then from there,

00:21:15.188 --> 00:21:17.670
decide where the
conflict would arise.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:18.750
And then you have a town.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.662
And once you have that town
done, you make another.

00:21:21.662 --> 00:21:23.870
And what's in between that
journey from town to town?

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.265
You have you have a trip there.

00:21:25.265 --> 00:21:27.260
Are there hills
where bandits live?

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.160
Is there an area where a bunch
of owl bears have been roosting

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.370
and the last season they had
a lot of kids or whatever,

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.310
and now there's an owl
bear overgrowth where

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:39.710
they're attacking
people left and right.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.430
And then you just
expand and expand.

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:43.180
That's all I think
about these days, guys.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:43.820
It's a problem.

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:44.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.730
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: That was
five words or less, right?

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:47.480
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, I think so.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.447
I often think of owl
bear ecology as well.

00:21:49.447 --> 00:21:50.280
MATTHEW MERCER: See?

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:50.910
Yeah.

00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:52.586
The things that
keep us up at night.

00:21:52.586 --> 00:21:54.710
SPEAKER 1: So the common
rule of thumb, I've heard,

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:58.000
is for DMs, for
an hour game time,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.940
there's usually an
hour of preparation.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:02.590
What's that ratio for you?

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.812
MATTHEW MERCER: That's
changed over the years.

00:22:04.812 --> 00:22:05.770
It used to be that way.

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:07.561
I'd say four hour of
game time, was an hour

00:22:07.561 --> 00:22:10.450
of prep for the many years
I was running on my own,

00:22:10.450 --> 00:22:13.557
depending on, sometimes, a
little shorter even, if it

00:22:13.557 --> 00:22:15.640
was like oh, it's just me
and three of my friends,

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:16.990
and we're just going
to be improvising

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.865
our way through this.

00:22:17.865 --> 00:22:18.700
It'll be fine.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.930
When we began doing
the show, and it

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.638
began to find an
audience, and I realized

00:22:21.638 --> 00:22:27.250
that there are people
creating wikis and checking

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.320
over all the
consistencies in my world

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.430
and having arguments over
forums about different facets

00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:34.280
of the universe.

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.430
So I'm like oh, no.

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.670
I have to make sure this
is all consistent now.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:41.822
So I'd say my prep time
has probably doubled,

00:22:41.822 --> 00:22:43.780
just because part of it
is the creation process

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:45.946
and the other half is me
paying very close attention

00:22:45.946 --> 00:22:48.891
to my internal lore and to keep
it consistent with everything

00:22:48.891 --> 00:22:49.640
I've already said.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.223
And that involves
sometimes going back

00:22:51.223 --> 00:22:53.930
and researching to my old notes
and double-triple checking

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:54.430
things.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:58.364
And I put out a campaign
guide a year and a half ago.

00:22:58.364 --> 00:23:00.280
And that was a new
experience of going through

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.880
all my old mad-man scrawlings
from campaigns in sessions

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.340
past, and going oh, god, I
have to make this legible

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.070
to a normal human being.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.691
Oh, god.

00:23:08.691 --> 00:23:09.940
So I had deconstruct all that.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.730
It's been a very unique
adaption process, definitely.

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:14.960
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.950
So D&amp;D can be a very
personal experience.

00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:22.400
The attributes that
you can create or add

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.910
to your characters can be
deeply personal, sometimes

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:27.070
of a very sensitive nature.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:30.230
The moment that is
freshest in my mind

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:34.520
is Sam Riegel playing Nott,
having this real issue

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.100
with coming to terms
with being a goblin,

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.310
and just feeling
uncomfortable in his own skin.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:47.210
What are your thoughts on D&amp;D
as being this unique game where

00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:49.580
these kind of
issues can come out

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.236
and they can be
explored in a safe way?

00:23:53.236 --> 00:23:55.610
MATTHEW MERCER: I mean, I
think that's one of its biggest

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:56.930
strengths.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:24:00.080
I think it's a safe space,
especially when you have

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:02.510
a group of friends that
you trust at the table

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.880
to step into the shoes
of another person,

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.660
whether it be someone that
you want to be more like

00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.510
or somebody that is
not like you at all

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:13.880
but you want to try and
connect with and empathize

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.580
with experiences outside
of your own personal ones.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.449
It's a place to explore
these themes safely

00:24:20.449 --> 00:24:21.740
and talking amongst each other.

00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:23.960
And whenever any
anybody crosses a line,

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.730
you discuss that
and talk about it,

00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:28.820
and that person learns
about boundaries as well.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:33.170
It's a really great place
to learn to fine tune

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:38.840
empathy and self-esteem and
really discovering the things

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.880
in life that you appreciate and
the things you want to change.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.270
And it's been that for me
for the past 20 plus years.

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.531
And even just-- and
at the same time,

00:24:46.531 --> 00:24:48.530
finding friends that you
feel comfortable enough

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:49.821
that you can explore that with.

00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:51.350
This guy, before
we started playing,

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:53.619
I knew you passingly from
projects we'd worked on.

00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:55.160
And it was like oh
yeah, Travis, he's

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.516
that big guy who probably
beat me up in high school.

00:24:57.516 --> 00:24:58.140
Like you know--

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:58.910
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Oh, no.

00:24:58.910 --> 00:24:59.701
MATTHEW MERCER: No.

00:24:59.701 --> 00:25:03.915
That's what saying-- that's what
I assumed, because you were--

00:25:03.915 --> 00:25:05.998
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Give
me your lunch money, Matt.

00:25:05.998 --> 00:25:09.180
[LAUGHING]

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.960
MATTHEW MERCER: End scene.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:16.370
But through this game, I
trust you with my life.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.070
You find these friends that you
go through these experiences

00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:21.947
together and you find
like-minded individuals that

00:25:21.947 --> 00:25:23.780
have been through these
adventures with you,

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:24.717
and I don't know?

00:25:24.717 --> 00:25:26.800
There's no other bonding
experience quite like it,

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.860
in my opinion.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:30.050
MARISHA RAY: I genuinely
believe that D&amp;D

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:33.080
can improve almost every
aspect of your life,

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.930
in some way, shape, or form.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:39.530
It's helped me with
decision-making under pressure.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.230
It's helped with the
leadership abilities.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:47.150
I genuinely think-- we had this
realization a few months ago

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:52.070
that our team and our company
worked so well together

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:55.970
and has done so well because
we've been playing and working

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:00.440
together as a team in this
make-believe fantasy setting

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.290
fighting dragons and
being in the trenches

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:05.310
with each other for years.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:10.550
So when we have this imaginary
memory formed together

00:26:10.550 --> 00:26:14.960
of us taking down an
empire or fighting dragons,

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.110
then you're like, oh, we can
easily tackle this contract.

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:20.160
We could do that.

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.640
That's something we can
get through together.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.100
And even to the
therapeutic benefits

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:30.020
of D&amp;D. And we hear a lot-- and
I'm a big supporter in people

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.510
using "Dungeons and
Dragons" for special

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:37.040
needs kids or people needing
therapeutic benefits.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.160
Or, like you said, to
work through things.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.220
It gives this
alternate reality where

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:45.860
you can take risks
and experience things

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:51.120
and you can fail without
real-world repercussions.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.521
So it's great.

00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:54.020
I love it.

00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:54.710
MATTHEW MERCER: I
think to that point

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:57.560
too, a lot of people, when
they start playing the game,

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.202
it begins this
fantasy fulfillment.

00:26:59.202 --> 00:27:01.160
It's-- I want to make
the best character I can.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:01.820
I'm awesome.

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.960
I'm the hero.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.850
And you begin to learn
that, in most cases,

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.210
in order to survive and
to see the story through,

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:10.730
you have to know
what you're good at,

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:13.490
what your friends are good at,
and respect that place when

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:14.240
that is necessary.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.365
And through that, you learn
wonderful team-building

00:27:16.365 --> 00:27:19.220
exercises in knowing how best
to work within that team,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:21.560
know what your strengths
are, when to step forward,

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.990
and when to step back and let
somebody else step forward.

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:27.110
And that plays directly to how
we've all come to this company.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:28.400
When we all decided to--

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:29.870
we realized-- we didn't
decide to-- we realized

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:31.000
we had to make a company.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.480
Like I said, everything's
been reactionary.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.313
We're like OK, what's
everybody going to do?

00:27:34.313 --> 00:27:36.234
And that would be a
hard place in many times

00:27:36.234 --> 00:27:38.150
in my life with other
people, where it's like,

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:39.140
well, we all want to be this.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.098
We all want to do this.

00:27:40.098 --> 00:27:42.380
In this, we are all fit
right into our roles,

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.550
because we all knew
what we were good at.

00:27:43.550 --> 00:27:45.424
We all respected what
each other was good at.

00:27:45.424 --> 00:27:48.646
And it was the easiest
creation of a company

00:27:48.646 --> 00:27:49.770
I could ever have expected.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:51.145
And I owe a lot
of that, I think,

00:27:51.145 --> 00:27:55.130
to us having the experience
of gaming together.

00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:59.510
SPEAKER 1: So I do want to
switch directions, momentarily.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.810
So Travis, throughout
the month of November,

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:03.700
you've been sponsoring
Operation Supply Drop.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:06.315
Do you want to tell us
a little bit about that?

00:28:06.315 --> 00:28:07.440
Why you got involved in it?

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:07.600
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Yes.

00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:10.340
So obviously, Veteran's Day
is just one day in November.

00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.000
But I remember, back in
2013, was the first time

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.790
that I heard about
Operation Supply Drop.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:18.700
They're this great charity
that really support

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.947
military families and
members through active duty,

00:28:20.947 --> 00:28:22.780
through their transition
into civilian life,

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:24.700
and then afterwards.

00:28:24.700 --> 00:28:27.250
I have a very deep
military family.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.320
My father, my uncle,
my brother all served.

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.630
And I've seen
throughout the decades,

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:33.700
the impact I think
that the military has

00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:35.215
had on their lives.

00:28:35.215 --> 00:28:37.090
And when I saw what
Operation Supply Drop was

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.940
doing with these crates, these
drops, that they'll do it for,

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:44.440
at operating bases, out at
certain training centers,

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.690
the impact was just immediate.

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:48.273
And I remember my brother being
out in Afghanistan and saying,

00:28:48.273 --> 00:28:50.290
we got this crate in
today, and it had an Xbox,

00:28:50.290 --> 00:28:51.692
and it had "Call of Duty."

00:28:51.692 --> 00:28:53.650
And all these guys that
I've been bunking with,

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:55.279
we have a certain
level of tightness.

00:28:55.279 --> 00:28:57.070
But when we sat down
at the end of the day,

00:28:57.070 --> 00:28:59.712
and things had been maybe
hairier than we had expected,

00:28:59.712 --> 00:29:02.170
we came in exhausted, we were
able to play and sort of have

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:03.781
that level of escape together.

00:29:03.781 --> 00:29:05.530
And we really felt
like we were back home.

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.446
And it really rejuvenated
us for the next day.

00:29:07.446 --> 00:29:09.170
I was like man,
that's so important.

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:11.290
And it's not just video games.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.430
And it's tabletop stuff too.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.510
They also send D&amp;D and
other things that put people

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:20.620
at a table together,
promote eye contact,

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.650
let them let them
communicate and engage

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.400
with each other in a
way that I just don't

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.110
think they would without it.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:29.470
And they've really moved
past that to also providing

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:30.880
these skill training centers.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.650
So they teach them
how to put together

00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:35.350
a resume-- what can you
expect in the workforce

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:37.490
and in job interviews
and things like that.

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:38.980
And I think those
are skills that

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.500
are kind of grossly lacking
when people find themselves out

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:42.166
of the military.

00:29:42.166 --> 00:29:43.780
People go in for a
variety of reasons,

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.240
whether to serve or to
find their way into college

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.782
or something like
that, but you never

00:29:47.782 --> 00:29:50.406
really know what you're going to
come out of the military like.

00:29:50.406 --> 00:29:52.030
Sometimes, it leaves
a little mark,

00:29:52.030 --> 00:29:53.300
and sometimes, it
leaves a big one.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.940
And I think that these
sorts of charities

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.080
are just so important
to make sure

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.454
that we're letting the people
that serve something that's

00:29:58.454 --> 00:30:00.850
larger than themselves,
know that we are thinking

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:01.670
about them as well.

00:30:01.670 --> 00:30:04.750
So this month, "Critical
Role" has paired with them.

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.140
If you have any interest, you
can go to "Critical Role--"

00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:11.350
no-- critrole.com/OSD and we
have a video and some more

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.100
information there.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.641
And we're donating all the way
through the month of November.

00:30:14.641 --> 00:30:18.770
And I just love
the organization.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:21.790
And I think we're going to
do a charity for first-person

00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:24.730
shooter stream, because I
used to be decent at those,

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:25.990
and now kind of suck.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.840
So we're going to let people
hop on and abuse me for a while.

00:30:30.774 --> 00:30:33.190
SPEAKER 1: I'm super happy
with all of the charitable work

00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:36.340
you've done or that
you've fundraised for.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.810
You've had Pablove.

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.790
You've had Operation
Supply Drop, obviously,

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:44.310
826LA has been a
long time recipient

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.290
to your charitable givings.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.740
I'm interested in
knowing what drives

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.390
all of this charitable giving?

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.900
One thing that
really attracts me,

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.770
and like a lot of other folks,
I'm sure, to "Critical Role,"

00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:00.880
is that you're always looking
out for the nonprofits that

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.830
are helping the local area.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.819
You're always looking
out for other people.

00:31:04.819 --> 00:31:06.360
And it's not just
a matter of, OK, we

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.150
need to make the next dollar.

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:08.483
We need to make the next dollar.

00:31:08.483 --> 00:31:10.865
It's what can we do to
make our community better?

00:31:10.865 --> 00:31:13.240
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Yeah, I
think we realized pretty early

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.940
on that as the spotlight on
"Critical Role" got bigger,

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.759
we had the ability to affect
really positive change

00:31:18.759 --> 00:31:19.300
in the world.

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:21.716
That was something that was
really important to all of us.

00:31:21.716 --> 00:31:24.102
826 was something
that we started--

00:31:24.102 --> 00:31:25.310
who was it that first found--

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.960
MATTHEW MERCER:
That was Marisha.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.180
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
Yeah, actually.

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.888
MARISHA RAY: Yes, it
was me and Talliesin

00:31:28.888 --> 00:31:29.890
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:31.330
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: And they have
them all throughout the nation,

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:33.160
but it was something
that I think really

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.830
benefited from a very unique
perspective that we have.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:40.600
And when the response was as
big as it was, we were like man.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:41.320
We went around.

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.180
We were like what are
individual charities?

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.230
What are the things
that we would want

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.430
to focus on, given the chance.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.430
And so we're trying to
work our way through that

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.800
and find ways to
just give back more.

00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:54.520
It's one thing to just say let's
make as much money as we can

00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:57.080
and try and grow this company
and do all those things.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.890
But on the inside, the thing
that makes us feel good

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.260
is when we have those
connections with each other

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:06.700
and we foster positive,
empathetic fans

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:07.420
and communities.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.400
And to us, these
sorts of charities

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.942
just embody the things that
we really think are important.

00:32:13.942 --> 00:32:15.400
MATTHEW MERCER:
Well, consider too,

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.400
a lot of what we do with
our stories and our company

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.880
is try and tell tales of
heroism and inspire other people

00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:26.269
to rise up and be
their own hero.

00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:27.810
But this is a world
where there's not

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:29.910
always the opportunity
to do so, or find places

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:34.694
where you can really
contribute and be that hero.

00:32:34.694 --> 00:32:36.860
And I think charitable work
is one of the great ways

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.460
that you can do that.

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.460
And so, not only does it
give us the opportunity

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.210
to help out, but
really the community,

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.130
give them the opportunity too.

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.110
And no matter what chaos
they're in, no matter

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:50.120
what busy-ness is
consuming them,

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.860
they can actively contribute to
changing somebody else's life,

00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:57.500
and then see the effect of
that through this community.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:58.670
And community is such
a big part of this.

00:32:58.670 --> 00:33:00.044
As much as this
is like, oh, it's

00:33:00.044 --> 00:33:02.020
our company and our
game and everything,

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.030
we may be the beating
heart of this thing,

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.650
but the body and
the world around it

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:08.275
is the community that
sprung out of it.

00:33:08.275 --> 00:33:14.090
And the sheer amount of positive
good enforcement and work

00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.610
that all the people that
have rallied around this show

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:19.730
have done, it dwarfs anything
that we could ever hope to do.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.270
And I'm just so proud
of being a part of that.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.390
MARISHA RAY: It was so
like self-explanatory.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.820
There was really
no other option.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:30.680
It felt like it just
presented itself,

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.490
as soon as we started
making just an appearance

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:35.420
fee from the show.

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:39.995
We were like this is "Dungeons
and Dragons," this is--

00:33:39.995 --> 00:33:41.870
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: We
were doing this anyway.

00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:42.745
MARISHA RAY: --weird.

00:33:42.745 --> 00:33:43.450
Yeah.

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:48.310
And so it only felt natural to
be like, how can we spread this

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:50.770
in any way, shape, or form?

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:53.140
And then, that's why we also
encourage people so much

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:57.400
to go down to 826LA, an
826 branch in their area

00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.760
and to teach kids D&amp;D
and start a D&amp;D club.

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:05.360
And we initiated one at
826LA that's still going on.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:11.580
And we've heard of several in
other 826 sanctions-- yeah,

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.080
cities--

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:15.980
branches-- that's the word I
was looking for-- branches--

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.973
that it's taking off there,
too, which just warms my heart.

00:34:19.973 --> 00:34:21.889
SPEAKER 1: Thank you for
all of the charitable

00:34:21.889 --> 00:34:24.090
giving you do, the shows
that you put on every week.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:25.298
And thank you for being here.

00:34:25.298 --> 00:34:28.075
And now, we'll open it
up to audience questions.

00:34:28.075 --> 00:34:29.449
MATTHEW MERCER:
What's your name?

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:30.500
AUDIENCE: My name is Rula.

00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:31.070
MATTHEW MERCER: Hi, Rula.

00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:32.570
AUDIENCE: I'm a big
fan of you guys.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:34.940
We watch every week.

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:36.919
One of the things about
being a voice actors,

00:34:36.919 --> 00:34:38.960
your voice is more associated
with the characters

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.380
that you guys play.

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.800
But now, because of D&amp;D and
because of "Critical Role,"

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.130
and everything that you
guys do, your voices

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:48.320
are more associated with your
faces than anything else.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.790
How has that changed
things for you guys?

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.310
Can you even walk out
on the street now?

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:56.719
MATTHEW MERCER: We can.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:57.620
It's a little harder.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.620
It's definitely changed.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.720
It's changed things,
dramatically.

00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:01.780
One of the things I used
to enjoy about voice

00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.820
over was the anonymity, where
I could just vanish and not

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.340
have to worry about that.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.040
And I would say, while
things have changed,

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.270
it's not bad, because we have
a community of amazing people.

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:15.950
And the times that
we do get recognized,

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:18.560
it's very respectful, and very
like, hey, sorry to bother you,

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:21.567
just wanted to say,
like what you do, maybe,

00:35:21.567 --> 00:35:22.400
can I get a picture?

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.130
And it's like, sure, if
I'm not like in my pajamas

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:29.491
at a Ralph's at like 3:00 AM
trying to get toilet paper.

00:35:29.491 --> 00:35:31.490
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Please
tell me that happened.

00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.750
MATTHEW MERCER: Oh, yeah.

00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:32.340
Oh, yeah.

00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:33.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:36.550
So it's a new
experience, definitely.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:40.440
It can be a little
overwhelming at events.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.530
We're still kind of
adjusting to the growth

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.130
that this whole thing
has experienced.

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:48.334
It's different, but I can't
say that it's negative.

00:35:48.334 --> 00:35:50.000
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
We double-take a lot.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.220
The Starbucks that I
go to all the time,

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.011
when I was going through
the drive-through,

00:35:54.011 --> 00:35:55.410
the guy was like, morning, Grog.

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:58.280
And I was like, what?

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.200
You wish you had
ordered maybe something

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.971
cooler than like a mocha
Java chip frappuccino.

00:36:03.971 --> 00:36:05.720
MARISHA RAY: Sometimes
it pays off though.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.225
Sometimes you'll be
at a bar and you'll

00:36:08.225 --> 00:36:10.100
order a couple of drinks,
and the bartender's

00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:11.870
like, it's on me, Beauregard.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:12.920
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: What?

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:13.930
MATTHEW MERCER: Yeah,
that's happened.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:15.040
MARISHA RAY: Yes, please.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.870
MATTHEW MERCER: They call it
nerd fight club, because there

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:19.190
are times that, that happens.

00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:20.648
We've been at
amusement parks where

00:36:20.648 --> 00:36:23.150
all of a sudden, somebody
who works there will be like,

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:25.700
hello, would you like to come
to the front of the line?

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.750
And I'm like, yes.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:28.250
Yes, I--

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:28.510
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:29.900
MARISHA RAY: I feel like
I should follow this.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:30.860
MATTHEW MERCER: This
way, Mr. Durden.

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:31.693
You're like, oh, OK.

00:36:31.693 --> 00:36:33.680
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: His
name is Robert Paulson.

00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.231
[LAUGHING]

00:36:35.231 --> 00:36:37.730
MATTHEW MERCER: So it has come
with a couple of really cool,

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:38.810
unexpected, little benefits.

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.851
If anything, just because
we get to meet critters

00:36:40.851 --> 00:36:43.130
in the wild and
really kind of see

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:47.894
how far reaching this community
is in places we never expect.

00:36:47.894 --> 00:36:49.745
AUDIENCE: Do I just
pass this back to you?

00:36:49.745 --> 00:36:51.620
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Throw
it at somebody else.

00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:52.453
SPEAKER 1: You pick.

00:36:52.453 --> 00:36:55.070
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Hard.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:55.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.410
MATTHEW MERCER: Hey.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:00.102
AUDIENCE: So I
know that there are

00:37:00.102 --> 00:37:02.060
a lot of rule sites for
"Dungeons and Dragons,"

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.220
as well as other tabletop
games, and knowing them

00:37:04.220 --> 00:37:05.880
all is a part of
playing the game.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.540
But at the same time,
just kind of making it

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:10.424
accessible and just
enjoyable for everyone.

00:37:10.424 --> 00:37:12.590
So I was wondering what
kind of house rules, if any,

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:14.109
you run with?

00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:16.400
MATTHEW MERCER: I've run with
a few, especially when we

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:16.880
started.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.463
Because when we first
started playing,

00:37:18.463 --> 00:37:21.860
we were Pathfinder, which was
very crunchy and rules heavy.

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:24.110
And then, we went to
streaming and 5th edition

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:26.180
had come out for a while, and
I heard that it was actually

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.650
an improvement over
previous editions,

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:29.233
a little more
streamlined, I was like,

00:37:29.233 --> 00:37:30.500
let's please move to that.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.280
Let's shift over.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.870
But because it was
also a new system,

00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:35.120
there's a lot of things
we were still learning.

00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:35.790
And the players.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:37.220
were carryover from Pathfinder.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.340
So I house-ruled some things for
the benefit of a larger group.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.884
I know healing
potions, technically,

00:37:41.884 --> 00:37:43.300
or drinking the
potion is supposed

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.140
to take an action
in the system, but I

00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.510
didn't want there to have-- when
you have eight-- seven to eight

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:49.801
players, to have one person's
whole turn to be drinking

00:37:49.801 --> 00:37:52.769
a potion, then wait seven other
rounds and enemies to come

00:37:52.769 --> 00:37:54.060
before you get to do something.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.519
So I was like,
bonus action's fine.

00:37:55.519 --> 00:37:57.226
That way, you can
still do something cool

00:37:57.226 --> 00:37:58.010
and drink potion.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:00.920
So it's more things
that are minor tweaks

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.190
to just make it more fun and
involved for the players.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.320
As we have gone into
the second campaign,

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.611
and people have got more
comfortable with the rule set,

00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:11.300
I've leaned off the
house rules a little bit.

00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.780
But honestly, sometimes, if it
just makes for a cool moment,

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.560
I'd rather go with that than
the stringency of the rules.

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.940
If someone has a
really cool idea

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.160
and they want to do
this interesting thing,

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.520
and I'm like well,
in order to do that,

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.870
technically, they have to
athletics rule for this thing,

00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:26.890
and [INAUDIBLE] it's probably
not going to work out.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:28.514
I'll be like, no,
but it's a cool idea.

00:38:28.514 --> 00:38:29.660
Go for it and roll.

00:38:29.660 --> 00:38:30.620
And it makes it
more interesting.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:31.610
The players get
to have fun with.

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:33.359
Because, basically,
at the end of the day,

00:38:33.359 --> 00:38:35.930
while it is still a game,
it's more than that-- you

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.721
and your friends trying
to have a good time

00:38:37.721 --> 00:38:38.925
and tell a story together.

00:38:38.925 --> 00:38:39.800
And even I'm trying--

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.591
I'm still learning.

00:38:40.591 --> 00:38:42.350
I'm still finding that balance.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.169
And sometimes,
I'll look at stuff

00:38:44.169 --> 00:38:46.460
on the internet, people
complaining about how, oh, they

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:47.380
messed up these rules.

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.445
And it'll be like oh,
man, I got to get better

00:38:48.445 --> 00:38:49.577
at enforcing those rules.

00:38:49.577 --> 00:38:51.410
And then I do enforce
it, and I'm like, man,

00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:52.640
that's not as fun.

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.310
So I'm still finding my
balance, at times, as I go too.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.550
AUDIENCE: So "Dungeons and
Dragons" draws very heavily

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.310
both mechanically
and flavor-wise

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.910
from your traditional Western
"Lord of the Rings" fantasy.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:11.180
With all of your backgrounds
in anime and whatnot--

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.730
your work there--
is there anything

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:16.960
you'd like to see D&amp;D draw
from that pool of stories,

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.630
or how do you incorporate
into your storytelling?

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:21.130
MARISHA RAY: That's
a good question.

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:22.840
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
Well, I asked Matt

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.300
at the beginning of the
campaign as I was struggling

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.890
to find a character
voice, I had done

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:30.430
a session that was just kind
of this like southern drawl.

00:39:30.430 --> 00:39:33.005
And I was like, Matt, can I
do that in a fantasy world?

00:39:33.005 --> 00:39:33.880
He was like, why not?

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.030
[LAUGHS] Yeah, why not?

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:40.720
So I think as long as
you don't get into--

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:45.047
well, no, I think almost
anything could pop in there.

00:39:45.047 --> 00:39:46.630
I think as long as
it fits the flavor.

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:48.865
And even Percy's
electrical inventions

00:39:48.865 --> 00:39:50.490
near the end of the
last campaign where

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.570
a nice step into things
you don't see very much

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.430
of, and the firearms too.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:55.805
MATTHEW MERCER:
Even just looking

00:39:55.805 --> 00:39:57.790
at the bloodline of D&amp;D,
there are adventures

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.130
where 95% of the
adventure is going through

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:03.727
like a subterranean tomb and
unlocking magical artifacts.

00:40:03.727 --> 00:40:05.560
But if you happen to
go in this one chamber,

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.480
you find this strange
metallic craft

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:11.140
with a deceased creature
with smooth skin

00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:12.310
and some sort of a--

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.670
looks like a fire-lock
pistol, but it shoots energy.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:17.870
Oh shit, they just put
aliens in your D&amp;D.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:21.970
So there is a classic bloodline
of toying with different genres

00:40:21.970 --> 00:40:22.630
and stuff.

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.180
For me, personally,
because it leans so heavily

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:29.560
into you know Anglo fantasy and
the very "Lord of the Rings"

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.020
thing, as we've played
through, our first campaign

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:33.280
was definitely meant
to be an introduction

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.530
to D&amp;D for most people at
the table that never played.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.130
So I kept it very
classic fantasy.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:38.713
And the more we've
played, I've wanted

00:40:38.713 --> 00:40:41.545
to pull in other
cultural inspirations.

00:40:41.545 --> 00:40:43.420
I would love to, at some
point down the road,

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:45.294
explore more of
[? Marquette ?] in our world,

00:40:45.294 --> 00:40:51.220
because I grew up loving
Arabian Nights and a lot

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:54.220
of ancient Sumerian
Mesopotamian religion,

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.594
classic Middle Eastern
history, and mythology.

00:40:57.594 --> 00:40:59.260
I think it's so grossly
underrepresented

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.210
in modern media, and so I'd
love to incorporate elements

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.560
of that down the road as well.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.410
I love eastern philosophy and
eastern mythology as well.

00:41:05.410 --> 00:41:08.914
It is wonderful and
doesn't get a lot of love.

00:41:08.914 --> 00:41:10.330
No matter what you
try and create,

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:11.710
there's going to be some
cultural touchstone that

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:12.160
comes from.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.750
All work is derivative
on some level,

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:15.850
because we're inspired
by what we experience.

00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.170
And we either are, in
creating something new,

00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:21.550
we're creating something that is
a series of other small shards

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:24.790
that you've merged
into a new combination.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.550
So I want to see things that
don't get represented as well.

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:32.440
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have a
question mainly for Matt.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.560
I'm an aspiring DM.

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.560
MATTHEW MERCER: Awesome.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.850
AUDIENCE: I run two
different D&amp;D campaigns,

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:39.970
which is way more stressful than
I thought it was going to be.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.370
MATTHEW MERCER: I feel you, man.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:43.830
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:41:43.830 --> 00:41:47.350
I am having trouble finding,
or rather, getting to a segment

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:50.440
where I can bridge that
gap, because a lot of people

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.300
come to D&amp;D for
different reasons

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:54.850
and are interested in
different aspects of it.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:58.120
But what I enjoy is that each
one of your characters, you

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:00.610
guys are so committed
to being that character

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:05.680
and sharing that space where you
can let the walls down a bit.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.460
I wonder if there's any tips
or ways to kind of foster

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.300
that environment to create that
so that they are comfortable,

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:14.710
because you can't force it.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:16.335
MATTHEW MERCER: You
can't force it, no.

00:42:16.335 --> 00:42:20.900
And it's not something
that happens immediately.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.130
One thing I recommend
is plan, if you can,

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:26.590
extra-curricular activities
outside of D&amp;D for you all

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:28.907
to hang out and just
become better friends--

00:42:28.907 --> 00:42:30.490
going out and seeing
a movie together,

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:34.270
or going to a theme park, or
going and doing different other

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:36.820
board games that are more
of a team-building exercise

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.370
on the side, where the pressure
isn't just you have to be

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:41.370
in character and we all
have to be friends now--

00:42:41.370 --> 00:42:42.014
go.

00:42:42.014 --> 00:42:43.180
They can just be themselves.

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.330
Then get to know each
other a little better.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.000
And then when they
come back to the table,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.166
they'll be a little more
comfortable with each other

00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:51.730
because they've had other
experiences as a troop.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:54.520
And there is having a
conversation outside

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:57.310
of the game about what do you
all want out of this game.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:58.780
What do you enjoy out of this?

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.630
What do you think you'll
enjoy out of this?

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:03.580
Get a feel for what
everybody wants,

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.477
and have them all talk
about it in the open,

00:43:05.477 --> 00:43:07.060
because they'll also
better understand

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.351
what each player wants to
get out of the story as well.

00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:12.042
And they might adjust
what they're looking for.

00:43:12.042 --> 00:43:14.500
If they're like I just want to
go and kill monsters and get

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:16.875
experience points and gold,
and one person's like, I want

00:43:16.875 --> 00:43:20.069
to explore the depths
of the human condition,

00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.860
it's hard to marry.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.000
But if both them
say it out loud,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.541
maybe the first person will be
like, yeah, human condition is

00:43:24.541 --> 00:43:25.645
cool, too, I guess.

00:43:25.645 --> 00:43:27.430
And they'll find
that middle ground.

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:32.170
But it's not your onus to figure
out that puzzle in private.

00:43:32.170 --> 00:43:34.430
You can figure it out
together as a group,

00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:35.870
have those conversations.

00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:38.110
And as long as everyone
knows where they all stand,

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:39.857
that also helps them
feel comfortable,

00:43:39.857 --> 00:43:41.940
not wondering what every
other player at the table

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:43.570
is looking for and going after.

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:47.010
They don't know their
character story secrets.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:49.390
But there can be unexpected
antagonism at the table,

00:43:49.390 --> 00:43:51.970
if all the players
have that disconnect

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:54.594
and assume what the other
person wants out of the game.

00:43:54.594 --> 00:43:56.510
So having those conversations
openly, I think,

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:58.280
are a really good tool
to getting everyone

00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.655
on the same page
and getting more

00:43:59.655 --> 00:44:02.330
comfortable with each other.

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.490
MARISHA RAY: It
takes a while, too.

00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:06.620
You will see
progress immediately,

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:11.930
pretty much over the next
several games, but up until--

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:14.300
still to this day, we'll
still check in with each other

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.330
and be like, hey, is it cool
if we do this type of thing?

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:19.850
Or can we explore this?

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:21.950
Or if I confront you--

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.400
I'm going to come at
you-- like when after--

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:29.660
spoilers-- Mollymauk died and
we had Ashly Burch playing

00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:33.100
with us, and I knew
that Beau's reaction was

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.420
going to be visceral and angry.

00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.590
And so I went up to her, and
I was like Beau is probably

00:44:39.590 --> 00:44:40.910
going to want to come at you.

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:41.960
Is that OK?

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.780
Are you going to be
comfortable and know

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.690
that it's coming from a
role-playing standpoint

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:51.670
when I chew your head
off in about 15 minutes?

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:53.600
And she was like,
yeah, absolutely.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.480
I'm here for it.

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.370
I'm game for it.

00:44:55.370 --> 00:45:00.219
But still it gave just a
little bit of that expectation,

00:45:00.219 --> 00:45:00.760
so that she--

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:02.280
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: It takes
away, like, is this Marisha,

00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.126
or is it Beau?

00:45:03.126 --> 00:45:04.250
MARISHA RAY: Did I mess up?

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:06.380
Am I ruining their game?

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:08.130
I didn't want anyone
to think that.

00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:10.700
So I think just having
a little bit of that.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.920
Even when our game
started delving

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:16.670
into romantic territory, we
had to check in with each other

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:21.140
and have pow-wows and
be like, is this OK?

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.829
Are we into this?

00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:26.120
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: It was
more like what just happened?

00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.510
[LAUGHING]

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.600
We'd played for two and
half years, no romance

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:30.457
on the stream.

00:45:30.457 --> 00:45:32.040
You know, I'm in
love with you, right?

00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.349
We're like-- what?

00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:36.140
MATTHEW MERCER: But
that was a conversation

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:38.272
that Liam had with me, too.

00:45:38.272 --> 00:45:39.980
They wanted to talk
about it and be like,

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:42.470
it would be interesting-- my
character could definitely

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.390
go down this path,
but I don't want

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:46.160
to do that if it's
going to be strange

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.030
and making other
people uncomfortable.

00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.321
And I was like, as long as
you're respectable about it,

00:45:50.321 --> 00:45:51.470
I'm sure I'll be fine.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:53.150
And it was hilarious.

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:55.787
Your guys' reactions
were hilarious.

00:45:55.787 --> 00:45:56.870
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Honest.

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:57.828
MATTHEW MERCER: Honest.

00:45:57.828 --> 00:45:59.630
[LAUGHING]

00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:00.627
Good question.

00:46:00.627 --> 00:46:01.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.710
MATTHEW MERCER: No worries.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:06.260
Over there.

00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:08.330
Good catch.

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:11.810
AUDIENCE: Hey, have you
guys ever considered

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.180
playing another system other
than the various editions

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:18.170
of D&amp;D. Has there been
any interest in that?

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:19.500
MATTHEW MERCER: Oh, yeah.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:22.099
D&amp;D is what our main
campaign is, largely

00:46:22.099 --> 00:46:23.640
because that's just
where we started,

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:26.169
and that's where
the world has gone.

00:46:26.169 --> 00:46:27.710
And it makes sense
within that space.

00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:30.620
But we've done a lot of
one-shots and a lot of side

00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:33.151
games where we've delved into--

00:46:33.151 --> 00:46:35.150
One of what my favorite
systems is "Dead Lands."

00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:36.470
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
Oh, it's so good.

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:37.580
MATTHEW MERCER: I
prefer OG "Dead Lands,"

00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:39.788
but I ran a "Savage Worlds,"
the newer version of it,

00:46:39.788 --> 00:46:43.810
for you guys, which was fun--
kind of an old weird west.

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:45.560
She's run a number of
"Honey Heist" games,

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:48.074
which is a ridiculous
one-page RPG.

00:46:48.074 --> 00:46:48.740
It's so amazing.

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.760
I love a lot of
systems out there.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.590
D&amp;D is just the classic
one that I grew up

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:58.790
with was my gateway to
the rest of the systems.

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.650
So I enjoy when we
have the opportunity

00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:04.160
to try other things off
of our main campaign.

00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:06.110
MARISHA RAY: I think
just currently starting

00:47:06.110 --> 00:47:09.890
to dive into a new
system, in a new campaign,

00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:12.320
it would be like a commitment.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.440
It would be a discussion,
and one we're just not

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.355
ready to have yet.

00:47:17.355 --> 00:47:18.980
AUDIENCE: I do want
to jump in on that.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.094
When can we expect
"Crash Pandas" 2?

00:47:21.094 --> 00:47:22.306
[LAUGHING]

00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:23.804
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:23.804 --> 00:47:24.720
MATTHEW MERCER: Oh no.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.760
Oh, it's so perfect.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.680
MARISHA RAY: Looking
at Regal on that one.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.190
MATTHEW MERCER: Yeah, we
just have to pin Sam down,

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:32.890
the weird fey
creature that he is.

00:47:32.890 --> 00:47:34.011
He'd be like run a game.

00:47:34.011 --> 00:47:35.510
He'd be like, ha,
you can't find me.

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.093
[POOF] Turn the
glitter and disappear.

00:47:37.093 --> 00:47:38.236
I'd be like, No!

00:47:38.236 --> 00:47:41.201
He's like a treasure
goblin in "Diablo 3."

00:47:41.201 --> 00:47:42.950
You're like catch him
before he goes away.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:44.230
No, he's gone.

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:47.090
No.

00:47:47.090 --> 00:47:48.870
Good question.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:52.790
Any other questions
anybody. curious to-- oh,

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:54.320
we've got a repeat question.

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.230
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Oh,
here's a long pass.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.640
MARISHA RAY: Go, yeah.

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:56.140
Oh, yeah.

00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:58.600
Oh.

00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.642
MATTHEW MERCER: Mic down.

00:47:59.642 --> 00:48:01.516
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: You
got to lay out for it.

00:48:01.516 --> 00:48:03.800
You got to have the
full-body commitment.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.019
Sacrifice yourself.

00:48:05.019 --> 00:48:07.310
MATTHEW MERCER: Yeah, chair
would have broke your fall.

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:10.670
AUDIENCE: This thing
still works, right?

00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:13.649
So we got to see Taliesin at
Lost Con over the weekend.

00:48:13.649 --> 00:48:14.690
MATTHEW MERCER: Oh, nice.

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:16.220
AUDIENCE: And it was awesome.

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:17.600
Absolutely awesome.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.130
I asked him who his favorite
character outside of the party

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:26.495
was, maybe guest characters, or
characters that you've created,

00:48:26.495 --> 00:48:27.280
Matt.

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:32.450
And I'm curious of all of the
universe that you've created,

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:33.967
who is your favorite?

00:48:33.967 --> 00:48:35.300
MARISHA RAY: Outside of parties?

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.340
AUDIENCE: Outside
of the parties.

00:48:36.340 --> 00:48:37.340
MATTHEW MERCER: Oh, man.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.810
MARISHA RAY: Interesting.

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:41.420
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
Mine's Victor,

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.940
just because it was
spontaneous for Matt

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:47.180
and it was just pure
gold in the moment.

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:48.860
I don't think any
other story moment

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.864
has caused almost every
member of the table

00:48:50.864 --> 00:48:52.530
to reach for their
cell phones and start

00:48:52.530 --> 00:48:53.446
filming you on-stream.

00:48:53.446 --> 00:48:54.764
[LAUGHING]

00:48:54.764 --> 00:48:57.860
It was just so good.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:59.360
MARISHA RAY: I think
mine would have

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.510
to be Raishan, just because she
left such a mark on my soul.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:07.520
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM: Ugh, yeah,
came out of that one dirty.

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:10.925
MATTHEW MERCER: That
was a fun villain.

00:49:10.925 --> 00:49:13.080
Oh, man.

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.570
Just from a personal
standpoint, I

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:20.930
think Shawn Gilmore was
an important PC to me,

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:22.420
partially because
he was dynamic.

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.890
But there was just a lot of--

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:25.680
when you create a PC that
you invest a lot of time in,

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.970
there's a whole bunch of their
story that never gets told.

00:49:27.970 --> 00:49:30.469
And so in my head, there's this
whole story for Shawn's life

00:49:30.469 --> 00:49:32.575
that you never get
to see on the stream.

00:49:32.575 --> 00:49:33.950
And I'm like well,
one day, maybe

00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:37.070
I'll find a place to put that.

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:38.660
He just kind of
naturally grew into

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:43.340
this larger-than-life figure
that I still carry with me.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:46.360
And he's pretty important to me.

00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.990
Other than that, villain wise,
the whole Delilah and Sylas

00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:54.610
Briarwood-- their whole
dynamic of a villain couple

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:59.590
that they're the reasoning
for their villainous tactics

00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:03.520
and lifestyle has not to
do with the need for power,

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:08.210
it was purely the drive
from one to save the other.

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:11.020
And they're just still paying
the price for doing that.

00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:13.271
And that was a really fun
story to write and play out.

00:50:13.271 --> 00:50:14.978
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
Who knows, maybe we'll

00:50:14.978 --> 00:50:17.110
find some ways to dip into
those stories of Shawn

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:18.190
Gilmore and others.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.720
MATTHEW MERCER: I hope so.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.510
That would be fun.

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:22.390
TRAVIS WILLINGHAM:
Yeah, wouldn't it?

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:24.515
SPEAKER 1: Well, we are
actually just out of time.

00:50:24.515 --> 00:50:26.890
