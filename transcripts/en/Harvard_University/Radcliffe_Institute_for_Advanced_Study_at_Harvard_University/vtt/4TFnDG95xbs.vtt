00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.010
-Thank you all for being
here tonight this afternoon.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.740
And let me first say
that I'm so incredibly

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.420
thankful to the Radcliffe
Institute for this time

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.810
and this space to do my work,
to work on this project,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.120
to nurture a new project,
and for the opportunity to be

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.080
and work with such a
phenomenal group of people.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.577
I really am thankful
for that opportunity.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.610
At the 2016 Super
Bowl, Beyonce performed

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.080
her new single,
"Formation," with a league

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.390
of women with afros dressed in
black and berets behind her,

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.730
an obvious homage to
the Black Panther Party,

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.820
which celebrates its 50th
anniversary this year.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.000
Beyonce's Super Bowl
performance reflects

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.640
a renewed popular interest
in the Black Power movement.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.840
The controversial performance
resulted in many critiques,

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.000
ranging all the
way from a critique

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.490
of her use of the
Black Power movement's

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.370
legacy for her own
fame and fortune

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.270
to concerns that she brought
the image of a racist group

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.610
to America's sport.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.570
Regardless of one's
position on the "queen bee,"

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.080
in this historical moment where
black people must proclaim

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.290
the value of their lives
against state violence

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.340
and the prison industrial
complex is being analyzed

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.250
and challenged by black
academics and activists,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.710
it is most certainly
a fitting time

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.030
to revisit a movement that was
centrally concerned with police

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.570
brutality and with
mass incarceration.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.980
It becomes even clearer why
it's essential to look again

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.330
at Black Power when we
remember the movement

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.320
that black students are
waging against campus

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.310
racism across the country.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.710
As the movement that
inspired students and faculty

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.100
to demand black studies programs
and black student unions

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.130
and demand not just access,
but space in our universities,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.750
it's no surprise that
Black Power, again,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.669
is taking a prominent role
in the popular imaginary.

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.230
Perhaps most importantly,
though, the Black Power

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.940
movement occurred on the
cusp of a new form of racism,

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.630
a form of racism that continues
to exist and shape shift

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.460
against the backdrop of
alleged legal equality.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.830
This period in the development
of a post-civil rights

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.230
racial ideology, one that's
strikingly similar to what

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.070
we have today, offers an
important comparative landscape

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.270
for understanding
black movements today

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.105
and for understanding white
resistance to those movements.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.370
Sorry to take
Beyonce away from--

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.021
So what I want to do today
is to talk to you a bit

00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:55.770
about my work on the
Black Power movement.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.060
So my research grew out of a
curiosity about whether and how

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.080
movements shape that wide
range of institutions

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.381
that exist between
the level of the state

00:03:06.381 --> 00:03:07.880
and the level of
the family-- things

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.580
like schools,
workplaces, churches,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.310
voluntary associations,
and so forth, the places

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.830
where our day-to-day
lives take place.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.600
And I'm particularly interested
in how black people in the US,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.120
embedded in white-dominated
educational institutions

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.360
and workplaces, bring
the ideas, strategies,

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.030
and tactics of black
liberation movements with them.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.120
In this vein, my
work has primarily

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.290
been concerned with
how Black Power made

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.660
an impact on institutions.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.580
In my first book, I
argue that the rise

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.890
of black professional
associations

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.610
in the late 1960s and early
'70s is a direct outcome

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:47.700
of Black Power.

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.860
And I detail that process in
the profession of social work.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.310
My second book that I'm
working on here at Radcliffe

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.640
is about a group of attorneys
who organized themselves

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.740
to be the legal wing of the
revolution during the Black

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.870
Power era.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.920
I have a second line
of research that

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.880
looks at race-based policy
in higher education.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.390
I've been interested in how
colleges and universities use,

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.690
or fail to use, policy in
the service of racial equity

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.670
and, in particular, in the
role of campus activism

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.318
in shaping that process.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.720
So in some ways, my
work is a departure

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.580
from the image of the
Black Power movement

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.420
that Beyonce channeled
at the Super Bowl

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.990
to be sure the Black Power
movement has been portrayed

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.270
as the quintessential bad
boy of black movement making.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.380
All afros, black leather, and
guns-- the Black Power movement

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.510
lives in the popular imaginary
as a deviant wild child

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.755
of black social movements.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:52.790
As a new student
of the movement,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.710
I was also fascinated
with this image,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.310
the image of the
young radical emerging

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.720
from the disappointments of
the Civil Rights movement

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.400
with a new attitude, a
new swagger, if you will,

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.080
ready to take on white racism
by any means necessary.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.460
There is certainly an affinity
between my generation,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.690
the hip-hop generation, and
the Black Power generation

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.369
that drove my initial
interest in the movement.

00:05:16.369 --> 00:05:17.910
So I used to just
have pictures here.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.743
But then when I learned
how to loop Beyonce,

00:05:19.743 --> 00:05:21.560
I was like, why wouldn't
I loop them, too?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:28.090
So anyway-- [LAUGHS] --now
you get Public Enemy, as well.

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.120
So much of hip-hop culture in
the late 1980s and early 1990s

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.625
reflects an admiration
of the Black Power

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:37.000
figures who were willing to
risk everything to say enough

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:37.800
is enough.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.560
So if you know Hip-Hop,
you can think back

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.670
to KRS-One or Public Enemy,
who you see projected here,

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.970
and the way that their music
and their visual presence

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.280
reflected a Black Power ethic.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.820
A problem, though, with this
image and with this fascination

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:54.990
is that it's really limited
the way that we remember

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.560
the movement and, certainly,
how we think about the impact

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.270
that it's had on US society.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.976
We look at the Black Panther
Party and groups like them

00:06:03.976 --> 00:06:05.350
and say, well,
they certainly had

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.400
an impact on black
culture-- things

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.980
like popularizing,
re-popularizing the afro,

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.590
the idea that black is
beautiful, new forms of music,

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.120
et cetera-- but not
much beyond that.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.260
But there is more to
the movement than this.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.340
There's also a
strain of Black Power

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.930
that was centrally concerned
with institution building.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.940
The idea of building
independent black institutions

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.140
is an old one in black America.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.150
And the Black Power movement
was centrally concerned with it.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.580
So if this were
1969 or 1970 and we

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.400
were in a
movement-related meeting

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.350
and I asked you,
what time is it,

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.790
in the call-and-response
tradition

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.580
of the black
community, the answer

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.200
is, it's nation time, meaning
that the movement called

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.940
for black people to build
the kinds of structures

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:57.800
and institutions
that go into building

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:02.440
a nation-- economic
stability, education, faith,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.060
family-- in a way that
would benefit black people.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.740
So my first book
project, again, looks

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.060
at the rise of black
professional associations

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.530
as this sort of outcome of
the Black Power movement.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.340
And I see that development as
the same sort of phenomenon

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.290
as the rise of black studies
programs, black student unions,

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:24.530
black museums, independent
black educational institutions,

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:25.850
and so forth.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:27.350
These are the sorts
of outcomes that

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:32.550
resulted from Black Power's
push to both carve out

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.310
space in existing
institutions and build

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:36.780
new independent institutions.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:40.310
And this strain of the
movement is less understood.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:42.560
So what I want to
do moving forward

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.210
is talk just a little bit
about how social science is

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:48.350
particularly guilty
of underestimating

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.740
the impact of
Black Power, how we

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:53.680
can contribute to fixing
that by rethinking

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.700
race-based movements,
in particular.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.800
And then I want to use
some data from the book

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.700
to talk about how
Black Power shaped

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.600
the rise of black professional
associational life

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.250
before giving you just a little
bit about my work in progress.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.880
So sociology has been
particularly dismissive

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.110
of Black Power.

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.200
It's really been
treated as an aside

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.540
to Civil Rights in that it
had been seen as really only

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.830
important in as much as it
affected the Civil Rights

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.500
movement, that it
lent credibility

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.020
to the more moderate
demands of Civil Rights.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.429
With very few exceptions,
the sociological literature

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.909
on social movements has
been guilty of ignoring

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:39.049
the lasting impacts
of the movement,

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:42.419
or worse-- lumping Black
Power activists together

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:47.620
as sort of a ragtag group
of unorganized thugs.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.370
In fact, Doug McAdam cites Peter
Goldman with no qualification

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.510
when he calls the Black
Power movement a, quote,

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.750
"ghetto-bred generation with
reputations no larger than

00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.790
a single city or a neighborhood
or even a particular block."

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.960
And as it turns out,
that's just not true.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.700
This is primarily
because sociologists

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.410
have made many studies
of race-based movements

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.000
without paying
attention to race.

00:09:14.758 --> 00:09:18.000
And as a result,
sociologists have mostly

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.160
thought about movement
impacts as changes

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.282
at the level of the state.

00:09:21.282 --> 00:09:23.240
So what matters about
the Civil Rights movement

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.740
is that there was legislation
that came as a result of it.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.870
But what race scholars know is
that the social relations that

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:34.590
create, maintain, and
reproduce racial inequality

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.750
are embedded throughout society.

00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:39.930
In other words, racial
meanings and racism

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:44.280
are not only outcomes of
state-initiated processes,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.030
nor are they simply
ideas that people can

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.350
choose to ascribe to or not.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.660
Rather, racial
meanings and racism

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.160
are developed and expressed in
and through the organizations

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.600
and institutions in
which we all interact.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.980
So when we understand that power
is dispersed throughout society

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:10.420
and that race and racism
shape all social institutions,

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:14.130
we necessarily have to look at
how race-based movements impact

00:10:14.130 --> 00:10:15.669
these other institutions.

00:10:15.669 --> 00:10:17.210
So in the book, I
developed this idea

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:20.040
of civil institutionalization
to get at this idea

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.840
that movements get imported
into the institutions

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:24.040
of civil society.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.200
And this is certainly the
case with Black Power.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.060
So the roots of the
Black Power movement

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.500
began much earlier than the
1966 date that most of us

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.040
attribute to it.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.340
US black radicalism certainly
didn't begin in 1966,

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:42.020
nor did the idea of
black nationalism

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:44.780
or a movement for black
social, political,

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.680
and economic power begin then.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.520
Still, the popular narrative
is one in which black radicals

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.360
emerged on the scene near the
end of what Peniel Joseph calls

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.993
the "heroic period" of
the Civil Rights Movement.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.000
The reality is that there
have always been at least two

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.710
connected, and
sometimes opposing,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.970
black political
cultures-- one that sees

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.230
assimilation or integration
into the white mainstream

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.760
as an appropriate goal
for African-Americans

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:15.740
and another that
promotes the rejection

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.980
of white institutions,
norms, and values.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.190
So really, as the Civil
Rights Movement gave way

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.590
to Black Power in the
mid-1960s, this second,

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.670
more radical political
culture came into dominance.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:33.300
And following on the heels of
the Watts rebellion of 1965,

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.810
Black Power gave
voice to a generation,

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:40.370
a generation of black
people who wanted more--

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.890
more than the Civil Rights
Movement was asking for

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.410
and certainly more than
the establishment was

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.450
willing to give.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.080
But more than this,
Black Power rejected

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.760
the peaceful, nonviolent
approach of the Civil Rights

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.890
Movement, claiming, instead,
that black liberation was

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:04.180
an immediate emergency
matter of survival.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.800
The Black Power
movement threw off

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.430
the decorum of someone
like King and chose

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:11.870
to speak plainly, forcefully,
and without regard

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:13.970
for white feelings.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:18.600
So just briefly, Black Power
as a movement took many forms

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.330
and was made up of a
wide range of individuals

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:22.640
and organizations.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.890
But at the core, the
Black Power movement

00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:28.320
marked a move away from
the goals of integration

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.170
that were central
to Civil Rights

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.720
and toward a desire for
radical social change,

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.270
a focus on self-help
and self-defense

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.420
in the black community
and a rejection

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.730
of white aesthetic
cultural norms and values.

00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:45.520
Self-definition,
self-determination,

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.670
and black pride were
central to Black Power.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:52.130
In concrete struggles
over community control

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:55.830
over organizations
within black communities,

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:57.790
struggles around
police brutality,

00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:01.590
welfare reform all occurred
under the umbrella of Black

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.200
Power.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.720
So while the images I
showed earlier of groups

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.710
like the Black
Panther Party dominate

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.990
how we think about the movement,
there was more to the movement

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:16.110
than those images that
dominated news reports and FBI

00:13:16.110 --> 00:13:19.660
surveillance reports.

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:22.270
There was a strain
of the movement

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:26.080
that was aimed at dismantling
institutionalized racism.

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.460
Stokely Carmichael-- later Kwame
Toure-- and Charles Hamilton

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:31.430
wrote a book called Black Power.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:35.390
And in it, they explicated one
of the first social science

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.790
theories of
institutionalized racism--

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:41.020
the idea that racial meanings
and racial inequality

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.680
become embedded in
institutions, they

00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:47.210
become embedded
institutional practices,

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.990
and are not necessarily
dependent on racist attitudes.

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:54.170
The book also makes the
case that black people

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:57.310
need a twofold strategy--
one, to have black community

00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:59.640
representatives within
existing institutions

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.765
to represent black
interests, and, two,

00:14:01.765 --> 00:14:04.390
to build independent
black institutions.

00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.300
So this notion that black
people need to close ranks

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.940
was certainly not new.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.360
But the call in Black
Power, the book,

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.800
really reflects
and sets an agenda

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.530
for this institution-building
element of the movement

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:20.190
and was manifested in all
sorts of organizations

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:23.600
and within American politics.

00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.040
So as the idea of Black
Power was popularized,

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.710
established black
leaders attempted

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.290
to define it
politically, leading

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.720
to a series of Black
Power conferences.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.460
The most well-known
Black Power conference

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:40.840
was held between July
20th and July 23rd of 1967

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.680
in the wake of one of the
bloodiest black rebellions

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:45.420
in US history.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:48.830
Lasting from July
11th until July 17th,

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:52.050
the Newark rebellion had
left over 20 people dead

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:54.370
and at least 1,000 injured.

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:56.390
So as you can imagine,
there was some conflict

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:59.670
over the timing
of the conference.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.020
Still, over 1,000 delegates
and representatives

00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:08.150
from 286 organizations attended
this first national Black Power

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:09.550
conference.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:13.690
The conference document opens
with this basis for action--

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.270
"Whereas, the Black people
stand at the crossroads

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:19.130
of either an expanding
revolution or ruthless

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:21.380
extermination, it
is incumbent upon us

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:23.670
to set our house in order.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.570
And whereas Black
people have consistently

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.670
expended too much energy
and resources reflecting

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.180
to white definitions,
it is imperative

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:34.130
that organizational and
technical competence develop

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:37.490
to initiate and enact new
insights, new definitions,

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:39.210
and new programs."

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:42.060
The Black Power conferences
built a power base

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.150
and an organizational
vehicle for the development

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:49.080
of black political conventions
and a stronger black presence

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.690
in mainstream politics.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.060
And this idea of black
faces in higher places,

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:55.950
or what I'm calling
the black radical march

00:15:55.950 --> 00:16:00.330
through the institutions,
was a central theme.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.510
So the impact of the
Black Power movement

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:05.450
on black participation in
mainstream electoral politics

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.260
is clear.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.340
From the election
of black mayors

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:10.900
to the development of the
Congressional Black Caucus,

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.880
Black Power's theme of building
political and institutional

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:17.120
power shaped African-American
participation

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:19.020
in the US political mainstream.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:23.660
What you see up here is Ebony
Magazine's progress report.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.460
Every January, they published
a progress report for the year

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.240
before.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.060
And the story of
the year for 1967

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:35.820
was the election of black mayors
in cities across the United

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.120
States.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.690
But the nation-building strain
of the Black Power movement

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:44.720
was not only played out
in the political arena.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.360
From the rise of
black studies programs

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:49.330
and the development of
black student unions

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:53.120
the creation of independent
black educational institutions

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.050
black theaters and black
museums African-Americans

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.760
used the fuel of the
Black Power movement

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.140
to develop independent
black institutions

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.340
throughout civil society.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.869
And this phenomenon
is important not only

00:17:05.869 --> 00:17:08.240
because it changed the
organizational structure

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.550
of civil society,
but also because it

00:17:10.550 --> 00:17:14.240
created important shifts
in racial practices

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.010
in organizations and
contributed to the greater

00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:19.750
incorporation of the
black middle class

00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:21.667
into white institutions.

00:17:21.667 --> 00:17:23.250
But in the literature
on the movement,

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.500
very little is known
about this process.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:30.540
And let me just say here that
this importation of Black

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.920
Power into mainstream
organizations

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.630
certainly contributed
to a watering

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:36.740
down of Black
Power in such a way

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.232
that its transformatory
potential would be co-opted

00:17:40.232 --> 00:17:42.440
into something that looks
more like today's diversity

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.950
initiatives than what it looked
like at its most revolutionary.

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:50.680
Still, this process of
translating and incorporating

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:52.220
tenets of the Black
Power movement

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:54.724
into major institutions
in US society

00:17:54.724 --> 00:17:57.140
created important shifts that
are important to understand.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.020
So in the 1960s, large
cohorts of African-Americans

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.690
entered several academic and
professional disciplines.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.680
Their numbers were
unprecedented.

00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:11.560
And they were the immediate
products of the Civil Rights

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.640
and Black Power movements.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.340
And these professionals
were often not satisfied

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.930
with just integrating their
professions with their bodies

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:23.130
with just demographic
integration.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.960
On the contrary, they came to
their professions with a desire

00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:30.520
to make changes on behalf
of the black community.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:32.200
They wanted to use
the professions

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:36.520
as a tool for black liberation,
indeed for Black Power.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.410
But they encountered
professional structures

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:41.890
that had been operating
on a logic of exclusion,

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:45.140
many of which had been formed
for the purpose of exclusion

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:49.180
and, as such, were resistant to
change and often unprepared for

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:53.610
and unwelcoming of integration,
not to mention Black Power.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.540
So across the country, groups
of black professionals,

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.220
empowered by the legal and
social gains of the Civil

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.030
Rights Movement and inspired
and emboldened by Black Power,

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:06.300
sought to implement the
gains of the movement

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:07.430
into their professions.

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.175
And this process was widespread.

00:19:10.175 --> 00:19:12.300
There's no expectation for
you to read all of this.

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:18.910
I just put this list here
so you can see magnitude.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:22.701
These are just foundings of
professional associations.

00:19:22.701 --> 00:19:24.450
And the national
professional associations

00:19:24.450 --> 00:19:27.770
of black psychologists,
journalists, sociologists,

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.990
economists, social
workers, firefighters,

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:32.940
political scientists,
accountants, and librarians,

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:38.674
just to name a few, were all
formed between 1968 and 1976.

00:19:38.674 --> 00:19:40.340
And this is just
simple counts-- a chart

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:45.570
to show you that the founding of
black professional associations

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:50.110
maps onto what we think
about as a Black Power era.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.800
And all these organizations
had as their explicit goals

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.840
to both change their
profession for the good

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.590
of black professionals
within them,

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.820
but also to change their
profession's relationship

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.000
and practice with
the black community.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.600
These organizations were not
the first black professional

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.740
associations.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.260
But they were created under
very different circumstances

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.320
than their predecessors.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.510
The National Medical
Association and the National Bar

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.360
Association, for example,
were not necessarily formed

00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.560
because they wanted a
racially-oriented organization,

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.950
as is evidenced by the
national parallel names

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.060
to their American counterparts.

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.070
They were formed because
African-Americans were excluded

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:32.700
from the American counterparts.

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.640
In contrast, the Black Power era
black professional associations

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.910
were born out of unprecedented
access to white ones.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:43.960
The increased access to
white-dominated professions

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:47.030
and professional
associations coincided

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:49.430
with the dominance of
Black Power politics

00:20:49.430 --> 00:20:51.700
in a way that led black
professionals to bring

00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:53.990
the movement with them.

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.710
The Black Power influence on
these organizations is clear.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:00.420
They all saw the move
away from integration

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.279
as the primary goal
of black action

00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:03.820
within the professions--
they already

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:08.240
had that-- in favor of
seeking self-determination

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.930
for black professionals
and black communities.

00:21:10.930 --> 00:21:13.120
The founders of
these organizations

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.300
worked in the Black
Power tradition

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:17.530
of challenging white racism.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:20.390
They reflected Black
Power's change in tenor

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:22.030
from the Civil Rights
Movement, which

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.940
no longer saw the removal
of barriers as enough.

00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:28.570
They didn't shy away from
demanding black representation

00:21:28.570 --> 00:21:30.970
within their professions
or from labeling

00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:35.100
longstanding professional
practices as racist.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.940
If you look at
these organizations,

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.940
many of them, to this day, have
red, black, and green logos,

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.570
the colors of black nationalism.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.070
Many were founded with
10 or 12-point platforms,

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.620
reflecting the tactic
of the Black Panther

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:54.130
Party and other Black
Power organizations.

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:57.520
Another commonality is that
these organizations were not

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.150
founded quietly.

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.870
They took over meetings.

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:02.850
They issued manifestos.

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:03.920
They made demands.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.380
They insisted.

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.870
These organizations
were formed in

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:13.690
and served as the vehicle for
protest within the professions.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.540
The Association of Black
Psychologists, for example,

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:21.410
was formed in September of 1968.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:24.960
They issued a series of demands
for the American Psychological

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:27.120
Association-- the APA.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.680
And the demands clearly
reflect a Black Power ethic.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.770
For one, they demanded
that, "the APA

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.370
bring to bear its full
resources on finding solutions

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:39.010
to the problem of
racism and poverty

00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:41.600
and recognize that a significant
part of research emphasis

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.670
must be shifted away from
the total preoccupation

00:22:44.670 --> 00:22:47.170
with the ghetto as
a source of problems

00:22:47.170 --> 00:22:49.290
to consideration of the
forces within the larger

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.110
white community that contribute
so heavily to the maintenance

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:53.920
of the status quo."

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.440
And when the
newly-formed organization

00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:00.970
disrupted the annual
meetings of the APA in 1969,

00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:02.470
they argued that
the black community

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:06.090
had served as a research
colony for social scientists.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:10.000
Robert Green argued that-- this
is a quote-- "Psychologists

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.350
and sociologists go
into the black community

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:16.250
and do research, but
refuse to specify and push

00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:19.750
major programs of improvement
for the black community."

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:22.010
He went on to say, "Do not
use us for research efforts

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:23.540
any longer.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:28.780
Help us, instead, to mitigate
the effects of white racism."

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.600
Black librarians organized the
Black Caucus of the American

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.440
Library Association in 1969.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.390
The statement of concern that
they presented to the American

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:41.520
Library Association--
the ALA-- in 1970

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.740
also reflected this
Black Power ethic.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.750
In their brief
statement, they assert,

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:50.240
"Black librarians are
especially concerned

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.960
about the effects of
institutional racism,

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.044
poverty, the continued lack
of educational, employment,

00:23:56.044 --> 00:23:57.710
and promotional
opportunities for blacks

00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:59.480
and other minorities."

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.950
And in a condemnation
of the discipline,

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:06.019
they referenced the 1968
report of the National Advisory

00:24:06.019 --> 00:24:08.310
Commission on Civil Disorders,
or the Kerner Commission

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:13.310
report, arguing that, although
these socioeconomic ills have

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.380
been condemned by the Kerner
Commission, the Commission

00:24:16.380 --> 00:24:18.350
on Violence, and
many other studies,

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:21.665
the library profession has
been slow in responding

00:24:21.665 --> 00:24:22.415
to these problems.

00:24:24.822 --> 00:24:26.280
And you might be
wondering, what do

00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.830
they expect the library
profession to do, right?

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:32.710
And so I'm going to
give you an example.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:36.030
And I think it's a
really clear example

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:39.080
of this idea of translating
the goals of the movement

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.450
into their professional lives.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:44.290
So the first official resolution
they pushed through the ALA

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.390
Council was in response
to library practices

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.160
in segregated schools.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:51.330
So the founders of
the Black Caucus

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:53.407
were troubled by the
number of private schools

00:24:53.407 --> 00:24:54.990
that were founded
in the United States

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:57.410
in order to avoid integration.

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:59.720
These schools were the
result of white flight

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.550
after the Civil Rights Movement.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:02.960
And many of the
new white schools

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.880
couldn't afford
their own libraries.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.630
And so they asked local
libraries to support them.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:11.110
Black Caucus founders saw
this as a prime opportunity

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.240
to hold their profession
accountable for the gains

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:17.080
of the movement for
supporting school integration

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.040
and asked them to refuse to
support these white flight

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.160
schools.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.850
After a heated debate,
the Black Caucus

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.530
was successful in passing the
following resolution-- "That

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:30.510
the libraries or
librarians who do,

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.950
in fact, through their
services or materials,

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:36.390
support any such racist
institution be censured

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:38.460
by the American
Library Association

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.700
and that the ALA staff give
the widest possible publicity

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.330
to this action."

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:46.290
So this Black Caucus
resolution is a prime example

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:50.120
of how Black Power era
professionals creatively

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.960
translated the goals
and ethic of Black Power

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.850
into their
disciplinary contexts.

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:01.770
So these are just two examples
of how Black Power era

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:05.000
professionals brought the ideas
and strategies of the movement

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.970
into their professions
and mounted a challenge

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:10.650
against institutional racism.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:13.040
But I also find that black
professional associations

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.850
of the era served four
important purposes

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:19.190
within their professions.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.650
First, they did identity work.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:26.530
So I saw a lot of this sort
of talking and writing around,

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:29.840
what does it mean to be really
black and a professional?

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:33.110
And by "really black," meaning
committed to black liberation,

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:36.500
committed to the movement, and
a professional at the same time.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.250
Secondly, that they
served as a protest wing--

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:41.790
so black professional
associations were often

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:49.990
and continue to be more
willing to engage in activist

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:53.680
social justice activities
than are their mainstream

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.520
counterparts.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.770
The third is a focus on
professional equality--

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:06.150
so challenging practices
that unfairly benefited

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.590
their white colleagues
in promotion or in being

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.050
placed on committees,
things like that.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.810
And the last thing I
talk about is monitors,

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:17.770
so that they sort of served
as the black conscience

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.160
within the profession.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:22.480
So if there were
practices of a profession

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.500
that they thought harmed
the black community, APA,

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:34.610
for example-- the Association
of Black Psychologists--

00:27:34.610 --> 00:27:38.030
they called for a moratorium on
IQ testing of black children,

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:43.890
because IQ tests
were unfairly biased

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:45.300
against black kids in schools.

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:47.090
So this was one of
these sort of being

00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:51.950
a monitor about the
profession's practices.

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:56.040
In short, black professionals
during the Black Power era

00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.390
turned the black power
gaze onto their work lives

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:02.960
to challenge racism
within their professions.

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:07.116
Black people in the US
shaped by the movement

00:28:07.116 --> 00:28:10.280
fought for black studies
departments, the development

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.790
of afrocentric curricula and
various educational endeavors,

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:17.320
representation on the boards
of directors in organizations

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.300
serving black communities,
and greater racial diversity

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.740
and sensitivity in
organizations of all sorts.

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:26.350
And this element of Black Power,
the work that African-Americans

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:28.850
did within all sorts
of organizations

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:32.320
to bring the ideas of
the movement into them

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.490
is a process that's
less understood.

00:28:38.630 --> 00:28:41.600
But it is one that, I think,
is essential to understanding

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.420
not only how these
institutions changed

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.070
over time, but also
the resistance even

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:49.380
by liberal whites
to those changes.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.000
As the black struggle
shifted from calls

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.470
for color-blind, neutral
equality of opportunity

00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:00.560
to color-conscious calls for
equality of condition delivered

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:03.180
in the urgent tone
of Black Power,

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.560
white resistance
also shifted, mostly

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.250
by using color-blind
rhetoric and policy

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:12.200
in ways that maintain
and continues

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.050
to maintain white supremacy.

00:29:16.050 --> 00:29:18.050
Before I close, I want
to talk just a little bit

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:21.785
about my new project,
Black Power Lawyers.

00:29:21.785 --> 00:29:24.590
But because I'm still
working through the data,

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.240
I'll talk just a little
bit about the framework

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.774
and my research process so far.

00:29:28.774 --> 00:29:30.190
It's still early,
but I don't want

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.740
to miss the opportunity
to hear your feedback

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:35.557
and questions at this point.

00:29:35.557 --> 00:29:37.640
So my new project is about
the National Conference

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.260
of Black Lawyers--
NCBL-- a group

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.930
that formed in 1968
with the express goal

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:47.180
to be the legal wing
of the revolution.

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:48.800
I came across this
organization when

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.250
I was doing work on
my last book looking

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.840
for black professional
associations, that big list you

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.060
saw up there.

00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:00.710
And my interest was piqued.

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:02.270
And when I looked
further, I realized

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.970
that they were explicitly
tied to Black Power.

00:30:04.970 --> 00:30:07.166
And I was immediately
curious about them,

00:30:07.166 --> 00:30:09.040
because I had never
thought about Black Power

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.020
as having a legal wing
or a legal strategy.

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.450
But as I thought more
about the extreme state

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.350
repression of the movement
and the court cases that

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:20.610
resulted from it, it was
clear that the movement

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.356
had to engage with the
law and with the courts.

00:30:23.356 --> 00:30:26.120
And so I found that
the papers of NCBL

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.130
are housed at Howard University.

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:32.510
Several other archives have
manuscript collections related

00:30:32.510 --> 00:30:35.380
to Black Power era legal
cases-- the [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.620
holds the Angela Davis defense
collection, for example.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.490
And many NCBL
attorneys have papers

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.750
collected in repositories
across the country.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.330
So I visited most of them
and started the process

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:49.510
of collecting oral
histories with attorneys

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:51.880
who were active in this
organization in the period

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.340
that I'm interested in.

00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:56.190
So as a whole, the book
will make the argument

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:59.530
that the Black Power movement
had a legal wing, which

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:01.886
is a sort of necessary
empirical argument,

00:31:01.886 --> 00:31:03.760
given the way that we
think about Black Power

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.900
so far, that there's such
a thing as Black Power law

00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:10.820
and lawyers who practiced it.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:15.640
The book spans the
period from 1968 to 1977

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.510
and includes, for
example, elements

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:22.410
of the defense of Angela Davis,
Assata Shakur, Joan Little,

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:24.350
and the Attica brothers.

00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:27.340
I end my time period
with NCBL's involvement

00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:31.300
in the Bakke affirmative
action case in 1977.

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:36.220
I look at career effects of
defending unpopular clients,

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.480
the organization's global
advocacy, and their work

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.850
on behalf of black law students
and in defense of black lawyers

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:47.490
who found themselves facing
disciplinary charges.

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:50.640
So the piece that I'm working
on right now and sort of

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:54.410
in the mix of trying
to figure out I'm

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:56.273
calling Kangaroo
Court-- the courtroom

00:31:56.273 --> 00:31:57.314
as a space of resistance.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.220
In 1977, Lennox
Hinds, who was then

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:04.970
Director of the National
Congress of Black

00:32:04.970 --> 00:32:08.420
Lawyers and Rutgers
criminal justice professor,

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:11.000
held a press conference
while court was in session

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.140
for the trial of Assata Shakur.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.240
In it, he characterized the
trial as a legalized lynching

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.010
by a kangaroo court.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:24.880
For his remarks, he was charged
with violating Middlesex Ethics

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:29.090
Committee Rule
7107d, which, quote,

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:30.830
"restricts the
speech of attorneys

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:33.490
who are associated with
pending criminal litigation

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.020
by sanctioning
attorneys from making

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:40.680
any extrajudicial statement that
they expect to be disseminated

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.430
to the public and that is
reasonably likely to interfere

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:46.200
with a fair trial."

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.280
In the end arguing that he
was not the attorney of record

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.890
and that the rule unfairly
restricted his First Amendment

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:54.310
rights, Hinds succeeded in
having the charges dropped

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:55.910
and actually brought
a suit of his own

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.700
against the ethics committee.

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.900
But his statements
are representative

00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:04.260
of a genre of black
movement politics

00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:07.090
that has yet to be given
much scholarly attention.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.560
And that's courtroom resistance.

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:10.560
What I'm finding is that
the National Conference

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:15.850
of Black Lawyers' attorneys
and oftentimes their clients

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.980
conceived of the
courtroom as a space

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.660
for carrying out this
movement from pushing

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.660
the boundaries of what was
acceptable speech about court

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:28.620
cases, as in the Hines case I
just told you about, to using

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:33.400
strategic disrespect of trial
judges as a resistance tactic

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.500
to making incredible advances
in the use of social science

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.100
in jury selection.

00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:42.810
NCBL attorneys used their
position as attorneys

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:44.790
in the service of Black Power.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:49.000
So I want to just
conclude with this.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.230
So there is no doubt that the
Black Power movement still

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.090
inspires young people.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:33:57.720
And it's not just Beyonce at
the Super Bowl or Kendrick Lamar

00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.270
at the Grammys.

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:02.710
The Black Lives Matter movement
and the new Black Student

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:06.140
Movement is all
raised fists, Assata

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:10.429
taught me, and by
any means necessary,

00:34:10.429 --> 00:34:13.310
even in the face of white tears.

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:16.060
And the resistance
that the movement faces

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.940
is quite predictable when you
understand the racial dynamics

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:21.174
of color-blind racism.

00:34:21.174 --> 00:34:23.340
I'm still wrapping my head
around these connections,

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:26.159
but they are quite
striking, really.

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:29.101
So for me as a student
of social movements,

00:34:29.101 --> 00:34:30.850
it's not so much about
whether Black Power

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:35.650
has a lasting legacy, but
about how and to what end.

00:34:35.650 --> 00:34:37.800
And my work tries to deal
with these questions.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.730
But beyond this, knowing
that so many black people see

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:45.210
2016 as so similar
to 1966 should raise

00:34:45.210 --> 00:34:47.940
many more curiosities
and, quite frankly,

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:49.920
should give us all pause.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.070
Thank you.

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.414
