00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.840
Hey guys, I'm Nate

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.310
We've got something really fun for you today: A lot of you have commented, saying that we should do something from the game

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:11.460
Fortnite, and I thought what would be the best idea would be to build one of the weapons seen in the game. So this video

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.799
is part 1 of 2 in building the "vendor tech

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.289
rocket slammer," which I thought was just the coolest looking weapon, and I had to build it. To make sure this hammer isn't gonna hurt

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.419
anyone and so it's light enough to use, most of it's going to be made out of some EVA foam and a PVC pipe.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.400
I've got this chunk of foam which I've already sort of made into a hammerhead shape and that's going to help me make the pattern

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.320
out of the foam for the build

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.820
I made this using some of the same techniques that I described in our video where I showed how to make some large

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.950
Mario Kart shells out of fiberglass. This is pink rigid insulation foam which is glued together

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.459
and then shaped using a handsaw and some rough grit sandpaper

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.020
I've got a couple kinds of glue, a razor blade, a heat gun, some tape; I've also got my computer up on the counter which

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.280
I'm gonna be using to look at my reference pictures of the hammer. Let's get started

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.180
Let's start with this block that I've already carved into the general shape of a hammer head

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.920
We'll cover this form in tape and then cut it off

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.080
Let's trim off the top and bottom of the tape and then use one

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.289
vertical cut to remove it from our form. As we cut and remove the sheet of tape from around our form, we can see that

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.260
it's very curved.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.269
We'll need to add a few more cuts in it to get it to lie flat on our sheet of foam

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.429
With the cuts added into our sheet of tape, we can now press it down onto the sheet to make it lie flat.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.030
Let's take a white marker and trace around our entire pattern down onto the foam. We can then remove the tape and cut along the

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.020
lines that we've drawn

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.120
With our pattern cut out of the foam, we now need to glue together all of the exposed edges.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.220
I'm using contact cement,

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.760
which I'm storing in a squeeze bottle with a small hole cut in the tip. This makes for a very easy application

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.640
As we start gluing together the pattern, we can see the form of the hammer-head begin to take shape

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.269
Once we've glued together all of the matching edges, our EVA foam hammerhead is looking great

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.370
Let's move on to making the face of our hammer

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.719
We can place what we've just built face down on a mat of more foam and trace around

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.260
that with our white marker. To try and get our edges to match up nicely,

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.419
we'll cut around this circle at a 45-degree angle

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.839
Let's trim the edge of the hammer head at a 45-degree angle as well. Now the two pieces should meet nicely. By gluing those

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.700
two pieces together, we have the front face of our hammer. To help prevent the head of our hammer from deforming,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.330
let's draw and cut out some shapes from a 1-inch sheet of styrofoam

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.199
The head of this hammer has one large 8-sided piece on top of a smaller 8-sided piece, which are both held a small

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.510
distance away from this face [that] we've already assembled

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:38.019
We'll cut out one of the small pieces and two of the large pieces and then put those together. Because contact cement will actually dissolve

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.589
styrofoam, we'll be using a hot glue gun to glue the styrofoam pieces together

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.410
By placing our styrofoam octagons down on sheets of foam, we can trace out

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.790
just the right sizes to completely cover all the styrofoam in the EVA foam

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:57.730
The center of this hammer's striking face has a domed circle on it. To get a curved surface,

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.339
let's use our heat gun on a piece of foam; and when it's nice

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.340
and hot, we'll try stretching it over a playground ball. The EVA foam can't stretch and shape infinitely,

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.260
but we can add a little bit of contour, if needed. This bowl has the right circumference for the circle

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.459
[that] we want to add onto the hammer

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.429
So let's use this to trace out a circle onto our curved foam

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.190
We can glue this domed circle onto the front of our hammer,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.760
and we have our impact head [finished]

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.399
To add a little bit of space between the body of our hammer head and the striking face of our hammer head,

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.970
let's glue together two sheets of EBA foam and then cut a circle out from them

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.790
Once this striking face is attached to the body of the hammer,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.189
it will be very difficult to do any cleanup work,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.360
so let's do that quickly now. A stone grinding attachment on a rotary tool does an excellent job of taking down sharp edges on EVA foam,

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.639
and for filling in any gaps or scratches in the foam, we'll use something called gallery glass

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:51.309
It's a product designed to simulate the "letting" in stained glass. It does a great job of filling in gaps,

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.369
and it takes paint very well. As a final

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.899
preparation step before we attach the striking face of our hammer onto the body of the hammer head,

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.509
let's hit it with a heat gun, which will help seal the foam and make it easier to paint later on

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.790
With all that prep work complete,

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.179
let's use some more contact cement and glue the two pieces of the hammerhead together

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.989
Some of the next steps will require knowing where the handle will attach to our

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.810
hammerhead. Our handle is going to be a PVC pipe,

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.899
so let's measure and cut a hole for that. We can mark the foam by pressing the PVC into it just a little bit, and

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.010
we have a clear line where we need to cut. We're not going to permanently attach the handle yet,

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.949
because it would get in the way as we work on the rest of the hammerhead

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.478
Just like with the front of a hammer, we will trace a circle that will be glued on to the back

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.839
We'll cut this circle at a 45-degree angle and trim the back of the hammer as well, so the two angles meet up nicely

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.970
Before we glue on that circle though,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.380
we'll build the rest of the back of the hammer onto it, as well as attach our handle and

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:52.260
reinforcing it inside the hammer head. The back of our hammer has a few different sizes of circles leading up to a

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.020
conical piece that is the rocket at the back of the hammer. Let's trace out those circle pieces from foam and then glue those on

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.010
Before we glue some of these circles down permanently, let's use our rotary tool to smooth down the corners

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.430
To get a custom cone shape, we can either partially cut a piece of paper or partially tape two pieces of paper together

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.620
By overlapping the edges more or less [variably], we can get a cone that is either more or less pointed

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.289
Once our paper is overlapped, to give us the shape of cone

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.549
we want, we can tape it off and then measure the size of circle for the base of the cone

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.979
I'm going to use this roll of tape to measure, because it happens to be just the right size of circle. This marker on top

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:38.939
Of a few stacked sheets of foam will give us a uniform height that you can trace around our cone.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.949
After cutting off the extra, I now have a chronical strip of paper that should work as a perfect pattern.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.260
A quick cut gives us a nice flat piece of paper that we can trace out onto a sheet of foam and then cut it out

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.680
This cone shape on the back of our hammer has some panels along the sides of it that are the same size and shape, so

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.919
we'll cut out a second one of these patterns as well. To make the side panels,

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:09.309
we cut one of the two pieces of foam into six equal parts. A quick cleanup with our rotary tool gives us nice rounded edges

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:15.339
Let's glue all six of those panels around the sides of our conical ring. After a little bit more cleanup with our rotary tool,

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.340
we're ready to glue that cone-shaped ring to the back of our hammer

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.169
The back of our rocket has a second cone shape extending off of the back of the first one

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.669
Let's use that same technique with a piece of paper to make a custom cone-shaped pattern

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:32.469
Once again, a roll of tape happens to be just the right size, so we'll trace off of that

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:52.159
Finally, the back of our rocket has another cone-shaped piece that tapers inward, rather than out.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.339
Once again, a quick paper comb pattern to make that piece. A

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.489
small flat circle in the middle of that cone finishes up the back piece

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:02.120
With that glued in place, the back of our rocket hammer is looking great

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:09.440
The rocket portion of our rocket slammer is now built, and as I said, we aren't attaching it yet until we've really secured the handle

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.589
inside our hammer, but it's looking really good--

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.490
It's looking really good

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.890
The front is looking really good,

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.599
and so now we have four fins that we need to add going around the body, as well as two little

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.700
energy pods with a cable coming out of them.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.350
I don't know what those are supposed to do,

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.619
but they look neat. A rubber band stretched around the body of the

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:31.070
hammerhead will give me a nice even line that I can measure from

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.940
Making these fins is going to take just a little bit of guesswork, so let's cut out

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.760
what looks like about the right shape and then modify it as we go

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.710
We can hold our cut fin pattern up to the body of the hammer and see where it needs adjustments

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.549
Once we have the inside contour of the fin correct, we can draw in the outside shape

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.189
The shape of this fin is good, but the fins need to be a little bit thicker,

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.260
so let's glue together two sheets of our EVA foam and then cut out four of this fin pattern

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.669
Adding these four fins is definitely going to make our hammer look more like a rocket

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:06.499
The sides of our rocket have two small pucks which seem to be glowing with blue energy

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:10.489
The surface of these pucks have three recessed cutouts, so for each one

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.160
I'll cut out a circle and then remove the unneeded

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:19.880
pieces from that circle. The circles with the removed pieces can then be glued onto the surface of some thicker pieces

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:24.760
Quickly going over the edges with the rotary tool smooths out the corners. Each of these pucks

00:08:24.769 --> 00:08:29.320
also has a small raised circle in the middle, which will just add with a thin sheet of EBA foam

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:33.229
Let's glue these two pucks onto the side of the body of our rocket hammer

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:40.908
This rubbery gas line hose should work really well for the cables that run from the little pucks on the side of the hammer, up

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:42.630
to the front of the striking head

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:47.059
We'll hit them with a heat gun to get the shape closer to what we want. At the end of our rubber

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.760
hose, we want it to make a sharp 90-degree turn,

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:54.469
so we'll cut a small notch into the rubber and then add some glue to make it hold that shape

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.160
The head of our rocket hammer is mostly built, so it is time to move on

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.430
to the handle. The base of that is going to be this PVC pipe, which is just a tiny bit too long.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:05.710
I think you need to take just a few inches off of the bottom,

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.440
but most of this handle is made up of a few different

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.089
cones. The head of the hammer will fit this far onto this PVC pipe to really give it some stability,

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:15.640
then there's sort of a cone shape underneath that, a

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:20.049
round cylinder under that, and then we've just got a good stretch of plane handle;

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:24.159
and then we've got a flared cone here and a long, tapered cone at the very bottom

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.739
Let's trim off the end of this, and then I've taken the liberty of making some of those cone shapes out of paper

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:32.040
We'll use those as patterns and cut them out of foam

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.040
 

00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:46.360
A small ring of hot glue will hold the neck in place when I slide it up to the height that it's supposed to be

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:49.189
Below the cylindrical piece is another small ring,

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:54.529
which will just be another small strip of EVA foam. The body of the handle is mostly one uniform thickness,

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:56.520
but there are two recessed strips,

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.229
which run down the length of the handle [that are] angled a little bit more toward the front

00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:05.689
So we'll coat the rest of the handle in more EVA foam, leaving a gap where those two strips should go

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.489
There are two more cones that make up the bottom handle shape of our hammer, and we'll make those the same way

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:18.199
we've made our other cones. A small doughnut-shaped ring can connect the opening of the upper, wider cone to the lower, narrower cone

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:24.199
We really want to make sure that our pipe is well-attached to the inside of the head of the rocket hammer,

00:10:24.199 --> 00:10:30.258
so let's cut out some circles that will fit around our pipe and then glue onto the inside body of the rocket hammer,

00:10:30.449 --> 00:10:33.949
to make sure that it's not going to move around as I shake and swing this thing

00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:39.289
The PVC has support attaching it to the top and bottom of the inside of the rocket hammer body,

00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:42.889
but I want even more than that, so we've got these two pieces of

00:10:43.259 --> 00:10:45.559
supporting foam that will work as a sort of

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.394
scaffolding on the inside of the hammer.

00:10:47.394 --> 00:10:50.419
With our support structure well installed inside the head of our hammer,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:55.099
we can now glue on the back rocket. With the hammer head attached firmly onto the handle,

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.639
it's time to add the few pieces that connect the neck of the hammer onto the head

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:03.110
Once again, these pieces are thicker than a single sheet of foam, so it's glue two of them together.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.810
Because of where some of these supporting pieces attach,

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.560
it's necessary to do a little bit of cleanup on the hammer head using our rotary tool

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:22.489
At this point, all of the pieces are added onto our hammer

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.620
There's nothing left to do as far as the build goes. Of course, this doesn't look like the hammer in the game because we haven't

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.980
added paint to it yet

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:34.220
So there are some little details that will need to be carved into the foam, and then we'll go through a several step process

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:37.940
to paint this whole thing up, but it is looking great

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:39.500
Hey guys

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.710
