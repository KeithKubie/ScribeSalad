00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:05.404
And so it seems
that another season of<i> Review</i>

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.940
must end with me,
A.J. Gibbs,

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.011
giving you the sad news that
Forrest MacNeil has vanished,

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:17.817
and this time, with our beloved
producer, Grant Grunderschmidt.

00:00:17.917 --> 00:00:19.219
I don't like to be sad,

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.054
so I like to think they're
floating down that river,

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:24.691
settling their differences
with one another.

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.292
And if I'm right about that,

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:29.361
I'm pretty sure Forrest
would give being hunted

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:33.933
six stars.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.668
That's all the time we have.

00:00:35.768 --> 00:00:37.603
This is A.J. Gibbs saying,

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:39.171
"Life,
you're already living it.

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.441
Ain't it great?"

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.276
So long.
