00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.470
&gt;&gt; So then after the user presses the button and the user interface detects it

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.240
what's the, what's the next thing that you expect would happen?

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.190
&gt;&gt; So I think that the next things that are hap,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.580
going to happen are going to be all of our checks to start the brew process.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.835
So we're- &gt;&gt; Make, makes sense.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.930
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. Check if the water's there, check if our receptacles in place.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.910
&gt;&gt; Okay, so there's, there's two primary checks.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.290
Do we have, you know, have we loaded up the water, and then, do we have a,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.630
a coffee pot to hold the results of, you know, the coffee after we've brewed it.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.250
So those are two checks.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.980
Is does it matter which one we do first?

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.830
&gt;&gt; I don't think so.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.550
Not necessarily.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.240
&gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Just as long as they're all held.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.980
&gt;&gt; And so, I, I don't see either.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.670
And so, we're not going to be concerned about that.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.520
At that point things are ready.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.550
We can, we can start the boiler to produce some hot water.
