Speaker 1:          00:00          So as much as possible, it's usually four fights a year and then as you get better it drops to three fights. And then when you're the champion that drops the two fights. So, um, that's, that's the progression of fault of fighting. You can't, like for instance, how many fights did the anti have this year? Maybe two. It before, when you start it now he would have like three to four. Yeah. He's very angry that this rematch is not happening. And I side with him, it was a Tyson and pulled out Tyson got a deal with ESPN. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and it's, it's a, it's a big deal because I, you know, talking about chess match, I think that's, he's pulled off the greatest chess match move there is first he comes over from England. He wouldn't, he takes the challenge if we Deontae uh, Joshua didn't, he boxed had a great fight.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Now he's put himself right up with all, all three of them are on the same line to me. And then now for the rematch, they want to, people want to see Deontae and they want to see Tyson fury again because the first fight was exciting. Uh, Joshua, who's he fighting? You know he's going to fight the big baby, but nobody knows him. Everybody knows Deontae boxing fans. Now that's about everybody knows Tyson. Everybody in, especially after that fight because it was such a spectacular fight. Oh my God. The first knocked down was great. The second knock down was preposterous. So the fact that he rose like Lazarus. Yeah. I mean it was crazy. And then one, the rest of the round he gets tagged a few times and it starts boxing and then even tagged Deontae I still had them winning that fight. It was close.

Speaker 1:          01:41          Oh, Tyson. I think by around thing boxing one that night. Every, yeah. Both guys looked great and uh, boxed well and made it exciting. Fight that, the rematch. Obviously everybody wants to see the rematch again. So when the rematch happened that that put, um, Anthony Joshua on the shelf. Yeah. In my eyes now is put them on the shelf a bit longer with this ESPN deal. And you know, Tyson fury is boxing in front of, uh, the public, uh, Anthony, Joshua and Deontae there pay per view right now. Who are they? Gonna fight paper view. Nobody wants to see no silly flight. They want to see what the flights. Yeah. You know, it's, it's a great move by Tyson fury. It's a great mood. But the first fight, the fight ended in a draw, right? Yeah. Yeah. So in the draw, Deontae keeps the title, but it least Tyson walks away like saying, look, look, I won the decision.

Speaker 1:          02:38          I feel like I should have won the decision. There's a dispute, there's a debate about it, but everybody wants to see that fight. I'm going to draw is not unreasonable, but kaizen could lose to, somebody can lose to some fucking awesome. Yeah. I want them mucking around saying, oh, I'll fight. This all won't find it till next year somebody might lose. This is what happens. And now none of them can fight other because if Joshua fights fury and loses to fury, Joshua was a star goes down. If Josh will fights Deontae and beats Deontae the Tyson Deontae fights. Not that exciting. But if Joshua wants real respect, he's got a fight, either fury or Deontay fights. Those are the big fight obviously gets respect. He's the heavyweight champion of the world, but split. You know, that's a weird thing too. I'd like to see Joshua Ortiz. I been interesting fight. It would be an interesting cause. Our teas can box and hit. Yeah. Well that was what showed how God damn powerful Deontae is that Ortiz was winning that fight. Yeah. And then I was, I think it was the 10th round, so the seventh or 10th I don't remember. But I remember when he called them, I was like, God, that guy, he me late in the fight. That guy carries that pal.
