00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.179
Just keep your eyes peeled
for any signs of where

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.265
the railroad would have been.

00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:17.058
NARRATOR: Now, the
train Bunch hit was

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:19.269
no run-of-the-mill locomotive.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.604
This was one of them
high dollar jobs,

00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:25.567
carrying folks in the high tax
bracket out of New Orleans.

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:28.611
But that old train
stopped running years ago.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.740
So finding them tracks is going
to take more than a little

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.032
doing.

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.368
Judging by this
big hill right here,

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.747
I think this might have been
right where it passed at.

00:00:38.747 --> 00:00:41.458
Brendan, I don't see any
pieces of the railroad, though.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.376
Keep your eyes peeled to see
if we can find a piece of it.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:46.379
BRENDAN: I'm keeping
them peeled, buddy.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.965
We're going to try to
find the railroad tracks.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.759
And we're going to follow
the tracks to where

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.010
he perpetrated the robbery.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:04.522
What's this here?

00:01:04.522 --> 00:01:07.400
Put some muscle to it.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.904
[grunts]

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:12.655
Is that a piece of the track?

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:14.115
It sure is.

00:01:14.115 --> 00:01:16.910
Yeah, that's all whole
piece of the track.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.328
Pure evidence.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:21.664
We're in the right location.
- Yeah.

00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:22.916
All right.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.043
Let's move out and see if
we can find anything else.

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:26.377
Let's go.

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:29.756
NARRATOR: This track led Bunch
to his biggest haul ever.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:34.093
And the boys are hoping
it does the same for them.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:36.221
I don't know what type
of clues we'll find.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.848
But when we follow the
tracks, we'll be following

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.684
the footsteps of Eugene.

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.061
BRENDAN: Follow
the train tracks.

00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:44.437
All right.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:47.273
And maybe we'll find a clue
that no one's ever found before.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.526
We're on the right track.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:50.944
And I mean train track.

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:55.281
Look, it clears up here.

00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.371
Clearly, this is where
the train tracks ran.

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:03.540
Right?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.750
Eugene went from
being a schoolteacher

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.962
to a train robber, because
he caught the fever.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:10.672
You know, if he was running
with a bunch of loot,

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:12.924
something could have
just popped out--

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:16.553
a coin, or, you
know, some jewelry.

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.722
The same fever that everyone
that's a treasure hunter

00:02:19.722 --> 00:02:21.307
catches.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.642
But it wasn't about the money.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:26.396
It was about the
adventure and the thrill.

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:29.732
And that's why he
could never stop.

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:32.485
[beeping]

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:35.738
That's a good hit.

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:40.118
[beeping]

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.619
I have a great signal.

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:42.787
It's repetitive.

00:02:42.787 --> 00:02:45.623
Same number, same
sound, over and over.

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:46.666
All right, let's pull it up.

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:50.712
Try and pop this out.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.843
There you go, buddy.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:57.635
Oh, look.

00:02:57.635 --> 00:02:58.845
There it is, there it is.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.430
What is it?

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.183
What is it?
No way.

00:03:04.183 --> 00:03:05.184
Told you we'd find gold.
