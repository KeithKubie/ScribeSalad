00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.620
- [Narrator] This program is presented

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.230
by University of California Television.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.640

with the latest UCTV programs.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.770
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.623
- Our speaker today is
a graduate of our own.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.520
Thomas Ginsburg, he grew up in this area

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.160
and then did his undergraduate degree,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.950
his law degree, and his doctorate

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.290
in jurisprudence and social policy,

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.673
all three, at Berkeley.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.070
His publications are
listed, and I won't repeat

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.040
what's in the program in that regard,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.740
'cause we wanna give him maximum time,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.413
but I'll just make this remark.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.100
Since he left us for this brilliant career

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.110
that he's pursued in universities abroad,

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.193
including in Japan,
University of Illinois,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.700
and now at the University of
Chicago in two departments,

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.370
the law school and the
political science department,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.620
he has become one of the
really outstanding experts

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.653
internationally on the questions

00:01:40.653 --> 00:01:44.080
of constitutionalism and
political development,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.550
and he's gonna speak on that today.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.070
As I started to say, since he left here

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.640
there's been a huge interest
in constitution-making

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.820
and nation-building
since the so-called end

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.813
of the Cold War of course,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.360
and he's right in the
middle of all the studies

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.830
that have developed in that area,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.286
and has made a great name in that field

00:02:08.286 --> 00:02:11.760
in collaboration with such
other eminent scholars

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.533
as our new Dean at the law school,

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.573
Sujit Choudhry, and others.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.020
Another great development, of course,

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.890
has been the emergence of
China as a near-superpower,

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.900
a little more today than it was yesterday

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.010
because they have a new nuclear sub

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.496
that went through the Malacca
Straits in the last two days.

00:02:32.496 --> 00:02:36.160
But the emergence of Asia
generally as a theater

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.380
of enormous security

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.550
and political importance internationally,

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.370
and Tom is in the middle
of that field as well.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.390
He's capable at Asian languages,

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.940
he's written a comparative book

00:02:48.314 --> 00:02:52.870
on rule of law and judicial
review, in that area.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.960
And then finally, and in
the more theoretical field

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.840
of rule of law and its
practical ramifications,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.790
he's been a major scholarly
voice in that area as well.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.537
Those of us, I'm proud
to say myself included

00:03:05.537 --> 00:03:09.340
in a minor role, who were
his professors at Berkeley

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.480
are enormously proud of the great stature

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.500
that he's achieved, not
just because he's famous,

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.600
but because his scholarship
is so excellent,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.600
so insightful, and so
marvelously original.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.570
So we're very privileged
to have Thomas Ginsburg

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.717
as our Jefferson lecturer on the question,

00:03:30.717 --> 00:03:34.240
"Were the framers right
about constitutional design?"

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.303
Welcome, Tom.

00:03:35.303 --> 00:03:38.303
(audience applauds)

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.330
- Well, thanks to
everyone for coming today,

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.360
and before I begin I really have to thank

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.700
the committee for giving
me this tremendous honor

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.890
of giving a Jefferson lecture.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.330
Perhaps more than your
average Jefferson lecturer,

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.300
I know exactly what that means.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.304
I've been coming to them
since I was an undergraduate

00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:04.170
and I'm just deeply moved and honored

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.130
to be asked to give one,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.280
so I would like to thank the committee,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.510
and also to thank Harry
Scheiber in particular

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.860
for his indefatiguable support
of my career in general,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.723
but also for the honor today.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.397
To ask as my title does,
"Were the framers right

00:04:20.397 --> 00:04:22.580
"about constitutional design?"

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.920
is to risk, in many quarters, ridicule,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.753
approbation, and even physical violence.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.323
We all know that we live in a country

00:04:30.323 --> 00:04:33.780
that was blessed with a set
of giants at the outset.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.210
As Thomas Jefferson said in
a letter to Adams in 1787,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.003
it really is an assembly of demigods.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.120
Reverence for our constitution
and those who created it

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.240
is one of the hallmarks of
American political culture.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.070
People treat it with
quasi-religious reverence,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.720
commentators from both ends
of the political spectrum

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.743
declare their loyalty and allegiance.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.020
This view of the framers as masters

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.990
of rational deliberation, masters of

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.460
applied political theory
I think is even stronger

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.700
when we look at other recent exercises

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.700
in constitutional design.

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.430
Egypt 2012, the framers of
the Egyptian constitution

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.670
don't look so focused as those
in the previous painting.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.910
(audience laughter)

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.493
Brazil, 1988.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.270
The framers look a little too focused,

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.573
too committed to their
particular projects.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.040
So this view of the American founders

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.250
as being a set of geniuses
is well entrenched

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.230
in our political culture and may indeed

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:37.740
have a kernel of truth in it.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.300
The funny thing, though, is,
when we look at their own views

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.000
of their handiwork, they
were a little more skeptical.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.920
So Benjamin Franklin, on the very last day

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.000
of the constitutional convention,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.017
admitted that he said, as you can see,

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:52.307
"I confess that there are several parts

00:05:52.307 --> 00:05:55.577
"of this Constitution which
I do not at present approve,

00:05:55.577 --> 00:05:56.957
"for when you assemble a number of men

00:05:56.957 --> 00:05:58.727
"to have the advantage
of their joint wisdom,

00:05:58.727 --> 00:06:01.023
"you inevitably assembled those men

00:06:01.023 --> 00:06:02.737
" with all their prejudices, passions,

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.417
"errors of opinion and local interests,

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:06.017
"and selfish views.

00:06:06.017 --> 00:06:08.363
"Can a perfect production be expected?

00:06:09.287 --> 00:06:10.657
"I consent to the Constitution

00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:12.337
"because I expected no better,

00:06:12.337 --> 00:06:15.310
"and because I'm not sure
that it is not the best."

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.730
Well, not exactly a ringing endorsement.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.480
It's close, it says, "Well,
it's as good as we can do."

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:24.513
George Washington:

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:27.177
about a week later,

00:06:27.177 --> 00:06:28.787
"I wish the Constitution which is offered

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:30.387
"had been made more perfect,

00:06:30.387 --> 00:06:31.937
"but I sincerely believe it is the best

00:06:31.937 --> 00:06:33.580
"that could be obtained at this time."

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.831
All right, good enough
for government work.

00:06:35.831 --> 00:06:39.100
(audience laughs)

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.268
In the Federalist debates, which occurred

00:06:41.268 --> 00:06:45.720
immediately after the previous two quotes,

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.050
we see a debate about the imperfections

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.610
of the document which had been produced,

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.170
and Hamilton, quoting David Hume,

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.870
notes that there will be a chance,

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:59.557
and that the political
community, on the last line,

00:06:59.557 --> 00:07:02.930
"must correct the mistakes
which they inevitably fall into

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.107
in their first trials and experiments."

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.660
Indeed, much of debate
in the Federalist Papers

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.600
if you go back and read them,

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.780
is really about the question of whether

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.690
to amend the Constitution
before ratification

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.400
or after ratification,

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.960
but imperfection is built into

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.020
the very earliest
understandings of the document.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.077
Madison, in Federalist 43, notes

00:07:22.077 --> 00:07:25.637
"That useful alterations will
be suggested by experience,

00:07:25.637 --> 00:07:27.187
"could not be but foreseen.

00:07:27.187 --> 00:07:28.957
"It was requisite, therefore, that a mode

00:07:28.957 --> 00:07:31.720
"for introducing them should be provided."

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.540
In other words, the very
idea of imperfection

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.360
was built into the
Constitution and its design

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.070
through the introduction
of an amendment procedure,

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:41.990
and that's certainly
something that the framers did

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.540
which as been very influential,

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:47.690
and very helpful in our
own political community,

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.330
one that other constitution makers

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.880
have almost uniformly followed.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.840
The next question is, "What do Al Sharpton

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.241
and Rand Paul have in common?"

00:07:58.241 --> 00:08:00.440
(audience laughs)

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.080
The answer, of course,
is that they're among

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.680
a group of recent people,
far bigger than this set,

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:07.910
who have proposed
constitutional amendments

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:09.570
for various pet projects.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.660
As you might guess, Al
Sharpton's proposals

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.600
are a little different than Rand Paul's.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.570
John Paul Stevens, in the top center,

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:17.416
has recently written an important book,

00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:19.820
calling for the amendment
of the constitution

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.860
to overrule, if you will,
the Citizens United case,

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.203
which has so corrupted
our political culture.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.330
There is and always has
been a kind of groundswell

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.100
of people who are calling for
constitutional amendments,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.630
something like 10,000 proposals
introduced in Congress

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.450
since the founding of the Republic.

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:40.050
Obviously, only a small handful

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.620
of these have been successful,

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.930
only 15 since the early 1800s,

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.280
and so there's always kind
of a move for amendment.

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.220
Now, the three people on top
might be familiar to you.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.790
You may not all know
the two on the bottom.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:58.350
On the right, appropriately,
is Mark Levin,

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.300
who is otherwise known as The Great One,

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.230
Fox News Commentator.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:05.320
On the left is Harvard
Professor Lawrence Lessig,

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.343
and both of them are united in that

00:09:07.343 --> 00:09:09.620
they are not only calling for
constitutional amendments,

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.810
but calling for a new
way of going about them,

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.530
different from what we've
achieved in our past history.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.070
Many of you may be familiar with

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.410
Article V of the US Constitution,

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:22.910
and from your high school civics days,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.193
remember that it takes 2/3
of both houses of Congress,

00:09:26.193 --> 00:09:30.200
and 3/4 of the states to pass
a constitutional amendment.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.660
There is, however, another
provision in Article V,

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.590
which allows the calling of
a constitutional convention.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:43.270
That is, if 2/3 of the
states, state legislatures,

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.890
call for a constitutional convention,

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.543
we can engage in rewriting
the Constitution.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.620
Indeed, earlier this year,

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:54.750
Michigan become the 34th state legislature

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.000
to call for a new
constitutional convention,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.700
and they sent this to John Boehner.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.300
Turns out that some of the earlier states

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:04.120
have since retracted their proposal,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.610
so at this moment there
aren't 2/3 of active calls,

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:09.370
although on one interpretation,

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:12.220
and this has been pushed by
some, including Mark Levin,

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.330
it's good enough, and that we should have

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.430
a constitutional convention.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:20.000
Imagine if we did, what kinds
of issues would we talk about?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.450
What I would like to do today is actually

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:24.380
engage in a thought experiment.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:25.850
It may or may not be realistic

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:28.400
to think that we will get a
constitutional convention.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.530
It's certainly unrealistic to think

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:33.700
that if we did, the framers
could be reincarnated

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.600
and come back and participate in it,

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.790
but that's what I want to propose

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.770
as a way of thinking about it.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:41.790
Suppose we had a
constitutional convention,

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.550
and that the framers were
confronted with the question

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.830
of what exactly we might do.

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:48.160
What should we do?

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.580
How should we go about writing

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:53.180
a Constitution of the
United States in 2014,

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.883
as opposed to 1787?

00:10:55.795 --> 00:10:58.540
I submit that the way they
would approach the problem

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:00.040
is exactly the way the approached

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.283
the problem back then, and that is,

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.443
to summarize, empirically.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.370
The framers were, of
course, living in a time

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.620
when there was no precedent
for a written constitution,

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.900
but they were well-versed and well-read

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.540
in literature dating back
to the ancient Greeks.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.800
They had read philosophy,
they had read history.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.700
Indeed, it may have
been the last generation

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.020
that had read literally everything

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.510
that there was to be read

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:31.270
in the language which they worked in,

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.380
and the way they approached these things,

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:34.550
when confronted with the problem

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.700
of real world institutional design,

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.690
was to look at what had happened before,

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.030
so in the spring of 1787,

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.730
as he prepared for the
constitutional convention,

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:47.160
James Madison plunged
into a thorough study

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.180
of historical confederacies,
ancient and modern,

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.750
from the ancient Greek,
to what he called modern,

00:11:52.750 --> 00:11:56.630
the Dutch Republic and the
German Federation of the time,

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:59.010
and engaged in a kind of inquiry,

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:00.750
an empirical and comparative inquiry,

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.429
to understand what it was that had worked

00:12:03.429 --> 00:12:05.179
and had not worked.

00:12:05.179 --> 00:12:08.090
His inquiry was
comprehensive but schematic.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.410
He focused just on six cases,

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.560
and for each one of these,

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.540
he looked at the allocation of power

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.530
between the center and
the sub-governments.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:20.180
He looked at various
rules of representation

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.140
that worked in these confederations,

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:26.340
and he considered, in his
language, the virtues and vices,

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.360
we would call them costs and benefits,

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.920
of the various approaches
to federal system design.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.165
This really informed his approach

00:12:33.165 --> 00:12:36.420
to the constitutional convention,

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:38.500
and informed in many
ways the Virginia Plan,

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:40.100
the famous Virginia Plan,

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.800
because Madison concluded
from this historical study

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.690
that the weaknesses of the
Articles of Confederation,

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.430
that the weaknesses of earlier
federations, had all lain

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.980
in having a central
government that was too weak,

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:53.370
and subunits that were too strong,

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:54.913
so he came in thinking

00:12:54.913 --> 00:12:57.150
that there would have
to be a strong center,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.920
and this indeed made
sense when you consider

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.130
the weaknesses of the
Articles of Confederation

00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.773
under which they had
been living at that time.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.900
The point is that the
founders thought their task

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.400
was trying to reason their
way to good institutions,

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.090
in a fragile world where
republican government was a rarity,

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:20.130
where republics, in all
previous instances, had failed,

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:23.363
and they recognized in doing so

00:13:23.363 --> 00:13:26.230
that there was something to
learn from past experience,

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:29.160
and so they engaged in Madison's famous

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.820
Notes on Ancient and Modern Confederacies,

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.320
an empirical and comparative study,

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.470
and that's exactly what
I want to do today.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:41.120
I'm informed here by
some work I've been doing

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.100
for that last several years

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:44.300
in something called the
Comparative Constitutions Project.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.020
We have a website you can go to,

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.020
which is an effort to try to collect

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.050
the texts of all constitutions

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.020
written for independent nation states

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.743
since 1789, since the
founding of the United States.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.053
This is pretty easy exercise in the sense

00:14:00.053 --> 00:14:02.040
of identifying the documents.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.120
For most countries nowadays,

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.990
there is a single written
document called a constitution.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.330
There's a few outlier cases.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:12.630
Saudi Arabia, for example,
has no written constitution

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.480
under the theory that the Holy
Koran is the constitution.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:17.730
Britain, of course, famously,

00:14:17.730 --> 00:14:20.170
doesn't have a codified constitution,

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:22.860
so in looking at documents,
we usually will look at

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.540
the document called a constitution.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.330
If there is no such thing,
we'll look at a bill of rights

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:30.150
or a statute that sets up
a branch of government.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:32.270
Fortunately, for most
countries, its fairly easy

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:34.810
to identify what the constitution is,

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:36.560
and one of the things we've
discovered in this project,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.080
which as taken much
longer than we had hoped,

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.200
is that there are a lot
more constitutions out there

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.750
than we had imagined when we started.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.330
That's because, of course,
most constitutions do not last.

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.950
As I reported in a book written in 2010,

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.390
the average lifespan,
the predicted lifespan

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.290
of a national constitution,
for all countries since 1789,

00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:58.763
is only 19 years.

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.250
It makes the American experiment seem

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:03.320
all the more exceptional,

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.210
and it also suggests that
there's something at stake

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.340
in thinking about constitutional design,

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:10.120
something normative, something--

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.410
It'd be very useful, in other words,

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:14.580
to be able to try to identify
principles that were good

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.540
and principles that were bad,

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.540
things that work, and things that don't.

00:15:20.330 --> 00:15:23.560
This slide shows the spread of the idea

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.720
of the written constitution over time.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.880
You might think about it as

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:30.060
a kind of technology of governance, right?

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.270
Not all governments in
all times of human history

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.520
have had written constitutions.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.770
It's really an invention
of the American framers,

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:40.130
and this is certainly one of
their most influential ideas,

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:42.430
the idea that we ought to codify

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.630
all our core principles, our core values,

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:46.290
and our core structures of government

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:48.100
into a single written document.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.690
That's been an enormously
successful project.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.890
The top line on this chart, this figure,

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:55.720
shows the number of
countries in the world,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:57.890
on the left axis there,

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:01.320
roughly quadrupling since 1789,

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.290
as empires have broken up.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.310
The dashed line just below it

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:06.460
shows the number of countries

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.100
which have a written constitution,

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.110
a discrete written constitution,

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.350
and the interesting thing here is that

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.660
those two lines converge over time,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.640
so that sometime early
in the 20th century,

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.890
it becomes the norm that when
you set up your new state,

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.240
the first thing you do
is draft a constitution.

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:26.000
The vertical lines show the number

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.800
that are written in any given year,

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.410
and one can see here that
it's a common phenomenon,

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:35.120
typcially following great
crises in world affairs,

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.860
the Springtime of Nations,

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:38.900
the end of World War I, World War II,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.570
the Cold War, there are episodes

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:42.593
in which constitutions are written.

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:45.290
The question which I really have is,

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.020
someone who is writing
a constitution today,

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.500
what is there to be learned
from this experience?

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.470
What would the framers do
if they were starting over?

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:54.830
Let me say quite clearly

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.143
what I'm not going to do in the lecture.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.550
I'm not going to ask the question

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:01.510
about whether anyone has learned from us

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.240
or whether we've
influenced other countries.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.950
Periodically, in the legal and
political science literature,

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:10.120
you'll see projects
focused on the influence

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:12.320
of the United States Constitution abroad.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.640
There was a lot of this
around the bicentennial.

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.530
Recently, there have been some reports

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:18.550
about how we're losing influence

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.560
in our current mood of
great national decline.

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:23.390
I'm not interested in that,

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:24.920
though it is to some degree relevant,

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.750
and I may mention some facts about it,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.633
but I neither want to be
celebratory or somber about it.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.830
I don't want to focus on
who's learned from us.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.750
I also don't really want
to get into the question

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.090
of what we should change in this country.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:41.930
We can talk about that
in questions and answers

00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:43.220
if you're interested in,

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:45.620
but there's also a small literature on

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:49.017
a calling for changing
the American constitution,

00:17:49.017 --> 00:17:50.960
and particular institutions.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.195
There was even a book a few years ago

00:17:52.195 --> 00:17:56.044
on competing authors
offering their proposal

00:17:56.044 --> 00:17:57.112
for what was the stupidest

00:17:57.112 --> 00:18:00.140
provision of the Constitution.
(audience laughs)

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.050
Answers ranged from the Electoral College,

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.740
to equal representation in the Senate,

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:06.910
to the rule in the 7th Amendment

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:11.140
that you get a civil jury
trial for all suits over $20.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:12.333
Note to constitution makers:

00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:14.483
there's such a thing as inflation.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:19.870
Again, I don't want to ask
exactly what we should change.

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:22.400
The point is, I want ask what it is

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.970
in terms of design principles
that the framers had,

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:27.860
so some of the things
that they came up with,

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:29.649
the Electoral College is a good example,

00:18:29.649 --> 00:18:33.940
were not well-reasoned,
based in a kind of theory

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:35.040
of institutional design.

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.830
They were political compromises,

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.430
and it's not surprising that there are

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.730
many critics of those kind of things.

00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:43.470
On the other hand, the
framers had very deep ideas

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.261
about human nature, about
the structures of societies,

00:18:47.261 --> 00:18:49.720
and the nature of republics,

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.713
and it's that in which they were,

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.600
I think they left their best work for.

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.210
Those are the questions
on which they thought

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.360
they were providing universal answers,

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.830
and so that's what I
would like to focus on.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:03.650
I'm going to focus on
three topics in particular.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.020
I think there are many more I could take,

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:08.800
but I'm gonna focus on war,

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.870
power, and change of the constitution.

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:12.970
Let me start with war.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.410
If you think back to 1787,
war was, and war power,

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.420
weighed very heavily on
the minds of the framers.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.993
The nascent republic was in big trouble.

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:31.970
The Continental Congress,

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.550
which had been created by the
Articles of Confederation,

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.520
lacked the power to tax.

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.140
It had the power to make treaties,

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.250
but it didn't have the
power to implement them,

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:42.330
and so it made a peace
treaty with Great Britain,

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.640
which the states were then reneging on.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.620
The British weren't happy about this.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:49.110
They refused to dismantle
their forts up in Canada,

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:51.050
and there were border
skirmishes happening,

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.390
so they felt a great
threat from the British.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.780
To the south, the Spanish had
closed the Mississippi River.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.600
To the west, there were
various Indian tribes,

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.860
and the situation was
one which really provoked

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.610
the federal convention in the first place.

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:07.613
They were so worried about security.

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.540
What were their questions about war?

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.120
Well, they of course come, we know,

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.530
to the idea that Congress

00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:19.950
should have the power to declare war.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.960
Heavily influenced by Machiavelli,

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.750
they thought that an
unrestrained executive

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.040
would seek aggrandizement

00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:28.610
through foreign policy
and foreign adventures,

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.290
and so very early on in
the federal convention,

00:20:31.290 --> 00:20:34.480
they thought that the
power to engage in war

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.883
should be with Congress.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:40.390
As the discussion went on,
Madison and Elbridge Gerry

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:42.910
proposed that the word
"declare" be substituted

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.430
instead of "making war,"

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.050
so the initial idea was that Congress

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.800
should have the power to make war.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.050
Didn't really know what that was,

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.030
and so somewhat on a whim,
they said "declare war."

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:55.060
Their idea was the if
Congress could declare war,

00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.160
Congress would involved

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.750
in all major foreign policy decisions,

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:01.550
whereas in a defensive
war, or some situation

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:04.210
where there was a need
for speedy response,

00:21:04.210 --> 00:21:06.150
the executive would be
able to act immediately

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.640
without being hamstrung,

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.750
so they were seeking in some sense

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:13.003
to balance the war power between
Congress and the president.

00:21:15.452 --> 00:21:17.820
They didn't talk much about it,
but of course they also said

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.520
that the President would
be Commander in Chief,

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.036
and one of the great constitutional
questions of our time

00:21:22.036 --> 00:21:24.415
is what exactly the extent of that power

00:21:24.415 --> 00:21:25.850
is for the president.

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:29.050
Under the Bush administration
was a very expansive view,

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:30.940
such that under the theory of

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:32.280
the executive branch at that time,

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:35.983
Congress couldn't pass
law about how to wage war,

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:38.300
and of course, others say,

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.303
well Congress really
has the residual power,

00:21:39.303 --> 00:21:42.380
so there's a big internal
debate in the United States

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.883
about the residual power.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.564
John Jay, one of the early Federalists

00:21:49.564 --> 00:21:52.010
argued that the scheme
that they came up with,

00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:54.920
with Congress involved in declaring war,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.317
would mean that there would be less war.

00:21:57.317 --> 00:21:58.967
"Not only fewer just causes of war

00:21:58.967 --> 00:22:00.447
"will be given by the national government,

00:22:00.447 --> 00:22:02.117
"but it will also be in their power

00:22:02.117 --> 00:22:04.317
"to accommodate and settle them amicably."

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.870
It's a position that, in some sense,

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.800
anticipates a lot of international
relations scholarship,

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.600
as I'll come to in a minute.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.710
We also have live constitutional questions

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:16.280
about the division of power between

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.050
the executive and the president.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:20.300
As many of you may know,
we haven't actually had

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:22.440
a declared war since World War II,

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:24.870
and only four in American history,

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:27.128
and so there's a fear in our modern era

00:22:27.128 --> 00:22:28.770
of executive aggrandizement,

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.483
exactly what the framers
thought might occur.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.010
Will Congress ever act?

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.420
Well, they've passed the War Powers Act,

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.160
and the presidents have always asserted

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.020
that that's unconstitutional,

00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.090
yet sometimes the presidents do act

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.230
in accordance with the War Powers Act,

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:47.400
not withstanding their view
that they don't have to.

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.960
In my opinion, assigning the war power,

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.450
the power to declare war to Congress

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.523
has had some restraining
effect on the president.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.110
We can observe this in
some of the skirmishes

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:02.180
that have happened since the
passage of the War Powers Act,

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.030
but generally speaking,
Congress doesn't want

00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:05.580
to get involved in war decisions.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:08.850
Why? Well, because they can only lose.

00:23:08.850 --> 00:23:10.310
Political science literature suggests

00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:13.693
that successful wars get
attributed to the President.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.680
Even if Congress goes along with it,

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:19.550
they won't get much
political credit out of it.

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:20.990
Far better, if you're a congressman,

00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:22.610
to just let the president take the lead

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.520
as Congress is doing
now with Obama in Syria.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.330
If it works well, they can
take some of the credit,

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:30.670
but probably won't be assigned much.

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:33.220
If it fails, they can blame Obama,

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.433
as I'm sure they will if it goes badly.

00:23:36.284 --> 00:23:39.440
The idea is that Congress
lacks the political incentives

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.340
to actually exercise the power

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:43.830
they're given in the Constitution.

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:45.050
I want to tie this to

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.970
the international relations literature,

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.630
particularly the idea of Jay,

00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:50.980
that having Congress involved
would lead to fewer wars,

00:23:50.980 --> 00:23:52.313
and more settlement.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:54.800
The democratic peace literature,

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.270
for those who aren't academics,

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.290
is one of the few things
in which we can say

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:01.400
there's something like
a law of social science,

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.750
and the finding is that democracies

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.760
don't go to war with each other.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.720
Pretty much a universal historical truth.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.680
There's a lot of debate as to why,

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.133
but it is a pretty strong finding.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.190
It's not to say that
democracies are more peaceful.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:18.060
They fight a lot with other countries,

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.800
and when they do go to
war, they tend to win,

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.900
and so there's a lot of
empirical regularities there

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.183
that need to be explained.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:27.960
Some of the literature suggests

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.920
that the advantages of democracy

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.560
might flow, in my view,

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.043
from the involvement of the legislature.

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.250
To begin with, consider
the normal conflict.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.560
Let's take Obama in Syria,
last year, when he was--

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.080
or two years ago, I guess,
when he was first proposing

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.883
to Congress to get permission
to go to war in Syria.

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.210
Obama and Assad are engaged in

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.600
a kind of strategic calculation,

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.500
where each is trying to
understand the other's intentions.

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:00.230
If Assad doesn't believe Obama,

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:01.970
then he's gonna continue
to do what he's doing.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.590
If he does believe Obama,
he's going to maybe back down

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.710
to avoid being hit by the United States,

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:09.513
which is a stronger party.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.710
The role of Congress in this
kind of bargaining game,

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.600
I think is at least twofold.

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.500
First of all, Congress
can prevent the president

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.310
from getting to bad or
unpopular conflicts.

00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:23.350
They can screen; they can stop us

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:25.860
from getting into wars that
we aren't going to win.

00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:27.430
That might explain why democracies

00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:28.883
win the wars they get into.

00:25:30.490 --> 00:25:32.270
In addition, in the bargaining game,

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:35.760
in my example with Assad,
they add information.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.657
If Obama went to Congress,
and Congress said,

00:25:37.657 --> 00:25:39.340
"Yes, we want you to go,"

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.300
there's one thing Assad can be sure of,

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.810
that Obama is about to attack, right?

00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:46.770
Having done that, it's
very hard politically

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:48.350
for Obama to back down.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.050
It's very hard for the
Congress to back down,

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:54.330
having approved a foreign war.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:57.340
Having legislators involved
might allow better signaling,

00:25:57.340 --> 00:26:00.660
better sending of signals
in the international plane,

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:03.530
might even allow better
aggregation of information

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.580
in the United States.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:08.240
Legislatures might help
democracies to win war,

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.500
and that might be part of the secret

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.793
of the democratic peace.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.450
How have other countries
written their constitutions?

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:21.790
Well, this shows over time,

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:23.930
in the dashed line, the executive,

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.440
and the red line, the legislature,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.580
who has the power to declare
war in national constitutions,

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:30.660
and you can see that the
United States approach

00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.170
of giving the legislature
the power to declare war

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.620
has not been very popular,
although to some degree

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.270
the whole question is interesting,

00:26:38.270 --> 00:26:39.960
and we can come back to this in questions,

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.410
if anyone's interested,

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:42.800
because declaring war doesn't even have

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.580
any meaning, really, anymore;
no one declares wars anymore,

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.050
yet constitution makers
continue to assign the power,

00:26:49.050 --> 00:26:50.350
so there seems to be a trend away

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.360
from the American approach.

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.370
On the other hand, if we
consider war power more broadly,

00:26:55.370 --> 00:26:59.970
not just declaring war,
but giving Congress

00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:01.870
some sort of approval authority over,

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:04.450
let's say, the actions
of Commander in Chief,

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.170
we find a much broader set of countries

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:08.743
have legislative involvement.

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.980
This is something like 70% of countries

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.640
have some legislative involvement.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.170
Excuse me, some 50% of countries

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:20.880
have some legislative
involvement in war policy,

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.263
and that seems to be pretty significant.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:29.623
What I do in this part of the
paper is to look at the data.

00:27:30.734 --> 00:27:32.710
I have an advantage here that there's

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:35.980
a huge scholarly community
studying the democratic peace,

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.870
and they have data that aggregates

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:43.190
every international conflict,
actually since about 1800,

00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:44.850
and they look at crisis bargaining,

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.290
they look at sort of
threats to other countries,

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.270
but they actually look at instances

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:51.760
that actually erupt in force,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.070
and they have different sort of levels

00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:54.520
of violence, if you will.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.090
They define a war as a conflict

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.110
that involves more than
1,000 battle deaths,

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:03.440
and so, what I want to
do, is I want to compare

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.900
the constitutional assignment of powers

00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:09.860
with these wars that have been
looked at by other scholars,

00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.730
and the question, of course
is whether you have--

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:14.250
If you have congressional involvement,

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:17.173
legislative involvement,
does it lead to less war?

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.490
Now, this other literature uses

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:23.160
what I refer to here as dyadic setup.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:26.260
Basically, for any
particular pair of countries,

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:29.680
it asks, in a given
year, if they go to war.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.500
Each country is either
and initiator or a target,

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.670
so there's a state a, state b,

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:38.010
and so there's this
massive amount of data.

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:39.900
What I do in the results
I'm about to report,

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.841
is I look at the relationship between

00:28:41.841 --> 00:28:44.340
constitutional power and war,

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.020
and I control for a few things.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.180
I control for whether or not

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.400
one state is more powerful than another.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.260
That's gonna lead, if you think about

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:57.510
the United States might be
more likely to invade Grenada

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:00.063
than it would France, for example,

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.080
so relative capability
as a predictor of war.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:06.230
I also look at whether both
countries are democratic,

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:07.760
and also whether they share a border,

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.089
because borders are the source

00:29:09.089 --> 00:29:11.033
of most international conflicts.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.703
In looking at this data, I'm
just gonna report this to you,

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.560
what these figures mean,
the sign, minus or plus

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.920
indicates whether you're
gonna get more or less war

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:26.170
with the condition that I'm looking at,

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:27.740
and the asterisks indicate

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.803
levels of statistical significance.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.850
Just to summarize, every single one

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:34.350
of these signs is negative,

00:29:34.350 --> 00:29:37.943
so if you have legislative
involvement, the first four rows,

00:29:38.927 --> 00:29:42.837
you are less likely to
get use of force or a war,

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.710
and the statistically significant ones

00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:48.740
have to do with the approval
of commander action, et cetera,

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.530
the ones with more asterisks.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.130
It's also interesting that silence,

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:55.550
constitutions that are
totally silent on the question

00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:57.150
actually lead to less war.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:29:59.420
That's an interesting finding.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.120
So far, it seems like
the framers were right.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.660
They said, if you involve the legislature,

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.160
you're gonna get less war,

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.020
and so maybe we ought
to suggest that in our

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.810
fictitious constitutional
convention we've called

00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:13.660
that we would keep the rule as it is.

00:30:14.610 --> 00:30:16.030
There's a problem, though,

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:17.870
and this is what happens
when you look at data.

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:20.440
I look not just at selection of wars,

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:23.490
but what happens in the
wars that you get into?

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.100
Again, there's kind of this international

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.200
bargaining process that leads to war,

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.830
and sometimes there will be settlement,

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.270
sometimes you'll
miscalculate, if you will,

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.220
and we'll get all the way

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.550
to violent and destructive conflict,

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:38.560
and what the findings suggest is that--

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.300
I'm looking here at outcomes.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:42.510
Are you more likely to win or lose

00:30:42.510 --> 00:30:46.120
if you have a legislative involvement?

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.680
Interestingly, what we find is that

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:52.240
legislative involvement in the initiator

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.440
always leads to less win,

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.680
and also leads to less win
on the part of the target.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.550
It seems to confuse, or confound,
that bargaining process.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:04.930
On the other hand, legislative
involvement in either state

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.000
leads to more stalemate.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.850
Why might that be?

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:11.500
Well, one theory is that
what's going on here

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:12.780
is something like what we would call

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.760
the selection of disputes for litigation,

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.830
that if you think about it
in models of litigation,

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:23.830
two parties always settle
unless they're really stubborn

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:26.110
or they have different
levels of information,

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.473
or it's really, really, really close case,

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.810
because litigation's always costly.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.710
It's always a dead weight loss,
to use the economist term.

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.710
What we find is that, probably
war is a lot like litigation.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.380
You're probably, when you
have legislative involvement

00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:45.490
in screening wars, one side or the other

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:47.520
is settling most of the cases,

00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:50.020
and the cases you get are the ones

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.043
where it's a really close case.

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:55.500
Furthermore, once you get into war,

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.570
and I think the United States,

00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:59.833
say in 2004, 2005, is a good example.

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:03.910
A legislature which is
committed to going to war

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:05.800
is gonna have exactly the same problems

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.520
as a president might in
terms of backing off.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.870
Congress isn't going to admit

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:11.940
that the Iraq war is a bad idea,

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:15.140
because they're all gonna
lose their seats, right?

00:32:15.140 --> 00:32:16.660
One of the problems of democracy

00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:18.900
and legislative involvement
in particular may be

00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:21.403
that you stick with bad wars for too long.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:23.780
Where does this leave us in terms

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.610
of the constitutional convention?

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.630
I'm not sure.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:28.120
It's kind of mixed result.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.390
The framers were right,
that you get less war.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:32.040
They didn't really think about--

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.900
I mean, their view was that

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.850
you would win the wars you got into,

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:37.370
but there doesn't seem to be
very strong evidence for that.

00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:38.620
It's a possibility.

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:41.310
I think you'd have to
probably look at the scale

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.840
of these wars that you
end up getting into.

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:43.673
If they're really minor things,

00:32:43.673 --> 00:32:46.940
and they end up being a
stalemate, no big deal.

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:49.900
If they're really major,
then probably there might

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.230
be some problem with too much commitment

00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:53.780
on the part of the legislature.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.530
Second part of the talk:

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:01.900
The framers thought a lot about power.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.900
They were very concerned with dividing it.

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:09.510
They were very concerned
with trying to find ways

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:11.940
to pit interest against interest

00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.403
in order to ensure liberty.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.180
When one thinks about the central issues,

00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:18.640
they thought a lot about diversity,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.410
how to deal with a diverse
political community,

00:33:21.410 --> 00:33:23.140
and they thought a lot
about the executive.

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.450
If you go back and you read the accounts

00:33:25.450 --> 00:33:26.690
of the constitutional convention,

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.950
they talk a lot about executive power.

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:30.430
Until two weeks before the end

00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:32.692
of the constitutional convention,

00:33:32.692 --> 00:33:36.100
the plan was for Congress
to pick the president,

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.660
which would make us kind
of a parliamentary system,

00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:41.930
and the reason this broke down, actually,

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.910
is that the so-called Great Compromise,

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:47.330
where the large states
and the small states

00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:50.530
came to the design of our modern Congress,

00:33:50.530 --> 00:33:51.990
that is a House of Representatives

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:53.970
with proportional representation,

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.440
and a Senate in which the states

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.640
would be represented qua senate,

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.590
and so the problem is
if this bicameral body

00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:02.870
was to elect the president,
how would it work?

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:04.630
Would they all sit together?

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:08.720
Well that would obviously
privilege the populous states.

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:11.760
On the other had, if you
had one vote per state,

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.630
that would make the
smaller states stronger,

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:15.190
and they couldn't agree,

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.910
so they gave it to a special committee,

00:34:16.910 --> 00:34:19.180
which ended up scrapping
the thing entirely,

00:34:19.180 --> 00:34:20.978
and coming up with that
wonderful institution

00:34:20.978 --> 00:34:23.500
which we all know as
the Electoral College.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:27.340
It was, as they admitted right
away, a political compromise,

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.270
and one which they realized
was very complicated,

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:32.030
and it's always on the top of the list

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:35.530
when people make suggestions for things

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:40.203
we would get rid of in the
current American constitution.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:44.400
They debated, once they
decided that the executive

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.620
would be elected in this way.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:49.360
They still debated how long
the president should serve,

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.001
whether it would be plural or singular,

00:34:52.001 --> 00:34:55.770
and to some degree, these
questions are still with us today.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:58.930
We have the large debate
on the unitary president.

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:01.920
I don't think that the
founders anticipated

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.640
the modern plebiscitary presidency,

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.060
where we vote for one person,

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:10.710
and that person is supposed to do it all.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:15.023
We blame him or her for
every wrong that occurs.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:18.840
It's pretty odd, when you think about it,

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.860
the idea that one person ought to be able

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:23.710
to do everything that is required.

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:25.380
Many political systems don't do that.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.700
Many of the Indian tribes where I live,

00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:31.250
in my part of the country,
would have two different chiefs,

00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:33.723
a chief for war and a chief for peace.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.400
Pirate ships, which were kind of

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.460
floating governments in their own way,

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.240
would often have a captain for war

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.720
and a captain for navigation,

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.130
and yet somehow we think
we can have one person

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:47.360
who can do literally everything.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.373
It's not true at our state
and local level governments.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:52.740
When we go to vote next week,

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:54.170
we're all gonna vote for--

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:55.300
Well, it depends; I'm not sure

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:58.190
if the governor is up in California,

00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:00.790
but we vote for multiple offices.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:02.540
We have divided executive.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:03.900
We vote for Attorney General,

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.683
we vote for Secretary of State.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:08.280
At the local level, I'm sure you're all

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.770
paying close attention to the cliffhanger

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:11.961
which is the Alameda
County Coroner's race.

00:36:11.961 --> 00:36:14.310
(audience laughs)

00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:16.490
We vote for all kinds of officials,

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:19.120
on the idea that there's specialization.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.700
When it comes to the national
government, we don't do that,

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.560
and that seems like something
we might think about,

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.030
whether that's really the right way to go.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:29.330
Now, there's a large
debate in political science

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:30.710
on these forms of government

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:34.170
known as presidentialism
and parliamentarism,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:37.160
as well a new form called
semi-presidentialism,

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.160
and there's really enormous literature

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.170
on the merits of these things.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:45.950
I'm going to suggest that maybe
the plebiscitary presidency

00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:47.420
is not such a good idea,

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.663
although the literature's pretty confused.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.360
This just shows the trends.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.000
The top line at the beginning

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000
is presidentialism, the darkest line,

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.790
and you see the number
of political systems

00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:00.970
that have a presidential system.

00:37:00.970 --> 00:37:01.803
The middle line is parliamentarism,

00:37:01.803 --> 00:37:05.060
and you can that that,
sometime around 1960,

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.280
surpassed presidentialism as

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.570
the most popular form of government.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:12.580
Finally, really booming
since the end of the Cold War

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.520
is what's called the French model

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.480
of semi-presidential system,

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:20.140
in which, which is characterized
I think, by two executives,

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.940
by a president who's directly elected,

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.350
sitting with a head of government,

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:26.040
who is responsible to the parliament,

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:28.196
and some people say you choose that

00:37:28.196 --> 00:37:31.310
because you think you can
get the best of both worlds.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:32.610
Sometimes countries choose it

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.530
because they've got a
divided political system.

00:37:34.530 --> 00:37:36.520
They want to give something to each side,

00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:39.060
but it's become the default model.

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.970
The plurality of political systems today

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:44.083
have a semi-presidential system.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:52.250
Whether or not it's a good
thing is hard to assess,

00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:54.530
but I think it is safe to say

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:58.093
that pure presidentialism
is on the decline.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.890
Again, you think about,
"Can one man do it all?"

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:04.190
What's the advantage of
having one man do it all?

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.690
Accountability; we get
to vote every four years,

00:38:06.690 --> 00:38:09.470
and blame one person for the sum

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:12.920
of all our benefits and
costs during the period.

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.062
On the other hand, there's a real risk

00:38:14.062 --> 00:38:16.620
of cognitive and other overload

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:19.203
by having it all
concentrated in one person.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:23.030
The literature on
presidentialism is very critical.

00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:27.000
It suggests that in many
countries, having a single person

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:30.130
is going to be very, very
divisive and damaging.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:33.400
Imagine an ethnically diverse
society, like say Kenya,

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:35.360
which is a presidential system.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.313
In Kenya,

00:38:39.140 --> 00:38:42.400
the presidency becomes a
winner take all institution,

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.550
and whoever wins feels
a need to give patronage

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.010
to his particular tribe or group,

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:49.643
shutting out the other sides.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:53.650
With the title of a
well-known book on Kenya,

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.830
when there was a switch in parties

00:38:55.830 --> 00:38:58.650
early in the 2000s,

00:38:58.650 --> 00:38:59.527
the new attitude was,

00:38:59.527 --> 00:39:02.910
"It's our turn to eat at
the trough of the state,"

00:39:02.910 --> 00:39:04.610
and this means, of course,
that the other side

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:07.380
is shut out from representation.

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.430
That's certainly a risk of presidentialism

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.380
in a diverse country like ours.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:13.423
We haven't suffered it, but still.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:16.750
Another risk of presidentialism
is the opposite,

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.700
and that's the gridlock problem.

00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:23.370
Because presidential
systems inherently create

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:26.740
a division of power between the
congress and the presidency,

00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:28.840
as in Madison's design, you have

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.030
in many, many cases, total gridlock.

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:34.450
I'm not saying this is gonna
happen in the United States,

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.138
but one can see in the
current political mood

00:39:36.138 --> 00:39:39.990
how in a system of less
robust institutions,

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:42.410
there might be a desire
for some kind of savior

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:44.020
to cut through the gridlock,

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:46.420
and you would have democratic breakdown.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.560
It's happened in many, many countries.

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.888
Indeed, the comparative
politics literature suggests

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:53.590
that a democratic breakdown is associated

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.143
with presidential systems.

00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:00.340
The most recent studies say that it's not

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.810
the fault of presidentialism,

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:03.470
it's the fact that unstable countries

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.610
choose this particular
model of government,

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:10.500
but either way, there's certainly
some sort of association,

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:13.920
and so that one sees in
new constitutional projects

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.610
that no countries have
adopted presidentialism

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:18.023
unless they had it already.

00:40:18.910 --> 00:40:21.340
That suggests that in our
constitutional convention,

00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.040
my fictitious constitutional convention,

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:26.583
we might stick with it, but we might not.

00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:29.380
I think that there's some possibility

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:30.743
that even if we did,

00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:34.840
we might think twice about the length

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.203
of the term of the presidency.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:45.723
This was debated very
intensely by the founders.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:47.950
The initial idea was that

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:51.190
it would be seven years,
actually, and non-renewable.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.200
There would be a term limit
in the US Constitution.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.290
They ended up getting rid of that,

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:58.363
and coming to the system that we have.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.530
I'd like to talk just a
minute about term limits.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:08.250
In the debate, George Mason had a theory

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:11.720
that someone in the last term of office,

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.510
right before they would return

00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:15.950
to being among their constituents,

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:18.540
this person would act in
the public interest; why?

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:20.420
They would be thinking about their friends

00:41:20.420 --> 00:41:21.920
and neighbors back home.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:24.093
They would be focused on the public good.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.613
The alternative view is that, of course,

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.530
desire for power would
breed a hunger for it,

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:36.400
and a term limit would
lead someone to stay on,

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.500
going to the second quote here,

00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:40.740
Hamilton said, "As the
object of his ambition,"

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:43.627
that is, the person who's coming
up to the end of his term,

00:41:43.627 --> 00:41:46.127
"would be to prolong his
power, it is probable

00:41:46.127 --> 00:41:48.017
"that in case of a war,
he would avail himself

00:41:48.017 --> 00:41:50.067
"of the emergency to evade or refuse

00:41:50.067 --> 00:41:52.020
"a degradation from his place."

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:56.050
In other words, create a
crisis and stick around,

00:41:56.050 --> 00:41:58.820
and that's again something we
see in many, many countries.

00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.560
Thomas Jefferson thought the failure

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.980
to include term limits
in the US Constitution

00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:05.485
was one of its great errors.

00:42:05.485 --> 00:42:07.147
He said that, "The people have the power

00:42:07.147 --> 00:42:09.127
"of removing him every fourth year,

00:42:09.127 --> 00:42:11.690
"but it's a power which
will not be exercised."

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.440
People will stay in office forever.

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.370
Now, in the United States, we
actually got very lucky here,

00:42:17.370 --> 00:42:18.690
because the Constitution doesn't say

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:19.790
anything about a term limit,

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:22.983
or didn't in the first version,
before the 21st Amendment.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:27.950
What we did have was Washington,

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:29.010
who was the first president,

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:32.760
and he very wisely decided to
step down after a second term.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.350
He didn't want to stay in
office, and this created

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:38.800
a kind of unwritten
constitutional amendment in a way,

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.563
and it was observed for many years.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:43.710
Actually, a very famous instance

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:45.720
regarding this unwritten
constitutional amendment

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.700
came with Teddy Roosevelt.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.120
Teddy Roosevelt had actually
inherited the term of McKinley,

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.060
after McKinley was assassinated,

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:57.020
and so he served in
office for three years,

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:59.620
then ran on his own,
and then stepped down,

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.380
saying, "There's a two term
limit; I can't run again."

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.170
But four years later, he changed his mind,

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:06.430
and decided to run on
the Bull Moose Party,

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.120
and he was up giving a speech one day,

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.339
when someone came along and said,

00:43:10.339 --> 00:43:14.260
a crazy fellow tried to
shoot him on the grounds

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.900
that a man should not be
president three times.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.032
In other words, someone
was trying to enforce

00:43:18.032 --> 00:43:21.440
this unwritten constitutional
norm of the time,

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.600
that there should be a term limit.

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.300
Roosevelt was lucky; he
wrote very long speeches,

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.400
and actually he had a 50-page speech,

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:34.410
which took part of the bullet,
as did his glasses case.

00:43:34.410 --> 00:43:36.250
It actually did penetrate his skin,

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:37.730
and he continued to give the speech,

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:38.563
which I will not do
(audience laughs)

00:43:38.563 --> 00:43:40.940
if one of you decides to shoot me now

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:42.440
to put you out of your misery.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.000
The point is that we were kind of lucky,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.810
and as a matter of constitutional design,

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:50.860
I think most democratic
constitution makers now

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.410
do put in a term limit,

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:55.850
but this leads us to the question of why.

00:43:55.850 --> 00:43:57.220
In some sense, the whole idea of

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:59.760
a fixed term is somewhat odd.

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.720
It means that we the people
can't continue to have,

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.110
let's say, Barack Obama
for another four years,

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:09.930
even if he's popular among
60 or 70% of the country.

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:11.290
On the other hand, it sometimes means

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:13.060
we are stuck with people who have

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:15.373
been proven to be incompetent and lame.

00:44:17.299 --> 00:44:19.650
This is in some sense, maybe the advantage

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:21.296
of the parliamentary
system, and one reason

00:44:21.296 --> 00:44:24.440
why most countries have been choosing it.

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.543
Indeed no country, as I said,
which has not had it before.

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.833
Let's imagine, again, I'll go down here,

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:33.760
what would have happened to
various American presidents

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.790
if let's say, a sustained
period of popularity

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:40.650
at 40% or below would
lead to your easy ouster

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:43.090
in a parliamentary vote.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:46.540
Well, Richard Nixon would
have met that in 1973.

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.160
It's not a great example,
because the system

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.710
did work to get rid of Nixon,

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:52.460
just took a little longer
than it might have otherwise.

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:56.633
Jimmy Carter probably would
have been gone by '79.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:00.470
On the other, and oh, George W. Bush,

00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:04.610
yeah definitely, 2006 or so, we'd be done.

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:06.530
We could have moved on.

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:08.350
On the other hand, the popular presidents

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:11.580
might be able to stay, if
we got rid of term limits

00:45:11.580 --> 00:45:13.550
and moved to a parliamentary
form of government

00:45:13.550 --> 00:45:15.823
where the accountability was constant.

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:19.563
Reagan clearly very popular by the end.

00:45:21.340 --> 00:45:24.070
Bill Clinton, extremely popular,

00:45:24.070 --> 00:45:26.460
and think what a different place we'd be

00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:29.163
if he'd been president
for another year or two.

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:34.430
The point is that this might
be something to look at,

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:36.720
certainly if we were starting afresh.

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.590
I doubt we'd come up with the
precise system that we have.

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:40.730
It seems to be unwieldy.

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:42.590
We have a weird way of
selecting the president

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:45.210
that sometimes leads
to minority presidents

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:48.060
who do not even have 50% of the vote.

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:49.900
We would probably change the way we vote,

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.900
and maybe even the idea of
having terms in the first place,

00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.410
by moving to a parliamentary system

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:56.743
or semi-presidential one.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:01.563
I want to turn now to my
third theme, which is change.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.030
Obviously, as I said before,

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:08.030
this was an important
theme of the founders.

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:11.640
They recognized that their
document was imperfect.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:14.320
They recognized that
change would be required.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:15.897
As Jefferson famously wrote,

00:46:15.897 --> 00:46:17.417
"Some men look at constitutions

00:46:17.417 --> 00:46:19.287
"with sanctimonious reverence,

00:46:19.287 --> 00:46:20.857
"and deem them like the ark of covenant,

00:46:20.857 --> 00:46:22.567
"too sacred to be touched."

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:26.217
Going on, "I know that
laws and institutions

00:46:26.217 --> 00:46:29.017
"must go hand-in-hand with the
progress of the human mind.

00:46:29.017 --> 00:46:30.267
"As that becomes more developed,

00:46:30.267 --> 00:46:32.527
"more enlightened, as
new discoveries are made,

00:46:32.527 --> 00:46:34.797
"new truths disclosed and
manners and opinions change

00:46:34.797 --> 00:46:36.727
"with the change of circumstances,

00:46:36.727 --> 00:46:39.267
"institutions must advance also,

00:46:39.267 --> 00:46:42.460
"and keep pace with the times."

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:45.663
The question is really how
well we've done in this regard.

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.681
Madison, I should say, also had a theory

00:46:49.681 --> 00:46:53.260
that changing the constitution
would be required.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:56.339
In a bit of propaganda,
in Federalist 43, he said,

00:46:56.339 --> 00:46:58.557
"The mode preferred by the convention

00:46:58.557 --> 00:47:00.847
"is stamped with every mark of propriety.

00:47:00.847 --> 00:47:02.737
"It guards against the extreme facility,

00:47:02.737 --> 00:47:04.987
"which would render the
Constitution too mutable,

00:47:04.987 --> 00:47:06.527
"and extreme difficulty,

00:47:06.527 --> 00:47:08.860
"which might perpetuate
its discovered faults."

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.030
It is the Goldilocks Theory, right?

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.523
Not too easy to change,

00:47:14.376 --> 00:47:16.810
not too rigid either,

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:19.210
and this is what they
thought they were getting.

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:25.130
It's hard to know if they got that right.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:27.920
The 10,000 different proposals
I referred to earlier,

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.260
to amend the Constitution,
I'm sure many of them

00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:31.760
were not worth adopting.

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:34.880
Some of them keep coming
up over and over again.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.470
Some of them are about
political grandstanding.

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:39.300
Knowing that constitutional amendment

00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:41.900
is basically impossible,
members of Congress

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:43.623
will propose all kinds of things,

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:46.830
sometimes to overturn
Supreme Court opinions,

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:50.300
sometimes to favor their
pet political causes,

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.290
things like requiring the
Bible to be read in school,

00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:58.020
overturn Roe v. Wade, and
various other changes,

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:02.350
and it may be that if we had
an actual realistic culture

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:04.060
of constitutional amendment,

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.940
we might get better proposals in Congress.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:08.130
The other thing, of course,

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:10.300
the consequence of having a rigid view,

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.350
a rigid system of constitutional amendment

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:15.250
is that our system has survived, in part,

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:19.500
by judicial reinterpretation
of the document,

00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:21.090
leading us all, in some sense,

00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:23.150
to be hostages to Anthony Kennedy,

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:25.940
who is a perfectly nice
guy, but it's hard to say

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:27.530
why he should be making decisions

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:30.260
that affect much of our lives.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:34.190
Now, when scholars look
at the US Constitution,

00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:36.337
in comparative perspective,
one question is,

00:48:36.337 --> 00:48:38.600
"How rigid is it compared to others?"

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:39.890
It's actually a very tricky

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:41.610
social science question to answer,

00:48:41.610 --> 00:48:44.310
for technical reasons I can get into,

00:48:44.310 --> 00:48:46.933
but looking at five different indicators,

00:48:46.933 --> 00:48:49.260
one sees that on cross-national indicators

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.900
of amendment difficulty,
the US Constitution

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.750
seems to be extremely rigid.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:57.000
It's the most rigid under the
first and third and fourth,

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.310
second out of 42 on Lorenz's index.

00:49:00.310 --> 00:49:03.787
On my own index in 2009,

00:49:03.787 --> 00:49:05.950
we rate it almost as hard,

00:49:05.950 --> 00:49:09.173
as the hardest constitution to
amend out of 440 in history.

00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:11.740
It seems to be pretty difficult

00:49:14.120 --> 00:49:18.390
Some say that this
difficulty is exactly why

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:20.670
the Constitution has endured.

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:22.100
It's a common claim.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.530
If we made it more flexible,

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:27.040
then the Constitution would lose its value

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.870
as a kind of sacred document
which we all revere.

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:33.350
It would become a mere

00:49:33.350 --> 00:49:35.900
repository of particular policies,

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.120
that happened to be favored
at particular moments,

00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:40.400
and looking around the world
at other constitutions,

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.780
one sees examples of this.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.980
One sees constitutions that seem to have

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.520
a lot of sort of interest group benefits

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.400
that are written into the
text, very thick documents.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.570
India's is about 145 pages.

00:49:52.570 --> 00:49:55.970
It makes it, in some sense,
almost a different meaning

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:58.660
of what a constitution is supposed to do.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.520
The argument is that
rigidity has helped us.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:03.990
Indeed, our constitution is
the longest lasting ever.

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.910
This is the most enduring constitutions,

00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:09.720
and you see a lot of
Western European countries,

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.410
and yet I think it's pretty
easy to debunk the claim

00:50:12.410 --> 00:50:14.583
that rigidity alone is responsible.

00:50:16.930 --> 00:50:19.600
In this 2010 book, we analogize

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.830
the United States Constitution
to the woman in this picture.

00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:25.340
This woman is a woman
named Jeanne Calment.

00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:28.260
She was the oldest human
being ever recorded,

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:33.223
when she died in 1997, at
the age of 122, in France.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:37.340
They asked her, "What is
your secret to long life?"

00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:42.136
and Jeanne Calmet said, "You
know, I smoked till I was 117."

00:50:42.136 --> 00:50:44.177
(audience laughs)

00:50:44.177 --> 00:50:46.527
"I gave it up then, but it
didn't make me feel any better,

00:50:46.527 --> 00:50:48.027
"so I went back the next year.

00:50:49.267 --> 00:50:54.267
"I drank Port wine by
significant amounts every day,

00:50:55.247 --> 00:50:57.800
"and I ate chocolate and olive oil."

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.920
Now, notwithstanding the
benefits of some of those things,

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.620
I think if that's your exclusive diet,

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.050
you wouldn't be predicted
to live a long time,

00:51:05.050 --> 00:51:06.800
and yet she did.

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.120
This is basically our view

00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.457
of the United States Constitution.

00:51:09.457 --> 00:51:11.920
(audience laughs)

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:13.930
It happened to last a long time,

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:16.220
one of the most long-lasting,

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:19.390
but it probably did so
in spite of that feature,

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:21.200
of being overly rigid, and what we find

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.530
when we look at all countries,

00:51:22.530 --> 00:51:24.440
and we have this kind of predictive model

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.340
of constitutional lifespan,

00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:30.170
is that it is flexibility and not rigidity

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:32.253
that predicts constitutional longevity.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.090
Earlier this year, I was actually in Oslo,

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:38.780
because it's the 200th anniversary

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:41.300
of the Norwegian Constitution,
so they asked me to come

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.610
and give my comparative reflections

00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:47.690
on the Norwegian Constitution,
and I showed this slide,

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:50.070
and then I showed this
slide, which is the world's

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:53.430
oldest yoga teacher,
(audience laughs)

00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:55.150
92 years old,

00:51:55.150 --> 00:51:58.510
and of the Norwegian Constitution of 1814.

00:51:58.510 --> 00:52:00.340
It's an incredibly flexible document.

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:03.450
To change it requires a
2/3 vote in parliament,

00:52:03.450 --> 00:52:05.000
in a single house of parliament,

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.010
with an intervening election,

00:52:07.010 --> 00:52:09.470
so that one group can't manipulate it,

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:11.870
they have to kind of
go back to the people.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.400
It turns out, that's really flexible.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:16.010
It's allowed Norway to adjust its system

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:20.430
over time, from being a pure monarchy

00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:22.610
to a kind of wonderful place

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:23.700
that everyone wants to move to.

00:52:23.700 --> 00:52:25.220
Everyone in Norway's a millionaire.

00:52:25.220 --> 00:52:27.730
That's probably not attributable
to the constitution,

00:52:27.730 --> 00:52:30.380
but certainly the
constitution has endured,

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:33.810
because it's been changed
very often, as Jefferson said,

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:36.270
not treated with sanctimonious reverence,

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:40.930
but updated with the times,
as conditions have changed.

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:43.830
This figure shows the number of provisions

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:47.070
amended in the Norwegian
constitution per year,

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:48.940
from 1800 onward, and
the comparable figure

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.500
for the United States, and
you see that basically,

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.350
constitutional amendment has been taken

00:52:53.350 --> 00:52:56.020
off the table from the early 1800s,

00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:01.020
with a couple of subsequent
periods, when we've added a few.

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.360
Norway, on the other hand, has changed it

00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:07.670
at least three times a
decade since the 1850s,

00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:10.300
and these aren't short term policy things.

00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:13.053
They're small things,
allowing the system to adjust,

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.470
things like expanding the franchise,

00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:18.960
changing the rules of parliament,

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.720
making the political system more viable.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.720
Now, I'm not suggesting
we should be Norway.

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:25.500
That would be too much,
and would surely risk

00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:28.672
physical violence, and also
we don't have that much oil,

00:53:28.672 --> 00:53:30.780
(audience laughs)
but the point is

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:32.340
that there are other ways to do things

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:35.000
that might give us some of the benefits

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.783
that we attribute to our own constitution.

00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:41.190
Think for a moment, if
the founders had adopted,

00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:43.820
let's say the Norwegian rule
for constitutional amendment,

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.190
and not the American rule.

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:47.200
Well, we probably would have had

00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.070
more constitutional amendment,

00:53:49.070 --> 00:53:50.880
but what else would we have had?

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.800
We probably would have had
less emphasis on the courts,

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.730
as a means of governing our lives,

00:53:57.730 --> 00:54:01.180
as a means of pursuing
constitutional amendment.

00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:03.260
In Norway, they have
a court, which has had

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:06.050
the power of judicial review
since the mid-19th century.

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:07.620
They never exercise it.

00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.110
The courts are the courts;
they're good courts,

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:12.300
but they do law.

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:14.603
They don't do policy;
they don't govern us.

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:19.470
They have a vigorous
system of party politics,

00:54:19.470 --> 00:54:20.910
which people are involved in.

00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:23.943
They fight about policy, like
how to spend the oil money,

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.180
but the point is that there really might

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.590
be a very different way of doing things,

00:54:28.590 --> 00:54:30.233
and not necessarily a worse one.

00:54:31.810 --> 00:54:33.260
I actually think it's pretty interesting

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:36.610
to think about what the global
world would have looked like,

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:38.690
what my data would have looked like,

00:54:38.690 --> 00:54:40.450
if the United States had adopted

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:43.340
a more flexible amendment formula.

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:46.510
In my view, the Americans are the source

00:54:46.510 --> 00:54:48.670
of the idea of judicialized governments,

00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:51.930
of the idea where the courts
exercising judicial review

00:54:51.930 --> 00:54:53.280
should be able to get involved

00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.333
in all kinds of areas of public life,

00:54:56.370 --> 00:54:59.560
and if the Americans had not done that,

00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.440
if they had not been forced to, in a way,

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.470
through constitutional amendment,

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:06.283
how different would global
political practice be?

00:55:07.210 --> 00:55:10.760
It is, as well, kind of a speculation.

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:12.120
That's all I can do,

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:14.053
but I to suggest that it does matter.

00:55:16.930 --> 00:55:19.313
You know, I don't want to, in concluding,

00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:24.100
suggest that I don't venerate
the founding fathers.

00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:25.800
Pretty great group of guys.

00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:27.800
They're remembered for
their important and enduring

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:31.605
debates about political theory,
more influential, I think,

00:55:31.605 --> 00:55:35.100
than they would have ever expected.

00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:36.470
Indeed, if they'd been called back

00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:38.910
for my fictitious
constitutional convention,

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:40.270
they'd be stunned to learn that

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.800
their document was still being used.

00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.950
I think they'd be completely
surprised by that.

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:48.090
Their view was the republics
were doomed to decline,

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:50.290
and so I think they've had success,

00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:53.440
in a way, beyond their wildest dreams,

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.930
but it's also true that going back,

00:55:55.930 --> 00:55:59.130
they would, I'm sure,
be amenable to the idea

00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:00.580
that the document ought to be changed,

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:03.330
ought to change with the times.

00:56:03.330 --> 00:56:05.540
Certainly Jefferson, in whose honor

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:07.873
this lecture is named, had that that view.

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:10.010
Our practice has been perhaps

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:12.900
more Madisonian than Jeffersonian,

00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:16.523
but I think there are
certainly some costs to that.

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:20.340
Well, in concluding, I want
to conclude with a quote

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:22.060
from Patrick Henry, which I do think

00:56:22.060 --> 00:56:25.157
is a kind of fitting quote
for a Jefferson Lecture.

00:56:25.157 --> 00:56:27.577
"I have but one lamp by
which my feet are guided,

00:56:27.577 --> 00:56:29.397
"and that is the lamp of experience.

00:56:29.397 --> 00:56:33.460
"I know of no way of judging
the future, but by the past."

00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:36.080
This is what the founders would
do if they came back today.

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.320
They would look back, they
would see what worked,

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.480
and they would come up
with some institutions

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.960
which would serve us,

00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.280
and I think that'd be a wonderful thing,

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.230
if it could somehow happen,
which of course it won't.

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:48.888
I do worry that if we do end up

00:56:48.888 --> 00:56:51.530
calling the constitutional
convention, I don't think

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:54.550
we'll proceed with the wisdom
of the founding fathers.

00:56:54.550 --> 00:56:55.761
Thanks very much.

00:56:55.761 --> 00:56:58.761
(audience applauds)

00:57:11.422 --> 00:57:12.750
- There are many pleasures involved

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:16.290
in being a chairman of the
Jefferson Lectures committee.

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:17.540
One of them is, I have the prerogative

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:19.820
of asking the first question.

00:57:19.820 --> 00:57:22.130
You haven't mentioned
slavery and the Civil War,

00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:25.410
with regard to the American
constitutional design,

00:57:25.410 --> 00:57:27.700
and I had a very hard time
listening to you, Tom,

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:29.710
thinking how Norway
would have handled that.

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:30.680
- Yeah.

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.910
- [Harry] Perhaps you'd speak to that

00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:33.980
most divisive issue of all.

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:34.813
- Right.

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:38.820
Great, well Norway's obviously
not a federal country.

00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:40.088
It's much smaller; it was much poorer

00:57:40.088 --> 00:57:41.280
when it was first founded.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.690
They did have their own versions

00:57:42.690 --> 00:57:46.010
of exclusive and racist behavior.

00:57:46.010 --> 00:57:47.990
The original Norwegian constitution

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:51.240
bans Jesuits and Jews
from entering the country,

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:53.060
and it took a while, I think it took them

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:54.710
three or four decades,
then they allowed Jews in.

00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:58.040
I don't think they allowed
Jesuits in till like 1958,

00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.790
so it took a really long time.

00:57:59.790 --> 00:58:03.340
The whole thrust of their
constitutional trajectory,

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:06.940
as ours, has been towards
greater inclusion,

00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:10.200
and that seems to have

00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.863
been pretty effective.

00:58:13.345 --> 00:58:16.290
I think that in terms of how--

00:58:16.290 --> 00:58:18.933
Your question provokes the thought about,

00:58:20.701 --> 00:58:21.700
would the political system

00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.217
have done better than the judicial system,

00:58:23.217 --> 00:58:24.930
and our own history suggests that.

00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:27.360
Dred Scott is considered a failed case,

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:31.600
a failed judicial attempt
to intervene in a very

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:36.240
difficult political situation,

00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:37.492
so I think I'll stop with that,

00:58:37.492 --> 00:58:39.530
There's no more I can say.
- Okay, thank you.

00:58:39.530 --> 00:58:41.880
- My name is Mike Beller; I'm a lawyer.

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:45.150
I have a question about judicial review,

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:49.290
relating to the rigidity of
the American constitution,

00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:51.890
and its survival.

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:54.321
First, to what extent to do you think

00:58:54.321 --> 00:58:58.330
the institutionalization
of judicial review

00:58:58.330 --> 00:59:01.714
and interpretation of
laws and constitution

00:59:01.714 --> 00:59:05.920
has perpetuated the
survival and the rigidity

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:07.980
of the American and/or the rigidity

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:09.820
of the American Constitution,

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:12.423
and from a broader perspective,

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:17.400
in the spirit that
you've spoken from today,

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.183
is that a good thing?
- Mm-hmm, great.

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:22.710
Well, you know, I think
it's conventional wisdom

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:24.440
that many of the little
things that we'd like

00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:27.080
to change in the Constitution
and we can't, right,

00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:31.030
so they do get worked out in
the course of concrete cases,

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:33.900
and through the exercise
of judicial power.

00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:36.540
Has judicial review extended
the life of the republic?

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:39.070
I mean, I suppose the conventional wisdom,

00:59:39.070 --> 00:59:41.310
it didn't do a very good
job before the Civil War.

00:59:41.310 --> 00:59:43.880
It didn't do a real good
job after the Civil War,

00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.410
when it starts to become
more vigorously entertained.

00:59:46.410 --> 00:59:48.000
It's not really until the 1930s

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.171
that we begin to celebrate
the role of the courts,

00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:53.800
and basically their role is allowing

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:56.483
the government to do
things it wanted to do,

00:59:57.730 --> 00:59:59.950
but I think in the more modern period,

00:59:59.950 --> 01:00:02.010
and Professor Scheiber brought up

01:00:02.010 --> 01:00:03.670
the problem of slavery, and you could say

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:04.741
the problem of civil rights

01:00:04.741 --> 01:00:08.190
in the Warren Court era,
are equivalent things.

01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:10.950
How do you change
entrenched social practice?

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:12.600
There's a large debate in the literature

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.830
on the role of the courts, as good or bad.

01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:17.730
It's one that's been revisited now

01:00:17.730 --> 01:00:19.100
with regard to gay rights,

01:00:19.100 --> 01:00:23.500
and many of the foremost
advocates of social change

01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:25.210
are telling the courts to stay out of it,

01:00:25.210 --> 01:00:28.960
because they can only mess
things up if they get involved,

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.550
so I think it's a really
deep and good question

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:34.340
as to whether they've done more harm

01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:35.683
than good in this country.

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:40.810
I tend to be someone who thinks that,

01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:42.780
like everyone else, I like the courts

01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.760
when they decide the way
I want things decided,

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.480
and I don't like it when they don't,

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.870
and of course that's not

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:52.010
a very good theory of
judicial legitimation.

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:55.290
It's been pretty good for
rights in the post-war era,

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:58.340
and there's a lot of
sort of darker chapters

01:00:58.340 --> 01:01:00.040
in the history of judicial review.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.010
- More questions?

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:08.807
Years ago, I heard a talk by

01:01:08.807 --> 01:01:10.410
the great historian, David Potter.

01:01:10.410 --> 01:01:13.014
He asked a similar
question about federalism,

01:01:13.014 --> 01:01:14.710
because didn't like something I'd written

01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:17.030
about federalism being a great failure,

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:18.427
and he said, "It was a great success.

01:01:18.427 --> 01:01:21.593
"We had a Civil War, but we
didn't have it for 60 years."

01:01:21.593 --> 01:01:23.260
- Yeah.
(Harry and audience laugh)

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.320
- Federalism was responsible for holding

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.490
the nation together for 60 years,

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:29.330
and then it couldn't do it anymore.

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:31.383
Malcolm Feely, Professor Feely.

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:33.983
- Yeah, Malcolm Feely.

01:01:35.523 --> 01:01:39.050
Is the constitution done a good job

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:40.763
of protecting federalism?

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:45.147
- You know, I was thinking
about this question,

01:01:45.147 --> 01:01:47.200
and you know it far better than me,

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.610
but to me, federalism in the United States

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:52.123
has been, I think, a great success story.

01:01:52.123 --> 01:01:55.160
Again, after Civil War, right?

01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:58.180
It's allowed a kind of
adjustment over time,

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.710
from a system which was very much

01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:02.740
leaning towards the subunits,

01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.950
towards one that has, of course,

01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:06.150
become much more centralized,

01:02:06.150 --> 01:02:07.433
and yet it's not centralized all the way.

01:02:07.433 --> 01:02:10.523
There's still sort of a
role for state governments.

01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:15.150
The theoretical challenge of
federalism is the following:

01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:17.360
we ask, "Why do we have government?"

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.390
We have government to
produce certain public goods,

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:23.400
national defense being the paradigm one.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.290
You might say something
like criminal justice,

01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:27.420
or welfare policy, or
things which don't need

01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:29.880
to be produced at the
level of the nation state,

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.603
but can be much more
responsive to local conditions.

01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:36.060
The theoretical question about

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:39.157
the allocation of powers
in a federal system is,

01:02:39.157 --> 01:02:42.499
"At what level are the
public goods best produced?"

01:02:42.499 --> 01:02:45.013
and assign the power to that level.

01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:48.040
I think the success of our system

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:50.030
is that we've allowed
that to change over time.

01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:51.323
It hasn't been rigid.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.460
It's been responsive to the--

01:02:55.460 --> 01:02:57.440
In some cases, surely not all,

01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:01.370
but responsive to the fact
that certain public goods

01:03:01.370 --> 01:03:04.360
are best produced at the
level of the nation state.

01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:06.750
I should say, just as an aside,

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.930
this is of course the challenge
of global governance now,

01:03:08.930 --> 01:03:11.200
that we're living in an area
where certain public goods,

01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.330
and climate change and things like that,

01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:16.170
can't be produced, or can't
be accomplished by a system

01:03:16.170 --> 01:03:18.580
of independent nation states,

01:03:18.580 --> 01:03:23.580
yet we lack the governance
structures to accommodate them,

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.150
but I think within the United States,

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:27.770
it's done a pretty good
job of shifting over time.

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.002
- [Malcolm] Thank you, Tom.

01:03:29.002 --> 01:03:31.160
- As I listened to your account

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:34.140
of the amendments in Norway,

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:38.590
they sounded like items
that our political system

01:03:38.590 --> 01:03:41.050
has handled in many different ways,

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:44.120
and not just the judicial
route that you've talked about,

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.810
but congressionally and in
all sorts of other ways.

01:03:48.810 --> 01:03:52.590
I wonder, are you asking
the right question

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:56.740
by asking about the amendability
of the Constitution,

01:03:56.740 --> 01:03:59.530
or would it be more
productive to ask a question

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:04.530
about more generally,
"How can changes be made?"

01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:06.900
- Good, so you're right that the substance

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.890
of things can be dealt with in many ways.

01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:09.820
Many of the things dealt with

01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:11.070
in the constitution in one country

01:04:11.070 --> 01:04:13.490
can be dealt with through
legislation in another,

01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:15.520
and there's no uniform substance

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.363
to a constitution in that sense.

01:04:18.904 --> 01:04:20.170
You know, the key thing, if you're trying

01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:23.050
to evaluate constitutional
scheme's performance

01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:25.260
on some dimension, like the inclusivity

01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:28.780
of the political process,

01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:31.660
one need not look just to constitutions.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.720
I'm really making just the smaller point,

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.400
which is that flexibility need not

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.200
necessarily doom a constitution;

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.230
that one need not have an overly rigid one

01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:44.640
in order to be maintained
for a long duration,

01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.420
or to generate veneration,

01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:48.330
'cause if you go and you talk
with the people of Norway,

01:04:48.330 --> 01:04:50.020
they're really into their constitution.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.020
They may not know what's in it.

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:54.630
They may not be able to read
the original Danish from 1814,

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:56.900
but they really love it
and they care about it,

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.510
and in some ways that's
not the different from us.

01:04:59.510 --> 01:05:02.320
The Tea Party folks carry around
copies of the Constitution,

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:03.910
but I'm not sure they really

01:05:04.992 --> 01:05:09.293
have read every single clause.
(audience laughs)

01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:12.120
I can't imagine that they venerate

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.460
all bits of the text equally,

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.056
the $20 suits and such.

01:05:16.056 --> 01:05:18.740
(audience member speaks indistinctly)

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:21.470
- [Audience Member] Tom, so let me just

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:23.976
frame a counterfactual for you.

01:05:23.976 --> 01:05:28.160
This presentation is directed
to an American audience,

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.990
and the question is, if we had a moment

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:35.130
of constitutional choice, would
we make a different choice,

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:38.190
if we cared about the evidence.

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:39.180
Let me flip it around.

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:42.110
Let's say that you're actually
in another country right now,

01:05:42.110 --> 01:05:44.320
where there is a moment
of constitutional choice,

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:48.437
and the question becomes, "Is
there any particular feature

01:05:48.437 --> 01:05:51.973
"of the American Constitution
that has stood up,

01:05:52.997 --> 01:05:54.837
"that stands up in the
face of the evidence

01:05:54.837 --> 01:05:58.022
"as being something of particular value

01:05:58.022 --> 01:06:00.090
"that we would want to adopt?"

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:03.220
The slide you put up there,
with the 120-year-old

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.910
French citizen who basically
smoked and drank and so forth,

01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:08.640
that you juxtaposed against
the American document

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:10.460
implied that the American Constitution

01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.430
has no redeeming feature at all.

01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:13.558
That can't be your claim, right?

01:06:13.558 --> 01:06:15.073
- No.
- Or maybe it is.

01:06:16.578 --> 01:06:20.630
Is there some feature of
the American document,

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:23.170
are there features that
have been validated

01:06:23.170 --> 01:06:25.350
by experience over the
last couple of centuries,

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:28.780
that basically, other drafter
should consider strongly.

01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:30.100
- Absolutely.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.090
The first point, of course,

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:33.580
is that by producing the first

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.660
written constitution for a nation state,

01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:37.270
they provided the very grammar

01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:39.285
by which the whole enterprise proceeds,

01:06:39.285 --> 01:06:44.140
and have been extraordinarily
influential because of that,

01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:46.420
in both particular design choices,

01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:49.040
and broader principles,
like checks and balances,

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.940
like separation of powers.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.380
These kind of things, these principles,

01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.617
seem to be ones which do
have maybe universal--

01:06:58.329 --> 01:06:59.890
very widespread popularity

01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:01.960
and widespread attachment to them.

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:03.480
In terms of particular choices,

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.990
it's odd that judicial review is mentioned

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:08.320
nowhere in the United States Constitution,

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.100
and I've been somewhat critical of it,

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:12.380
and yet it is something which I think

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:15.740
we all do recognize
now, in the modern era,

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:20.460
in one of potentially
rights-harming governments,

01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.600
is of great value, and one that's

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.550
a kind of contribution to civilization.

01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:27.790
Of course, courts around the world,

01:07:27.790 --> 01:07:29.740
at least until fairly
recently, until the rise

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:31.910
of the German Constitutional
Court and others

01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:34.480
would look to the American
court as the paragon

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.330
of exercising this important power.

01:07:36.330 --> 01:07:40.640
You do need checks; you do need
accountability institutions,

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:43.260
and the Americans are the
ones who came up with that,

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.500
so I certainly don't want to suggest

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:49.340
that we should avoid all
of Jeanne Calment's diet.

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.680
No doubt, some of those things are good

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:54.239
in certain proportions.
(audience laughs)

01:07:54.239 --> 01:07:57.088
(audience applauds)

01:07:57.088 --> 01:08:00.755
(upbeat instrumental music)
