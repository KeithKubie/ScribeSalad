00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.840
So David,
how did you fill up this table?

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.600
&gt;&gt; So it looks to me like the three
things that we can actually do here

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.850
legally are, we can put D on A, we can
put D on the table or we can put A on D.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.340
So my first option reflects
putting A up on D, and

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.440
the other three things remain the same.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.590
My second option reflects putting D down
on A and the others remain the same.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.518
And my third is to put D on the table
and the others remain the same.

00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:28.324
&gt;&gt; That's good David.
