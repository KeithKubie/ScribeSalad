00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.330
Another challenge is figuring out where
a specific patient's clinical data

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:05.955
is stored.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:09.690
Marla, our multiple chronic disease
patient seeing many different

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.680
specialists, would have parts of her
records scattered across many EMRs.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.260
Suppose one of them, or

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.500
a PCP, should she get one,
wants an integrated view of her care.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.300
Where does it go to
get that information?

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.880
Special document locator systems at
some health information exchanges

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.790
facilitate this type of query by
indexing where a patient's images,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.140
lab tests, and
other clinical data are stored.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.320
The new Meaningful Use Stage Two VDT

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.360
requirements mean that Marla might
create her own integrated record by

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.300
obtaining electronic summaries
from each of her providers.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.600
Which of these are reasons for

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.010
establishing a health
information exchange?
