00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.450
This episode is brought to you by Ayahuasca!

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.110
Hey there day trippers, Jules here for Dnews.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.260
In 1971, Richard Nixon started what many called
the war on drugs in the United States, cracking

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.010
down on illegal narcotics and, quote, “tighten[ing]
the noose around the necks of drug peddlers.”

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.150
The same year, the United Nations enacted
a treaty designed to ban psychotropic substances..

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.860
Nonetheless a number of illegal drugs can,
were, and are still used recreationally and

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.880
as medicine.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.410
And one of the most widely debated categories
of drugs, in this respect, is psychedelics.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.190
Just to be clear, a psychedelic is a drug
which most often works by activating serotonin

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.500
receptors, causing changes in cognition and
perception.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.150
This is similar to the effects found in activities
like meditation, dreaming, even having a near-death

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:50.350
experience.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.390
And in fact, this dramatic shift in perception
is not necessarily a bad thing.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.570
For centuries psychedelics have been used
in medical treatments and religious ceremonies.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.930
Native Americans have used, and continue to
use psychotropic cactuses, called peyote,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.390
which contain a chemical called “mescaline”.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.250
Anecdotally, it is a successful treatment
for alcoholism, and other addictions.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.729
The indigenous people of Mexico’s preferred
religious drug is psilocybin mushrooms, and

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.970
in South America, a drink called “Ayahusaca”
contains a very strong hallucinogen called

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.970
DMT.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.510
And while the merits of drug-use are up for
debate, we at DNews certainly do not encourage

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.240
you to experiment; the fact that they are
illegal means that these claims are incredibly

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.600
difficult to verify.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.610
Until very recently, many illegal drugs were
also effectively impossible to legally procure

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.610
for scientists to study, so while politicians
can demonize all drugs as the same, science

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.189
has been unable to fire back with much proof.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.780
Although the 1950s through 1970s saw a flurry
of government sponsored studies on LSD and

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.080
other psychedelics, many were dismissed as
unscientific, or done illegally in secret.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.240
One study in 1969 did find that when autistic
and schizophrenic children were given LSD

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.060
and psilocybin, they consistently found improved
speech behavior in mute children, increased

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.810
emotional responsiveness, happier moods, and
less compulsive behavior.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.400
And some researchers have found clever ways
to study the effects of psychedelics without

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.659
actually having it.

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.630
In 2012, two Norwegian scientists did a meta-analysis
of existing studies on LSD use and alcoholism.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.209
These studies were completed between 1966
and 1970, before the United Nations called

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:19.500
for the global ban.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.090
Essentially, the scientists were examining
the progress of alcoholics at inpatient clinics,

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.090
some of whom were given a small dose of LSD.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.160
The researchers found that 59% of those who
had taken it decreased their alcohol consumption,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.610
compared to 38% of those patients who did
not take LSD.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.540
Additionally, they found that the LSD patients
were 15% more likely to stay sober after leaving

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.540
the clinic.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.810
In recent years, more and more studies have
been able to be performed with psychedelics,

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.230
particularly psilocybin mushrooms.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.599
One ongoing study out of NYU is looking at
their effects on treat cancer patients with

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.599
anxiety.

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.960
For many terminal patients, providing palliative
care can be of the utmost importance, and

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.510
it’s been shown that psychedelics do seem
to ease this form of anxiety.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.069
In the past few years, several other studies
have shown that psilocybin can induce a mystical

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.660
or spiritual experience, which can be a method
of dealing with cancer patient psychosocial

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.660
distress.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.660
And in a more recent study released in 2015,
Brazilian researchers gave patients with depression

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.400
the drink Ayahuasca.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.650
They found that not only did their depression
decrease almost immediately, but that it remained

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.570
that way for the following few weeks.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.879
To be absolutely fair, the study has little
external validity, as the sample size was

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.440
only six volunteers, and there was no control
group to compare to.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.090
Of course, the difficulty in studying psychedelics
hasn’t stop people from self-medicating

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.819
outside of an appropriate scientific and medical
setting.

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.290
This can lead to less than optimal reactions
and adverse effects.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.680
So although we here at DNews cannot in good
conscience promote drug use, we do promote

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.930
scientific research, so in that light, I say:
let’s legalize psychedelics.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.930
For science.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.200
[SPONSOR/AD READ]
In addition to testing drugs on human, scientists

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.400
have also tested drugs on rats.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.900
If you’re into rats, you might want to watch

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.010
Interestingly, scientists still don’t completely
understand how and why psychedelics affect

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.299
the brain, but you can hear about some ideas
about how LSD affects the brain in this video.

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.739
So what do you think, should psychedelics
be made legal to study?
