00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.377
In the last lesson,

00:00:01.377 --> 00:00:05.970
we saw that an operating system
is really a reference monitor.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.018
Every time a request is made for
a particular resource,

00:00:09.018 --> 00:00:13.610
it must say,
what is the source of this request?

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.090
Authentication helps us
answer this question.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.080
In particular, it tells us on
whose behalf a process is running

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.670
that is making a request for
the resource.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.940
We will explore multiple
authentication methods and

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.330
how they can be implemented
in a computer system.
