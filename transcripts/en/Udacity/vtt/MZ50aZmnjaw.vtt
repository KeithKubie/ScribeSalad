00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.780
I'm here with Mark Nguyen.

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:04.440
He's a Course Manager here at Udacity.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.810
So, Mark, why should a student
post to the Udacity forums?

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.910
&gt;&gt; That's a very excellent question.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.430
Why should you not-
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.355
&gt;&gt; Want to post to the forums.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:17.340
There's a couple of things of
why should you use the forums.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.508
Number one is the forums are there, they
most likely have your answer already.

00:00:21.508 --> 00:00:26.380
So if you're working on a project,
you're working through the course, and

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.430
if you find out that you
have a question, and

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.780
if you're stuck on something, most
likely there is already an answer there.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.740
Most likely, a fellow student
has already asked that question.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.270
And then you could just simply go
to the forum, search for it, and

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.470
then find your answer there.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.660
The second thing of why you should use
the forum is to also practice your

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.660
communication skills on the forum,
and specifically,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.120
how you should communicate
your problem and

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.850
how you should also conduct
yourself on the forum.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.010
Because we've noticed that
the questions that are being posted,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.560
the ones that get answered
frequently and the fastest,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.750
are the ones that give everyone else the
entire context, the entire information.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.460
So, when you're posting on the forums,
I really would highly recommend you to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.470
really start thinking about how you
should phrase and frame your question.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.650
And how you should give everyone
the entire context of your situation.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.610
Here's my problem, here's what
I'm doing, here's what I've done.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.420
Here's some snippets of my code,
if you have any code,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.420
if you are working on a that has
coda in it, but basically give

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.120
everyone the entire context and
let everyone know what you know.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.250
So, that could help you prevent
a lot of back and forth stuff and

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.060
help you go ahead and communicate in
a very succinct and efficient manner.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.610
The forums really give
you a good area for

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.620
you to practice these
communication skills.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.220
Third, and one I wanted to let you know
about is go ahead and help other people.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.910
And if you teach the subject yourself,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.890
you will actually have a deeper
knowledge of the material yourself.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.950
So in addition to helping people,

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.900
in addition to communicating and
finding answers,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.950
the forums serve as a rich resource for
you to network and help other people.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.440
And then this will really help you gain,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.805
understand the knowledge
on a deeper level.

00:02:33.805 --> 00:02:34.790
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.149
&gt;&gt; And as well as build your
reputation on the forums.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.690
Which goes to my fourth reason why you
should use forums is about networking.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.170
It's all about networking.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.670
We have a huge array of people
from all across the world,

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.620
from all walks of life and
they're all in it together,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.000
and you somehow manage to build
a great reputation for yourself.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.850
Guess what?

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.242
There will people who want to help you
out later on down the road, as well.

00:03:01.242 --> 00:03:06.420
So, I highly recommend you to
really use the forums as your

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.770
tool to look up the information you
need, and also to help other people out.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.750
&gt;&gt; Wow, thank you so much.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.260
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.
