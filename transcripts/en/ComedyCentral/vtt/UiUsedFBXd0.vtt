00:00:01.502 --> 00:00:05.038
It's time to play...
Serving Face. Serving Face.

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:07.007
(cheering)

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:11.745
Pareidolia is
the subconscious illusion

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:14.548
that makes you see faces
in regular objects.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:16.583
Like in this pissed-off mop
right here.

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:18.452
What's he all mad about?

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:21.054
Comedians, I'm gonna show you
an object with a hidden face

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:22.623
from the twitter account
@facespics.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.892
For 250 points,
I want you to tell me

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.159
what the object is saying. Matt?

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:28.161
Is that Marshawn Lynch
right there?

00:00:28.195 --> 00:00:30.797
(laughter, groaning)

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:32.766
-Aw...
-(whooping)

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:38.472
First up,
this happy cup of coffee.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:39.573
Doug.

00:00:39.606 --> 00:00:42.476
Who wants to stay awake forever?

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.445
(laughter, applause, whooping)

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:49.016
Points. Matt Besser.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.751
Cream in my mouth!

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:53.954
(laughter, groaning)

00:00:53.987 --> 00:00:55.989
(whooping)

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:57.758
HARDWICK:
You guys!

00:00:57.791 --> 00:00:59.393
You guys!

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:07.034
Oh, I'm gonna (bleep)
give him points, yeah.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.369
There's no question
that's worth points.

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:12.105
Next--
this suspicious pair of pants.

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:14.007
What's he up to?

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:16.410
What's his angle, Doug Benson?

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.678
(laughing)

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:20.814
If one more person
calls me Easter Island Face,

00:01:20.848 --> 00:01:22.883
I'm gonna split.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.452
(laughter, whooping, applause)

00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:28.856
Mary.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.490
(sighs):
You know... I'm just...

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.659
I'm not ready
to come out of the closet.

00:01:32.693 --> 00:01:34.161
(laughter)

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.363
Points.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:38.799
-(applause)
-Hmm.

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.067
Matt Besser.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.604
Why does everyone "God bless" me
when I fart?

00:01:43.637 --> 00:01:45.572
(laughter)

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.843
HARDWICK:
Yeah.

00:01:49.877 --> 00:01:52.145
Next-- this celebrating stick.

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.616
Hurray! Doug Benson!

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.851
I just need the landing!

00:01:57.885 --> 00:02:01.655
HARDWICK:
Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:04.224
-Oh, goddamn it.
-Give it to me!

00:02:04.258 --> 00:02:05.859
All right, points!

00:02:05.893 --> 00:02:06.960
Matt Besser.

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:08.428
(high-pitched):
I might be skinny,

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:11.732
-but my dick is this big.
-All right, points.

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.700
(whooping, applause)

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:20.474
(high-pitched): I'm packing
some serious wood down there.

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:21.675
All right.

00:02:21.708 --> 00:02:25.012
Next up, this...
this hip-hop carrot.

00:02:25.045 --> 00:02:26.980
(bell dings)

00:02:30.317 --> 00:02:32.853
Mary.

00:02:32.886 --> 00:02:33.921
Mo' bunny, mo' problems.

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:35.455
Yeah, points.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.858
Points. Very well done.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:40.494
Very well done.

00:02:40.527 --> 00:02:43.297
Next, this angry kayak.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.698
(growls)

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:45.966
Hey, Matt.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.903
World's largest glory hole
open for business.

00:02:49.937 --> 00:02:53.707
Oh, yeah, he wouldn't be
very happy about that at all.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.678
Yay, I have something to stick
my big wooden dick through!

00:02:57.711 --> 00:03:00.948
Finally, this super sexy radish.

00:03:00.981 --> 00:03:03.951
Mmm, ah.
Oh, my.

00:03:03.984 --> 00:03:05.919
Doug.

00:03:08.222 --> 00:03:10.724
I know, I look
radishing tonight.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:13.493
HARDWICK:
No!

00:03:13.527 --> 00:03:15.462
Aw...

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:22.636
Points. Uh, Mary.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.404
Put me in your butt

00:03:24.438 --> 00:03:26.106
like you do

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.742
with all other radishes.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.210
Points.

00:03:30.244 --> 00:03:31.345
That is...

00:03:31.378 --> 00:03:33.447
that is a really hot...

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.782
And you know you put radishes
in your butt.

00:03:35.816 --> 00:03:35.883
-I've got four in now.
