00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This question is about key distribution.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Suppose Alice and Bob execute the Diffie-Helman protocol

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but pick a value for g that is not a primitive root of q.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Which of the following could happen?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Alice and Bob could produce different keys.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The generated key would be more vulnerable to an eavesdropper.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The number of possible keys that could be generated would be smaller than q.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Or an in-the-middle attacker would be more powerful than if g is a primitive root.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that apply.
