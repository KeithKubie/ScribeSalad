KATIE: Today I'm pleased
to welcome

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.105
John Butman here today.

00:00:08.105 --> 00:00:12.500
As you know, he is the author of
"Breaking Out." How to bu--

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:12.720
I'm sorry.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.379
The full title is "Breaking Out,
How to Build Influence in

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.337
a World of Competing Ideas."
He's also the founder and

00:00:18.337 --> 00:00:21.775
principal of Idea Platforms,
which happens to be just down

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:23.890
the street here in Kendall.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.392
So he works at Idea Platforms
and he works with other

00:00:28.392 --> 00:00:30.832
content experts on [INAUDIBLE],
helping them

00:00:30.832 --> 00:00:33.516
develop and go public with their
ideas in a variety of

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:36.688
different expressions and forms,
from social media, to

00:00:36.688 --> 00:00:39.860
apps, to print, to print
books, and videos.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.300
He's worked with leaders,
and universities, and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.645
philanthropies, consultancies,
and businesses, as well as

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:48.425
independent professionals.

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:50.389
His work is actually taking
him to 30 different

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:51.862
countries--

00:00:51.862 --> 00:00:53.822
I wish mine would do that.

00:00:53.822 --> 00:00:54.190
[INAUDIBLE]

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.694
And their ideas have been
featured in dozens of

00:00:56.694 --> 00:00:57.678
publications.

00:00:57.678 --> 00:01:00.138
They have been featured in
speaking venues worldwide,

00:01:00.138 --> 00:01:02.598
including the World Economic
Forum at Davos,

00:01:02.598 --> 00:01:05.058
PopTech, and TEDx.

00:01:05.058 --> 00:01:08.010
He's also been included in
The Thinkers50 list.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.470
Their books have appeared on
"The New York Times," "Boston

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.422
Globe," "Businessweek," and
"Toronto Globe and Mail"

00:01:13.422 --> 00:01:14.650
bestseller list.

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.140
"Breaking Out" in particular
has been featured in "The

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.500
Financial Times," "Forbes,"
inc.com, "Huffington Post,"

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.780
"Harvard Business Review,"
"Bloomberg" and plenty more

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.980
that I'll leave off.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.232
But personally, I
read the book.

00:01:27.232 --> 00:01:29.120
I really enjoyed reading it.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.900
In fact, I shared the book with
my brother who was at

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.270
Google here, too, and also
an author, and he

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.570
really enjoyed it.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.350
And hopefully he's going to
share it with others, because

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.800
that's a part of how
ideas are spread.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.045
But I don't want to give too
much or anything away because

00:01:45.045 --> 00:01:46.918
this is why we brought
John here today.

00:01:46.918 --> 00:01:48.854
So I'll hand it over to John.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.450
JOHN BUTMAN: Great, thank
you very much, Katie.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.400
Thanks you.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.040
Thanks to everybody
for coming.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.660
Happy pre-lunch to you.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.820
I am indeed the principal
of Idea Platforms.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.425
Anna Weiss is my colleague
and associate.

00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:07.170
She was very involved in the
writing and creation of the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.750
book, too, so I want
to acknowledge her.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.690
And the title of my
talk today is--

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.460
if we can make this go-- how do
people gain influence for

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.020
an abstract idea?

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.040
So it's a very simple question
I'm addressing.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.910
And the question is, if you have
an idea for how you would

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.460
like to make a difference in
the world, how you want to

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.440
make some kind of change
in the world--

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.440
there is the world out there,
there are people whose minds

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.930
you want to influence, whose
thinking you want to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.760
influence, and whose behavior
you want to change.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.230
And in between is this thing
that I call the ideaplex,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.430
which is all the stuff, all the
channels, and all the ways

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.420
you can get to people.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.450
So how do you go from the idea
in your head to the idea in

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.570
other people's heads?

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.540
Very difficult to do.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.370
That's what I've been studying,
that's what we'll be

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.800
talking about today.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.855
So two important things
about this.

00:02:58.855 --> 00:03:01.840
I'm talking about people,
not about companies.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.150
So it's about how do individuals
do this?

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.050
And I'm talking about
abstract ideas.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.050
So I'm not talking about ideas
for companies or for products.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.430
So when I say abstract idea,
let me just give you a few

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.170
examples so you know what
I'm talking about.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.940
So for example, abstract idea.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.990
You know civil disobedience.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.890
Abstract idea.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.470
I can never spell while
I'm doing this.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.120
I like to both do the pen thing
and the click thing.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.100
I feel that you need two
ways to apprehend.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.320
Leaning in.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.710
This is probably familiar
to you.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.090
Everyone know--

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.070
recognize that one, right?

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:41.320
Creative destruction.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.560
Alright, I told Anna this one
yesterday and she said, I

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.150
never heard of it before.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.260
Continuous improvements.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.900
Interestingly enough, I mean,
here's one that's been around

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.370
and it's become so embedded we
don't even think of it as an

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.290
idea anymore.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.330
But when it first started,
some 50 years ago,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.500
this was a big idea.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.030
It was an abstract idea that
people didn't really get.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.660
They thought you just
kept on going.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.160
Anybody want to volunteer
abstract idea?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.440
Well, that.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.800
Oh, yeah.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.530
Quantified self.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.680
It's--

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.260
I like this one.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.300
Quantified self is kind
of a new one.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.340
So, this is the kind of thing
I'm talking about.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.650
How do these ideas
get out there?

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.060
So my goal with this
talk is twofold.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.050
First of all, I would
like to help you.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.080
If you want to go public
with an idea.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.810
If you have an idea that you
would like to plant in some

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.010
minds, whether it's just within
your community, or

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.380
within your discipline, or
within your unit, or

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.460
the world at large.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.540
And second, there are so many
ideas out there coming at us

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.690
that I would like to give you
some thoughts about how to

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.870
evaluate these ideas that are
constantly flooding around us.

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.580
So, let me first just talk a
little bit about the ideaplex,

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.550
because this is one of the
reasons that we have

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.720
this glut of ideas.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.500
So by the ideaplex I mean all
the activities by which we

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.650
generate, distribute,
and consume ideas.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.760
And what's interesting is the
countries that Anna and I

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.510
visited as part of the research
for the book, the

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.940
ideaplex in the US is really
different, and much bigger,

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.000
and much more complex
than anywhere else.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.610
So the idea entrepreneur I'm
going to talk about in just a

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.950
moment is really a product
of the ideaplex.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.550
And I'm talking about from the
entire educational system to

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.400
social media, traditional media
in between, think tanks,

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.600
research and development--

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.645
I mean, there are so
many places that

00:05:40.645 --> 00:05:42.450
ideas are coming from.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:47.360
So the ideaplex makes it easier
to go public because

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.540
you can just post a YouTube
video, you could just tweet,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:52.440
and you're public.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.230
But it makes it harder to gain
influence because everybody's

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.860
tweeting, and everybody's
going public.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.180
So it's interesting that
it's easier and

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.490
harder at the same time.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.230
But it has given rise to this
new player that I call the

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.140
idea entrepreneur.

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.110
So this is an individual.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.570
These are some of the
characteristics.

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.180
It's an idea driven person.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.390
They tend to be outsiders to
a status quo of some kind.

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.690
They can be within an
organization but still be

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.840
outside the status
quo thinking.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.460
They tend to model the
ideas themselves.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.520
The ideas are always
life-affirming in some way.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.040
They are very personally
motivated.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.270
And they always seek some
kind of change.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.840
So they're looking to make
some kind of change in

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.410
something--

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.600
can be a mindset, can be an
organization, it can be quite

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.670
small, it can be quite large.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.210
So, who am I talking about?

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.660
Let me just give you
a few examples.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.190
Sheryl Sandberg.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.000
So, she wrote the book
"Lean In." What's

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:49.840
she trying to change?

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.230
She's trying to change attitudes
about women in the

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:55.690
workplace and in society.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:56.640
Daniel Kahneman.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.340
Anybody read his book,
"Thinking, Fast and Slow"?

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.560
So he's a behavioral
psychologist.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.150
He's trying to change
how people go

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.070
about making decisions.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.150
And he gets into business
decision making.

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.020
Mireille Giuliano.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.270
Anybody read her book?

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.490
"French Women Don't Get Fat." So
she's trying to change how

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.315
people think about eating
and lifestyle.

00:07:16.315 --> 00:07:18.190
And her basic thing is, you
should do it the way the

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.080
French do it.

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.090
Atul Gawande.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.280
Everyone know him?

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.900
So he's trying to change how
surgeons think about the ways

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.080
they behave in the
operating room.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.860
He wrote "The Checklist
Manifesto."

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.680
Very interesting fellow.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.310
Anna's seen him speak.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:35.290
Tim Ferriss.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.870
Anybody a Tim Ferriss
adherent?

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.520
Is anybody--

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.470
you are?

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.170
AUDIENCE: My email is.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.055
JOHN BUTMAN: For the work week,
the body, or the, what

00:07:43.055 --> 00:07:43.700
are all three?

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.570
The work week, OK.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.300
So Tim Ferriss is trying to
change how you think about,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.840
sort of, everything, right?

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:51.520
But he's saying you should do
everything faster and you

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.890
should optimize yourself.

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.860
And he's a self quantification
guy.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.210
You probably haven't heard of
this guy, Bindeshwar Pathak.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.110
We met him in India,
fascinating guy.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.070
He is trying to change how
Indians think about

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:04.250
sanitation.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.430
He believes that sanitation is
the way for success for the

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.720
nation of India.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.840
These are-- actually, this
is a group of these, the

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.070
untouchables, right?

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:19.130
Former scavengers who we had
a chance to meet in India.

00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:20.170
Eckhart Tolle.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:22.310
Anybody read Eckhart Tolle?

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:26.400
"The Power of Now." Hugely
successful author and speaker.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.840
He's trying to change how people
think about being in

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.890
the moment and about
spirituality.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.140
Bryant Terry.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:37.280
He's a chef and he's
into nutrition.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.539
He's trying to change how you
think about social justice.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.970
He says nutrition is the
way to social justice.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:43.610
Now I just want to--

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.190
those people are all quite
famous and quite well-known.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:48.060
So I want to show you a
couple who are not.

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.900
This is Maria Madison, who
actually lives in my town of

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.910
Concord, Mass.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.980
And she's trying to
change how people

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.650
think about their community.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.070
So she's doing it in
a very small way.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.670
She runs this little
group called The

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.250
Drinking Gourd Project.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.870
And this is a young woman named
Samantha Joseph who is a

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:03.780
friend of Anna's.

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:07.130
She works for Iron Mountain and
she's trying to change how

00:09:07.130 --> 00:09:10.310
people within the company think
about sustainability.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.560
So, all the ideas I'm going to
present to you, although we

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.490
basically focused on well-known
people who have

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.050
bestselling books, these apply
within communities.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.910
The ideas apply within
communities and within

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.010
organizations.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.750
So, finally, Cesar Millan,
the dog whisperer.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.300
Does everybody know
the dog whisperer?

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.500
You've seen him,
seen his shows.

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.710
So, they are all very different,
obviously, but they

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:38.400
all follow a basic method.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.400
It's not really a set of steps,
but there are three

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.260
parts to this method.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.600
Fascination, expression,
and respiration.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.700
I'm going to very
briefly take you

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.190
through those three things.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:50.860
So, the first one.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.730
Fascination.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:56.810
If we look at Cesar Millan,
he's got a great story.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:00.740
He was born in Mexico, he was
raised on a farm, spent time

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:02.270
on a farm as a kid.

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.500
Everybody discovered that he
was really good with dogs.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:06.820
He seemed to be able to
communicate with dogs unlike

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.250
anybody else.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:12.360
And when he was in his early
teens, his family got a TV set

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.820
for the first time.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.370
And he came across
American shows.

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:20.105
And, believe it or not, his
favorite show was "Rin Tin

00:10:20.105 --> 00:10:21.070
Tin."

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.350
And then he came across
"Lassie." And he said, wow,

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.525
this is really very different.

00:10:25.525 --> 00:10:28.350
The way these dogs behave is not
the way the dog's behave

00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.950
on the farm here in Mexico.

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:32.640
I must go to America and
discover what the training

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.440
techniques are for these dogs
because these dogs understand

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.330
English, they respond to
commands, they seem to have

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.550
relationships, they live in
houses, they wear clothing.

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:44.450
I don't get what's going on.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.160
So this was a moment of
revelation for him.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.630
Now, so, his fascination with
dogs has remained a part of

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.590
his presentation for
his entire life, so

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.230
for the last 30 years.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.080
And this particular story he
tells over and over again.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.540
I went to see him do a live--
he does this live talk, this

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:04.870
hour-long kind of stage show.

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:07.280
I went to Lynn, Massachusetts
and saw him do this.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.445
And he told this story about
seeing "Rin Tin Tin." He tells

00:11:10.445 --> 00:11:12.340
it every time he talks--

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:12.625
virtually.

00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:15.610
And every time he talks about
it, he says it as if it

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:16.930
happened yesterday.

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:23.835
So these are-- so fascination is
about these iconic moments.

00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:28.570
And all of these idea
entrepreneurs have these

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:33.340
iconic moments that
reveal the idea.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:37.080
So they are able to tell you,
here's when I came to

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.330
understand this idea.

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:46.460
Mireille Giuliano, for example--
"French Women Don't

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.770
Get Fat." She talks about how
she came to America when she

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:53.620
was a kid and she was a
perfectly slim, fit, young

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:54.600
Frenchwoman.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.510
She came here.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.100
She lived in five
different homes.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.320
When she was a high school
student, everybody plied her

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.800
with lemon meringue pie, and
brownies, and frappes, and

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.415
stuff like that.

00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:06.080
And she gained 20 pounds.

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.930
And it really did not
make her happy.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.570
She went home, her father said
to her, oh my god, you look

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.980
like a sack of potatoes.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.850
So that moment is one that she
talks about all the time.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:20.250
So these iconic moments are
very much a part of

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.540
fascination.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.950
Then there is--

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.430
all these idea entrepreneurs
have huge quantity of

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:27.010
accumulation.

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.490
So they accumulate lots, and
lots, and lots of material.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:33.720
And we find this--

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.940
as Katie said, we work with
people who come to us, who are

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:39.870
content experts, who want to go
public, and often they want

00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:40.910
to write a book.

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.920
And they say to us, do we
have enough material?

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.170
And very often they do not
have enough material.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.900
And you really need a great deal
of material behind your

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.760
idea to convince people
in lots and lots

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.140
of different ways.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:58.530
So you need data, you need
stories, you need references,

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:03.260
you need analysis, you
need all this stuff.

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:06.140
And a friend of mine, George
Stalk, who's a strategy expert

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.210
said, well, he has a test for
how much material you need

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.180
because he's always asked how
much do you need before you

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:12.990
write a book?

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.810
He said, well, if you can
stand up in front of an

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:18.725
audience for a full day and
talk nonstop, and have the

00:13:18.725 --> 00:13:21.420
audience stay reasonably awake,
you probably have

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:22.910
enough for a book.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.170
So you can use that test if
you want to write a book.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.010
They also, they always
have practices.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.830
So all these idea entrepreneurs
are very

00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:34.080
practical people.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.730
This is what really
distinguishes them from the

00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:40.530
abstract thinkers, the
academics, those who are

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:43.980
interested in writing books but
don't make it practical.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:48.400
So what we found is that they
really have to find a way to

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.210
allow people, making people
understand how do you put this

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.590
idea into everyday use?

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.880
So obviously, Cesar Millan
gives you ways to

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:56.720
deal with your dog.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.480
But Daniel Kahneman gives you
a series of questions to ask

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:01.170
if we make a decision.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:05.510
All of these guys, all these
people, give you practices.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.280
It's very, very important.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.190
So, they take all this stuff
and they build a personal

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:14.580
narrative around their idea.

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.390
And what's really great is the
personal narrative is the

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.670
story of the idea.

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:21.790
It's a story of how the
idea developed.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.240
It's the abstraction of the
idea, but it's the life story.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:28.300
So the person essentially
becomes the idea.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.480
This is very difficult to do.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.400
All the people I showed you
pretty much to that.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.140
But you can do it in
a smaller way.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:38.000
So you can say that person is
the one who knows more than

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.940
anybody else in the organization
about whatever it

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:42.740
is, and that is the person who
is really espousing this idea

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.370
and has put themselves
into it.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:48.590
So their personal narrative is
really entwined with the idea.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.400
So the second part of the
method is expression.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.220
Now obviously, the fas-- these
three overlap and they're

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:56.960
simultaneous.

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.340
But the expression comes next.

00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:04.240
So by expression I simply mean
that your idea is pretty much

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.340
nothing until you have expressed
it in some way.

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.030
And I've done many talks and
people come up to me

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:14.270
afterwards and say, I have this
really fantastic idea but

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.510
nobody is doing it.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:18.580
And I'll say, well, have
you told anybody

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:20.750
about it, for example?

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.230
Well, say, yeah.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.480
Well, I told somebody
about it.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.760
But the idea entrepreneurs
express their ideas in

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.480
multiple ways, all the time.

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:34.890
So the first thing to do is to
figure out what is their best

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.400
form of expression.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.830
And this is not so easy to do,
because if you don't spend

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.250
your life in communications
you may not know what your

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.780
best form is.

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:51.190
So we found people come to us
who want to write books are

00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:54.410
not actually writers, and it's
very difficult to write.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:57.500
And so we help them try to
find what their best

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:58.230
expression is.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:01.350
So, very often, people are much
better talkers than they

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.740
are writers, and that's
where idea

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:04.750
entrepreneurs should start.

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.740
So, Cesar Millan, for example,
is a great talker.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.930
He's great in person,
but as a writer--

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:11.980
I mean, he's fine.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.880
His books are fine, but you
really want to see the guy.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:17.490
Mireille Giuliano is actually
a very good writer.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:19.000
You want to read her books.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.370
They are fun to read.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:21.190
They're interesting to read.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:24.480
And she likes to talk, but it's
kind of secondary to her.

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:32.960
So this writing speaking tension
is very intriguing

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:35.000
because you really
need to do both.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.880
And they do very different
things.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.810
We found that all idea
entrepreneurs do

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:40.340
both of these things.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:43.730
But whatever the best form is,
and even if they do both, they

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.100
always create what we call
a sacred expression.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:50.980
So this is the one expression
that everybody comes to

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.420
recognize and say,
that is the one.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:55.335
That is the book this
person wrote.

00:16:55.335 --> 00:16:56.910
That's the one you
should read.

00:16:56.910 --> 00:17:00.440
And if you don't have that,
it's very hard to go up a

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.290
level when you go public.

00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:04.849
So people who really want to
take it up a level, and go

00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.122
public, and get a lot of
attention, they really have to

00:17:07.122 --> 00:17:09.290
put a lot of work into
the expression.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.480
And it's not enough just to
write a book, just to do a

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.170
video, just to do a talk.

00:17:14.170 --> 00:17:15.690
You have to put a lot into it.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.839
But all the accumulation, all
the iconic moments, all the

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:19.440
practices--

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.710
they all have to be there in
the sacred expression.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:25.069
Then you have to put a lot of
work into making it both

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:30.000
quality, but also get out
there so people see it.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.020
Finally, they do, as I said,
multiple expressions.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:40.870
And what they really want to do
is create a video, a talk,

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:44.840
tweet, blog, write, write
articles, appear in

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.440
conferences, appear at TED Talks
if they possibly can.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.340
But every piece of--

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.560
each expression does something
a little bit different.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.620
So when I first saw Malcolm
Gladwell speak, it was really

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:56.000
interesting.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.874
He did his talk about "The
Tipping Point." And I don't

00:17:59.874 --> 00:18:02.070
know if you've seen him talk
about that, and I'm not sure

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.770
if it changes or not.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.100
But when I saw him, it was
just after it came out.

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.500
And he got up and he told the
first story from the book.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:11.460
And basically, in the
same words that he'd

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.780
written it in the book.

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.610
And I thought, well, I've
already read the book.

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:17.220
I don't need you to read
the book aloud,

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.060
there's audio to do that.

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:23.360
So I'd rather have you tell me
other stuff and explain to me

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.250
things in the book, or tell
me other stories.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.460
So the great idea entrepreneurs
make their talk

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:30.270
different from the book.

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.420
I found this very difficult when
we started off with this

00:18:32.420 --> 00:18:35.610
book because you've spent three,
four years working on

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.570
all the stuff in your book
and then suddenly nobody

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:39.260
wants to hear that.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.580
They want to hear new stuff.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:44.570
So well, I don't have any
new stuff right now.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.620
But you have to come
up with new stuff.

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:48.840
So the talk has to be different
from the book.

00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.190
The video has to be different
from the talk and the book.

00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:53.090
So all these multiple
expressions start to build

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.800
this self-reinforcing platform
that's really fantastic.

00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:58.880
And we've seen this with our
books-- it's been really,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.250
really fun to watch.

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:02.590
Because we've been blogging
on the "HBR" blog

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.320
network, which has--

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.185
I think it goes out to
a million people.

00:19:06.185 --> 00:19:07.280
So I don't know if
anybody looks at

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.200
that, the blog network.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.080
But they have five or
six blogs per day.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.390
And they're always running their
analytics on them so you

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:17.160
can see where you fall
in the ranking.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.185
It is very dangerous for an
author to do this because you

00:19:20.185 --> 00:19:22.730
can waste your entire day
checking your analytics of

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:25.790
your Amazon ranking
and where you

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:29.170
fall in the blog hierarchy.

00:19:29.170 --> 00:19:33.150
But you want to build this
self-reinforcing platform.

00:19:33.150 --> 00:19:37.690
And that's what all the
idea entrepreneurs do.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.130
Then we come to the third piece,
which is really the

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.550
most important and fun one.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:46.120
Am I going to write on the
wall if I do this?

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.400
I was told not to write
on the wall.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:52.496
I would be kicked
out immediately.

00:19:52.496 --> 00:19:54.173
KATIE: The building's too
new for you to write on

00:19:54.173 --> 00:19:55.770
the wall just yet.

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:56.120
JOHN BUTMAN: All right.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:58.920
So I'll squeeze it in down
here while you do that.

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.170
So respiration.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.735
This is the most
important one.

00:20:04.735 --> 00:20:07.750
This is where influence really
starts to happen.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:10.660
So you can have a fascination.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:12.500
You can accumulate a
ton of material.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.960
You can create a lot
of expressions.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.760
And you can have absolutely
no influence at all.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:18.590
And it happens all the time.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.380
And this happened to a couple of
our clients and it's a very

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:22.380
unpleasant experience.

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.470
You put all this work into it.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:26.960
Usually we find that putting all
the work into it will pay

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.920
off eventually, but it
may not pay off with

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.620
this particular effort.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.070
So what is respiration?

00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:34.700
This is when the idea comes
to life, when the

00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:35.870
idea starts to breathe.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:38.050
When people pick it up, when
they tell each other about it,

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.530
and they start to put
into practice.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:40.360
All these things happen.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.100
So this is what we really want
to have happen to your idea to

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.950
make some kind of change.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.250
Now, you cannot force this
to happen, but you

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:48.370
can encourage it.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:49.250
So there are a lot of
things you can do.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.950
So the first one, first thing
you can do is you have some

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.480
kind of direct engagement.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.760
The number of authors we've
worked with who feel that once

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.240
the book is done, or once the
video is done, or once the

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.570
talk is done--

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:06.450
it's done.

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:09.110
I have presented my idea
unto the world.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.840
The world will now completely
understand it.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.330
They will take it on board.

00:21:13.330 --> 00:21:15.080
They will act accordingly.

00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.580
My work is finished.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.940
I can ride off into
the sunset.

00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:18.740
Right?

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.710
So this never happens.

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:22.200
Never ever happens.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.360
Even if they do go
give a talk--

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:26.190
just like I'm giving now--

00:21:26.190 --> 00:21:31.010
they don't actually ask for
questions, or don't listen to

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.290
what people say.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.950
And so there's no direct
engagement.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.340
All the successful idea
entrepreneurs have some kind

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.900
of direct engagement.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.670
Eckhart Tolle, is, I
think he's sort of

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:43.010
my model for this.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:46.150
He has so many ways of engaging

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.680
directly with audiences.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:49.910
He tried to do sort
of big tent shows,

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:51.210
where he would go into--

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:52.670
I don't think he went to Madison
Square Garden-- but he

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:55.350
want to very big venues and he
didn't like it, because he's

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.420
kind of a shy guy.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:22:00.760
What he likes to do is be in a
video studio with an audience

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.120
about the size of this group.

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.880
And people would get up and ask
him really deep, probing,

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:08.870
personal questions.

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:11.730
Like, I'm about to commit
suicide, what do you

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:13.390
think I should do?

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:14.150
Oh my god.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.820
And he will say, oh, well.

00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:20.080
And you can see him
kind of stumbling.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:21.970
And he's not polished.

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:23.600
He's really trying to
help this person.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.950
He's directly engaging.

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:28.950
And when he does it, something
magical happens in the

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.770
audience because you see this
guy's putting his ideas to

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.590
work, right here, with somebody

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:35.970
who has a real problem.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:39.340
And you see the person is
helped in some way.

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.050
Cesar Millan does the
same thing on stage.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:45.690
He brings on dogs who he's not
met before who have problems.

00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:47.270
Presenting problems.

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:47.820
Right.

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.280
So when I saw him, the
dog was a barker.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.950
Yeah, he barked at every
dog that went by.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:59.550
And Cesar, really, within three
minutes this dog was

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.170
totally changed.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:03.720
It was just by his presence,
by the way he

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.820
behaved with the dog.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:07.020
But Cesar had the new dog.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.870
The dog had come out, and
he walked his own dog

00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:11.380
named Junior by.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.260
And the guest dog had barked
like crazy at Junior and tried

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:17.640
to pull at his leash.

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.680
And at the end of it, after
three minutes, Cesar walked by

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:24.750
with Junior and the dog just,
sat there like, no problem,

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.040
there's another dog here.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:31.850
So direct engagement is
absolutely essential.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:32.910
The second one is--

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:36.790
we're still in respiration--
our current presence.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.980
Now, I don't know if you've
witnessed this, but very often

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:44.000
if you hear an author or
somebody with a set of ideas

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.030
interviewed on the radio or on
TV, they will often say those

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:54.030
killing words, "as I said in my
book." " No one cares what

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.290
you said in your book.

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:56.820
They want to know what you
think about what's

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:58.600
happening right now.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.280
So every idea entrepreneur has
to find a way to develop a

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:06.370
framework of ideas that is
stable, that they believe in,

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:09.420
and they don't change all the
time, but they can interpret

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.080
and apply to what's going
on right now.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:17.090
So all the good ones will be
able to take their ideas and

00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:19.180
apply them to whatever
is happening.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.700
And then people have--

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.900
they get the, what I call,
this current presence.

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.975
So Deepak Chopra.

00:24:24.975 --> 00:24:26.880
You know Deepak Chopra?

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:28.380
He's quite brilliant at this.

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.660
He's so brilliant
at it that he's

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.740
kind of lost the framework.

00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:35.810
He's so much a personality of
the ideaplex and he's so able

00:24:35.810 --> 00:24:37.060
to respond to everything.

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.020
Remember he was all over
the place when

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.560
Michael Jackson died?

00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.390
So he was somehow--

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:44.150
Deepak Chopra was the expert
on Michael Jackson.

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:46.850
I'm not quite sure why, but it's
sort of like, if you need

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.450
somebody to talk about anything,
call Deepak.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:54.800
He will apply his ideas, he'll
fix them somehow so they fit.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.485
So, from my point, he's kind of
lost the idea thing, he's

00:24:58.485 --> 00:25:01.430
become a personality
of the ideaplex.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:06.620
Contrast him to Jim Collins, for
example, who has done four

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:11.260
books, basically, four major
books in a pretty--

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:14.410
Deepak Chopra, by the way, has
done 65 books in his 30 years.

00:25:14.410 --> 00:25:16.450
So there's quite a
difference there.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.830
But he very, very much sticks
with his ideas.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.360
He evolves them over time.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:23.830
He looked at--

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:26.500
he said, well, how do my ideas
apply to social sectors and

00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:27.870
did this whole monograph.

00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:30.790
So there's a way to have a
current presence which doesn't

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:33.740
threaten your ideas, but it
also keeps you current.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.495
Very important--

00:25:37.495 --> 00:25:43.860
OK, I'm continuing respiration
here-- is they personally

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:44.850
model the practices.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:47.380
So once they go public and
they've talked about these

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:53.110
practices, but they model
them as things continue.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.460
So two examples.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.370
Martha Stewart, who I think of
as an idea entrepreneur.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.850
She kind of got a little bit
focused on the money for quite

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:03.740
some time, but she started out
as an idea entrepreneur.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.760
And the great thing
about her is she

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.090
has practices, obviously.

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:08.820
I mean, she's got more practices
than you could shake

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.270
a stick at.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:11.060
She's got nothing but
practices, really.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.090
And what happened when
she went to prison?

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:14.550
Does anybody know?

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:16.240
I mean, the reports vary.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.130
It's a little hard to
get the exact story.

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:20.450
But, as far as we can
tell, she taught

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.000
people how to do yoga.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.930
She cooked.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:27.970
She did knitting
or crocheting.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:34.070
And she advocated for better
food in prisons from prison.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:37.410
So she didn't become angry, she
didn't shut down, she kept

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:38.200
doing her practices.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.970
I thought, this is
pretty good.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.250
And, to me, OK, she had her
problems with the whole

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.820
financial thing--

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.640
I don't know what happened
there, really--

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.950
but she kept going with
her practices.

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:49.620
Contrast that with Al Gore.

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.120
Remember Al Gore and
his whole thing

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.430
with the carbon footprint?

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:56.090
So he came out with "An
Inconvenient Truth." He's the

00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:00.230
only guy who has a PowerPoint
presentation that led to a

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:03.680
Nobel Peace Prize and
an Academy Award.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.520
That's not bad.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.320
I think that's, you know--

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.720
well, anyway.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:14.180
But while he was out there,
going public with his ideas,

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.840
he got a lot of backlash because
of his enormous house,

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.100
his enormous jet-- he was flying
around all the time.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.170
His carbon footprint
was just way off.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:23.690
So he was not modeling
the practices.

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:26.880
Now, as far as I can tell,
Al has changed his ways--

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.820
got a smaller house, and he's
reduced his carbon footprint.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.400
So he heard that message.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.230
But you've got to model
the practices.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.960
That's very, very important.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:37.050
Two other things
in respiration.

00:27:37.050 --> 00:27:40.310
One is, you're always going to
have backlash if you have an

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.100
idea of any intensity.

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.050
You're going to have to expect
you're going to get backlash

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:46.270
of some kind.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:50.620
So, you hope you get very
intense positive reactions,

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.720
but you're probably
going to get very

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.740
intense negative reactions.

00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:56.400
So, my favorite example
of this is Amy Chua.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.470
Remember her?

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.190
She wrote a book called
The Tiger--

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.610
"Battle Hymn of the Tiger
Mother." Yeah.

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:03.460
So this -- what?

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.590
Two or three years ago?

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:05.450
Oh my god.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:09.030
Do you remember there was huge,
huge hyperventilation.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:11.160
It wasn't respiration, it was
beyond respiration to

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.120
hyperventilation in
the ideaplex.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.880
Everybody went nuts.

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.820
There was an excerpt from "The
Wall Street Journal" from her

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:21.880
book, and I forget how
many comments.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.650
I think it had 9,000 comments.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:27.040
It got more comments than any
other article had ever

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.390
received for "The Wall Street
Journal," before or since.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.470
So, she was really not
prepared for this.

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:37.420
I mean, she went out thinking,
I am presenting what I think

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.670
are some good ideas
about parenting.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:41.920
And, wow.

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.780
She did not expect
this to happen.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:47.140
And part of it was, she ran into
some pretty heavy trends

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:48.250
in the Zeitgeist.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:49.980
You know, that was a time when
we were all worried about

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.120
China, and said, oh my god,
China is going to completely

00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.230
eat our lunch.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:55.930
And every parent was worried
about their kids, saying, oh

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:58.860
my god, none of our kids are
going to get into college.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.040
And so Amy Chua was saying,
you know, really, all the

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.080
parenting techniques here in
America, they're fine and

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.540
everything, but we could use a
little more of the hard and

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:09.530
metric-driven parenting.

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.300
So parents went insane.

00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.290
So you have to expect
this backlash.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:19.090
And you have to find a way to
not try to rebut it, but

00:29:19.090 --> 00:29:20.070
encompass it.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.700
So Cesar Millan, for example,
he's taken a

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:23.760
great deal of backlash.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.690
He does not have a degree
in veterinary science.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:27.430
He didn't go to--

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:30.120
he does not have a college
degree at all.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.830
And so the establishment
doesn't like him.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.660
And they say he's set back
dog training 20 years.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:37.840
And he just deals with that.

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.970
He says, this is, you know,
people feel this way.

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.600
This is how I operate.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.940
It's just part of the thing.

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:48.680
And the final part of
respiration is meta story.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.090
And this is one-- this is really
part of the ideaplex.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.180
This is the part I find
really fascinating.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:57.610
People have come to be as
interested in the story of

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.870
getting your story out there as
they are in the idea that

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:03.240
you're actually getting out.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.910
So for a while they say, oh,
that's really interesting.

00:30:04.910 --> 00:30:08.050
And with our book, for example,
for a month or so,

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:10.060
they said, you know, I've read
the book, interesting ideas,

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.040
really interesting.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:14.580
But after about two months, it
was like, so how's it going?

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.570
How many books have you sold?

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.370
Oh, you were on, whatever,
Big Think.

00:30:19.370 --> 00:30:22.060
So people really want to know
the story of getting

00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:23.500
the story out there.

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:28.650
And so idea entrepreneurs have
started to always include meta

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:30.600
story in story.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.130
And that, to me, is really
fascinating.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.360
So people, they want the idea,
but they also want

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.460
to know how it went.

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.360
And they want this validation
of the fact that you're

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.970
actually having success out
there in the ideaplex.

00:30:40.970 --> 00:30:42.450
So those two things
go together.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.550
So that's the method.

00:30:47.550 --> 00:30:52.070
Now, just a couple thoughts
about some other issues,

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:57.280
because this one is
really critical to

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.260
getting an idea out there.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.720
Now, you'd sort of think that
you would know who your key

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:04.770
audience is, but it's surprising
how often people do

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.060
not know who they're
talking to.

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.190
And they're kind of talking
to themselves.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.760
So they think I have a really,
really great idea.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:14.530
I really love talking to
myself about this idea.

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:16.660
I'm sure that other people
really will love it, too.

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.890
So I think I'll write a book,
or I'll go public.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:22.670
And they find that it's really
not always the case.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:26.270
But, more often, there
is an audience you

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.080
think you want to influence.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.010
So Atul Gawande, "The Checklist"
doctor, he really

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:34.460
wanted to influence surgeons
and medical staff.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.670
And clearly that's
his audience.

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:40.770
But he had to go to an adjacent
audience to really

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:41.700
get to them.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.500
So you have your direct
audience, but you may not be

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.680
able to talk to them directly.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.640
You may have to go to an
adjacent audience.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.760
So this is very intriguing.

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:54.630
Now, Atul Gawande got picked up
by the business community,

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:56.740
I think more so than
it got picked up

00:31:56.740 --> 00:31:58.160
by the medical community.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.400
And then it sort of went back
to the direct audience.

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:02.990
They said, oh, well I guess we
better pay attention to this.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.910
So, often you want to go to an
adjacent audience to get back

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:07.500
to your direct audience.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.050
So you got to think about what
are the adjacent audiences?

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:11.420
You often don't know.

00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:14.010
So Mireille Giuliano, the
"French Women Don't Get Fat"

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:17.660
lady, she said, well, my direct
audience is probably

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.140
sort of middle-aged women,
well-educated, who have

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.730
weight, they're struggling
with their weight or with

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:25.910
their health and lifestyle.

00:32:25.910 --> 00:32:27.470
So I want to talk to
them directly.

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:29.220
And they did read the book.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:34.800
But she found she got more
response from young mothers

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.930
who were worried
about the kids.

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.820
So she had this whole young
mother audience.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.990
Then she discovered that
grandmothers were reading the

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.870
book because they said, oh, this
reminds me of how things

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.990
were back in my day when we
climbed the stairs all the

00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.430
time, didn't watch TV, and
only ate whatever.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:55.740
So she kind of surrounded
her direct audience.

00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.720
And then she discovered
that the spouses

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.030
were reading the book.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:03.140
Or the wife was saying to the
husband, you know, this is a

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.100
really great book.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.260
So all these guys
were reading it.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:06.640
And then--

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:08.340
I'm not sure if this is
adjacent or not--

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.770
but then she discovered that
she had a gay audience.

00:33:10.770 --> 00:33:11.840
So she was--

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:13.650
and she only discovered that
because she did all this

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:14.390
direct engagement.

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.690
She would go out to book
shows and do talks.

00:33:16.690 --> 00:33:19.670
And all these gay
guys were there.

00:33:19.670 --> 00:33:21.860
So she developed this
gay audience.

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:26.030
So she built these separate
audiences into

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.280
a very large audience.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.610
Then there's a third one that
I call the secret audience.

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:36.950
And this is my favorite one
because everybody I've worked

00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:40.580
with, including myself,
usually has somebody--

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.790
usually it's often
the individual--

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.900
that they are speaking to.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:49.780
They may not even know who it
is, but it's often an issue of

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:54.290
revenge, of unfulfilled
promise.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:56.370
So I'm writing to my third grade
teacher who said I'd

00:33:56.370 --> 00:33:57.950
never amount to anything.

00:33:57.950 --> 00:34:00.990
Or, my father who-- it's often
to my father who died when I

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.700
was 10 and I couldn't
show him whatever.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.570
So there's a secret audience.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:09.929
And you may not know who
it is, but you may

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:10.880
eventually get to it.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:13.159
And the reason this is important
is it really helps

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:14.969
you focus what you're
trying to do.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:19.330
Because you often think you have
an audience, and it feels

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:22.280
right, but then you really
discover you're trying to say

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.480
something a little different,
and you're talking to

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.100
different people.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.310
So usually that secret audience
person represents the

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.370
audience you really
want to get to.

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:31.710
So, for example, one of my
secret audience members is my

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:32.929
brother-in-law.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:36.350
And we have a perfectly fine
relation and everything.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:40.090
But I wrote a book several years
ago and after he'd read

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:41.110
it-- which I appreciated--

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:42.979
he said, I don't know why
you wrote that book.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:48.590
I don't know why you
wrote that book.

00:34:48.590 --> 00:34:51.409
Why did you waste three years
of your life on that book?

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:56.020
And he kind of had a point
because my audience was not

00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:56.889
clear on that book.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:59.380
So I always have him in
mind when I write.

00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:01.220
I say, is he going to say,
why did you write

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:02.850
that book, or not?

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.090
I'm really pleased to say when
he read this book he said, I

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:08.770
really enjoyed that book,
it was really good.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.210
I said, oh my god, Glen,
I spent 10 years

00:35:11.210 --> 00:35:13.020
thinking about you.

00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.190
You didn't know that.

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:17.780
So then we get to--

00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.480
we need another one?

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.650
Oh, we got two, we got two.

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.150
There are two.

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.450
OK.

00:35:24.450 --> 00:35:24.940
There are two there.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.410
Yeah.

00:35:26.410 --> 00:35:28.645
So, now comes the question, so
how do you measure this?

00:35:28.645 --> 00:35:29.900
You know, everybody
said , well, how

00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.360
do you measure influence?

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.550
Is it possible to do?

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:35.240
Because it's not about finance,
it's not about money.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.780
How do you measure
the influence

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.160
you're having on people?

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.810
How many people, et cetera?

00:35:39.810 --> 00:35:45.210
So you can't directly measure
influence, of course, because

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:46.630
it's not financial.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:49.070
But there are a number of
things you can measure.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:52.280
So you can measure all
the expressions.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.620
So you can look at your books,
your talks, and there are an

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.020
amazing number of things
you can measure.

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.930
Book sales are just the
most obvious thing.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.860
But, you know, how many
talks am I invited to?

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.990
For academics, in particular,
how often are my ideas

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:07.740
referenced in other works?

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.470
That's a huge one.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.512
Daniel Kahneman says his first
article about "Thinking, Fast

00:36:11.512 --> 00:36:12.920
and Slow" is the
most referenced

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.170
article of all time.

00:36:17.368 --> 00:36:18.610
I don't-- that's what he says.

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:20.680
But anyway, it is referenced
a lot.

00:36:20.680 --> 00:36:22.470
So are you referenced lot?

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:26.260
Are you invited to lots
and lots of talks?

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.390
How many people show up?

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.530
How many Twitter followers
do you have?

00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:31.360
There's just, I mean, there's
just endless metrics that you

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.420
can look at.

00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.580
These are useful, however, I
have also had clients who have

00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.320
great metrics that way and
have no influence.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:40.300
So there's no direct correlation
between any of

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.660
those analytics and the
influence that you have.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.170
So it's all a little bit
mysterious and upsetting.

00:36:46.170 --> 00:36:49.470
I can tell you when clients come
to us, that answer does

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:50.740
not make them very happy.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:53.370
They want to believe that
it's about sales.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.680
And, in fact, I had a chat
with my doctor recently.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.430
We were just chatting and he
said, so how's the book going?

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.170
How many books have you sold?

00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:00.770
I said, well, actually,
I don't know.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:01.746
I haven't checked.

00:37:01.746 --> 00:37:02.880
He was like, you what?

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:05.350
You haven't checked
your sales?

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:06.220
I said, well, no.

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.110
That's really not the point.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.490
He said, well, how else do you
know anything about anything

00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:12.760
if you don't check the
sales of your book?

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:15.320
I said, doc, let's just get
on with the exam, OK?

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:22.150
However, you can usually come
up with some kind of metric

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.950
that may or may not be measuring
exactly what you do,

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:27.880
but that helps people gauge
what you're doing.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.210
So Cesar Millan, for example,
uses euthanization of dogs.

00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:34.440
He says every year 3 to 4
million dogs are euthanized in

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:35.730
the United States.

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:38.270
And largely that's because
people do not know how to

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:40.210
behave with their dogs.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:42.400
He says that 6 to 10--

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.120
6 out of 10 dogs that are taken
home from shelters are

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.930
returned to the shelters.

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:48.660
There's some--

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.790
I don't know if that metric
is exactly right, but

00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:51.890
that's what he says.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:53.960
So those are two metrics
that you can use.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.940
And you could say, well,
euthanizations are coming

00:37:55.940 --> 00:37:59.730
down, or fewer dogs are being
returned to their shelters.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:02.790
Now you can't directly say, I
caused that to happen, but he

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:05.150
can look at those numbers.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:09.190
So you need some kind of
metric you can look at.

00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:16.080
But, interestingly enough, the
most affecting and most

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:19.620
rewarding, and probably most
important one, is this one to

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.340
one, people saying to
you, you know what?

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.740
I saw you talk, I read your
book, it was really

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:27.950
meaningful to me.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.140
It changed the way I think.

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.930
It changed the way I behave.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:32.080
I do things differently now.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.320
I tell other people about it.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:37.480
And all the idea entrepreneurs
we spoke with said that is the

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:42.190
one that they found the most
meaningful and the most really

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:45.400
telling, because you know that
if you've directly affected

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.270
somebody, they're going to be
talking to other people in a

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.680
way that's not just, oh,
I read this cool book.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:52.130
It's like this really meant
something to me.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:55.490
So Tim Ferriss has this sort of
gang of followers, right,

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:57.740
who really, really
believe him.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.480
So that one to one thing
leads to a one to many.

00:39:03.350 --> 00:39:08.160
Finally, you start to think
about, so what is my very,

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.230
very long lasting effect beyond
the book, or beyond the

00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:15.460
two or three years
when I go public?

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.870
And we get to what I call
the thinking journey.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:20.310
And this is where you connect
the idea that you want to go

00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:23.220
public with to other ideas, and
think about how does it

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:26.950
fit in a much bigger way.

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:30.910
So, you want to think about
how do you take the idea

00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:33.890
beyond yourself when you're no
longer active, or you're on to

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.450
something else?

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.460
And there are ways to
think about that.

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.850
One is, are you linking
to some kind of

00:39:39.850 --> 00:39:44.652
fundamental human concern?

00:39:44.652 --> 00:39:49.020
And this is something that a
lot of people who want to

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.600
write books, in particular,
are not doing.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:55.370
They're focused on a very narrow
or technical area.

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:57.940
But if you can link to a very
deep, fundamental human

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:00.410
concern, you got a pretty
good chance of gaining

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:01.770
some lasting influence.

00:40:01.770 --> 00:40:04.810
So, to use Cesar Millan again
for an example, you know he

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:05.880
talks about dog training.

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.280
People think of him-- oh,
he's a dog trainer.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.610
But he strongly believes that
he's about dog-human

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:12.740
relationships.

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.730
And that he is actually about
the state of American society

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.590
and our relationship
with nature.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:20.100
So he's linking into a much,
much deeper idea.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.960
If you take anyone of these idea
entrepreneurs, they're

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.290
always finding some fundamental
idea that they are

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:26.260
talking about.

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.030
They don't always say it.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.170
They don't say it directly,
but it comes out.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.250
Many people have this
idea of ownership.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.010
I want to own that idea.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.080
Consultants in particular
want to do this.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.780
I want to be the owner
of that idea.

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.020
And I found that this is a
really good way to not own an

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.410
idea, is to say, I
own this idea.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:50.920
No one else owns this idea.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.100
I thought it up, nobody
else did.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:56.070
So, the good idea entrepreneurs
say, you know, I

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:56.900
didn't think it up.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.560
I am expressing it for
lots of other people.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.755
I, of course, I added my own
thing to it and expressed it

00:41:02.755 --> 00:41:05.040
in different ways, but
I don't own this.

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:05.750
I don't want to own it.

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:06.760
I want other people to own it.

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.800
I want other people
to add to it.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.780
So don't try to own the idea.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:15.040
And you've got to recognize the
relationship of your idea

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.940
to other ideas out there.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:22.720
And no idea is wholly
original, or even

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.890
particularly original.

00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.180
But they're originally stated
and they come out at certain

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.410
times that are important.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:30.190
So link to those.

00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.700
And then finally, if you can,
you want to trace to a very,

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.120
very long thinking journey.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.290
So you want to trace back, and
you want to trace forward.

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:41.505
So when I asked Cesar Millan,
for example, I interviewed him

00:41:41.505 --> 00:41:44.620
and I said, is there
anybody that you--

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.550
whose footsteps you would
like to follow?

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:49.440
Or you think of as somebody
who is kind

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:50.470
of a mentor, a leader?

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:52.960
He said, oh yeah, Gandhi.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.520
I said, Gandhi.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:54.990
Really?

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:55.440
He said, well--

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.170
I said, why?

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:59.375
He says, well, Ghandi has this
quote which is, the quality of

00:41:59.375 --> 00:42:03.034
a society is judged by the way
it treats its animals.

00:42:03.034 --> 00:42:05.530
I thought, oh, this is
pretty interesting.

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:09.560
So if you take Cesar Millan, if
you take Gandhi, his whole

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.540
thing was what he called
satyagraha, which is truth

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.160
firmness, which is sort
of civil disobedience.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.300
And Cesar's method of working
with dogs is calm

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.580
assertiveness, which is sort
of the same thing for dogs

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.620
that Gandhi had for humans.

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.600
And you can trace this
thinking journey

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.560
really back to Buddha.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:32.170
You can say Buddha, Gandhi,
Tolstoy, Martin Luther King,

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:33.470
Cesar Millan.

00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:34.210
Perfect.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:35.460
Perfect line.

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:42.881
All right, so, I want
to leave you with--

00:42:42.881 --> 00:42:47.960
well I guess I can, I forgot to
take you through metrics.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:51.520
So if you're thinking about
going public with an idea--

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.010
and maybe just within your
organization, or whatever--

00:42:55.010 --> 00:42:59.220
these are questions we ask
our clients to answer.

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:02.470
And they're really obvious
questions that when I start to

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:03.690
show them to people they
start laughing.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:06.440
Like, ha, absurd questions.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.040
But they're very, very
difficult to answer.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.220
And you can--

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:15.260
I'm sure you've heard people
flounder with these questions

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:18.440
trying to answer them in
many, many situations.

00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:22.010
So for the idea entrepreneur,
I can give you the correct

00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:23.920
answer for each one of these.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:27.480
So the first one is, why
am I doing this?

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.350
And I cannot tell you the number
of times I've seen

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.440
people who say that, I want to
public with an idea, but they

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.790
can't say why.

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:35.570
What is driving them?

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:39.430
What is their purpose
in doing this?

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:42.260
And usually that means that
their purpose is that they

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.920
would like to become famous
in the ideaplex.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:48.200
They would love to have great
blog analytics, and have

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.570
people say, wow, I read
your cool book.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:51.220
That's really great.

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:55.820
It was on the front shelf at
Barnes Noble, or whatever.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.480
That is the wrong answer.

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.260
And the right answer is you want
to do something for other

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:03.130
people, and that is what's
driving you.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:05.330
I'm not saying that these idea
entrepreneurs are totally

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:07.910
selfless, that they don't have
healthy egos, but they really

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:09.600
want to do something that
changes the world for the

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:11.650
better as they see it.

00:44:11.650 --> 00:44:12.540
I found this for myself.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.950
We start working on a book and
you're so focused on, I got to

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:17.370
get this book done.

00:44:17.370 --> 00:44:18.250
Can I get it done?

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.470
What am I trying to say?

00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:21.150
But at some point
there's a flip.

00:44:21.150 --> 00:44:23.805
And you say, oh, I'm actually
trying to help people out with

00:44:23.805 --> 00:44:25.220
this thing.

00:44:25.220 --> 00:44:27.640
Number two, what do
I want to achieve?

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.230
This goes back to the metric.

00:44:29.230 --> 00:44:32.610
So very often you kind of throw
something out there and

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:34.520
say here's my idea.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.510
I'm doing it because
of whatever.

00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:40.820
But there's no specific
achievement that you're after.

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:44.250
And whether or not that's the
one you actually achieve, or

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:47.340
that's the one you keep focusing
on, you want to keep

00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:50.360
saying, what specifically do
I want to have happen?

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.260
And that usually goes to
the practices also.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.000
So do I want to see people
referring to me?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.750
Do I want to see people
referring to my ideas?

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.380
Do I want to see them put
them into practice?

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:02.310
This third one, what is my
personal connection?

00:45:02.310 --> 00:45:03.980
This is really tough.

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:06.990
And most of our clients really
struggle with this.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:09.920
They don't-- you know, we're
taught in organizations not to

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:12.816
get personal, to keep it all
in the argument, keep it on

00:45:12.816 --> 00:45:15.810
the data, but you have to
bring in these personal

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:17.090
connections.

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:19.090
Very tough to do.

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:19.710
Who am I talking to?

00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:25.300
We talked about the audiences,
but very often somebody will

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.810
go out with an idea and they
will talk to the people who do

00:45:27.810 --> 00:45:29.160
not need to be convinced,
people

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.220
who are already convinced.

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:34.960
So you've got to find a way
to that direct audience.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:38.580
And the final one is what is my
idea in a single sentence?

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:40.030
And this is really hard to do.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:42.060
I try to do it myself
every day and

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:43.670
sometimes I can't do it.

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:46.310
But you keep trying to refine
it because the world will do

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:47.410
that for you.

00:45:47.410 --> 00:45:49.910
They will say, oh, he's the
guy who talks about the

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:51.830
ideaplex thing.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:53.350
And that's all you're
going to get.

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:53.550
All right.

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.940
That's all you're
going to get.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.450
So if your idea-- if your
sentence isn't really good and

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.540
if you haven't shaped if for
yourself, they're going to do

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:01.600
it for you and you're not
going to be happy

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:03.060
with it half the time.

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.505
So keep working on that.

00:46:04.505 --> 00:46:07.480
AUDIENCE: Because that's
a form of expression.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:07.950
JOHN BUTMAN: Sorry?

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.340
AUDIENCE: That's a form
of expression.

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.000
JOHN BUTMAN: Oh yeah, I've
missed that one.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.050
We talked about that.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:15.350
Think about that, your best
form of expression.

00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:19.500
So if after looking at these
questions and thinking about

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.690
your idea and who you're trying
to reach, if you decide

00:46:21.690 --> 00:46:25.090
not to go public with
your idea, I applaud

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:26.010
you for that decision.

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.660
It's a really, really
good decision.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:32.180
And more people should decide,
I don't think I'm ready, or I

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.210
don't think the idea is strong
enough, or I don't think I

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:35.470
could get to the audience.

00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:37.920
Or I don't want to really
deal with the ideaplex.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.400
I think part of the reason we
have this glut is everybody

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.220
thinks, oh, I'll just take
it out, and I'll

00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:42.840
take my idea out.

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:45.820
I'll change the world, it will
be great, and don't do all

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:46.360
this stuff.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:48.780
And so we have to sort of weed
through all this stuff.

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:53.250
So please, if you say no to
yourself, that's really good.

00:46:53.250 --> 00:46:54.740
But if you think about these
questions, you think, well,

00:46:54.740 --> 00:46:55.916
maybe I will.

00:46:55.916 --> 00:47:00.310
The sort of the one question you
can ask that is absolutely

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:05.780
definitive is, can I not not
go public with this idea?

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.810
If you are so driven that you
don't care about everything I

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:11.990
said, you say, I cannot
not help myself.

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:13.430
I cannot not go public.

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:17.450
Then I say to you, godspeed
and good luck.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:18.700
Now thank you very much.

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:24.530
So we got a few minutes
for questions, or

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:26.270
thoughts, or comments.

00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.954
Yeah.

00:47:26.954 --> 00:47:28.436
AUDIENCE: I'm fascinated
with the backlash.

00:47:28.436 --> 00:47:32.772
And I would like to hear you
expound a little bit more on--

00:47:32.772 --> 00:47:35.490
just say what you want to say
about [INAUDIBLE] your

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:36.150
observations.

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:38.380
JOHN BUTMAN: Well, especially
with social media, it's so

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:42.100
easy for people to
backlash at you.

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:45.340
It's a fundamental part of it.

00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:48.140
I think it's actually a healthy
part of it, because if

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:52.300
you don't hear people's
objections to your ideas,

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.710
either they're being polite
or your idea isn't really

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:56.560
different enough and it's
probably not worth

00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:57.300
considering.

00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:00.620
So you really actually want
backlash and you want

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:01.730
intelligent backlash.

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:04.440
You want considerate backlash
where you can actually engage

00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.740
in discussion with people.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:08.470
And then you need to decide, so
what's the cut off point?

00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:12.760
We've had people make comments
on our blogs, or on Twitter,

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.950
and you just say, well, sort
of look into the person and

00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:17.760
say, this is not coming from
anywhere that's useful and

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.440
just kind of ignore it.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.410
But it's very hard to do because
idea entrepreneurs

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:24.260
think, I am good.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.950
I'm trying to change the world
for the better and these

00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:29.010
people are thinking I'm bad.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:31.000
And it's hurtful.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.120
So you just have to accept that
and say it's actually a

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.610
good, healthy part
of the process.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:36.420
Yeah.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.910
AUDIENCE: You referenced
some clients.

00:48:38.910 --> 00:48:42.396
I'm curious as to what sorts
of clients you had?

00:48:42.396 --> 00:48:42.894
Businesses?

00:48:42.894 --> 00:48:44.388
Or individuals?

00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:46.420
JOHN BUTMAN: Yeah,
so, I don't--

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.820
I think I can't tell
you exactly,

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:49.300
specifically who they are.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.430
But I can tell you sort of
generically who they are.

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:55.590
So working, for example, with
the president of a large

00:48:55.590 --> 00:48:57.910
philanthropic organization.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:59.760
And she has--

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.950
they have one basic theme
that they want to

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:02.650
get out to the world.

00:49:02.650 --> 00:49:04.572
And say this is where we're
putting all of our money and

00:49:04.572 --> 00:49:05.560
all of our effort.

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.520
So she's doing a whole campaign,
she's doing a book,

00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.250
she's doing a bunch of
other activities.

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:11.740
So, she authors the book, we're
helping her think about

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.626
the ideas and create the book.

00:49:13.626 --> 00:49:17.880
We're working with a serial
entrepreneur was is also a

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.580
lecturer at the Media Lab.

00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:22.030
He's talking about the
future of technology.

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:24.300
So he wants to become sort of
the guru of the next wave of

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:25.660
technology.

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:29.190
We are working with a
guy who has been in

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:31.110
investment for a long time.

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:33.155
And he believes that
the history of--

00:49:33.155 --> 00:49:35.480
the whole story of investment
has never been told.

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:37.930
And the reason that we are in
such a mess financially is

00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:39.840
that people don't understand
what they did with their money

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:44.030
at all, and all they do is get
tips from people who have self

00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:45.320
interest at heart.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:48.420
So he wants to write this book
and get it out there.

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:51.380
So these people have the
means to support this.

00:49:51.380 --> 00:49:54.270
And they're going out-- these
are the ones sort of at the--

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:56.406
well, not the entrepreneur, but
the other two are sort of

00:49:56.406 --> 00:49:58.090
at the end of their careers.

00:49:58.090 --> 00:49:59.135
We worked with a number
of consultants.

00:49:59.135 --> 00:50:01.810
We're working with a French
consultant right now.

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:04.400
And his whole-- he's an
organizational guy.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.060
So he believes that
organizations are dealing with

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:09.740
complexity in all
the wrong ways.

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:12.920
That instead of dealing with
complexity through human

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.470
intelligence, we're trying to
make our organizations so

00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:18.880
rule-bound and complicated to
try to cover every possible

00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:21.120
contingency, which
is impossible.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.014
So those are some of the kinds
of people we're dealing with.

00:50:24.014 --> 00:50:24.988
Yeah.

00:50:24.988 --> 00:50:30.345
AUDIENCE: To just go back a
little bit to the to backlash.

00:50:30.345 --> 00:50:31.806
There's--

00:50:31.806 --> 00:50:36.189
do you have ideas that generate
a lot of backlash,

00:50:36.189 --> 00:50:38.320
they get a lot of air
time, because

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.190
everyone loves the debate.

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:44.880
Do you find that in the long
run, that ideas that are the

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.832
stickiest, that sort of permeate
and change the

00:50:47.832 --> 00:50:50.538
thinking of everyone, do those
tend to be, or generate less

00:50:50.538 --> 00:50:52.506
backlash up front or more
backlash up front?

00:50:52.506 --> 00:50:53.990
Do you have a sense of that?

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:55.120
JOHN BUTMAN: That's a really
good question.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.730
I haven't really thought
that one through.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:51:00.270
But my feeling is that people
respond much better over the

00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:03.730
long run to people who are
really genuine, are not

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:07.390
deliberately trying to create
controversy, and really want

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:08.305
to help you.

00:51:08.305 --> 00:51:13.190
And the ideas may be difficult,
but they're not

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:14.400
deliberately controversial.

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.860
So my hunch is--

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.610
I think this is probably
your hunch--

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:19.660
is that those ones that really
spike and get a lot of

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:21.980
attention tend to disappear.

00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:25.140
And the ones that really, really
last are the ones that

00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.430
are deeper and stronger, and
they generate conversation,

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:30.180
but not so much backlash.

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:34.850
It's interesting, if you look
at on the Harvard blog site,

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:36.610
there's a real difference
between blogs that get a lot

00:51:36.610 --> 00:51:40.490
of comments and the ones that
get a lot of readership.

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:43.650
So very often the ones that get
a ton of comments, they

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:45.020
don't last very long.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:47.350
So it's just like sticking your
finger in people's eye,

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:48.870
and they want to
talk about it.

00:51:48.870 --> 00:51:52.650
It doesn't mean that
it's lasting.

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.141
Yeah.

00:51:54.141 --> 00:51:55.962
AUDIENCE: Back to the
respiration, a lot of what you

00:51:55.962 --> 00:51:59.276
talked about had to do around
credibility, like when you

00:51:59.276 --> 00:52:01.596
mentioned that Cesar Millan
really establishes tangible

00:52:01.596 --> 00:52:04.081
credibility, immediately
and another example.

00:52:04.081 --> 00:52:07.725
And in both cases, they are--
that their credibility, they

00:52:07.725 --> 00:52:10.680
are pretty immediately
recognized, and so that's part

00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.150
of the influence, that there's
immediate connection.

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:19.860
How do you factor in some of
these ideas take time for the

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:25.110
recognition of impact and
how does that become

00:52:25.110 --> 00:52:26.610
a variable in influence?

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.410
JOHN BUTMAN: So, how long
does it take to--

00:52:29.410 --> 00:52:30.540
AUDIENCE: Does that matter?

00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.060
JOHN BUTMAN: It does matter.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:35.350
I think there's usually a very
long accumulation period.

00:52:35.350 --> 00:52:37.410
And people are, they're doing
all this, they're doing

00:52:37.410 --> 00:52:39.510
respiration, they're doing
expression, but it hasn't

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.330
become really well known yet.

00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:43.310
So Cesar Millan did a lot
of stuff, but then

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:44.680
he got this TV show.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:46.935
He was actually approached to
do a TV show and that's, he

00:52:46.935 --> 00:52:48.950
just, spiked him.

00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:53.380
But, Mireille Guiliano spent
four decades gathering stuff.

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:55.545
People kept saying to her, you
have to write this book, you

00:52:55.545 --> 00:52:56.555
have to write this book.

00:52:56.555 --> 00:52:58.200
She said I don't want
to write this book.

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.220
My mother told me you should
never write books because

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.280
that's too self-aggrandizing.

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:05.400
And her friend finally said,
forget about your mother, it's

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:07.810
about helping other people
because I've seen you do it.

00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:09.280
And she said, OK, now
I understand that

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:10.620
that's what it's for.

00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:15.440
So when people come to us and
say, I want to be the thought

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:22.120
leader in this thing
by the end of 2014.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:26.730
Sorry, no can guarantee that.

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:31.390
You have to have accumulated the
stuff, you have to go out

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:34.660
there and create respiration,
which you cannot be sure is

00:53:34.660 --> 00:53:36.010
going to happen.

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:37.602
And it can take a long time.

00:53:37.602 --> 00:53:39.690
Yeah.

00:53:39.690 --> 00:53:40.315
Somebody else, yeah.

00:53:40.315 --> 00:53:42.622
AUDIENCE: If we want to be good
at speaking, presenting,

00:53:42.622 --> 00:53:44.614
and connecting with audiences,
what are

00:53:44.614 --> 00:53:46.108
good ways to get practice?

00:53:46.108 --> 00:53:46.610
JOHN BUTMAN: Ha.

00:53:46.610 --> 00:53:48.050
That's a great question.

00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:51.890
You know, take any invitation
you could think of.

00:53:51.890 --> 00:53:54.740
And if you can't get any
invitations, then call

00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:57.560
somebody you know and say, can I
come over to your company at

00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.540
lunch and talk?

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:00.750
Almost--

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:01.240
AUDIENCE: Well, we have
a post-masters

00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:02.920
group right in Google.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.750
JOHN BUTMAN: Oh yeah?

00:54:03.750 --> 00:54:05.490
I mean, you can speak--
there's always

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:07.060
somewhere to speak.

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:08.870
You know we, at the very
beginning-- we've done a whole

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:11.410
bunch of talks-- but at the very
beginning we just called

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:13.220
some of our friends and we
said, we've got this book

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:16.380
coming out, could we come
at lunch and just do

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.160
an hour long thing?

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.250
They said, yeah, why not?

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:22.150
So you can always just brow beat
people to let you talk.

00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:23.180
And at the very worst.

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.320
You do what I call the
cocktail party test.

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:29.090
No matter where you are, with
anybody at anytime, as tedious

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:33.500
as it might be, you just start
telling them your idea.

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:37.300
And if-- you say my new idea
is blah, blah, blah.

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:38.950
And if their response is, oh,
that's really interesting

00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:40.960
because I was thinking the same
thing, you know you're

00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:41.850
onto something.

00:54:41.850 --> 00:54:43.700
If their response
is, so, where'd

00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:45.310
you spend your vacation?

00:54:45.310 --> 00:54:48.490
Then you probably have
not hit it yet.

00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:50.040
But you can always find
a place to talk.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:51.590
That's a really good question.

00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:52.050
Anybody else?

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:52.964
Yeah.

00:54:52.964 --> 00:54:55.706
AUDIENCE: This is a question
about if you recall the

00:54:55.706 --> 00:54:57.080
iconical form, like the--

00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:58.640
JOHN BUTMAN: The iconic
moments, you mean?

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:01.496
AUDIENCE: Well, the sort of
idealized form of the idea

00:55:01.496 --> 00:55:03.400
that you put out there.

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.020
AUDIENCE: Sacred expression.

00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:05.140
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry?

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:07.960
Sacred expression.

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:11.370
There are, I've seen a pattern,
a very few data

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:15.100
points, of books like "The
Long Tail," "Blue Ocean

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:21.494
Strategies," you know,
some of these sort of

00:55:21.494 --> 00:55:22.472
big business books.

00:55:22.472 --> 00:55:23.613
JOHN BUTMAN: Yeah, big
idea business books.

00:55:23.613 --> 00:55:24.428
AUDIENCE: Big idea
business books.

00:55:24.428 --> 00:55:31.670
That started with or mapped to
a article in "Wired" or in--

00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.870
JOHN BUTMAN: "HBR."

00:55:31.870 --> 00:55:33.862
AUDIENCE: "HBR," something
like that.

00:55:33.862 --> 00:55:38.768
And, I've always found my path
through has been, someone

00:55:38.768 --> 00:55:40.655
points me to the article, I read
the article, get really

00:55:40.655 --> 00:55:41.350
excited about it.

00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:44.020
Read the book, they're like,
why did that take 200 more

00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:45.700
pages to say the same thing
as in the article?

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:50.980
Are those authors doing
the right thing by

00:55:50.980 --> 00:55:51.735
writing their books?

00:55:51.735 --> 00:55:53.880
Or are they, or should
they just--

00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.690
JOHN BUTMAN: Well, I think there
are two answers to that.

00:55:55.690 --> 00:55:57.620
One is, many of those
articles are written

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.080
after the book is written.

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.260
And they couldn't write
the article until

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:01.930
they write the book.

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:03.370
Because they had to go through
the process of writing the

00:56:03.370 --> 00:56:05.640
book to get all those ideas.

00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.840
Then it's so wonderful because
you can just squish them down

00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:08.860
into an article.

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:10.440
That's why the article
is so good.

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:12.850
And so often you'll find that
the articles that are less

00:56:12.850 --> 00:56:14.580
good do not come from a book.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:16.465
If you-- a lot of the stuff
you read in the "The New

00:56:16.465 --> 00:56:19.190
Yorker," for example, is
excerpted from books.

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:22.010
So you get the benefit
from all that extra

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:24.800
work in this article.

00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:25.120
But, yeah.

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:28.430
I mean, very often you don't
need the rest of it.

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:30.780
But you do need the book.

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:34.520
And what we've come to the
conclusion is that all idea

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:37.350
entrepreneurs need a book.

00:56:37.350 --> 00:56:38.720
It may not be their
sacred expression,

00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:39.960
but they need a book.

00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:42.290
And I can't tell you-- people
come to me and say, you know,

00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:43.200
I'm talking.

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:46.900
I just did my TED Talk, I've
been blogging like crazy.

00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.050
I've got to have the book.

00:56:48.050 --> 00:56:49.700
Everybody wants the book.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.270
And if you think about, the book
does a lot of things for

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:53.970
you that nothing else does.

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:57.080
So, I mean, people still think
of it as sort of the ultimate

00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.420
emblem of learning.

00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.530
I can write a book.

00:56:59.530 --> 00:57:03.140
We've been told forever that
book is the ultimate

00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:04.880
expression.

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:10.150
It's this very handy device you
can just hand to people.

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:12.590
It's an entry to the ideaplex
because that's how

00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:12.950
you get into it.

00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:16.350
You say, his new book,
as opposed to he just

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:18.460
posted a cat video.

00:57:18.460 --> 00:57:20.460
That's not getting you
on Charlie Rose.

00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:21.900
You got to have--

00:57:21.900 --> 00:57:23.820
the book does a lot
of things for you.

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:28.165
But, you know, your criticism
is very well taken.

00:57:28.165 --> 00:57:29.300
Many people feel the same way.

00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.890
Do I need to read this
entire book?

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:32.890
And often, you don't.

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:35.890
AUDIENCE: Have you written
an article form of this?

00:57:35.890 --> 00:57:37.874
JOHN BUTMAN: We did--

00:57:37.874 --> 00:57:40.950
we have not written an article
in "HBR," but we've done

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:44.518
articles in various different
places, yeah.

00:57:44.518 --> 00:57:46.446
Other questions?

00:57:46.446 --> 00:57:46.928
Yes.

00:57:46.928 --> 00:57:50.302
AUDIENCE: So what is it the
metric that you are measuring

00:57:50.302 --> 00:57:51.266
yourself against?

00:57:51.266 --> 00:57:52.712
Is it tweets?

00:57:52.712 --> 00:57:54.650
Followers?

00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:56.620
JOHN BUTMAN: The number of--

00:57:56.620 --> 00:58:02.100
the number, fewer clients that
come to knock on our door.

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:02.840
What is the metric?

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:05.310
That's a really good one.

00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:07.575
The one on one metric really
means the most to me.

00:58:07.575 --> 00:58:10.210
And that's one I'm paying
most attention to.

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:13.410
So that's kind of what
I'm focusing on now.

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:16.120
And we're still in the
early days here.

00:58:16.120 --> 00:58:19.860
But if we could hear
people say--

00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:25.370
if we could get this model out
there and get some sense that

00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:28.320
people are kind of evaluating
ideas through this model, that

00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.570
would be great.

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:32.390
Great.

00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:33.640
Thank you very much.
