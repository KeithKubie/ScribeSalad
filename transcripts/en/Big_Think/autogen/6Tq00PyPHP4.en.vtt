00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.649 align:start position:0%
then fast as you can that allowed slug
down<00:01:22.799><c> some</c><00:01:23.070><c> water</c><00:01:23.280><c> swallow</c><00:01:23.850><c> and</c><00:01:24.240><c> then</c><00:01:24.420><c> keep</c>

going as fast again Hey look that I
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.140 align:start position:0%
going as fast again Hey look that I
thought<00:01:26.310><c> is</c><00:01:26.490><c> that</c><00:01:26.880><c> really</c><00:01:27.299><c> the</c><00:01:27.780><c> right</c><00:01:27.990><c> way</c><00:01:28.259><c> to</c>
