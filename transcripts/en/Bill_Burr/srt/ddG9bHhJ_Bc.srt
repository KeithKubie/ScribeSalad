5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,100
you're almost through the week. Some of

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,380
I don't know how it fucking
works, but um, yeah,

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:27,510
I'm just here to check in on you
just for the fucking half an hour.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,140
I hope you guys enjoyed the very special
edition to the Monday morning podcast

9
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:36,000
that was put out yesterday with uh,
the great,

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,280
the Great Jim Norton promoting his new
standup special that you can watch now on

11
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:45,750
Netflix. Mouthful of shame. I've heard
nothing but great things about it.

12
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:50,340
I have yet to see it because uh,
you know,

13
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,430
I only got so much fucking time now with
the little kid running around who just,

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,420
it just keeps getting better every day.
Just keeps getting better every day.

15
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:00,210
I Dunno what the fuck people
complain about, about having a kid.

16
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:03,190
It's fucking awesome.
Oh my God,

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,720
you going to do good as opposed to what?

18
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,950
Sitting alone in your apartment
do all the free time.

19
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:14,800
In the fucking world.
Slowly drinking yourself to death.

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,140
Cause I'll tell you that bit up those
sides of the fence like in this side a

21
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:22,780
little better.
Let's say in every once in awhile.

22
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:27,870
Every once in a while I don't have visit
my old friends that my fucking 83 70

23
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,080
sixers level bar that I have,
I always throw,

24
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:36,220
I always give a shout out to the 83 76 in,
cause every talks about the 96 bowls.

25
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,550
Everybody talks about the 27 Yankees.

26
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:43,930
What about the 1983
Philadelphia 70 sixers. Huh?

27
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,510
I would love to throw
the 86 Celtics in there,

28
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,410
but the fucking Lakers choked
against the Houston Rockets.

29
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,870
So I mean sort of a a,

30
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:57,370
you know when in the 80s it didn't mean
you didn't really feel like you won a

31
00:01:57,371 --> 00:02:01,420
championship unless you beat the Celtics
and the Lakers. That's basically it.

32
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,190
That's, that's my, you know,

33
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:07,120
no disrespect to Ralph fucking Sampson.

34
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,160
No fucking disrespect.

35
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:13,800
Do Chemo [inaudible] Lucy on a
TV or they have fucking treat.

36
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,720
No tree Rollins was Atlanta.
I don't remember.

37
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:19,450
They had very similar uniforms
in my memory bank. In fact,

38
00:02:19,451 --> 00:02:23,260
I think they had the exact same colors,
just Houston Rockets was less busy.

39
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,760
More traditional like the Detroit Red
Wings, jersey, simple red and white,

40
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,610
Toronto, blue and white sit.
It's over. These are our colors.

41
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,230
Fuck you somebody.

42
00:02:35,231 --> 00:02:39,070
Please explain to me how the Tampa Bay
fucking lightning also can wear blue and

43
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:42,100
white. I don't understand that. You know,

44
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,280
it's like the Pittsburgh Penguins when
they came back wearing black and gold,

45
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:46,270
it's like what the fuck?

46
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,920
Bard Nick told me that the original
fucking hockey team in Pittsburgh did wear

47
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:54,910
black and gold. But then yeah, but then
you folded and you left it on the table.

48
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:56,980
It's like when you don't
renew your fucking website,

49
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,750
somebody else is going get it. Um,
I don't know what I'm talking about.

50
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,950
All I know is I have to plow through this
next fucking half an hour just to see

51
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:08,470
how you're doing. Whatever. Maybe I'm
going to catch you on the ride home.

52
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,750
You know, worst case scenario,
you got one fucking day left.

53
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,710
Use a sick day, take a three
day weekend. You know, you know,

54
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,670
it was actually thinking now is
this is the time of year where, uh,

55
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,480
the spring break,
I wonder what kids do nowadays.

56
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:29,980
It's gotta be a way where they can
get out of the view of the constant

57
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:32,890
surveillance of your parents.
Now,

58
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,140
you know what I mean?
Jesus Christ.

59
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:38,000
By the time my daughter
gets to that fucking age,

60
00:03:38,001 --> 00:03:43,001
I'll probably be able to have a drone
like hovering over her for her the entire

61
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:47,750
fucking existence.
I'll just shout down from the sky,

62
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,520
you know, on a dog. Go to that
party, just freaking around.

63
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,020
She'd be looking up like dad,

64
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,413
oh,

65
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,210
so shaken my dad hovering over me in a
hoe and a fucking whatever the fuck it's

66
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:04,690
called. That will literally
be helicopter parenting.

67
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,570
No,
it's fucking drones.

68
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,570
I went to something recently and I guess
the gift bag was a drone. It's like,

69
00:04:10,571 --> 00:04:15,120
why would you give people those things?
It's not intrusive enough.

70
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:20,070
All this fucking technology that all these
fucking Weirdos, you know what I mean?

71
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,970
I want to know the first time a drone
is going to seriously give somebody's

72
00:04:25,971 --> 00:04:30,500
brain damage because the operator was
trying to jerk off while they were trying

73
00:04:30,501 --> 00:04:31,440
to operate.
It

74
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:38,030
is there hovering over somebody's
fucking house, you know,

75
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,660
try to come down to the bathroom.
This already perverts doing that.

76
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,390
Perverts fascinate me, man.
They fascinated me. Say Blanket.

77
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,180
You just walk up and say hello. They can't
do it. But then they have these needs,

78
00:04:50,181 --> 00:04:53,750
right? So then they got to peek
around the corner. You know,

79
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,290
speaking of Pekin peaky blinders,

80
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,950
one of my favorite fucking shows is
come on over the last five years, um,

81
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,480
I was on a,
uh,

82
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,680
an airplane flying back from Austin,

83
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:11,840
from the south by southwest
festival. Um, which, yeah,

84
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,880
I can't tell you another time when you
would not want to be in Austin. You know,

85
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,790
I mean, it's great for films in that
type of Shit, but it's just like,

86
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:22,790
I don't know, man. I don't know
what happened to that city.

87
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,880
I've been going there for the last 20
years. It just gets more and more crowded.

88
00:05:25,881 --> 00:05:30,881
It's like a bunch of sweaty
hippies with LH level traffic.

89
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,790
That's what south by southwest is.
And I don't know what it is.

90
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:37,970
Every white person in
Austin during that week,

91
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:41,240
they all look like they play hacky sack,
you know,

92
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,930
I dunno if there's just
something about the, uh,

93
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,180
did disheveled on purpose colleged
age white kid that I know.

94
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,560
I even when I went to college,
I wasn't like that, you know,

95
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:59,600
fucking combed my hair when
I still had here. Right.

96
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,170
I didn't try to fucking look
like I lived out on the street.

97
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:07,690
That was like a big guy thing back then
to try to look all fucking disheveled.

98
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,120
Like guy could barely take care of myself.
But look at my college id.

99
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:14,180
Look at my crazy picture.
It's like, dude, you did.

100
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:16,730
All of the sudden this whole
fucking thing is on purpose.

101
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,900
The end of the fucking day,
if your back's against the wall,

102
00:06:20,901 --> 00:06:22,610
you can call your mom and dad.
All right,

103
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:26,870
so fucking calm your hair and put on a
clean shirt, right? You can't, I'm sorry.

104
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,660
Why did I say all of that? Anyways, I, um,

105
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:32,991
this was my day.

106
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:36,380
I actually was flying out there at
that day to do the all things, comedy,

107
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,990
podcasts and then fly right
back. So I, uh, I'm like,

108
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:42,501
this is great.

109
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,810
I've always wanted to go to the airport
and just have like nothing and just

110
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:46,670
walked in,
you know,

111
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,810
like Leonardo Dicaprio in catch me if he
came every just come fucking walking in

112
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,810
wearing this little fucking,
I know how to fly plain outfit.

113
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,680
That's what the fuck I wanted to do,
minus that outfit. So I put on sweatpants,

114
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,100
you know,
and whatever fucking tee shirt jacket.

115
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:04,250
And I had my change of clothes and
toiletries in this backpack and that was

116
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:06,950
fucking it.
All right.

117
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,130
Went in there like a Goddamn drifter and
I get all the way to the airport and I

118
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,030
realize I forgot my fucking wallet.
Right.

119
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:19,970
So I can't get on the fucking plane
cause I don't have any form of

120
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:23,840
identification. I don't have my
college id man from back in the day.

121
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:29,290
And, um, what did I have?

122
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,230
Um,
I ended up having to go,

123
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,850
yeah,

124
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:36,190
I didn't know what to do. I was like,
I'm gonna miss this fucking fun.

125
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,140
I'm actually thinking now that my dad,

126
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,070
she did grow my hair out a little bit in
college, but I still dress respectfully.

127
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,660
Maybe I was a hybrid. I can't fucking
remember was so fucking long ago. Anyways,

128
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,030
so I fucking get to the airport.

129
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:53,540
I don't have my Goddamn id and I don't
know what the fuck to do and I have to

130
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,374
make this,

131
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:59,000
this podcast cause his advertisers
and all that type of shit.

132
00:07:59,001 --> 00:08:00,620
You can't say this is the lineup.

133
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,260
This is the projected amount of
people that are going to listen.

134
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:07,670
It's a business and then not show up
and take the fucking money. So, uh,

135
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:10,400
I didn't know what to
do. So I ended up, uh,

136
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,260
the first time ever I flew private
and blue a fucking ton of cash.

137
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,740
So I'm going to be playing a bunch of
casinos coming up to make up for the money

138
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,710
that I, uh, that I spent on,

139
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:26,700
that I flew out of Van Nuys
like a fucking rock star,

140
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,860
lit up my card, literally glowing in
my pocket. I had to fuck a drive home,

141
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:33,110
get my wallet, fly out, you know,

142
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:38,111
drive out there and then sit there and
then talk to these fucking savages just

143
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:42,290
being like, oh, you need a plane
right now. Ah Yeah, really,

144
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,110
that'll be 1 million bucks.
And I'm like,

145
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:49,250
fuck you with somebody else.
And they're like,

146
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,320
it'll be a half a million.
I'm like, fuck you.

147
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:54,980
And all you do is you just keep calling
people and after awhile you just start

148
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,830
saying numbers and um,
I got it.

149
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,450
I got it way the fuck down for whatever
they first quoted me. I have that,

150
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,440
got it down to half that, but still
cost a fucking zillion bucks. So, uh,

151
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,870
I get on the plane talking to the
pilots to like, right fucking,

152
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:16,710
there was a smaller plane, like when
I went to take a Piss, I'm like,

153
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:18,540
do you guys have a bathroom here?
They're like, yeah, they do.

154
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,170
When they had to move the snacks and
then they closed that little door and I'm

155
00:09:22,171 --> 00:09:26,220
taking a piss right on the other
side of the fucking door and like,

156
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,290
you can't stand up in the
plane. So I am stand up, but I,

157
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:35,291
I'm acting like I have osteoporosis and
I'm trying to take a fucking piss and

158
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,270
there's, there's an angle you have to be
at so you don't piss on your own fucking

159
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:39,870
sweatpants.

160
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:43,560
But eventually the velocity of the urine
coming out of your Dick is going to

161
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:45,900
slow down and it's going to
come towards your clothes.

162
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,020
So then you gotta make a decision. What
am I going? How am I going to do this?

163
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,370
How far down am I going to pull my pants?
What the fuck's going on?

164
00:09:53,371 --> 00:09:56,940
Like that weird kid. Remember that weird
kid when you were in elementary school?

165
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,780
You went in to take a piss and the kid
had his pants all the way down around his

166
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:04,620
ankles. It's like, why didn't
you just fucking on Zip? You fly,

167
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,440
you know what's going on here?
So,

168
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,120
and then old town,
I'm just thinking like,

169
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:16,590
how is this better than flying on a
commercial airline? I don't get it.

170
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,520
You know what, if you fly in business of
first, if you bump yourself up, um, the,

171
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:23,280
I am one and done on that shit.
I just think it's the,

172
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:25,560
it's a colossal fucking waste of money.

173
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,090
And I have the glowing fucking
credit card right now to prove it.

174
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,750
And um,
there's just no money in it.

175
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:37,380
The fucking people who rent the
planes of barely making any money,

176
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:39,810
the pilots don't make any money.
All the pilots,

177
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:44,640
one eventually fly for commercial,
a commercial airline, right? I mean,

178
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,010
they're still flying commercial private
or they want to fly for like, you know,

179
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,660
one of the major airlines
is what I'm trying to say.

180
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,660
So one of the pilots came back and
he's talking to me. He goes, yeah,

181
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,960
we got some beers here. And I'm like,
I'm on the wagon. But I'm like, well,

182
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:56,430
what the fuck? I spent all this
money, I got to have a beer.

183
00:10:56,431 --> 00:11:00,840
So I drank a cores light, like the
white trash count that I am. And um,

184
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,870
he sitting there talking to me and uh,
I'm all fascinated with the,

185
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,650
all the aviation aspects of it.

186
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:11,880
And I'm sitting there and looking at
the guy and he had a tear in his slacks

187
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:14,850
right at his knee. Like
there was a, like a,

188
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,160
like a vertical slice,

189
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,730
like he was in a knife fight and
just so many sliced it a little bit.

190
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:24,150
And I was just going like,
there's no fucking money in this.

191
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,210
What this guy's doing right now define
the law of gravity getting me from Los

192
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,320
Angeles to Austin. He doesn't
get lost. He knows where to go.

193
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:39,210
He knows what altitude to fly at.
We had a nice fucking landing. We,

194
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:42,930
my life is literally in this guy's hand
and they don't pay this guy enough money

195
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:48,030
that he can fly this fucking jet without
a pair of pants that have fucking

196
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:52,590
ripped. You know, maybe that's why
all those kids fucking annoyed me.

197
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,930
You know what, he's, I didn't fit,
you know, when I was in Austin,

198
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,050
cause I'm seeing a guy who actually
really is struggling flying of fucking jet

199
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:04,010
and he has fucking a ripped slacks.
Who knows?

200
00:12:04,011 --> 00:12:07,250
Maybe he just had a rough night. He
had a rough one. Maybe just passed out.

201
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,950
I don't fucking know. Anyways. Um,

202
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,080
I remember when I was in college
and uh, yeah, like I, I did,

203
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,430
I was never that fucking rebel guy.

204
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,530
I remember walking by this chick one time
and I just had like mainstream clothes

205
00:12:21,531 --> 00:12:23,930
on.
I had like a polo shirt and regular shit.

206
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:27,620
I remember I walked by and she
just goes, Ooh, hot labels.

207
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,090
I just want to be like,
you fucking golf.

208
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,900
Can you look like every other fucking
got caught here? Do you guys all,

209
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:42,070
I don't know what fucking every blacks,
everything painted black store.

210
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:44,800
You fucking walking.
You all have the same fucking makeup.

211
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,590
Y'All have the same fucking lipstick.

212
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,470
Yeah. I just, you know, cause
there's no goth food court.

213
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:56,230
You feel like you're out of the year
out of the reach of the corporations.

214
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:00,700
I'll never forget that. Ooh, hot labels.

215
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,790
And I kind of liked her too cause a lot
of those got chicks with cute, you know,

216
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:07,930
if you could get past the fucking,
you know, now a days I would actually,

217
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:12,490
I would totally steer clear of them
knowing what I know. It's like, Oh God,

218
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,430
let me, I would have one question. Do
you or do you not hate your parents?

219
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:23,770
You do and say, ah, I'm not
fucking going through that shit.

220
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,020
Those fucking long talks about everything
that they did to you. You know?

221
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:31,330
And you know what? My parents
did shit to, you know,

222
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,220
and I'm a parent now and
I'm going to do shit.

223
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,030
You know that doesn't mean you got to
fucking walk around dressed like you were

224
00:13:37,031 --> 00:13:37,864
in awake.

225
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,983
Okay.

226
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,960
I mean, why are you dressed like
that? Cause you got bullied.

227
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,680
Now look at you now you're just
bringing this shit onto yourself.

228
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,370
What are you waiting for bullies
to become enlightened and be like,

229
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,400
oh I guess people have the right to be
different. It's not going to happen.

230
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,430
So at the very least,
if you're going to walk around like that,

231
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:59,100
it at least at some point
take the makeup off,

232
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,690
going to a Dojo and learn some fucking
MMA shit so you can protect yourself.

233
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,720
So I guess in the end of the day,
I'm not really attacking golf people.

234
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:11,700
I'm really saying a pellet fucker.
She still judged me, right?

235
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,013
Yeah.

236
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,520
Ooh,
hot labels.

237
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,540
I've seen one of those things where you
walk and you kind of stop for half a

238
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:23,560
second and then you, is it worth it?
It's not worth it. And I just kept going.

239
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,590
I forget what her fucking name was.

240
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,230
It was either Natasha a brook,

241
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:36,020
which was always a fucking hot girl name.
When I was growing up,

242
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:41,660
I never really saw a brook that wasn't
good looking. Natasha's were good looking.

243
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,400
Debbie's Debbie's, we'll fund Debbie's
were fun girl. It's weird like you give,

244
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,930
you give a fucking person a name,
you know what I mean? It was, I,

245
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,000
you know, just blending
in. Bill lost in the crowd.

246
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,220
Oh, mainstream bill with this corporate
clothes. Just walking down the street.

247
00:15:05,221 --> 00:15:08,430
I did have the Red Afro for awhile
when I got into fucking radio.

248
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,330
I fucking grew it out
a little bit. And, uh,

249
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,540
I think I had the beard or that's when
I got into drums and I was trying to be

250
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:16,580
in a band and that sort of,

251
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,260
I was trying to grow my hair
out and it just went out,

252
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,980
which would have been cool in the sixties
or seventies I would've looked like

253
00:15:22,981 --> 00:15:27,030
Bernie from room to 22 but
by the 80s it wasn't cool.

254
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,760
You had to have the law and fucking
hand just never worked for me.

255
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:34,620
The comedy gods, they just pulled
me in. It's like, listen bill,

256
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,820
you'll look like a douche
no matter what you do. Okay.

257
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:44,430
You're not a good looking guy. You
look like a fucking freak. Okay.

258
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,010
The only hope for you is to stand on
stage and make fun of yourself and make a

259
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:54,840
little bit of money. Why didn't you want
to, you cash in on your Orange Afro?

260
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,710
You know, I think that that's what
was going on. And eventually I, I,

261
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,760
that's what I did.
That is exactly what I did.

262
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,430
And then when I was making enough money
in the business, uh, the comedy, God said,

263
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:10,380
okay, you don't need your orange afro
anymore. And they took it from me. Um,

264
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,620
I know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Oh,

265
00:16:13,621 --> 00:16:16,620
I know what I wanted to
bring up two weeks in a row.

266
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,580
I'm going to give you a great movie.
I told you I saw Jordan peals get out,

267
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,230
which is so fucking such a
great movie. And so, you know,

268
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,450
different from everything
else that's out there.

269
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:31,440
I'm actually going to enjoy
watching Hollywood now.

270
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:35,250
Try to rip that movie off.
It's like get out,

271
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,280
meet people who don't know
how to make a get out.

272
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,680
I think they're going to do the
Latino version. Um, however you say,

273
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,430
uh, get out in a Latino, you know,

274
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,600
Salado Vamonos I don't
what the fuck you say.

275
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,350
I'm starting to remember sesame street
and we had to enter and exit Ibn

276
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,910
[inaudible] out. Oh, that
was close. I don't fucking
room. I don't know. You know,

277
00:17:00,911 --> 00:17:01,430
whatever.

278
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:04,570
There's some fucking white guy will get
a reset of stone and he'll figure out

279
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:07,840
how to say it.
Don't try to rip off that movie.

280
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:11,830
That was a great movie. And this week, um,

281
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,860
I was on the plane ride back from Austin.
Wait a minute,

282
00:17:14,861 --> 00:17:19,810
typing in my password and I saw
the guy from peaky blinders.

283
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:23,770
Kilian Murphy don't know
nothing about no robbery.

284
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,160
Oh fuck you with the fucking password.
Hang on a second. God Damn it.

285
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,473
Okay.

286
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:35,790
Uh, there we go. It's called, I
don't know, I hope I say this right.

287
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:40,560
It's um,
anthropoid a n t h r o p.

288
00:17:40,561 --> 00:17:43,080
O. I. D and it's based on,

289
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:48,081
they say the extraordinary true
story of operation anthropoid uh,

290
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,530
the world war mission to attempt
to assassinate ss general.

291
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,310
I am hard Heidrich.
Um,

292
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,140
and what I love is it, it's a
story I never heard. You know,

293
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,910
granted I don't fucking read and it
takes place in a checklist of Aki and

294
00:18:05,911 --> 00:18:10,710
Prague. And I had no idea. I
knew that Germany, you know,

295
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:14,400
they lost I guess
Austria in World War One.

296
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,100
And then, uh, you know, a star came back
and he's just like on TV should have that.

297
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:25,100
And they just took fucking Austria
and nobody in Europe did anything.

298
00:18:25,101 --> 00:18:26,840
And everyone's just like,
well, well maybe that's,

299
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:30,860
maybe they'll just be happy with that
and we won't get involved in this fucking

300
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:33,800
world war thing again. And then I
thought he went immediately to Poland,

301
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,700
but evidently, oh, fucking evil.

302
00:18:37,701 --> 00:18:40,640
Charlie Chaplin himself
went to a checklist of,

303
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:45,710
I had no idea and, uh, made me want
to read up on the subject. And,

304
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,720
um, it's a fucking amazing,
amazing movie. And, uh,

305
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,440
it's one of those movies where,
uh, what they're talking about,

306
00:18:54,441 --> 00:18:57,560
the behavior was so heroic
as you're watching it,

307
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,530
you're actually sort of squirming going,
like,

308
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,020
how would I react? What I would
hope that I would be one of these,

309
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:12,140
you know, the good guys here as opposed
to the person just trying to blend in.

310
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:12,920
Well,

311
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,690
they're not coming after me and I just
sort of do whatever the fuck they see.

312
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:21,650
And I'll choose like self
preservation, which I gotta
be honest with you. Like, um,

313
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,270
I would never fault a parent for doing
that because once you get your kid like

314
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,810
you just like so focused on your fucking
kid, you just like fuck all adults,

315
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,090
you know, not fuck all adults.
It's a cycle. I'm not creating
a situation. Me, I go,

316
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,740
I I think I got a kid,
you know,

317
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,320
but you'd like to think like,
you know what?

318
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:44,730
Fuck that I'm going to teach my kid how
to shoot a fucking Uzi and let's go Nazi

319
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:46,950
hunting. You know, you'd like to
think that you were that person

320
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,490
as opposed to sitting there quietly
eating your soggy cornflakes.

321
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,543
You know,

322
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,320
this is the thing about being a
coward is if nobody else knows,

323
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:07,170
you'll forgive yourself.
You know,

324
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,120
it's other people know and it just
staring at your shoes for the, you know,

325
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:15,720
waiting for the people that know what
a coward you were during that time.

326
00:20:15,721 --> 00:20:17,700
Eventually die or you die or whatever.

327
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:22,650
But it's a fucking unbelievable
fucking movie. Absolutely loved it.

328
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:25,620
And um, directed by
Sean Ellis. I like this,

329
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:28,170
I like giving shout outs cause not a
lot of people go to movies anymore.

330
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,030
Shout outs,

331
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:33,600
all these fucking talented people
here and it stars a Jamie Dornan.

332
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,040
Kilian Murphy. I hope I said
that right. It's spelled c,

333
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:42,650
I. L. L. I. A. N. A. Come on.

334
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,680
You got to have a couple of broads
in here with some 11 inches, right?

335
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,390
I'm never going to say this.
Sarah Amro Savage Strava,

336
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,940
a fried joke joke.

337
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,120
These crisis is like trying to
name a fucking hockey player now.

338
00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:00,570
Hannah F R e J.

339
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,450
K O. V. A with a fucking
hatchet mark right above it.

340
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,500
I Dunno. It was a, it was
amazing. Very fucking movie.

341
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:13,030
Check it out if you get a
chance. If you're on American
Airlines, it's playing. Um,

342
00:21:13,031 --> 00:21:15,540
I don't know if they get extra money if
they do it that way. I Dunno. All right.

343
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,070
Anyways, let's read a little bit
of advertising here for this week.

344
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,230
What do we got here? Oh, but
oh, due to me on days, Mandy,

345

Bodu Dude,

you're wearing Yahtzee, ea fucking Ryan.

347
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:34,270
Fuck off you fucking
balls will feel real nice.

348
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:39,790
Shave your head if you got lice.
I like me undies on my Tate's.

349
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,430
It makes me have really good dreams.
Oh yeah.

350
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,370
Unlike the generic ones when you were
in Haines, right? Ooh, hot labels.

351
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:49,600
All right,
me undies.

352
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:51,190
Okay.

353
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,130
Oh Man. That one's stuck with, isn't it
amazing the things that stick with you?

354
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,370
That was almost 30 fucking years ago
and I still remember it like it was

355
00:21:57,371 --> 00:22:01,900
yesterday. Ooh. Hot labels. You know,

356
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,840
if I had a time machine, like I wouldn't
go back and try and stop Hitler.

357
00:22:04,841 --> 00:22:09,160
I'd go back to that moment in my life
so I could turn around and be like, God.

358
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:11,960
And that'll be, that'll
be it. That'll be it.

359
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:16,210
And I get right back in and I would leave
anyways.

360
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,750
Mandy's elevate your underwear
game, your underwear game, yo,

361
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,960
to the next level with me on these me,

362
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,770
you've perfected your wardrobe.
Hey, but what about the stuff?

363
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:31,360
Not everybody gets to see, man.
If you've been settling for store,

364
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:33,510
bought underwear,
five packs,

365
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:38,170
if you've been settling to go into the
fucking mall and buying a pack of five

366
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:41,650
pairs of underwear that some fucking
kid had to sew together in El Salvador,

367
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,620
if you're sick of going
through that difficult thing,

00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,470
I have something that will
change your life for the better,

369
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,840
and that is fucking me undies.

370
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,810
What's the first thing you put on
in the last thing you take off?

371
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,750
What does it do? Your underwear, right?

372
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,960
Unless you leave your hat on your
fucking Weirdo, it's your underwear.

373
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,590
Make your most important piece of clothing
the best it can be with me on these.

374
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,580
When's the last time you were completely
naked and you just had on a hat?

375
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,450
You know if there's anybody in the
room, they're fucking laughing, right?

376
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:14,380
You cannot be completely naked and
just have on a hat and not do a dance.

377
00:23:14,381 --> 00:23:16,250
It's impossible.
Especially if you guy,

378
00:23:16,251 --> 00:23:19,180
then you've got your junks fucking
shaking around. It's tremendous.

379
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:23,650
It's a great show. Actually. What is
me undies are just seriously soft.

380
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:25,810
Feel good undies delivered
right to your door.

381
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,080
Mandy's are designed in
Los Angeles or Louisiana.

382
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,120
They don't really say la and made
from sustainable sourced micro modal,

383
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:37,270
modal fabric,
three times softer than cotton.

384
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:42,630
Beyond these softer than
soft luxury undies coming in
ever changing selection of

385
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:47,330
classic colors. What is Classic College?
It's probably your basic, you know,

386
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,590
Crayon set when you're a little kid.
What's your favorite color?

387
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,450
Whoa. All right. Blue, red,
white, black, brown, yellow,

388
00:23:56,451 --> 00:24:01,280
green. That's it. That's it. Like the
original members had guns and roses.

389
00:24:01,281 --> 00:24:02,930
Then all of a sudden you get burnt Sienna.

390
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:07,820
You know when Matt Sorum comes in and
you get a little fucking, uh, I dunno.

391
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,380
Some mother fucking off white. When
you get a, what does that Guy Dizzy?

392
00:24:12,381 --> 00:24:15,950
Fucking something around there. Anyways,
bold shapes at French tourists patterns.

393
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,880
So you can tailor your undies to your own
personal style. Guess what? Guess what?

394
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,630
You can save time and money each
month with a monthly subscription.

395
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,470
How much do you shit your pants
that you need underwear every month.

396
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,100
And if you're not ready
for a subscription, that's
okay. You can still save.

397
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:34,940

body off restoration.

402
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,060
You know you're not just putting a
coat of paint on this piece of shit.

Do you like to booze? Huh?
Do you like to get fucked up?

441
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:16,010
But you don't want to get pulled
over for drinking and driving?

442
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,330
Wouldn't be great if there was a
service that was like a taxi service,

443
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:23,990
but it wasn't, it was just
some person in a car. Well,

444
00:27:23,991 --> 00:27:26,930
I introduce you to lift l,
Y,

445
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:30,560
f t cause you can never spell it
the correct way in the modern era,

446
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,750
in the modern era, right? It's gotta be,
it's gotta be funky. Get people over this,

447
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,650
not l I f t man, that's the
squares. This is l. Y. F. T.

448
00:27:39,651 --> 00:27:43,190
Like why would you drive when
you're drinking and um, you know,

449
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,880
you know about Lyft, right? Right.

450
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:52,190
It's the APP that gets you a
ride in minutes on demand 24,

451
00:27:52,191 --> 00:27:56,390
seven for less than the cost of a cab.
Uh, please include the following points.

452
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:57,920
By the way,
that fucking commercial,

453
00:27:57,921 --> 00:28:02,390
I think it's full lift that they do on
TV where the people are robbing the bank

454
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:03,840
and they're freaking out.

455
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:06,020
And then there's that one kid
just sitting there going like, oh,

456
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:09,620
the guy's named Tim. That's a great
name. And he's totally fucking relax.

457
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,900
Does that fucking actor in that is,
is should immediately be put in movies.

458
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:19,290
That's my own personal opinion. I
thought it was very unique. There's all,

459
00:28:19,291 --> 00:28:21,090
I'm saying it's a great commercial bread.

460
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,090
I'll all the way run
two thumbs up anyways,

461
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,080
please include the following points
during your read. Okay. If you tried Lyft,

462
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,230
you know what I mean? Um, with Lyft,

463
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:35,520
you just download the APP
request to driver and they
show up in three and a half

464
00:28:35,521 --> 00:28:38,550
minutes. On average. That's really fast.
Everybody knows how this fucking works.

465
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:43,680
Every Lyft drivers fully vetted through
that 10 points. Safety Standard one.

466
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,670
Have you ever fucked the kid? Okay,
good. We moved to the second round to,

467
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,450
have you ever had a drone crash into your
neighbor because you were jerking off

468
00:28:51,451 --> 00:28:54,510
watching them take a
shower? No. Okay. Three.

469
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,140
Yeah. Have you ever been
sympathetic to the Communist Party?

470
00:28:59,141 --> 00:29:01,670
Whatever the fuck they say up to that
it kind of goes off the rails. You know,

471
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,750
once you haven't fucked a kid, you
know, you haven't killed anybody,

472
00:29:04,751 --> 00:29:08,230
then it's kind of like, Eh,
you know, uh, you like to boost

473
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,030
plan. How much do you like the boots? Um,

474
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:16,660
10 point a standard including criminal
and DMV background checks, you know,

475
00:29:16,661 --> 00:29:20,560
you'll get around quickly and safety
lift drivers are rated after every ride.

476
00:29:20,561 --> 00:29:25,210
So only the best stick around this is
like bill Belichick do your fucking job.

477
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,240
You don't have to worry about getting
into a filthy car with some creepy dude.

478
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:31,660
With Lyft, you can tip in the APP, which
obviously leads to happier drivers.

479
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:36,661
So right now Lyft is offering
our listeners a special deal.

480

on March 25th and I am for
M ms and it's here in la.

499
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:56,140
I for some reason don't have
the information in front of me.

500
00:30:56,141 --> 00:30:59,800
I don't fucking know.
I'm co hosting it with Craig Gas.

501
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:04,000
It's rock against ms I believe is
going to be a bunch of musicians there.

502
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:09,810
Steven Adler again,
fucking Gilby, Clark, um,

503
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,070
Rudy Sasso, Michael, Devin. All of these
fucking rock stars are going to be there.

504
00:31:15,071 --> 00:31:19,720
We're going to raise a bunch of money to
help try and find a cure for this bed.

505
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:23,500
Horrific disease as opposed to
what? Bill? A wonderful disease.

506
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,350
What about the disease of laughter?

507
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,580
I don't think we ever want to
cure that to me. I'm sorry.

508
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:33,610
I'm going to be in San Jose this week.
Everybody, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,

509
00:31:33,611 --> 00:31:36,610
I'm doing two shows a night.
I got my new shit going on.

510
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:40,290
I was supposed to do the
goddamn comedy jam, but I'm,

511
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:44,200
my fucking shoulder is messed up.
And uh,

512
00:31:44,201 --> 00:31:47,980
I've been driving my old truck to
that's three on the tree and that's the

513
00:31:47,981 --> 00:31:48,940
shoulder that's fucked up.

514
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,120
But I actually was bothering
me just to shift on the column.

515
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:53,200
That's how fucking old I am.

516
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:58,960
Like someday I might have to sell that
truck because it hurts my shoulder to

517
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:03,880
just shift. It only has
three gears. I know.

518
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:07,000
It's fucking pathetic. I've been fallen
off on the Bruins and the Celtics,

519
00:32:07,001 --> 00:32:08,890
I know the Bruins scored a bunch of goals.

520
00:32:08,891 --> 00:32:13,210
I know we beat the bulls the
other day, but then the, uh,

521
00:32:13,211 --> 00:32:17,080
the Bruins scored six goals,
four goals in the third period.

522
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:20,260
I watched the first period of both the,
uh,

523
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:24,040
the Vancouver and the Calgary game.
And that was always my,

524
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:28,420
my fantasy when I was young as a fan,
when I went on the road, you know,

525
00:32:28,421 --> 00:32:32,590
I was just like, I would love to do
that fucking western Canada road trip.

526
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,840
You know, back then it was
Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver,

527
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,460
Eh,
maybe played Winnepeg too.

528
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,950
And then the last end he went down
and they played the La Kings in La.

529
00:32:45,951 --> 00:32:50,060
Kings would just sit and way out
in the West would nobody nearer.

530
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,780
Like the closest fucking
team I think was Vancouver.

531
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,190
And then the next closest would probably
be, would have been the St Louis Blues,

532
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,810
maybe Chicago Blackhawks. I will
guess Saint Louis. They would just,

533
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:07,811
there was no fucking team west of
St Louis other than the La Kings.

534
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:12,770
So no wonder the answer to that time
took him so long to win a fucking cup

535
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,980
along. They had to fly.
Vancouver's never fucking one.

536
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,270
One Calgary one once, right. In 89,

537
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:25,100
they'd be fucking Patrick war
in the Montreal Canadians. Uh,

538
00:33:25,101 --> 00:33:27,440
I want to say Pat Burns was coaching
that team. I can't remember,

539
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,400
but Edmonton Limited fucking lit it up.
So anyways,

540
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,600
let me see if they'd be Calgary
Leslie Boston prayer.

541
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:39,200
We go bro wins. Here we go. Boston Bruins.

542
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,490
If flying around the ice they
saw Pasta Knox 29th goal.

543
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,890
He's really fill in, fill in the
uh, Tyler and void. When you say,

544
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,590
you know,
since Tyler Sagan left,

545
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:56,540
Marshawn became a legitimate superstar
and now pasta knock is on his way.

546
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,270
So I guess we're doing all right.
You know,

547
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:01,390
we survived it and I
actually think Tyler Sagan,

548
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,040
all this shown us
congratulating ourselves.

549
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:07,820
I think we want Bruins extinguish
the flames. You get it.

550
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,930
You get it.
It's like they're on fire.

551
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:15,590
David Back is returned from a collision
into the boards. Yeah, that was scary.

552
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:19,730
That looked like me and pick up hockey.
Um,

553
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,100
oh for fuck sakes.
Where did the story go?

554
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,840
We scored the game winner is
the Bruins down the flames.

555
00:34:26,841 --> 00:34:30,320
Five to two in Calgary on Wednesday
we scored six goals of Vancouver.

556
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,920
Five 11 goals in two fucking games.

557
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:39,530
You know, all my fucking bitch
moaning and complaining. Um,

558
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:43,910
Marshawn humbled by emerging
status as a lead score. Yeah,

559
00:34:43,911 --> 00:34:45,620
that's absolutely right.
What about pasta?

560
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:50,000
Marshawn had a hat trick in Vancouver
and I fucking missed it, dude.

561
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:53,180
All of a sudden we're scoring goals and
I was sitting there wine and saying,

562
00:34:53,181 --> 00:34:57,950
do not get rid of Clo Julian. And
it's been a, it's totally worked out.

563
00:34:57,951 --> 00:35:00,770
It's worked out for us. It's worked out
for him. It's worked out for the Canadian,

564
00:35:00,771 --> 00:35:01,604
so it's all good.

565
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,410
And I'm flying around the ice
with the new coach Cassidy.

566
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,230
That's fucking great. That's
fucking great. I love it. I love it.

567
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:13,270
Is good to see Doug Hamilton to seem to
be doing all right out there and can't.

568
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,460
And Calgary, I never, I never have
a fucking problem with the experts.

569
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,970
Even if they decided to
try to take more money.

570
00:35:19,971 --> 00:35:23,810
I don't give a fuck you a career.
Have a good time.

571
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,670
Good to see you still in the league.
You know,

572
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:29,960
I know you're out there in the saddle
dome that doesn't get a lot of love down

573
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:34,100
here in the lower 48 as they
say in Alaska. Um, anyways,

574
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:37,500
that's the podcast I got to get on
with my fucking day here. Oh my God.

575
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:42,480
My wife said the fucking greatest thing
to me ever to fucking motivate me to

576
00:35:42,481 --> 00:35:46,730
work out. I was sitting there looking
in the mirror in the bathroom.

577
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,150
I just fat shamed myself every fucking
night. That's how I stay in shape, right?

578
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,630
And I just,
you know,

579
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:56,610
I went off the rails and I ate steak and
shake twice and a to Mcdonald's twice

580
00:35:56,611 --> 00:35:57,450
and had burger king.

581
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,820
This month has been like fast
food when had been on the road,

582
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,770
I don't want spend going on with me.
Right?

583
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,980
So I was looking at the
results of that diet

584
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,930
and I was just looking in the mirror
and I, I called myself a tub of fuck,

585
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:13,260
which I've never said my life.
I was just like, you fucking

586
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,130
soft mushy tub of fuck.

587
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,210
And then Nia was in the other room
going like, what's going on with you?

588
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:25,890
I don't know. Look at me. I'm fucking, I'm
a mess. She goes, yeah, I looked at bad.

589
00:36:25,891 --> 00:36:30,720
I go, Yag, do look at me. I've got a
fucking dad bod now. And she goes, no,

590
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:35,040
you don't. I don't need it. You're not
helping me. You know, I need honesty here.

591
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:36,600
And then she just goes,
all right,

592
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,610
you're not his tone as you once were.

593
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:46,770
And I just went, fuck yeah. She goes,
I'm sorry you said that. I said, no,

594
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,370
you're doing me a favor. So
that's it. Now I've been on it.

595
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,650
I've been on it like the
Joe Rogan company. I've been
focusing on it. Alright.

596
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,330
Oatmeal. Fucking poached egg
in the morning. By the way,

597
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:01,530
when you make your poached eggs,

598
00:37:01,531 --> 00:37:03,920
if you want to have them like they
do in the restaurant, you know it's,

599
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,840
it's spooning with itself.
This is such a simple trick.

600
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:10,830
I didn't even know it for all these years.
Just swirl the water.

601
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,770
I know I've said this before,
but maybe you missed the podcast.

602
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,850
Just swirl the water, get a
little whirlpool going. Okay.

603
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:19,020
And then you crack the egg,

604
00:37:19,021 --> 00:37:21,720
you drop it right down the center
and it's like a figure skater.

605
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:23,550
You know when they do the fucking
spinning around and it just,

606
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:25,830
it brings its arms in and then you go,

607
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,660
you take it out with a slotted spoon,
you put it on a fucking English muffin.

608
00:37:30,661 --> 00:37:34,050
Unless you like me. If you're a tub
fuck and you're trying to lose weight,

609
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:37,080
there's no English muffin.
It's just sitting in naked and afraid.

610
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,940
That is the dumbest fucking show.
Do you know there's no prize?

611
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:46,230
These people go out there and get like
fucking Lyme disease got ants crawling

612
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:48,930
around their balls and up into
their fucking private parts. I mean,

613
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:52,530
I just don't understand why you would
do that. Cavemen were not naked.

614
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,820
They were definitely afraid,

615
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,880
but they fucking killed something
and they covered up their junk.

616
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,410
I actually saw this guy naked in
a fucking tree with a hatchet.

617
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,800
This is just a commercial
because I refuse to watch that.

618
00:38:04,801 --> 00:38:07,350
I don't watch that show.
You know,

619
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:10,770
black people will watch shit that
because it's a bad representation of

620
00:38:10,771 --> 00:38:13,260
themselves.
That's what that show is for white people.

621
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:16,590
There's very few shows out there that,
that bring white people down, you know,

622
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,240
because white people are run and shit.

623
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:23,250
So we always make ourselves the
fucking heroes. I'm naked and afraid.

624
00:38:23,251 --> 00:38:25,110
That's not a good show for white people.

625
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,900
That is every stereotype of a fucking
white person. Just like, you know,

626
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,500
I think my life is just too fucking easy.
I got to make it difficult.

627
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:38,360
What am I just took all my clothes off,
went to the fucking juggled sob.

628
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,310
I could survive.

629
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:41,430
Yeah.

630
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,830
Naked and afraid. So this fucking
guy and just in the commercial Ford,

631
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:49,080
he's up in a tree and he's fucking
hacking at this branch in this tree.

632
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,250
He sitting in and then the whole fucking
branch collapses and it's just like,

633
00:38:53,251 --> 00:38:56,550
that reminds me of some
shit from like bugs bunny.

634
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,600
We the f somebody be sitting on a branch
in this sign off in a sitting on the

635
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:04,450
wrong side of it and then they fall
off or the whole tree falls down.

636
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:07,600
I literally watched this guy do what?
Live action.

637
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:11,140
A real person did that to himself. He
was, but he was hacking on the right side.

638
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,470
But still, I don't know what happened.
The whole thing fucking falls.

639
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,230
And now he's falling in.

640
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:17,600
Yeah.

641
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:21,910
To like a bunch of like branches sticking
all like with just completely naked.

642
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:24,763
You know,

643
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,020
I never cut my balls my entire life.
I never got a scratch on my balls.

644
00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:32,580
Nothing.
Cause they were covered up.

645
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,740
They had on a pair of pants,
claims a fucking tree naked.

646
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,333
MMM.

647
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,780
Anyways,
I don't know why I'm talking about this.

648
00:39:42,781 --> 00:39:45,350
I don't know why I have this level of
passion for a fucking show. I don't,

649
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:49,350
I don't even watch, uh, that's the uh,
yeah, checked in on you. Okay. You guys,

650
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:49,741
you guys have,

651
00:39:49,741 --> 00:39:53,130
you guys have yourself a great fucking
weekend or write your cards and I will,

652
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,060
uh, I'll talk to you on Monday. All right.
That's it. Go fuck yourselves. And, uh,

653
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,820
God bless the United States of America.

654
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,020
Hey,
what's going on?

655
00:40:01,021 --> 00:40:05,460
It's still birth is the Monday
morning podcast for a Monday,

656
00:40:05,461 --> 00:40:09,660
March 16th, 2009. Um,

657
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,810
I didn't know what this is the
year of anybody. Asian listening.

658
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,750
What is it the year of? Is it
the year of the Monkey? Um,

659
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:23,880
I am in San Francisco right now
and, uh, I can't believe it.

660
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,910
It's drizzling out and it's cold
and it's miserable as just, I,

661
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,000
I just blew my mind because every
time I come to San Francisco,

662
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:37,710
but whether it's just, it's just, you
know, it just puts a smile on your face,

663
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:39,240
you know, it's just
one of those, you know,

664
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,170
which I don't know when the fuck they
ever filmed that rice a Roni commercial,

665
00:40:43,171 --> 00:40:46,890
but it must've been like the one sunny
day in the last 10 fucking years out here.

666
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,110
Cause this is the 12th time
I've come to this city.

667
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,990
I just pulled that number out of the air,
but whatever,

668
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:57,630
it was the suck every time.
And that's like five typically impossible.

669
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,730
Um, and as I mentioned,
I have a touch of a cold.

670
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,980
I usually get sick when I come here.

671
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,500
Dave was actually a little bit sick before
I got here. How did you get sick bill?

672
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:13,320
Well, I'll tell you, I went to a
Joshua tree national park and uh,

673
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:18,350
evidently I didn't dress properly as I
hiked my way out to somebody goldmine,

674
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:23,970
literally, um, Joshua tree definitely, uh,

675
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,480
definitely a good time. Although I made
a real, I made a big time fool of myself.

676
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,990
I showed up and uh,
I asked the ranger,

677
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:34,450
I swear to God he was a ranger,
but he's working the gift shops.

678
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:37,700
So I forget he sucks at the and arranger,
you know what I mean?

679
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:42,560
Probably accidentally started
a fire rather than putting
one out in the park. So,

680
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,390
uh, I asked the ranger, I, you know,
it's called Joshua tree. So in my mind,

681
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,373
you know,

682
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:53,180
there's this big beautiful park and this
is one fucking Joshua tree and that's

683
00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:55,550
what everybody comes up to.
And you know, like that,

684
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,340
what's that wall at all those
Jewish people go up and pray to?

685
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:03,560
I thought it was something like that,
some sort of Mecca. Right? So I say, yeah,

686
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,260
you got, gives me a map of
the whole, the whole park.

687
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,240
I'm actually getting embarrassed
telling the story. I actually said,

688
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:14,480
so where exactly is the Joshua Tree?
Is it like,

689
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,370
is it like one tree?

690
00:42:16,371 --> 00:42:20,900
Is it like a group of like five trees
and the guy's looking at me and then just

691
00:42:20,901 --> 00:42:22,490
the way he looked at me,
I just realized,

692
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:25,880
I just said probably the dumbest fucking
thing I could possibly say within them

693
00:42:25,881 --> 00:42:30,710
park. And evidently this is what
I learned it in defense of myself.

694
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:33,590
I am from the east coast,
every gift gently. Uh,

695
00:42:33,591 --> 00:42:38,591
Joshua tree is just the type of tree
and I had probably driven by like 200 of

696
00:42:40,671 --> 00:42:43,120
them on the way up to fucking
talking to this ranger.

697
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,720
There was probably three of them in the
parking lot basically there. But you,

698
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,550
people on the east coast who have,
if you ever go out there,

699
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,210
there is no Joshua tree.
It's just a type of tree.

700
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,090
And if you go to Joshua tree and you say,

701
00:42:56,091 --> 00:42:59,210
so where is the Joshua
tree that would like be,

702
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,980
that'd be like going to New Jersey
and going, um, where is the pine tree?

703
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,620
Like the, the, the pine tree
that, you know, the special one.

704
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:15,520
And, uh, you know, it just,
yeah, I don't know. You know,

705
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,530
I just got the directions.
I just found out out of fucking get there.

706
00:43:18,531 --> 00:43:21,830
I had no information about it,
but you know, in defense of me,

707
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:26,240
they should name the park.
Uh, Joshua trees, plural,

708
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:27,980
not Joshua tree.

709
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:34,270
It confuses people when they ask silly
questions and then they feel stupid and

710
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,130
then they tell him that we tell the story
on their podcast and they get slightly

711
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:40,220
embarrassed. Um, so anyways,

712
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,090
that was my week. Oh, you know,

713
00:43:43,110 --> 00:43:47,570
somebody went to the San Jose sharks game
on Saturday night on my way up here to

714
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:52,520
do my one, my two shows here up in San
Francisco, saw the shark's speed, uh,

715
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:57,550
the kings in a shootout and
at the game I saw a 50 to 50,

716
00:43:59,391 --> 00:44:00,380
I'd say about 55,

717
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:04,700
58 year old Guy Punch a 27
year old kid right in the face.

718
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:09,230
And it was fucking hilarious. Um,
there was this kid he had on this, uh,

719
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:13,430
Detroit Red Wings, Jersey A's
hat on backwards, you know,

720
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,030
and right out of the gate he's
just standing up screaming shit.

721
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,290
And he was cheering on the sharks.
So Evan, I don't know what happened.

722
00:44:22,610 --> 00:44:25,970
I think, cause he kept
standing up anyways, this,

723
00:44:25,971 --> 00:44:30,770
this chick who was also like 55, 58,
she's got this awful fur coat on,

724
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,620
you know, in San Jose. So you
know, she thinks she's somebody,

725
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:37,980
I'm sure that's a fancy thing
to do in San Jose, California.

726
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,080
What a fucking ghost town that was by
the way, is that nobody on the streets.

727
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,780
Right. So, um, yeah, speaking of which,

728
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:50,280
like I actually was going cheap with the
fuck I was going to stay and I actually

729
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,540
, uh, decided to stay at
this Ramada, you know,

730
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,340
thinking that it was, you
know, I'm like, all right,

731
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:59,520
it's like an 89 bucks for the
night. Fuck it. I'll stay here.

732
00:44:59,521 --> 00:45:04,521
And I pull in and it's one of those deals
where the hotel rooms open up out into

733
00:45:05,341 --> 00:45:09,510
the parking lot. And if you're a fan of
my podcast, you know, I feel about those.

734
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:13,530
I do not stay, I don't
stay in motels. Okay.

735
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,710
Even if you call it a hotel,
if it fucking opens up,

736
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,330
if your room opens up out into the
parking lot, that's a fucking motel.

737
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,990
Can somebody tell what is the
definition of a motel versa hotel?

738
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:28,470
Cause if my world,
if your door opens up to the parking lot,

739
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:33,710
that is a motel slash this serial killer
buffet where they can just walk down

740
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:36,210
and be like,
I'm going to kill this guy.

741
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:38,430
I'm going to kill this guy
and I fucking with that guy.

742
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:43,530
So I never even checked in nor
did I cancel my reservation.

743
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,160
So I wonder,
I wonder if I'm going to pay for that.

744
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,220
I ended up just calling the
Marriott around the corner,

745
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:54,720
not even worried about whether they had
a fucking room available because I saw

746
00:45:54,721 --> 00:45:56,610
that there was only six
people on the street,

747
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:00,360
four of which were fucking crack heads.
Um,

748
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,210
yeah. So anyway, so I go to this fucking
game, get back on track here. Yeah.

749
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:09,660
So this woman, this fur coat, all of a
sudden she gets into it with this guy.

750
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:14,220
Where is this? This, this Red
Wings Jersey, and you know,

751
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:16,680
she's giving him shit and he's
given it right back to her,

752
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,720
which of course I'm loving.
You know what I mean?

753
00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:23,130
They're usually guys back down to women
once they start screaming in public and

754
00:46:23,131 --> 00:46:26,670
he didn't, he just kept
giving a shit right back. And
I don't know what she said,

755
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:30,330
but she goes, yeah, you just
try me. Or something like that.

756
00:46:30,331 --> 00:46:33,210
Which was really fucking annoying.
You know,

757
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:36,060
I hate where women act like they're
going to get physical with a man.

758
00:46:36,061 --> 00:46:40,170
Like they're going to knock them out.
It's like we do shut up, you know,

759
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:42,450
I can't hit you.
I mean I could,

760
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:46,110
but I'm instantly going to go to fucking
jail and then I'm going to get raped,

761
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,100
you know?
So stop acting like you're fucking Tufts.

762
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,470
The law is on your side. I, right.

763
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,190
So she's doing all that shit and he's
given a shit right back and then it's sort

764
00:46:56,191 --> 00:47:00,060
of died down. Then I started watching
the game again and next thing you know,

765
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:03,720
there's just this commotion and I
look over to my left again. Now,

766
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:06,720
the kid in the Red Wings
Jersey is covered in beer

767
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:12,000
and he's John at the,
the lady with the fur coat and a,

768
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:15,780
obviously she dumped it over
his head, you know, I mean,

769
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,170
of course I would too if it was
illegal to kick the shit out of me.

770
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:23,580
So she dumps it over ahead.
Any doesn't blast her in the face.

771
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:28,020
Just adding to her country level that
she's going to be the following day.

772
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:32,560
The fact that she got away with that and
didn't get dropped. I'm not advocating,

773
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,940
I don't think you should hit a woman,

774
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:37,510
but I don't feel that women should take
advantage of the fact that a man can't

775
00:47:37,511 --> 00:47:42,511
hit them by just doing over the top
country things like just dumping a beer on

776
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,210
somebody. You know what I mean? So
anyways, so she dumps a beer on the guy,

777
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,220
which I gotta admit is also
hilarious on another level.

778
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:52,960
So I didn't hear the exchange, I
guess. I don't know what happened.

779
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:57,010
All of a sudden this fucking old guy comes
into the picture he's got his face is

780
00:47:57,011 --> 00:48:01,000
all twisted up with angry anger, and
he just says to the kid, he goes,

781
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:05,500
who are you calling a bitch? He must've
called the chicken of fur coat a bitch.

782
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:08,950
And I, the kid didn't say
anything and I swear to God,

783
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,270
this fucking 55 year old dude who was
the slowest punch I've ever seen in my

784
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:16,720
life. He literally lifted his
hand up like a rock 'em sock.

785
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:20,390
'Em robot and just through this
straight, not even, you know,

786
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,290
I don't know what the fuck it was.
It was like rock 'em sock 'em he just,

787
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,540
she sort of bought them right,
right on the nose.

788
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,980
And then the kid just immediately called
for security and I was just like, wow,

789
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,860
that's really a tough situation.
They're like,

790
00:48:32,861 --> 00:48:35,590
he just dealt with two of the
toughest physical confrontations.

791
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:40,120
A woman dumps a bureau via head. You want
to punch her in the face, but you can't,

792
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,170
but then you allow them to dump it
over your head. So he deals with that.

793
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,630
Then he has an old guy
punched him in the face.

794
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:49,600
It's like another man just
punched him in the face.

795
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:54,130
You want to drill them back but
you can't cause he's an old guy,

796
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:56,920
but then you will out an old
guy to punch you in the face.

797
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,010
So at this point this guy
socially has been raped, right.

798
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,340
So I'm thinking when security
comes down, I'm like, all right,

799
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:07,300
this guy got punched in the face and a
beer over his head. He might actually,

800
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,140
you know,

801
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:10,620
he should get out of this even though
he's younger than the two of them.

802
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,340
You're going to be sympathetic
with the old people.

803
00:49:12,490 --> 00:49:15,490
But he immediately screws up cause the
security gets there and he just starts

804
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:18,520
cursing his brains out.
Go and I didn't do shit.

805
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:22,570
I was use fucking watching the fucking,
they just snatched him.

806
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:27,040
They actually snatched all three
of them and 20 minutes later,

807
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:30,280
somehow the kid with the Red Wings
Jersey came back and the two old people

808
00:49:30,281 --> 00:49:33,760
didn't. And I was thinking, how
the fuck did he pull that off?

809
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:36,040
And the only way I can think of it is,

810
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:39,190
is if the old guy admitted
to punching him in the face,

811
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,820
which is probably what someone
would do if they weren't a lawyer.

812
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,391
He probably said,

813
00:49:43,391 --> 00:49:46,180
well this guy punched me in the face
and then he probably did it cause you

814
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:50,170
called my wife a bitch and then it
became do you want to press charges?

815
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:54,100
And then the old guy gets scared and grabs
his walker and he leaves and then the

816
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:58,510
fucking Detroit Redwings kid came back.
That was my experience.

817
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:02,500
Was that just a long boring
story that went nowhere.

818
00:50:02,501 --> 00:50:04,960
I kind of lost interest towards the end
of that and their mouth started getting

819
00:50:04,961 --> 00:50:09,170
dry. Anyway, this is the month, uh,
the Monday morning podcast and a,

820
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,990
if you new to my podcast, I do one
of these every single week. And uh,

821
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:17,860
I think it's becoming really relevant
during these tough economic times,

822
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,730
you know, to just give away
something free like this.

823
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:24,760
I'm only mentioning that it's free
cause somebody told me that they find it

824
00:50:24,761 --> 00:50:29,240
annoying when people say it's a podcast,
you know,

825
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:32,720
it's like really? Well,
it is a free podcast.

826
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:35,690
You fucking douchebag and
despite the fact that it's free,

827
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,380
people still bitch at me
every week, you know? So yeah,

828
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,080
I am going to throw it in your face then.
I'm doing this for free.

829
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,100
What do you think about that? I'm going
to guilt you. Just like your grandmother.

830
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:52,190
You know I saw one of the greatest movie
trailers I've ever seen in my life.

831
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,620
Do you guys, you guys fans
of the movie the dirty dozen?

832
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:59,930
Well what is wrong with you have
you should be go go on youtube,

833
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,530
hit pause. You don't need to listen to
me right now. This is all you need to do.

834
00:51:03,531 --> 00:51:04,910
If you want to be entertained for free,

835
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:08,960
just go on youtube and type
in the dirty dozen and watch.

836
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:13,880
Watch the movie trailer of it and they
have one of the greatest lines I think

837
00:51:13,881 --> 00:51:14,900
that has ever been written.

838
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,040
And then describing basically
the premise of the movie is this.

839
00:51:19,041 --> 00:51:23,480
These 12 guys who are on basically either
on death row are facing really long

840
00:51:23,481 --> 00:51:24,530
prison sentences.

841
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:29,360
And if they agree to go on this
suicide mission to kill a bunch of Nazi

842
00:51:29,361 --> 00:51:34,280
officers, if they survive,
they get to go free. And, uh,

843
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:35,001
that's the movie.

844
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:38,810
So they're basically describing all the
characters and one of the characters

845
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:43,790
they described as an Indian with
war paint smeared on his soul.

846
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:52,040
I can't do it justice.
I cannot do it justice.

847
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:57,700
The guys doing it in that movie voice
and he's not doing it with a hint of how

848
00:51:58,641 --> 00:51:59,960
fucking hilarious it is.

849
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:05,230
Cause it wasn't a hilarious back then
and Indian was more page smeared on his

850
00:52:05,571 --> 00:52:10,370
soul. It's just, it's fucking awesome. I
want that as my ring tone. Um, anyways,

851
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:14,480
so let's get on with the podcast. Uh,
yeah, like if you're new to my podcast,

852
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:17,780
people send me questions, I answer my
answer the questions as best I can.

853
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:21,650
People send me their lists of underrated
things they find underrated or

854
00:52:21,651 --> 00:52:25,790
overrated and movie reviews.
Um,

855
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,050
and the latest,

856
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,210
the latest is people are
telling me stories of, uh,

857
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:37,490
of revenge. Uh, all right, so
here's one. They're really long.

858
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:42,310
These people really are writing me like
Stephen King length stories of revenge

859
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:46,820
and I'm personally, what I've been saying
throughout this is I don't do revenge.

860
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:52,190
I, uh, I enjoy hearing the stories,
but I don't do it because a,

861
00:52:52,191 --> 00:52:56,840
I just, my Karma is too
fucking strong. I Dunno man.

862
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:01,841
Like there's something about
revenge unless it's face to face,

863
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,810
you know, you just sort of
fight somebody, you know,

864
00:53:05,811 --> 00:53:08,360
that seems like an honorable kind
of revenge. But when you sort of,

865
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,940
you start the second year,

866
00:53:10,941 --> 00:53:13,490
like looking at another human
being and they don't know,

867
00:53:13,491 --> 00:53:16,700
you're looking at them and you're
trying to plan some diabolical shit.

868
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,920
I don't know about you guys,
but there's something inside of me.

869
00:53:18,921 --> 00:53:23,840
I can't fucking do it because I
just, I never feel more evil. I mean,

870
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,070
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I've sat around and thought about it,

871
00:53:26,071 --> 00:53:30,510
but to actually carry it out. Yeah.
Who knows? Maybe it's exciting.

872
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:37,020
I never feel more alive than when plotting
the death of a, my next door neighbor.

873
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,610
All right, here we go. Um, you
know that sound byte, Mike,

874
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:44,310
to come back to haunt me in the future
when I pull my Robert Blake in my sixties.

875
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:48,540
Take that one out of context. All
right, so here's the podcast one.

876
00:53:48,541 --> 00:53:51,240
I'm gonna try to skip through most of
this and just get to the gist of it.

877
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:55,280
A pill. I was going to college
in Washington state, uh,

878
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:57,980
but I'm skipping all of my classes
and getting horrible grades.

879
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:03,080
The school I was going to was university
of Puget sound easily the worst place

880
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:08,100
I've ever fucking been to a
Yada, Yada, Yada. So anyways,

881
00:54:08,101 --> 00:54:10,930
there was this kid who was a friend of
mine and at the beginning of the summer

882
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:13,290
he was in front of his at the
beginning of the semester.

883
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,660
But I slowly started to realize
that he was a piece of shit,

884
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,420
which culminated when he also

885
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:24,120
having red hair fucked my then
girlfriend when she was drunk.

886
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:27,300
That makes sense. So basically he had this
friend in the beginning, the semester.

887
00:54:27,301 --> 00:54:28,920
He thought he was cool.
You graduated,

888
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:32,160
realizes that he's a piece of shit in
the culminated when he fucked his then

889
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:35,490
girlfriend when she was drunk.
There we go. So anyways, uh,

890
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:39,800
uh,
what he said was this,

891
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,830
this was actually one of the better
moments of my time at the college hearing

892
00:54:43,831 --> 00:54:48,690
that they had hooked up and finding
her the next day, the next morning,

893
00:54:48,691 --> 00:54:51,480
sorry. And she literally
could not look me in the eye,

894
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:56,340
which in hindsight I find extremely funny.
Um,

895
00:54:56,370 --> 00:55:01,260
and she is shame she and an shamed way
explained that she thought the other guy

896
00:55:01,261 --> 00:55:04,620
was me, but she was so
drunk, she didn't notice.

897
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,450
They look to say I was not understanding
with her at all and may be out of

898
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:13,050
character choice to go back to not
fucking anyone. Well, good for you man.

899
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:17,490
It's a strong choice. Hey,
go be alone. Good move. Um,

900
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:21,780
but this of course ended my friendship
with that piece of shit kid since he

901
00:55:21,781 --> 00:55:26,280
confirmed what I had been suspecting about
him, about big being a, uh, an asshole.

902
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:31,500
So Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. This. So
basically the kid stops going into class.

903
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:35,820
He starts drinking every day
and he ends up dropping out.

904
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:40,650
So, uh, he's cleaning out basically
his room. He goes, so it's my last day.

905
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,820
I'm happy, I'm happier than a crack
head with a hundred dollar bill,

906
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:45,900
packing my shit up.

907
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,610
Then the cock sucker who fucked my
girlfriend somehow found me in the hall

908
00:55:50,611 --> 00:55:55,611
checking myself out of my room and he
comes up to me with this incredible

909
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:56,940
Shitty,

910
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:01,940
shitty eating grin and he says how much
he's gonna miss me and that thickly

911
00:56:02,101 --> 00:56:03,360
sarcastic tone.

912
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:08,390
And then actually proceeded to pinch my
cheek like your grandmother used to when

913
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:09,660
you were six.

914
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:15,570
I'm sure you know the feeling of shaking
with rage, being unable to do anything,

915
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,070
being unable to do anything.

916
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:20,910
Assaulting a kid at a liberal arts school
with security guards right in front of

917
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:22,620
me would get me arrested.

918
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:27,550
But of course I still felt like the
world's biggest gaping pussy for not doing

919
00:56:27,551 --> 00:56:32,110
anything at all. Something had to be done
about this. And here comes the revenge,

920
00:56:32,111 --> 00:56:35,440
ladies and gentlemen. Uh, okay.

921
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:39,400
I decided I liked the kids, uh,
from the ranch story last week,

922
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:44,080
I decided to fuck with his
car. Yeah. Jesus Christ, Dude.

923
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:48,850
You know, that's, that's really not,
that's not the man. That's not the,

924
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:53,450
the, uh, that's not the John Wayne
move there. You know, you should have,

925
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:57,940
you could have always gone back when
the security wasn't there and then just

926
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,900
sorta, just fucking smashed him in
the face. You, I dunno. So anyway,

927
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:03,520
he decides to fuck with his car.

928
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:10,630
Dude, you're reminded
me of that. That, uh,

929
00:57:10,631 --> 00:57:14,530
that chicken fast times at Ridgemont
high, that's what, what's what women do?

930
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:19,090
They write dick or prick on the
side of your car or whatever.

931
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,250
What am I going to do? Well,
I'm going to stop judging.

932
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:23,950
I'll just read the rest of the story.
So he had decided to fuck with his car.

933
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:27,490
He had a nice Jetta and I knew
where he parked at every night.

934
00:57:27,491 --> 00:57:32,491
So I got a friend to be my lookout as
much as a scumbag as I am for fucking with

935
00:57:32,681 --> 00:57:35,710
someone else's car. All right.
At least he admitted it. Uh,

936
00:57:35,711 --> 00:57:38,530
this could not have gone any
better. Miraculously, there was,

937
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:42,070
there was this perfect gap in the security
patrols given me just enough time to

938
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,400
key every panel on his car and slash
all four tires until I was back on the

939
00:57:48,221 --> 00:57:51,850
sidewalk with my friend. Uh, immediately
up to finishing security guard showed up.

940
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:54,550
Bill old people started doing
their early morning walk to Cetera,

941
00:57:54,551 --> 00:57:57,070
and I got the fuck out of there.
Within an hour,

942
00:57:57,071 --> 00:58:00,640
I caught a bus to Seattle and commerce
started working almost immediately.

943
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,950
Only an hour in front of
my friend's apartment.

944
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,940
And hour later in front of my friend's
apartment, I started feeling awful.

945
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:11,350
I went from feeling totally fine
to having a, a hallucinatory fever.

946
00:58:12,370 --> 00:58:15,970
Uh, I lay in my friend's bed for an entire
day until around four when apparently

947
00:58:15,971 --> 00:58:20,680
that Jack has discovered what I did to
his car and called my phone over and over

948
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:25,270
from a number from his number, then
from all my friends' phones, etc.

949
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,850
I don't remember much of,
is this conversation,

950
00:58:27,851 --> 00:58:32,420
but I do know I was trying
to be a tough guy. Uh,

951
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:35,770
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. So the kid kept calling

952
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,720
for months and months. Eventually I
stopped answering his calls, but he,

953
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:43,600
he kept calling, dude,
you fucked with a cycle.

954
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:48,730
You know, when he came up and pinched
your cheek like that, and they said,

955
00:58:48,731 --> 00:58:52,300
how much do you do? Realize how, what a
sadistic fucking maniac you dealing with.

956
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:53,410
It's probably good.

957
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:56,860
You didn't fucking punch him cause
he probably would've came at you like

958
00:58:56,861 --> 00:58:59,830
Hannibal lector and fitting the
Chunky a cheek right out of your face.

959
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:02,080
But anyway,
he said,

960
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:06,760
he even called me on Christmas almost a
month later when he would call it these

961
00:59:06,761 --> 00:59:11,230
times, it's always on available,
blah, blah, blah blah.

962
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,800
Oh, this is a good party. I'd answer.

963
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,500
And he'd start making heavy
breathing noises after awhile.

964
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:21,280
Like those telephone perverts
women were afraid of in the 1960s

965
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,960
a story has a happy ending though.
Uh, at one of those hipsters bar,

966
00:59:27,961 --> 00:59:29,730
a sort of gothic coffee shop.

967
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,780
Actually I managed to hook up with a girl
that was probably out of my league by

968
00:59:33,781 --> 00:59:38,250
playing off his constant cycle phone
calls as though there were other chicks

969
00:59:38,251 --> 00:59:41,750
trying to get with me.
I don't know whether,

970
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:45,090
does that sound like the number one thing?
Well, it's like with revenge. I'm sorry,

971
00:59:45,091 --> 00:59:47,060
like that was really choppy,
but I swear to God,

972
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:48,560
the kid wrote me like a manifesto.

973
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:51,890
I was really trying and I don't have time
to edit these fucking things, but uh,

974
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,870
that seems to be people's
number one a way of uh,

975
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:01,020
taking revenge on somebody.
You know,

976
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:06,060
you got to get out there and uh,
fuck with their car.

977
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:10,680
I guess that what's makes it ven right.
Revenge has to be sneaky.

978
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:12,820
Bye.

979
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:13,460
See,
wait a minute.

980
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:18,460
We've got two guys fuck with a car
and we had another guy who took his

981
01:00:19,051 --> 01:00:21,640
girlfriend to Disneyland is ex-girlfriend,

982
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,950
have cheated on him and did
horrific things to her. Ah,

983
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,140
you know what it is about revenge.

984
01:00:28,141 --> 01:00:32,100
It has to be sneaky because even that
chick thought she was going to Disneyland

985
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,630
to ride on the tea cups and to get back
with this guy and he was actually taken

986
01:00:36,631 --> 01:00:40,700
her down there to, to make a porno.
Um, do you know something that that's,

987
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,720
that's what it is about revenge.
I can't deal with,

988
01:00:42,721 --> 01:00:44,430
I can't deal with the dishonesty of it.

989
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:49,380
There's just something that just makes
you feel like, uh, he just feel dirty.

990
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:55,920
You know, he fuck up somebody's car.
You should do it right in front of them.

991
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,680
As you look at them with some
maniacal look on your face.

992
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:04,080
I mean that would really, you know, when
that get them, cause then you'd be like,

993
01:01:04,081 --> 01:01:07,500
wow, this guy knows I'd fuck
him up if he fuck with my car.

994
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:10,770
And not only is he doing in front of me,
he made sure he called out my name.

995
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:12,630
So I saw him doing it.
You know what I mean?

996
01:01:15,950 --> 01:01:16,750
Got It.

997
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:17,730
You know what their minds me on what time?

998
01:01:17,731 --> 01:01:22,731
I saw this crazy white dude on the subway
and he was rapping some song and that

999
01:01:22,861 --> 01:01:27,120
had the n word in it and it was like
10 black people on the train. Okay.

1000
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,820
And he's dropping the n
bomb every five seconds.

1001
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:31,420
Okay.

1002
01:01:31,420 --> 01:01:35,410
I like, I'm a crazy
Edward, some something,

1003
01:01:35,430 --> 01:01:39,760
some crazy and we're doing the best
they can. And then he'd go, whew.

1004
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,120
He just kept doing it over and over

1005
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,370
out of his fucking mind.

1006
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:51,240
But why is hell all the downtown six
back in the day when I lived on the upper

1007
01:01:51,461 --> 01:01:53,440
east side, he kept saying it over and
over again and it was like, you know,

1008
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:56,980
was a subway. It was like 10, 15 black
dudes on the train who was a white dude.

1009
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:00,670
He's dropping the Edwards. Every white
person knows if you fucking do that,

1010
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:03,960
if it's instantaneous asking.

1011
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:09,600
But I think that that's what saved him
is because he was so overtly doing it.

1012
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:12,520
All the black people looked at him.
We're like,

1013
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:16,900
this guy knows we're going to kick the
fuck out of him yet he's still doing it.

1014
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:21,870
So then you do the quick
math. Oh, he's fucking crazy.

1015
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,850
He's crazy.
Okay,

1016
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:27,810
I'm going to fight this guy and he's
going to bite me and I'm going to get

1017
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:30,450
hepatitis. So that's the, uh,

1018
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,540
I don't know what the fuck
point up front and make that.

1019
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,010
That's how you get out
of, I guess, you know,

1020
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,370
not getting your ass kicked because if
you can truly convince people that you're

1021
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:42,510
fucking crazy, like people
just, they, they, they don't,
they don't mess with you.

1022
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,080
So that's what you should've done then
did you want to keep this fucking car in

1023
01:02:46,081 --> 01:02:46,914
front of them?

1024
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:52,500
They just have a maniacal look on your
face and every other sentence just scream

1025
01:02:52,501 --> 01:02:56,630
out. Woo. And they leave you
alone. Anyone after dealt,

1026
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,620
dealt with the phone calls and then
again you wouldn't hooked up with the

1027
01:02:58,621 --> 01:03:02,730
chicken, the coffee shop. I don't know.
Let's get to the podcast questions.

1028
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:06,090
Shall We? I get a, I get
fucking, I get a cold here. Okay.

1029
01:03:06,091 --> 01:03:08,760
I'm making excuses for that last two
minutes. That didn't even make sense.

1030
01:03:09,110 --> 01:03:11,010
All right, podcast question number one. So

1031
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:16,020
you talked about wanting to have a kid
now, now that you're getting older,

1032
01:03:16,021 --> 01:03:21,021
I'm just curious to know if you would
want him or her to hear your podcasts

1033
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,300
considering you can don't
things like revenge.

1034
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,500
I love how people don't listen to me.
I don't condone revenge.

1035
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:31,800
I've said that on every podcast,
but I do find the stories interesting.

1036
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:35,160
And I will comment and laughed
at the shit that you did.

1037
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,100
I don't condone what Scarface did,

1038
01:03:38,101 --> 01:03:42,330
but I can enjoy him shooting up people
in the end of the movie, you know?

1039
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:46,950
Anyway, so he, but anyways, the way
this guy heard it, maybe I've maybe out,

1040
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,310
you know, maybe I wasn't clear about
what I was saying. So anyways, uh,

1041
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:55,260
the way he heard it is basically I condone
things like prevention. He said, I,

1042
01:03:55,261 --> 01:04:00,150
he busting a nut on your x space to make
her feel like a whore for cheating on

1043
01:04:00,151 --> 01:04:01,710
you.
I'm not criticizing you.

1044
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:06,270
I'm sincerely interested in knowing
if having a child will change your

1045
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:09,570
perception on things
because as I close in on 40,

1046
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,490
I'm feeling the same way,

1047
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,350
wanting to finally have a kid and it
makes me consider if I should adjust my

1048
01:04:16,351 --> 01:04:21,351
moral compass beforehand because I would
want my son or daughter to have me as a

1049
01:04:22,951 --> 01:04:27,060
decent role model. Your situation is a
little more precarious in the your future.

1050
01:04:27,061 --> 01:04:31,380
10 year old son could find an old
copy of bill burrs. Greatest hits.

1051
01:04:32,010 --> 01:04:32,731
And here I was,

1052
01:04:32,731 --> 01:04:36,810
father thinks that common a girl's hair
is the best prescription for heartbreak.

1053
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,760
Keep up the good work.
Ah, all right Michael.

1054
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,160
This is how I view this type of shit.
Um,

1055
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:51,630
for me to actually think about anything
that I'm saying on this podcast about

1056
01:04:51,631 --> 01:04:55,470
actually having a child that I don't
even have is the quickest way of making

1057
01:04:55,471 --> 01:04:59,850
these podcasts horrifically. Unfunny. Um,

1058
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:02,400
um,
I actually,

1059
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,400
I have major problems with parents
and how once they have kids,

1060
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:13,200
they all of a sudden start acting like
they're not the fucking frat boy date

1061
01:05:13,770 --> 01:05:17,070
rapists that they used to be.
And not only do they act that way,

1062
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:20,380
want everyone else to behave that way too,

1063
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:23,200
because they knocked up the check
that they're with and it's like, dude,

1064
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:26,800
I did knock up my curl. Okay. I'm
still having a good fucking time.

1065
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:29,650
You know what I mean? So if
my, you know what, why don't,

1066
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,260
why don't I do the rest of his
pod, this, this moment right now,

1067
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:36,850
like my future 10 year old son is actually
listening to the archives. Hey son,

1068
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,070
what's going on?
It's your dad.

1069
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:43,600
I hope I didn't fuck up the first
10 years of your life. Listen son,

1070
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:48,550
if you're taking anything that I say
on these podcasts remotely, seriously,

1071
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:53,620
I've completely failed as a parent and
I want you to go outside and fall on a

1072
01:05:53,621 --> 01:05:54,550
fucking lawn dart.

1073
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:59,130
Cause I'm going to start over again and
I'm going to make another kid and a,

1074
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:03,000
I'm the teaching them to learn how
to fucking take a joke. I don't know.

1075
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,260
You don't want I got halfway through
that and just got fucking creepy.

1076
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,220
I just told him my future kid
to kill himself, you know,

1077
01:06:08,410 --> 01:06:13,260
with a toy that has been banned.
Um, no, to be honest with you, no,

1078
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:17,680
I never, I never think about what
you're asking me. Do I swear to God?

1079
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:20,780
Is the formula for not becoming funny?
You know,

1080
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:22,600
that's what comedians
do is they get older,

1081
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:27,601
they have kids and all of a sudden they
stopped cursing on stage and they stay

1082
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:31,750
one of the role model.
And uh,

1083
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:37,000
that's when shit just starts going
down hill. And, uh, you know,

1084
01:06:37,060 --> 01:06:41,610
you want to start doing family
movies, you know, and, uh,

1085
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:44,020
I'm not doing that. Okay. I'm a comedian.

1086
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:47,050
Nothing I say should be taken
seriously if you take it seriously,

1087
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:50,620
if that's not my problem.
Uh, even if you are my kid,

1088
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:54,140
I'm be honest with my kid.
You know what I mean?

1089
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:56,680
Now people like try to shelter their
kids and tell them that there's a Santa

1090
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:01,210
clause and everything like that. And
you know, I don't know about that.

1091
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,620
Like if somebody does something
really weird and then my kids like,

1092
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,950
why did somebody, why did that person
do that? I'd be like, you know what son?

1093
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:13,920
Because most people are cons, you know,
I know it's a harsh reality and uh,

1094
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:17,830
enjoy your coloring years sun,
cause it's only gonna get worse.

1095
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,030
I wasn't going to get worse.
All Right, Bill listening to,

1096
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:30,400
uh, okay, bill listening to
the newly discovered podcast.

1097
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:33,580
You all, this is the guy. You
know what? This guy, I'm going to,

1098
01:07:33,581 --> 01:07:36,940
I'm going to say this guy for this,
this right here. Not as whole email.

1099
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:40,440
But this email right here, I think
this guy earns Douche bag of the, uh,

1100
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:42,700
of the fucking week because he goes,

1101
01:07:42,701 --> 01:07:47,701
you should charge for your podcast and
up the production value or just leave

1102
01:07:47,711 --> 01:07:48,544
them as they are.

1103
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:52,660
Just don't keep mentioning that they're
free like other podcasts is due.

1104
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,810
It's a bit Douchey when you do that.
You know what?

1105
01:07:55,900 --> 01:08:00,850
Why don't you go fuck yourself? How
about you do that? Is that, do she,

1106
01:08:00,851 --> 01:08:02,740
if I tell you that you fucking cunt,

1107
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:05,590
they'll tell me what to do in
this fucking podcast is free.

1108
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:07,000
I don't need to do this.

1109
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:11,200
Shift going to tell me how the fuck
I'm supposed to do these. All right?

1110
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,680
So go fuck yourself on
your first paragraph. But
because I'm such sweetheart,

1111
01:08:15,681 --> 01:08:17,720
I'll read the rest of it. The
rest of it. You don't bug me.

1112
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:21,050
You're a Douche in your
first paragraph. Uh, Bill.

1113
01:08:21,051 --> 01:08:22,550
So with the Vinny call you to come in,

1114
01:08:22,551 --> 01:08:26,390
I kind of assume you are a drummer
like me and with the headphone comment

1115
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:30,470
drummer headphones gotta be
right. Uh, I've got to be right.

1116
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:35,750
So if you are a drummer and listen
through headphones, listen to Steve,

1117
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:37,880
Steve,
oh seven days,

1118
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:43,790
then in parentheses it says a sting
field with gold. All they did,

1119
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:47,150
they did a cover of that. Yeah. I don't
know if you guys listened to the podcast,

1120
01:08:47,151 --> 01:08:49,760
but that's I'm kind of into,
I've been starting to buy records.

1121
01:08:50,950 --> 01:08:53,650
I started buying them again and uh,

1122
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:56,290
find like some concept albums and that's,
you know,

1123
01:08:56,300 --> 01:09:01,250
those all those great old albums.
So just a great, somebody sent me,

1124
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,650
somebody wrote something on the
Internet where they would just,

1125
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:07,490
they were bitching about music today
and they said something to the effect of

1126
01:09:07,491 --> 01:09:09,140
how,
you know,

1127
01:09:09,170 --> 01:09:12,590
how bummed they worked because people
today don't want to hear good music.

1128
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:16,760
I just think that's such a hilarious
comment. People today. Yeah.

1129
01:09:16,761 --> 01:09:20,030
They don't want to hear good music. Oh
yeah, that's, that's exactly what it is.

1130
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:24,800
It has nothing to do with the deregulation
of media in the early 1980s which

1131
01:09:24,801 --> 01:09:29,060
allowed fucking five guys to buy all
the fucking radio stations and to run

1132
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:30,780
everyone exactly like the other one.

1133
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:33,590
Thus limiting the amount of
music that can get on the radio.

1134
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:38,030
That's not what it is. It's that people
then they don't want to hear the music.

1135
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:42,200
Is that good music? You shut that
off, Mr. I don't want to hear that.

1136
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:47,050
I want to hear some awful, I don't
want to hear good music. You know,

1137
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:50,000
it's funny, there's the cleaning ladies
on the outside of the door and she picks,

1138
01:09:50,001 --> 01:09:52,640
I can't hear. And I know she's
listening to me ranting it here,

1139
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:57,050
debating whether or not to come in
here or not. I know you're out there.

1140
01:09:58,220 --> 01:09:59,930
Um,
John just freaked around.

1141
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:04,730
Kind of freaked me out too because I
realized that technically I really am not

1142
01:10:04,731 --> 01:10:09,620
talking to anybody. Um, what was I
talking about? Oh yeah, the music.

1143
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:12,170
I think there's plenty of good
music out there. You just,

1144
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:13,430
you get access to find it.

1145
01:10:13,431 --> 01:10:17,060
It's on the Internet now and
possibly on satellite radio.

1146
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:18,770
And if you don't have satellite radio,

1147
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:22,670
that's one of the most
underrated things ever. Uh,

1148
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:27,890
it's fucking incredible.
And I'm getting it put in my car because,

1149
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:31,940
uh, I've rented a few cars recently and
they've had satellite ready radio in it,

1150
01:10:32,030 --> 01:10:36,530
and that's where the good music is.
That's where the funny radio shows are.

1151
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:41,090
That's where it's at when it comes to
radio. Man, it's fucking great. And uh,

1152
01:10:41,091 --> 01:10:45,680
and people curse on the radio,
which I enjoy.

1153
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:46,940
And if I had a 10 year old son,

1154
01:10:46,941 --> 01:10:51,941
I let I let him listen to those words
because I always heard them from the day I

1155
01:10:51,951 --> 01:10:56,690
was walking around. I heard him and look
at me. I turned out fine and I did two.

1156
01:10:56,691 --> 01:11:00,470
Stop laughing. I did pay my fucking
taxes. I'm not hurting anybody.

1157
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:05,510
Um, anyways. Overrated.
Underrated. Uh, overrated.

1158
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:09,350
This guy says sonic youth.
Dot, dot, dot. Really?

1159
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,560
You know what? I don't know. Are they
the ones who are saying a runaway train?

1160
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,770
How about the kids who
runaway runaway Chelsea?

1161
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,730
I would call it back.

1162
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:28,700
[inaudible] something
Yak. Ah, Paul Simon. A.

1163
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:32,880
Dot dot. Dot. I want to shove an African
drum up his ass. Is he black now?

1164
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:39,420
Okay. Listen to any Paul Simon album
in the late eighties, early nineties.

1165
01:11:39,421 --> 01:11:42,060
Do you ever think he was just trying to
expand as an artist and he was working

1166
01:11:42,061 --> 01:11:46,950
with different musicians and he
went outside of America? You know,

1167
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:50,850
it's not like he went out there with
a Fubu fucking a tracksuit on when he

1168
01:11:50,851 --> 01:11:54,750
played with them. Notice I said
Fubu staying at times with the, uh,

1169
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:59,640
early nineties was Fubu, wasn't
it? It was at midnight. You know,

1170
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:04,740
Jesus Christ who did the black,
now he's standing next to a black guy.

1171
01:12:04,950 --> 01:12:09,600
He's still wearing those wrangler jeans,
those awful hair plugs.

1172
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:13,290
Uh, BB King, the other
guy says is overrated.

1173
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:16,260
He's been milking the legend
status for so long. He can't eat.

1174
01:12:16,380 --> 01:12:20,670
He can't even play a chord. C
You two's rattle and hum, dude,

1175
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:25,470
I got to agree with you on
that one. Bb King, I think.

1176
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:30,330
Uh, yeah, I think he might be a little
overrated. The guy can't play a chord.

1177
01:12:31,470 --> 01:12:34,880
A, he does play nicely,
but a, if you've noticed,

1178
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:38,600
there's not a lot of black people going
out to see them. I think it's a pitcher.

1179
01:12:38,650 --> 01:12:39,840
White people who think he's good.

1180
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:47,670
That was one of the most ignorant fucking
things I'll ever say that really made

1181
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:51,270
me laugh. You know, and that guy who
sent me the email, I didn't mean that.

1182
01:12:51,271 --> 01:12:55,590
So in the future, when my 10 year
old son hears it ease, I, you know,

1183
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:57,270
he's going to know and let Jesus Christ.

1184
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:02,790
Why would you put that in my fucking head?
I never think shit like that.

1185
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,420
That's how you know,
if you think about ramifications,

1186
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:09,960
you never going to be funny.
Hey, what if I say this?

1187
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:11,880
Won't that hurt someone in the crowd?

1188
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:17,090
And then the moment to set it is gone
and it's over five batch shows tonight.

1189
01:13:17,341 --> 01:13:20,550
I'm going to fucking blame you. Hey,
like that. Alright. Underrated. Uh,

1190
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:25,200
the Mayfield four miles. Kennedy.
I have no idea who that is.

1191
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:27,540
I'm going to look that up.
And Roy Orbison,

1192
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:31,560
he's one of those guys who
is overrated and underrated.

1193
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:35,520
I think he's underrated with the
average listener. And he's overrated.

1194
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:40,140
When you talk about him, about
his, uh, seven octave voice.

1195
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,290
Hey,
I dunno.

1196
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:46,500
He really has an amazing
range with his voice,

1197
01:13:46,501 --> 01:13:49,590
but I don't like the sound of it.

1198
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:53,370
Is that like sac religious list?

1199
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:56,690
Some of the songs he
thinks like pretty willing

1200
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,190
[inaudible]

1201
01:14:02,190 --> 01:14:03,023
yeah.

1202
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:06,030
[inaudible] you.

1203
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:11,090
Oh, kill yourself. He looks like a
lesbian. All right. Underrated. Uh,

1204
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:15,060
the slight Enos of college chicks.
Um,

1205
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:19,240
I don't care. Well seeing a Roy
Orbison, he died out of nowhere, man.

1206
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:20,350
Like I just had a heart attack.

1207
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,540
That's one of those guys where
he dies of a heart attack.

1208
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,150
You really look at his face and it's
like, yeah, I can see the heart attack.

1209
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,700
He had a blue cheese double chin,

1210
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:31,300
underrated the sluttiness
of college chicks.

1211
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,050
I don't care where you went to college,
if you lived any,

1212
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:37,480
if you lived away at school and
weren't getting laid once a week,

1213
01:14:37,481 --> 01:14:41,560
something must be wrong with your Dick.
This is over exaggerating a bit.

1214
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:43,240
That's one of my favorite expressions.

1215
01:14:43,241 --> 01:14:47,500
I think I've ever read over exaggerating.

1216
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:50,950
I'm trying to do the math on what
the fuck that means. So if you said,

1217
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:54,490
if you lived away at school and we're
getting laid at least once a week,

1218
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:57,700
if you weren't getting late,
at least once a week,

1219
01:14:57,701 --> 01:15:01,720
something must be wrong with your Dick.
But that statement is, is overexaggerated

1220
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:06,430
over it.
So does that mean you're not exaggerating?

1221
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:10,420
Does that mean to get laid
one and a half times a week?

1222
01:15:10,430 --> 01:15:14,980
You tag someone and finger bless someone
else. I really don't do sex jokes.

1223
01:15:14,981 --> 01:15:18,630
I believe that that makes
me uncomfortable. Uh, but
this is over exaggerating.

1224
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,740
Vimpat ice still. It is ridiculous.
I went to a small Catholic college,

1225
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:28,400
but you would know about the stories I
got from my dorm room. A couple bears,

1226
01:15:28,450 --> 01:15:31,270
some can't even read this.

1227
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:36,190
Do you guys even guys like against using
the space bar? A couple of beers, some

1228
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:42,250
dim dorm room lighting and slow jam
playlists off your laptop and you were in

1229
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:46,030
business most of the time. It didn't
even matter if your roommates were there.

1230
01:15:46,031 --> 01:15:50,500
I want to have my roommate wake up to
this bitch sitting on my face riding a

1231
01:15:50,501 --> 01:15:53,920
unicycle. All right, we're going to
stop there. Okay, I got it. Dude,

1232
01:15:53,921 --> 01:15:55,360
you're getting late.
Jesus Christ.

1233
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:02,800
You know what? That's actually
true. I never lived at college,

1234
01:16:02,801 --> 01:16:07,060
but I definitely hooked up with college
girls and I actually hooked up with the

1235
01:16:07,061 --> 01:16:12,061
girl in the top bunk and her in a
roommate now only was in the bottom bunk,

1236
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,540
but was awake.

1237
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,210
I have you ever tried to fuck
respectfully in respective kind of way?

1238
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:22,270
It doesn't really work.
Uh,

1239
01:16:22,630 --> 01:16:25,390
especially when you use a word you
can't even pronounce respectively.

1240
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:28,930
Does that even, does that even
a word? All right. Overrated.

1241
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:32,950
Adding why to the end of guys' names,

1242
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:37,570
unless you're playing stick ball in the
school yard or your grandma calls to

1243
01:16:37,571 --> 01:16:38,920
wish you a happy birthday.

1244
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:43,360
If you're over the age of 18 year old
man and should not be referred to as Joey

1245
01:16:43,361 --> 01:16:48,361
or daddy or any other bullshit name ending
and why I'm hoping you would want to

1246
01:16:48,611 --> 01:16:52,920
punch. The first guy walks up and says,
hey Billy, what's up? It's bullshit.

1247
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:56,350
You're a man. You should go buy a man's
name. You know what? That's exactly right.

1248
01:16:56,351 --> 01:16:58,900
I actually,
when I first game game into this business,

1249
01:16:58,901 --> 01:17:03,010
I went by Bill Burr and I thought it
was too short and too difficult to say.

1250
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:08,250
So for like five years I went by Billy
and even though it flowed better with my

1251
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:13,880
name, anytime anybody called me that
I, it just, it, it didn't feel right.

1252
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:17,750
It was just like a,
unless the guy was some like New Jersey,

1253
01:17:17,751 --> 01:17:20,630
they have a way of making it sound. All
right. Are New York guys, but it's just,

1254
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,760
I just felt like a little kid.

1255
01:17:22,761 --> 01:17:25,580
Like I should have been sitting there
with my brown sack lunch and after,

1256
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,170
I don't know how Billy crystal does it,

1257
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:30,870
so I would have to agree with
you on that one. All right.

1258
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:35,620
And I think that's it. I think
that's it for the podcast. Uh,

1259
01:17:35,621 --> 01:17:38,590
I want to thank everyone
for listening this week. Uh,

1260
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:43,240
it's a little bit on the short side,
but um, I don't know. It's weird.

1261
01:17:43,260 --> 01:17:45,870
I'm up in San Francisco and I
got a gig tonight and I want,

1262
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:46,850
before I even do the Gig,

1263
01:17:46,851 --> 01:17:51,680
I want to thank everybody for coming
out on a Monday night. I know it's a,

1264
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:55,130

So, uh, listen to this.
Before we come onto my show,

1266
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:03,080
I'm going to try out this new chunk and
I'm probably going to bomb, but, uh,

1267
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:04,610
definitely going to give
you your money's worth.

1268
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:06,170
I really appreciate
everybody who showed up

1269
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,240
or who's going to show up or if this
is the next day who has showed up?

1270
