00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.390
I know I must have said it a thousand times

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.190
if I've said it once. But you have two copies of

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.440
every chromosome. One from Mom and one from Dad. I

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.420
find it easier to understand where my chromosomes come from if

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.480
I color them pink, say, for the ones that came

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.600
from Mom, and blue for the ones that came from Dad.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.240
But let's not forget that your Mom and your Dad

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.880
also had chromosomes from their parents, the maternal and paternal lines

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.710
of their own, your maternal grandma and grandpa, and your

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.560
paternal grandma and grandpa. And we could keep drawing this farther

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.010
and farther back in time. But if you like to

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.450
think about it, you're a mix of your grandparents as much

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.180
as you are your parents. If we just look over

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.650
here on your Mom's side, she had a whole set of

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.180
chromosomes from her mother and a whole set of chromosomes from

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.240
her father. And she didn't just pass down a whole complete

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.110
chromosome set from one of her parents

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.170
to you. When her germ cells underwent meiosis,

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.410
her chromosomes actually crossed over. This had

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.480
the effect of mixing and matching her own

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.510
parents chromosomes, your grandparent's chromosomes. So that when she passed

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.470
these chromosomes onto you, you'll notice that your maternal chromosomes are

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:16.560
actually a mix of your grandparents' chromosomes, recombination is

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.250
what allows you to actually have chromosomes that are

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.690
mixes and matches of your grandparents'. Now we can go

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.312
back in time to your great grandparents and we

00:01:26.312 --> 00:01:29.555
could have an even finer resolution map with four colors

00:01:29.555 --> 00:01:32.522
instead of two or your great great grandparents and

00:01:32.522 --> 00:01:35.280
do eight colors instead of four. And let's not forget

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.110
about your Dad over here, either. Your paternal chromosomes came

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.250
from your father, who had a mother and father himself.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.410
And his own maternal and paternal chromosomes underwent chromosome

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.670
recombination. And the result is a mix and match

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.625
of your Dad's parents' chromosomes. And then he passed

00:01:51.625 --> 00:01:54.750
one set of those chromosomes on to you. So

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.760
you're also a mix of your paternal grandparents as

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.420
well. So based on recombination in these inheritance patterns

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.420
from your parents and grandparents, how much DNA identity

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.260
do you share with any given grandparent? Go ahead and

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.009
pick which answer you think is best.
