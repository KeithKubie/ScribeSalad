00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So here we have our circular earth,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
which I'm trying to represent in 3 dimensions

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
by showing the equator, and somewhere here,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we have Syene, and somewhere here--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and I'm going to exaggerate this distance

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to make the drawing easier--we have Alexandria.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now to begin solving this problem, Eratosthenes did what

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
physicists often do when they're tackling

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a really difficult problem.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
He made an assumption.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And now the assumption that he made was that

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the sun was so far away, way, way, way

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
off the screen, that when the sun's rays arrive at the earth,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
they're coming more or less parallel

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
no matter where on the earth you are.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now these lines are parallel--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
we assume they'll never touch--

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and why was this a safe assumption to make?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Well, let's take a look.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Let's draw a little play version of the sun over here,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and now this is totally separate from what's going on over here,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and let's look at the sun's rays.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Here they are, radiating outwards from the center

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
from the sun, and you can tell that

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
they're certainly not parallel.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
What happens is we get really, really,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
really far away from the sun like way out here,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
where we've got more rays like this.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We can start to see that if we're really far away

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
from the sun--maybe if our earth is over here--

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
well, in this neighborhood, the rays

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
do look more or less parallel.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
They're not exactly parallel--they seem

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to be diverging a little bit--but

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
maybe it's good enough for our purposes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We'll examine this more in the homework.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Okay.  So we have our rays arriving parallel

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
at Syene and Alexandria.  Now what?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now how am I supposed to figure out the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
circumference of the earth based on some

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
parallel rays and the observation

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that they're striking vertically here at Syene.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Well, before we jump into the calculation of the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
circumference, let's try and understand what's

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
going on here first.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, we've already talked about a person standing

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
here in Syene--their shadow would be directly below them,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
because the sun's rays are striking vertically.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Here in Alexandria,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
a person would have a tiny little shadow,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and you can see that the angle from the head

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
of the shadow to the head of the person--

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
this line actually follows the sun's ray.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We'll be using that more later, but, for now, let's think.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If this person started walking north, closer to the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
pole up here, what would happen to his shadow?

00:02:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Would his shadow lengthen as he walked north, or would it get smaller?
