00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.070
Hey it's me Destin.Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. 
We're right in the middle of a 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.090
series on helicopters and we're gonna talk to you about.. What is this called?
(son) Parachute.

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.140
A parachute. 
So in airplanes, the pilot

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.320
can have a parachute so if anything 
goes south he can jump out

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.660
and he can parachute to safety.
Do you want to test the parachute real quick?

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.730
(son) Yeah I'll do it.
OK we're gonna use the parachute off the balcony here. Check this out.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.770
Daddy's gonna throw it. You ready?

00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:28.800
Parachute man...

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.500
in the ocean. 1...2...3...

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.000
Oh man! [laugh]

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.380
We just gave the parachute man to our neighbours.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.500
So think about this.
Let's say we're in a helicopter

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.670
and we're up high and all of a sudden we run 
into trouble when we run out of engine power

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.860
and we start to fall. 
So we've got this weight and it's

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.040
suspended by this rotor system. 
Now if we're smart about it we can

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.220
change the pitch on our blades to 
spin up our rotors really really fast.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.280
And then we have kind of like a 
pinwheel or a windmill effect.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.350
And if we're really smart, right at the last minute, 
right before we hit the ground,

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.400
we can change the pitch on those 
blades to provide lift. So we're

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.580
back driving our rotors and then right at the last 
minute we're using them to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.780
decelerate, right before we hit the ground. 
This is a manouver called autorotation,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.960
and this has kept helicopter pilots alive 
for many many years.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.150
In fact, they've even done autorotations from 40,000 feet.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.250
So a helicopter basically has a built-in parachute.
But with a helicopter you've got this

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.440
rotating disc right in front of you. 
So my question is, what happens if you lose power

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.790
at altitude. So this battery he just put in, what if it dies.
So what happens Carl?

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.970
(Carl) If you lose power in a helicopter you can autorotate.
Alright.

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.980
So Carl's gonna demonstrate autorotation and 
we'll get an idea for what happens.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.250
You're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.340
Alright so what exactly are we about to do here?

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.450
(Carl) We're gonna demonstrate autorotations. 
I'm gonna take you up a couple of hundred feet up in the air

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.740
shut the motor off, and fly it all the way 
to the ground without power.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.550
(Destin) Sounds like a genius idea to me.
(Carl) [laughs] Let's do it.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.980
(Destin) You know... This is expensive right?
(Carl) Yeah

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.220
[ rotor noise ]

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.310
Alright so where you at? How high?

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.490
(Carl) Aah this is probably about 300 feet. Three and I'm gonna

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.670
turn the motor off right now, and we're coming in without

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.850
power.
(Destin) On a very expensive helicopter.
(Carl) Oh yeah.
(Destin) So there's no power right now.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.030
(Carl) No power at all.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.200
(Destin) So why did that happen?

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.370
What did you just do?
(Carl) We're turning the pitch of the blades down,

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.470
and as the helicopter is falling down, the air being forced through by gravity

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.600
spins the blades.
(Destin) So it's like a windmill?
(Carl) It's like a windmill.
(Destin) So helicopters are

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.770
a whole lot safer than I thought. I'm gonna be honest with you I'm not very impressed though cause

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.970
it was right side up the whole time.
[laughs]

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.170
(Carl) Let's do it upside down.
(Destin) W..w..wait dude. I'm joking dude.

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.350
(Carl) Aah. Let's do it!
(Destin) He can do it.
(Carl) Let's do it!

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.430
I am not responsible for what's about to happen.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.520
[rotor sounds]

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.600
You don't have to do

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.780
it if you don't want to.
(Carl) [laugh]

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.950
(Destin) Are you upside down already?
(Carl) Oh yeah.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.130
(Carl) Here we go. We're gonna flip upside down.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.320
(Destin) So you have an unpowered..
(Carl) Power is off
(Destin) helicoper upside down.
(Carl) Correct.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.510
(Destin) This makes perfect sense. Holy cow.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.300
[laughs]

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.890
(Carl) There we go.
(Destin) That is messed up man. Alright so helicopters are

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.070
a whole lot safer than I thought, and if you want to see more about how they work

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.250
look at this video series that we're making, how to control helicopters. This is Carl.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.450
I put his info in the description. Please subscribe. Later. Where's my thinking hat?

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.640
I need my thinking hat.
