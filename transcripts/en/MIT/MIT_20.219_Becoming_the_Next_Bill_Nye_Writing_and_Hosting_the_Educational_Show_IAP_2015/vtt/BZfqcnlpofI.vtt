00:00:25.504 --> 00:00:26.920
GUEST SPEAKER: So
I'm going to try

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.461
to run through things
pretty quickly,

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:33.740
and if you don't have any sort
of video experience or still

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.070
photography experience, a lot of
this will sound foreign to you.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.360
If you do, some of it
will be very familiar.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.400
But either way,
if what I'm saying

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.110
is confusing because
of the density of it,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.460
I would just sort of encourage
you not to be too freaked out.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.170
Because the takeaways are
actually fairly simple.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.630
It's kind of like--
again, there's

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.338
a lot of complicated
technology and a lot

00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:58.605
of complicated technique, but
the base is pretty simple.

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:00.980
And what I'm going to do--
partly what I want to do today

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.709
is just expose you to
some concepts and terms

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:08.710
that you actually may not have
to really fully grasp or have

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.850
mastery of in order
to make your video.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.570
But it's worth it to
at least kind of know

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.115
what they are I think.

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:16.990
PROFESSOR: And I can
condense my [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.870
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.849
But I do want to-- I'm
very cognizant of not

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:22.640
wanting to spend more
than like 30 minutes.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.372
So can you tell me-- if
I'm like maybe 10 to 2:00,

00:01:27.372 --> 00:01:29.080
just kind of give me
a wave or something.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.120
And I'll condense even more.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.620
OK.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.780
So visual language, there's
sort of a question here--

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.420
what do we mean by
visual language?

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.336
Because it's kind of a
contradiction in terms.

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:41.660
Sometimes we think of
language and the visual

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.700
as being at odds
with each other.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.620
We have text.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.707
We have speech.

00:01:45.707 --> 00:01:48.040
And we talk about, oh, well,
we've got to make a visual.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.110
So what is a visual language?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.600
It goes back to something
that I talked about

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.870
in the first class.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.895
And in some ways what
I'm going to do today

00:01:57.895 --> 00:01:59.520
is try to build on
some of those things

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.200
as I sort of race through them.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.280
We have all of these
plastic elements of film

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.700
that we can manipulate.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.919
And today I'm going to
focus on a handful of them,

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.290
in particular camera.

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.540
Because the camera is
kind of the speech device

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.044
that allows us to speak
in this visual language.

00:02:17.044 --> 00:02:18.960
And Elizabeth made a
really interesting point,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.000
or quoted a very
interesting kind of way

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.110
of thinking about it,
which was all of us

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.580
understand this language better
than any generation that's

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.840
ever lived, Because we just have
consumed it our entire lives.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.800
But that doesn't
mean we can speak it,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.806
and understanding that
is a great first step

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:36.430
in speaking it.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.060
But you really have to kind of
unpack it and think about it

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.930
consciously in order to be
able to kind of reproduce

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.020
it or change it and make
it what you want it to be.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.660
Anyway, so I'm going to
race through some of these

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.450
fairly quickly, focused
mostly on camera,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.520
and I'm going to dispense
with sound right away.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.844
Because I just want
to say about sound--

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:59.260
don't dispense
with it right away.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.600
Don't do what I'm doing.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.980
It is super, super important.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.160
I think I mentioned
this the other day,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.379
getting good sound is
absolutely critical.

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.545
And sometimes sound can be
more important than pitch

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:13.480
and all this stuff I'm
going to talk about.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.750
It's also sort of the
boring part sometimes.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.320
Well, you know, is the
microphone close enough to me?

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.164
I don't know.

00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:20.080
Who's listening to me?

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.351
Am I OK?

00:03:21.351 --> 00:03:21.850
Good.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.558
All right, because
it's really important.

00:03:23.558 --> 00:03:25.780
Because if you don't
hear me-- or even

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.280
if you can sort of hear
me, but it's a camera mic

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.780
and it's six feet away,
there's a huge barrier

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.680
between your audience
and your material.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.480
So do not skimp on sound.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.160
The environmental
sound is important.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.390
It's important to
be in a quiet room.

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.230
It's important to have
good mic placement.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.750
It's important not to have a
signal be too soft or too loud.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.350
Listen with your ears.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.130
And then creatively you can
do so much with sound too

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.970
with music and sound effects.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.540
But I don't really have time
to talk about that stuff.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.060
PROFESSOR: I'll go
over that stuff.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.500
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.000
Yeah.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.880
OK, good.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.330
I just want to sort of make
the pitch to not forget

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.610
about sound in all of this.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.140
But let's go on and
talk about camera.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.300
And I don't know if there
are any theater people here,

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.120
or people who have
done theater, but I

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.203
want to start with this
concept of the proscenium.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.459
Film and video, film at
least, has been around

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.899
for over 100 years-- 125
years or something like that.

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.600
The sort of first
Edison experiments

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.230
or the Lumiere
brothers in France I

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.000
think it was the
late 19th century.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.080
And for the first 20
years of the technology,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.290
the way people kind of
accessed it or thought

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.510
about it and the kinds
of things that people did

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.050
were based on theater.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.760
Because that, of course,
is thousands of years old.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.490
In a theater, you
sit in an audience,

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.710
and there's a frame,
which is the proscenium.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.440
And then stuff
happens in the frame.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.090
And a lot of the
plastic elements

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.070
that we ran through the other
day are very, very relevant.

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.220
You've got lighting.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.170
You've got staging.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.840
You've got a frame, a sort
of placement of people.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.950
You've got costumes.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.590
You've got sound effects,
music even, all sorts

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.040
of things-- very, very similar.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.850
But it all happens in
this kind of static frame

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.880
right there in the middle
of your field of view.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.700
And it was really
literally about 20 years

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.830
before people started
going, oh, with a camera

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.770
we can do something a little
bit different than that.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.390
The first films-- and these
were wildly popular films.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.850
It was already a big industry.

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.850
Very quickly it turned into
a major, major entertainment

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.550
and communication industry.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.610
But people would
set up a camera,

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.080
and then people would do their
thing in front of the camera.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.085
And then they would
project the thing,

00:05:45.085 --> 00:05:47.210
and people would be like,
wow, this is really cool.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.820
This is like theater, except we
can watch it again and again.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.750
And this is very relevant
to educational video,

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.810
because that is essentially
what a lecture is.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.900
A lecture is a proscenium
presentation of material.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.100
And the question which you're
asking yourselves in this class

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.990
is-- OK, we've got that.

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.462
We get that.

00:06:09.462 --> 00:06:12.020
When we watch
media, whether it's

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:14.110
online or on television
or in a theater,

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.810
obviously we have
progressed way beyond that

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.190
visually, in terms
of visual language,

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.010
and the tools and techniques
that we use to do that

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.940
are the things that
you need to do in order

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.564
to become conversant
in this quote

00:06:27.564 --> 00:06:29.730
unquote "visual language,"
not just a consumer of it

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.440
but a speaker of it.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.820
So I'm going to
go over something

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.200
that is sort of like
a convenient bucket

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:45.120
to put things into, and
it's also easy to remember.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.050
When I think about camera,
I think about the four F's.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.000
And some of them
are F because I make

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.240
them be F. It just is easier.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.280
So F-stop or
exposure-- and if you

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.290
know anything about
photography or film,

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.630
F-stop is the aperture
of the camera lens,

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:04.930
and you can let more
or less light in.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.500
But what I mean by that
actually is not just

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.980
the F-stop or the
exposure of the lens,

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:11.960
but how you control the light.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.950
It could be lighting.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.544
It could be the shutter speed.

00:07:14.544 --> 00:07:15.960
There are a million
different ways

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.460
of controlling the exposure
of what you're filming.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.280
The second thing is focus.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.360
The first thing about focus is
it's a good idea to have it.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.360
It's kind of one of those
non-negotiable things.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.180
You really do want something
to be in focus in your frame.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.130
Sometimes you might not, but
it's better to do that in post.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.690
Always make sure
something's in focus.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.380
You may be working
with cameras that

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.720
take care of this for you--
both of these-- the exposure

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.309
and the focus.

00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:39.850
I'm not sure.

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:40.784
Is that true?

00:07:40.784 --> 00:07:41.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.105
So they're all working with the
[INAUDIBLE] or your iPhones.

00:07:45.105 --> 00:07:46.896
The equipment that you
guys will be working

00:07:46.896 --> 00:07:50.260
with, you won't have
to necessarily-- it's

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.790
not an element that you
can control necessarily

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:54.980
on the device itself.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:55.915
GUEST SPEAKER: Or
you can control it

00:07:55.915 --> 00:07:57.530
only by fooling
the device, which

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.840
is something you might
want to do if you get more

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.834
sort of comfortable with it.

00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:03.500
PROFESSOR: To do focus
on these cameras,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.328
you just literally touch the
touchscreen with your finger

00:08:06.328 --> 00:08:08.520
where you want that
to be in focus.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:09.895
And exposure,
we're going to have

00:08:09.895 --> 00:08:12.397
to tweak with the external
lighting and stuff.

00:08:12.397 --> 00:08:13.230
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:14.330
Yeah.

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.460
99 times out of 100 it's
pretty straightforward.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.660
And the auto systems
on newer cameras

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.290
are really pretty good about it.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:23.710
So I'm not going to spend a
lot of time dwelling on that.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.610
But they're kind
of non-negotiable.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.820
You want to get a
good exposure, and you

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.200
want to get something in focus.

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.830
And 9 times out of
10 that something

00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.789
is someone's face, the
person who you're filming--

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:36.015
not always but usually.

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.610
The third one is focal length.

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:41.260
And that is basically
how many millimeters

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:44.210
you are shooting at from
wide angle to telephoto.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:47.000
And you're not going to be
changing lenses on the camera,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.120
but you can zoom in and out.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.230
Focal length is not the same
thing as wide shot or close up.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.010
People often think that
that's true, but it's not.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.485
You can go completely wide angle
on a camera, and then walk up--

00:08:58.485 --> 00:09:01.800
I can walk right up to
Elizabeth and get a close up.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.890
And similarly, I can go
all the way telephoto

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.530
and walk back 50 feet
and get a wide shot.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:10.030
But they have very, very
different kinds of resonances

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.100
and feelings and emotions.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.990
So I'll try to talk a little
bit about that in a minute.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.540
You might want to do
everything at a very long lens.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:22.100
You might want to do
everything at a wide angle.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.475
It will mean
something different.

00:09:23.475 --> 00:09:25.370
It will feel different.

00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:27.020
Framing-- this is
the big one, and this

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.519
is kind of like the
catch all that I

00:09:28.519 --> 00:09:33.980
throw all of this sort of real
thinking about visual language

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.796
into.

00:09:34.796 --> 00:09:36.170
It's not just
framing as I talked

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.690
about the other day, like,
oh, gee, do I center somebody?

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.440
Do I put them on the
right or on the left?

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.950
It's the entire
structure of your video.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.159
How am I going to shoot this?

00:09:46.159 --> 00:09:47.575
Where I'm going
to put the camera?

00:09:47.575 --> 00:09:49.144
How is it going
to edit together?

00:09:49.144 --> 00:09:50.310
Is the camera going to move?

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.450
Is it not going to move?

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.930
So framing is the
big one, and that's

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.970
mostly what I'm going to talk
about today in that broader

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.460
context.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.970
Quickly, so exposure-- just
to get this out of the way--

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.580
this is what an aperture
looks like and the lens.

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:08.095
Again, it's automated for you.

00:10:08.095 --> 00:10:11.256
A big number means not a lot
of light getting through,

00:10:11.256 --> 00:10:13.690
a little number means a lot
of light is getting through.

00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:15.740
This affects the
exposure in a way

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.190
that I'm not going to get into.

00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:19.231
But basically you have a
lot more depth of field,

00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:21.280
a lot more will be in
focus the smaller the hole.

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:25.910
Because the photons that get
through are more directed,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.990
they're less scattered.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.870
And we talked about this.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:35.200
Just as a sort of an example
of classic elements of film--

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.275
so these are two stills from
Science Out Loud videos.

00:10:38.275 --> 00:10:40.400
I think we saw a little
bit of the Exoplanets video

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:40.983
the other day.

00:10:40.983 --> 00:10:42.942
I don't know if you've
seen this one on plants.

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:44.857
PROFESSOR: I think they
did just a little bit.

00:10:44.857 --> 00:10:45.750
GUEST SPEAKER: OK.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.958
What I thought was really
interesting about these two

00:10:47.958 --> 00:10:53.400
frames is if I was storyboarding
this, what would I draw?

00:10:53.400 --> 00:11:02.300
I would draw something
like this-- medium shot,

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.570
presenting to camera.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:06.130
But that doesn't
capture anything

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:10.870
about what is compelling
about these shots.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:13.020
It's all the other stuff.

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.160
Here we are launching
into space, deep space,

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.650
to look at planets.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:22.500
And here we are-- bright,
welcoming the world of plants.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.100
It's kind of an obvious point.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.740
But this tells us
nothing about that,

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:29.832
unless you then add a
lot of other information.

00:11:29.832 --> 00:11:31.790
And that's kind of what
storyboarding is about.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.570
It's not just about what
does my shot look like,

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:37.720
but it's about-- what is all the
stuff in the shot that's going

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.920
to really make it compelling?

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.070
And it's really a
great moment to start

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.840
thinking about locations--
a field of flowers.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.420
Wow.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.850
I guess I need a
field of flowers.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.058
Where am I going to get that?

00:11:49.058 --> 00:11:51.300
Or what if everything was black?

00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.520
What if it's a black screen?

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.978
And how are we
going to shoot that?

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.570
Lighting-- I don't know if
that's even an option here.

00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:00.800
I'm not going to go into it.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:02.633
PROFESSOR: We have a
light kit if people are

00:12:02.633 --> 00:12:05.634
interested in doing lighting.

00:12:05.634 --> 00:12:09.530
But come talk to either one
of us during office hours

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.945
or after class or something.

00:12:11.945 --> 00:12:13.320
GUEST SPEAKER:
The only thing I'm

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:15.630
going to say about lighting
is it's kind of like being

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.190
a doctor, like,
first do no harm.

00:12:18.190 --> 00:12:21.070
If you bring the
lights out, and you

00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:22.820
don't know what
you're doing, and you

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:25.750
aren't trained on the kit,
you can break the kit.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.780
You can hurt yourself
or someone else,

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:30.410
or you can ruin your video.

00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:33.380
On the other hand,
it's really, really

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.470
an important tool and
something that-- you

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.240
can't shoot certain
kinds of things

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.702
without some kind of lighting.

00:12:40.702 --> 00:12:42.410
I'm not necessarily
recommending that you

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.760
try to use artificial lights
or become a lighting expert.

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.320
It's a little beyond the scope.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:53.006
But if there's something like--
to go back to this example--

00:12:53.006 --> 00:12:57.430
you have to light to
get a look like that.

00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:59.900
Some kind of lighting
has to be done-- maybe

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.420
not film lighting
or video lighting,

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.840
but some kind of lighting set
up has to be created in order

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.000
to get a look like that.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.856
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:07.856 --> 00:13:08.897
GUEST SPEAKER: I'm sorry.

00:13:08.897 --> 00:13:10.621
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:10.621 --> 00:13:11.579
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:11.579 --> 00:13:14.230
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh,
you can improve it,

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.180
but you have to begin
with something that's been

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.050
filmed with that intention.

00:13:20.050 --> 00:13:21.830
PROFESSOR: If you have
an effect that you

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.288
want to do in your video, you
can come talk to me about it.

00:13:24.288 --> 00:13:28.450
Because we achieve some of
these things with jankier props.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:32.212
I've done-- I'm not proud to
admit this in front of Chris.

00:13:32.212 --> 00:13:33.420
GUEST SPEAKER: No, that's OK.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.520
PROFESSOR: I've done a shoot--

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.110
GUEST SPEAKER:
Oh, you don't even

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:37.610
know janky till you've been on
some of the shoots I've done.

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:39.530
PROFESSOR: I've done
a few with desk lamps

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.950
that I've covered with
white tissue paper

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.450
to help diffuse the light.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.359
You don't need a
super fancy light kit

00:13:45.359 --> 00:13:46.890
to achieve some of the basics.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.450
GUEST SPEAKER: No, absolutely.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:51.890
And that's exactly what
I'm about to get into.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.830
To do sort of like
a darkroom thing,

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:56.980
you don't need a
fancy video light kit,

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:59.210
but you do need to
light the person.

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.650
And yeah, it could be a
desk lamp with paper over it

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.360
to sort of smooth it out,
to diffuse the light,

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.510
but you will need
to do something.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.500
It's not going to
just magically happen.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:12.020
And that's the point
of this-- lighting

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.870
doesn't necessarily
mean a video light kit.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.040
It means being aware
of the environment

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.640
and the available light that
you're shooting in and taking

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:23.070
that into account either
by manipulating that thing,

00:14:23.070 --> 00:14:25.980
like a light kit, or
by taking advantage

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:29.322
of the best light in the
world, which is the sun.

00:14:29.322 --> 00:14:31.280
So for example, if I was
shooting in this room,

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.250
and I didn't have any lights--
I might love the background out

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:35.790
there.

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.370
But shooting somebody
in front of that window

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:41.280
is not going to be possible if
I want to get the background.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.330
Because by the time I expose
for the person's face,

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.620
the background is going
to completely blown out.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:48.090
And if I expose
for the background,

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:49.173
the person is silhouetted.

00:14:49.173 --> 00:14:51.560
So unless I want
that look, I really

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:53.920
can't have it unless
I bring in lights.

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.640
And it would actually take
quite a bit of lighting.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.180
Fluorescents-- you can do a
lot with fluorescent overheads.

00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:03.670
The difference between me
standing here-- look at my face

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:08.156
here, and look at my face here.

00:15:08.156 --> 00:15:09.780
Where do you want
your person to stand?

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.180
And you can manipulate
that kind of thing

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.390
even in a lab or a classroom
or some other setting.

00:15:16.390 --> 00:15:19.140
You can make choices based
on the available light

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.180
or the ambient light
that will help you.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.850
And the other thing to think
about in terms of exposure--

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.710
going back to
exposure-- is what do

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.980
I want to be properly exposed?

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.120
In that face floating
in blackness,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.662
the face is properly exposed.

00:15:35.662 --> 00:15:37.120
Everything else is
very, very dark.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:39.200
But the face is
properly exposed.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.780
In the flower shot, the whole
thing is properly exposed.

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:44.786
It's more even lighting.

00:15:44.786 --> 00:15:46.410
There's some nice
modeling on the face.

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.385
But the whole point
of that is that you

00:15:48.385 --> 00:15:50.760
want to see the environment,
you want to see the flowers,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.240
you want to have this very
vibrant, bright scene.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.087
So being very sensitive to
the light that's available

00:15:59.087 --> 00:15:59.920
is part of lighting.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.940
It's not necessarily setting
up a bunch of light stands

00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:06.630
and video lights and spending
two hours when you should

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.270
have been shooting your scene.

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:10.440
Because it can also be
very time consuming.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.086
PROFESSOR: Just a quick tip on
lighting-- since most of you

00:16:13.086 --> 00:16:14.996
will probably be filming
indoors and relying

00:16:14.996 --> 00:16:18.581
a lot on fluorescent overhead
lights, the only caveat

00:16:18.581 --> 00:16:21.281
to that is that
oftentimes-- there are only

00:16:21.281 --> 00:16:24.810
two people in here-- but for
me, the glasses is a big issue.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:27.310
You'll get like a weird shadow
underneath on people's faces.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:28.500
GUEST SPEAKER: Or a
glare in the lens.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:29.666
PROFESSOR: Yeah, or a glare.

00:16:29.666 --> 00:16:32.610
So you can compensate for that
with maybe a desk lamp that's

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:35.626
also shone on your face
from a little bit below

00:16:35.626 --> 00:16:37.524
to hide some of those shadows.

00:16:37.524 --> 00:16:39.690
GUEST SPEAKER: Particularly,
as Elizabeth mentioned,

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.710
if you diffuse that light
with some kind of tissue

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:45.530
or something in front
of it-- because one

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.190
thing about lighting-- the
first do no harm-- when you're

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.460
lighting faces,
harsh, direct light,

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.160
whether it's sunlight or
desk lamps or video lights,

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.900
are very unflattering.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.140
So that's absolutely
a great tip.

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.810
But I think it's
always a good idea

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.210
to sort of try to diffuse it.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.540
If it's not a hot
light, you can put

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.060
like a tissue or a white
paper towel in front of it,

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.852
and it will give this
very nice soft light.

00:17:10.852 --> 00:17:13.018
PROFESSOR: But if you're
shooting something indoors,

00:17:13.018 --> 00:17:15.469
and you just feel
like the person looks

00:17:15.469 --> 00:17:17.490
a little funky on
the screen, it's

00:17:17.490 --> 00:17:20.049
probably because it's
an overhead light that's

00:17:20.049 --> 00:17:21.519
casting shadow.

00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:24.772
So just experiment with
a desk lamp or something.

00:17:24.772 --> 00:17:27.230
GUEST SPEAKER: And I'm not
going to go into focus too much.

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:28.646
Because again, I
know you're going

00:17:28.646 --> 00:17:30.090
to be working with autofocus.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:33.730
But just to say-- make sure that
what you want to be in focus

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.285
is in focus.

00:17:36.285 --> 00:17:37.660
There are all
sorts of things you

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.690
can do to mess with
the depth of field,

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.170
which is like how much of
the plane of your image

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:43.220
is in focus.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.170
So if you have a very--
if you're very wide open,

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:47.760
if there's not a
lot of light, then

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.330
suddenly you have
very shallow focus.

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:50.996
Which means that if
you were filming me,

00:17:50.996 --> 00:17:53.090
my face might be in
focus, and the background

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:55.240
would be out of focus.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.820
If you are stopping
way, way down

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.559
because there's a ton
of light, suddenly

00:17:59.559 --> 00:18:02.100
it's a very deep focus situation
where everything's in focus.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:03.766
And that may or may
not be a good thing.

00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:05.090
You may not want more focus.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:08.160
There's something very
nice about just what you

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.416
want to be in focus and
everything else being out

00:18:10.416 --> 00:18:12.290
of focus, because that
makes people's eyes go

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:14.930
to what you want them to see.

00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:16.753
It also creates
depth in the frame.

00:18:16.753 --> 00:18:18.211
PROFESSOR: Does
everyone understand

00:18:18.211 --> 00:18:22.150
what depth of field
in the frame means?

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.404
GUEST SPEAKER: Here I am.

00:18:23.404 --> 00:18:25.070
I don't know if you've
seen this Science

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.880
Out Loud video, Engineering
Trash into Treasure.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:28.550
I won't show it.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.270
But it's got a
really nice opening,

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:33.020
which uses depth of
field really effectively.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.350
So this is a person talking
about the creation of charcoal.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.180
And in the foreground are the
props, and she's out of focus.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.140
And it's kind of
counter-intuitive,

00:18:41.140 --> 00:18:44.610
because your presenter
is out of focus

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.740
and the props are in
focus in the foreground.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.525
But it's actually quite
engaging and interesting.

00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:51.400
And then what they do--
and this is something

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.566
that you will have a hard
time doing if you are just

00:18:53.566 --> 00:18:56.950
doing autofocus-- is they
shift the focus to reveal her.

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:57.962
And that's a reveal.

00:18:57.962 --> 00:18:59.920
That's something we talked
about the other day.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.510
Revealing things is part
of the visual language

00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:06.250
that you want to think
about-- whether it's

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:11.360
a cut, with an edit, a change
of the angle, a pan, a camera

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.420
move.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.770
Revealing your next
thing is really just kind

00:19:15.770 --> 00:19:17.900
of a key visual element.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:23.554
So here it's like the burning--
I forget what kind of--

00:19:23.554 --> 00:19:24.470
PROFESSOR: Corn husks.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.640
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.706
The burning corn
husks come into frame,

00:19:26.706 --> 00:19:28.330
and then the charcoal
comes into frame,

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:30.454
and then the focus shifts
and you reveal the person

00:19:30.454 --> 00:19:31.800
who's been talking to you.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.500
It's cool.

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.130
It's quite a nice
little opening.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:36.338
PROFESSOR: It's really hard
to achieve depth of field

00:19:36.338 --> 00:19:38.550
with these camcorders.

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.926
One way you can
sort of trick it is

00:19:40.926 --> 00:19:44.568
if you stand really far in
front of your background.

00:19:44.568 --> 00:19:47.332
That's the closest way you're
going to get that blurry

00:19:47.332 --> 00:19:49.375
background effect.

00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:52.270
So if you wanted to film in
this classroom for instance,

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:55.174
and you didn't want the
stuff on the chalkboard

00:19:55.174 --> 00:19:57.230
to be really visible,
you would have

00:19:57.230 --> 00:20:01.774
Chris move up all the way up to
maybe where David is at least

00:20:01.774 --> 00:20:03.690
and then shoot from the
very back of the room.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:03.940
GUEST SPEAKER: Right.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.064
And so that's what this is.

00:20:05.064 --> 00:20:08.320
So again, you have a zoom lens.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.720
If you go all the
way wide on the lens,

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.600
you have much deeper focus than
if you zoom all the way in.

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:16.640
So if I walk up
and shoot Elizabeth

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.850
with a very wide angle,
everything behind her

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.160
will be in focus.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:22.940
If I go way back there, and I
get the same kind of close up

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:26.209
of Elizabeth with a
longer part of the zoom,

00:20:26.209 --> 00:20:28.000
everything behind her
will be out of focus.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.250
Which might be
better if we don't

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.650
care about the background,
or if it's messy.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:36.240
I've often been in labs
that just look horrible.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:38.140
And the best way
to handle that is

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:42.380
to zoom way in, go way back,
and have the background be

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.962
way out of focus.

00:20:43.962 --> 00:20:45.420
Or you can, as
Elizabeth mentioned,

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.878
you can bring the
person forward so

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:49.074
that there's a lot of
distance between the person

00:20:49.074 --> 00:20:49.865
and the background.

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.540
So focus, focal length,
all of these things

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.760
relate to each other.

00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.110
And again, we're going
to move a little quickly.

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.860
PROFESSOR: It's about 10 till.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.651
GUEST SPEAKER: No, I'm
doing fine, I think.

00:21:02.651 --> 00:21:04.110
I think I'm doing OK.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:05.840
This is an extreme wide angle.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.670
You can see how
deep the focus is.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:10.920
It's infinity.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.210
And this is a telephoto,
so it's a close up,

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:19.390
but even the leaf behind
the bird is out of focus.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:23.190
Just a word about zooms-- so
there are two kinds of zoom,

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:24.910
and there's one kind
of danger-- well,

00:21:24.910 --> 00:21:26.450
two kinds of danger actually.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:30.010
Optical zoom, which is if you
zoom in and out with the zoom

00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:32.310
control on your camera.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.520
That is the way you
change the focal length.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.230
Then there's digital zoom, which
is usually on these cameras--

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.604
I'm assuming these
are like this.

00:21:39.604 --> 00:21:41.240
If you go past a
certain point, you're

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.080
not changing the
lens anymore, you're

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.625
just zooming in on the
image itself digitally.

00:21:47.625 --> 00:21:49.500
The problem with that
is that your resolution

00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.820
goes down immediately.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.170
It looks really bad.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.520
It starts to pixelate
and just fall apart.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.015
So I would recommend that
you not use the digital zoom.

00:21:58.015 --> 00:22:00.140
It's kind one of those
situations where people say,

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.306
oh, well, when I can use it?

00:22:01.306 --> 00:22:05.340
I'm like, well, when the UFO
is landing in Killian Court,

00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.470
and you're just too far
away to get the shot,

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.990
definitely use the digital zoom.

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.130
But if you have
time to do something

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.170
different or plan a
little differently

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:19.970
then stick with the optical.

00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:23.550
PROFESSOR: And also realize
that you can zoom in on a frame

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.380
and post when you're editing.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:29.040
So it's generally better to
just capture something wider.

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:32.340
So say you want to do like a
traditional interview set up,

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.720
and you're not
sure how close you

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.250
should be into your subject.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.800
Go ahead and err on
the side of zooming out

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:38.904
as much as possible.

00:22:38.904 --> 00:22:40.445
You can always play
with how much you

00:22:40.445 --> 00:22:42.660
zoom when you're editing later.

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.980
And the other thing about
zooming-- maybe this

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.860
is just a matter of
personal preference.

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:51.100
But generally, I don't like it
when I see the camera zooming

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.110
in live time.

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:55.070
I prefer seeing just a
clean cut from a wider

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:56.195
angle to the zooming angle.

00:22:56.195 --> 00:22:57.861
GUEST SPEAKER: And
that's the other part

00:22:57.861 --> 00:22:59.230
of the danger for sure.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.660
Yeah.

00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:03.380
Zooms in general--
unless you're doing it

00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.644
because you know what you're
doing-- all these rules

00:23:05.644 --> 00:23:06.560
are made to be broken.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.840
That's something I should
mention right up front.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.800
They're often kind of
the lazy person's way

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.600
of doing something.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.350
And in general, I
would even go so far as

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.766
to say even if
you're not planning

00:23:16.766 --> 00:23:21.340
to show the zoom-- if I was,
again, filming Elizabeth,

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:24.620
and I wanted to get a wide
shot, so I shoot her here.

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:26.210
And then I want a close up.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:29.100
And I zoom in on Elizabeth,
and I get the close up.

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.770
There's something
kind of unpleasing

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:36.190
about going from a wide angle
shot to a zoomed in telephoto

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:37.570
shot of somebody.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:40.220
The more sort of
smart way to do it

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:42.420
is to pick a focal
length that makes

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.290
Elizabeth look great and
gives you what you want

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.240
and then move the camera in.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:50.090
Don't change the focal
length of the lens

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.220
when you change the
size of the shot.

00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:55.730
So maybe I end up
on a medium shot,

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:56.939
in terms of the focal length.

00:23:56.939 --> 00:23:59.563
And then when I want to get the
close up, I pick up the camera,

00:23:59.563 --> 00:24:01.134
and I walk in and
get the close up.

00:24:01.134 --> 00:24:03.550
And that's going to cut better,
it's going to look better,

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.633
it's going to feel better.

00:24:04.633 --> 00:24:07.550
It's going to feel like
just more controlled

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:09.660
and like you sort of
knew what you were doing.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:14.279
So zooms-- very useful,
dangerous as well.

00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:15.820
All right, so back
to the proscenium.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.135
I just want to say a
little bit about framing.

00:24:18.135 --> 00:24:20.260
What shots do you actually
need to tell your story?

00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:22.270
Well, the way you figure
that out is exactly

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:24.780
the way you do it with
animation or anything else,

00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.090
you do a storyboard.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:30.060
And this is a storyboard I did
a few years ago for a narrative

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:30.990
scene.

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:33.090
But you'll see it contains
a lot of the things

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.400
that we've talked
about in this class.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.800
Who's our main character?

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.507
This kid.

00:24:38.507 --> 00:24:39.340
How do we know that?

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:40.923
Well, the next shot
is a point of view

00:24:40.923 --> 00:24:43.420
of what this person is seeing.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.240
There's a moving shot up, and
the next thing that you see

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.170
is his grandfather's reveal.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:50.545
You see what they're looking at.

00:24:50.545 --> 00:24:51.920
And only then do
you actually see

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.530
a wide shot, which is a
home-built airplane being

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:55.860
pushed down a field.

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.950
So this is kind of
visual storytelling--

00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:01.610
a very simple thing.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:02.840
Who's our character?

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.550
What do they see?

00:25:04.550 --> 00:25:06.470
Who's around them?

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.012
And then revealing
the whole scene--

00:25:08.012 --> 00:25:09.970
it could have been done
completely differently.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:11.040
This could have
been the first shot.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.998
It could have been--
let's establish the scene.

00:25:12.998 --> 00:25:14.130
Let's see all the people.

00:25:14.130 --> 00:25:18.310
Then let's kind of cut in
and see our main character,

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.290
or maybe it's revealed later.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:22.170
There's no right or
wrong answer here.

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.010
But the point is is
that what you want to do

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.890
is think through your scene
just as you do with animation.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.130
That whole process that
Josh took you through

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.695
is completely relevant
to absolutely everything

00:25:32.695 --> 00:25:33.820
that you're going to shoot.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.520
Just a few notes about
what different shots do.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.400
Wide shots establish the
location, the environment,

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.980
the spatial relationships.

00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.927
They add production value.

00:25:45.927 --> 00:25:47.510
I don't know about
you, but if I could

00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:49.870
go to the top of this bridge,
I would shoot this shot.

00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:52.520
I wouldn't not, because
this is awesome.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.480
And that's happened.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.400
I've seen that happen.

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.660
People get an incredible
location, an incredible view,

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.930
and they don't get a shot
that shows where they were.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:05.960
That's what we call
production value.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.580
Similarly, I think this
is an awesome picture.

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.800
This was actually taken in 1911.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:17.310
This is a pre-revolution
Russian nobleman

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.560
in a tiny village in Russia.

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.600
It was taken in 1911.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.570
It's an amazing picture.

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:24.890
But I would feel like
I missed a huge amount

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:27.650
if it was just his face.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:29.340
You learn so much
about the environment,

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.160
you learn so much about the
person, by having a wide shot.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.540
If this was a video, I might
want to also have a close

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.290
up when I started to hear about
him and learn about who he was.

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:42.850
But boy, this is great.

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:45.060
How could you miss that?

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:48.720
So again, showing environments,
getting production value,

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.960
establishing characters and
relationships, relationships

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.870
and space.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.120
Closer shots-- well,
they kind of bring you

00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.100
into someone's world.

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.440
They reveal details--
closer shots

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.930
of a face, closer shots of
what the person is looking at.

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:07.230
If you're explaining
something, obviously,

00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:11.510
really good close shots
that show the angle,

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:14.880
show from a good angle what
you're trying to describe

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.620
are very, very important.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.619
So again, it's kind
of obvious, but just

00:27:19.619 --> 00:27:20.910
make sure to get those as well.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.330
You want to get the wide shot.

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:24.930
But if you're actually
describing a process that's

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:27.170
like a physical process
that somebody is doing,

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:29.872
make sure you document it well,
and that you don't shoot it

00:27:29.872 --> 00:27:31.580
from the angle where
the person's hand is

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.827
covering the key thing.

00:27:34.827 --> 00:27:36.910
Just look at your frame
and see if you're actually

00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:40.880
communicating what you
want to communicate.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.280
Moving shots-- endless
kinds of moving shots.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.640
You can pan the
camera on a tripod.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.000
You can walk with a camera.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.640
You can move on a dolly.

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.770
They have all sorts
of good great uses.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.720
They reveal story beats.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.130
If, again, to keep
picking on Elizabeth,

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.260
if I want to introduce
Elizabeth, and I dolly

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.019
or pan over to
Elizabeth, people want

00:28:03.019 --> 00:28:05.060
to know what the end of
that shot is going to be.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:07.190
What am I going to see?

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.770
Oh, this person,
who's a character

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.810
that I am supposed
to pay attention to.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.890
Or you can follow a person,
it creates a very strong point

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:15.390
of view.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:18.730
If someone's walking and talking
and you're following them,

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.950
then we pay attention
to that person,

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:24.290
because the camera is picking
them out of the background

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:25.650
to pay attention to.

00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.580
So that's part of
this visual language.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.900
Similarly, we could
do a point of view

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.840
of that person's
walking, and then we're

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.090
suddenly into their world.

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:38.120
So kind of a classic situation
is someone's walking,

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:41.270
we're following them, and
then you cut to the reverse,

00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:43.570
and you see what they see.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.500
And now we're in their head.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.140
So it's another great thing.

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.107
And then there's just kind
of the classic one of we

00:28:52.107 --> 00:28:54.440
have reptile brains-- this
is the same reason we edit it

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.440
quickly.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.930
Here's a new thing, you can
either cut to a new thing,

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:02.905
or you can pan or
dolly to a new thing.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:10.685
Let's see-- just a quick
word about locations.

00:29:13.342 --> 00:29:15.300
You're going to talk
about this too, but always

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:16.440
scout your locations.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.530
It's smart producing,
which Elizabeth

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:21.866
is going to talk about, but
it's also very smart creatively.

00:29:21.866 --> 00:29:23.240
I have been in so
many situations

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:27.390
where I've gone to a location
a few days in advance,

00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.030
and I have completely
rewritten my script

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:31.660
based on the location.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:34.380
Either because I saw a problem
that I wasn't anticipating--

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:37.030
like a classic one
is, OK, well, we're

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.900
going to film all this stuff
at the electron microscope,

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.610
but there's a column here,
and I can't shoot anything

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:44.970
from this angle.

00:29:44.970 --> 00:29:46.100
Oh, shit.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.070
It's really good to find that
out a few days in advance,

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.110
because you can't
move the microscope.

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:53.206
So what are you going to do?

00:29:53.206 --> 00:29:54.830
Or because the location
is really cool,

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:55.913
and there's amazing stuff.

00:29:55.913 --> 00:29:57.720
And you get very
excited, because there's

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:01.370
all sorts of possibilities that
open up that you couldn't have

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:04.190
ever imagined just sitting,
doing your own story

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:06.970
board in your room or
writing your script.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.720
But suddenly because
this place is amazing,

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:11.890
you see all sorts of
things that you could do.

00:30:11.890 --> 00:30:15.510
So I always suggest trying
to visit your location.

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:18.520
One, for just kind of
practical scouting reasons,

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:23.260
like is there a chainsaw
factory next door?

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.570
But two, because
it can completely

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.180
affect your creative vision.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.770
And try to do it
enough in advance

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.561
so that you can
incorporate what you learn.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:34.650
So I'm going to just
wrap up with a couple

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:36.050
words about editing.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.539
This is where all of
the stuff comes together

00:30:38.539 --> 00:30:40.580
and where you find out
whether your plan worked--

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.210
your storyboard, your visual
language, your script.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.710
And it's also where you fix all
the things that didn't work.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.043
And I guarantee you that
plenty of things will not work.

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:54.910
Just a word about pacing,
B-roll, and transitions.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:56.979
So pacing is kind of
like how much do I edit.

00:30:56.979 --> 00:30:58.520
And this is kind of
the big question,

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.940
like, gee, what's the big thing?

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:02.100
What's the secret?

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.050
What's my pacing?

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:04.630
What should it be like?

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.770
And I don't think there
is an answer to this.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:11.060
When I was in film
school 20-plus years ago,

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.190
I was being taught by people
who were trained in the 1950s.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:16.960
And people who were
trained in the 1950s

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.150
would tell us, well, you
really can't edit faster

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.670
than four seconds per shot.

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.200
Because the human brain just
can't comprehend an image

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.310
that lasts shorter
than four seconds.

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:33.090
And I remember dutifully
editing my very first piece

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.790
and following that rule
and watching it and going,

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.210
this sucks.

00:31:37.210 --> 00:31:39.000
This is terrible.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.210
What's wrong with this?

00:31:40.210 --> 00:31:41.620
This is awful.

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:46.060
And it's because four
seconds is a really long time

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.660
in some cases, in a lot
of cases, in many cases,

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:49.970
in most cases.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.370
And that has increased--
has only increased.

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.184
My idea of a fast
edit may be completely

00:31:54.184 --> 00:31:56.600
different than your idea of a
fast edit because I'm older.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:58.780
I don't know.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.340
And there's also the
difference between genres.

00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:03.610
I think Elizabeth
mentioned this briefly,

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:06.720
television-- there's this sort
of like bombard everybody.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.970
If you want to show
an establishing shot

00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:11.280
of a house in a reality
TV show, you can't just

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.490
show one shot or two shots.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.004
You have to show eight shots.

00:32:14.004 --> 00:32:16.420
They're each 12 frames long,
like, boom, boom, boom, boom,

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.010
boom, with drums going.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:21.990
Just to make the reptile
brain go, oh, yeah,

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:23.470
this is important somehow.

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:24.494
I don't know.

00:32:24.494 --> 00:32:26.410
And it gets kind of
absurd at a certain point,

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:29.760
and it can be,
obviously, overediting.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.525
But the more typical
experience that people

00:32:32.525 --> 00:32:33.900
who are just
starting out have is

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:37.000
that they don't shoot enough,
not that they shoot too much.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.050
You think, oh, I've
got three shots,

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:41.690
and this is going to cover
like 30 seconds of my video.

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:44.730
But 30 seconds can
be an eternity.

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:49.730
And if your shots
aren't telling a story,

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.270
that could be pretty skimpy.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.770
Which brings us to
B-roll, I'm going

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.919
to talk about that in one
second with an example.

00:32:55.919 --> 00:32:58.210
The other thing, though, to
think about is transitions.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:00.460
How do I get from this to that?

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.920
Obviously, you can just cut.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:07.040
But is there an issue--
like I'm cutting

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:08.960
from a medium shot of
Chris talking, talking,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.950
talking, to a medium shot
of Elizabeth talking,

00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:12.070
talking, talking.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.040
That's not necessarily
super compelling.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.240
Do I need some other
way of transitioning?

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.210
Do I need a wide shot
of the classroom?

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.660
Do I need people listening?

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:23.460
What other shots do I
need to tell my story

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:26.448
and to transition
from scene to scene?

00:33:26.448 --> 00:33:30.550
The B-roll I just
wanted to mention.

00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.070
Have you guys talked about
what that even means at all?

00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:34.690
OK.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:38.700
I was going to show
this in the PowerPoint.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.100
But B-roll is a term that
goes back, way, way back,

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.530
like 80 years ago, when
people edited on film.

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:48.460
The B-roll was the
second roll of film

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.260
that they would then composite
over the first roll of film.

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.140
And it was all the stuff
that wasn't included

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.690
in the sort of main narrative.

00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:58.440
And I'll show you what
I mean in a minute.

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:00.690
This is just a little
snippet from a video

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:02.940
that we shot not too long
ago with Jeff Hoffman, who's

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.900
a professor here in
AeroAstro, a former astronaut.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.600
And we had done a storyboard
and kind of a script plan.

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.590
So we knew when he was going
to be on camera and when not.

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:13.500
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:17.280
-The design, construction, and
operation of aerospace vehicles

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.670
have allowed us to leave
the surface of the earth

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:24.400
and fly through our planet's
atmosphere and out into space.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.800
I'm Jeff Hoffman.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.675
I'm a professor in the
Department of Aero--

00:34:27.675 --> 00:34:27.800
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.250
GUEST SPEAKER: So
anyway, we knew

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.210
that he wasn't going to be
on camera in the first part.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:33.780
So we were able to
cut between takes.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.080
We didn't even
bother to really have

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:40.750
him be compelling on
camera at that point.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.429
But here we knew he
would be on camera,

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:43.739
so we filmed him that way.

00:34:43.739 --> 00:34:46.730
And the first string
out is just literally

00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:49.980
putting together your
script in a very linear way,

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:55.460
the way you wrote it, without
any kind of fancy stuff.

00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.750
And then I'll just show you
what it looked like after.

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:08.644
I'll just show the first 10
seconds, and then I'll be done.

00:35:08.644 --> 00:35:09.310
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:25.578 --> 00:35:26.572
Lift off.

00:35:26.572 --> 00:35:28.063
We have a lift off.

00:35:28.063 --> 00:35:33.540
32 minutes past the hour,
lift off on Apollo 11.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:36.462
-Have you ever wondered
how rockets work?

00:35:36.462 --> 00:35:38.670
Have you ever looked out of
the window of an airplane

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:42.682
and wondered how something so
big and heavy can actually fly?

00:35:42.682 --> 00:35:44.140
Have you ever
wondered what happens

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.440
to the human body
in space, or how

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.830
a spacesuit keeps
astronauts alive and able

00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:51.800
to work in the vacuum of space?

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.760
These topics are all part
of aerospace engineering.

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.580
Aerospace engineering is
giving humans the freedom

00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:00.960
to move in three dimensions.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.620
The design, construction, and
operation of aerospace vehicles

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.070
have allowed us to leave
the surface of the earth

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.262
and fly through our planet's
atmosphere and out into space.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:16.620
-Mission specialist
Jeff Hoffman.

00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:19.950
-Hello, Jeff?

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:21.260
-I'm Jeff Hoffman.

00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.670
I'm a professor in the
Department of Aeronautics

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:25.950
and Astronautics at MIT.

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:28.800
Before coming to MIT,
I spent 19 years at--

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.285
[END PLAYBACK]

00:36:30.285 --> 00:36:31.830
GUEST SPEAKER:
[AUDIO OUT] We were

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:35.130
able to shoot with him very,
very quickly, because we

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:36.560
knew what we needed on camera.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.060
And we knew that
we were going to be

00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:41.920
able to cover and fill
and sort of explain things

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.270
with other imagery.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.792
In this case, a lot of it's
obviously archival stuff,

00:36:45.792 --> 00:36:47.250
but it could be
stuff that we shot.

00:36:47.250 --> 00:36:49.640
And later in the video
there is stuff that we shot,

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:51.920
but it was all the same plan.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.320
Anyway, I know that's a
lot of stuff thrown at you,

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.830
but I'm also
cognizant of the time.

00:36:57.830 --> 00:37:01.700
So we can talk about this after
class, too, if you would like.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.340
Thanks.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:07.150
PROFESSOR: So just to give
another example of B-roll

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:10.330
maybe on a more likely
level for you guys,

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:13.170
because I assume you won't be
going out into outer space.

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:14.670
GUEST SPEAKER: Well,
neither did we.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:15.760
I called NASA.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.140
NASA is a great resource.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:23.952
PROFESSOR: For
Anastasia's video--

00:37:23.952 --> 00:37:24.618
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:37:24.618 --> 00:37:27.790
-What do these awesome
compounds have in common?

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.130
They all come from plants!

00:37:30.130 --> 00:37:33.497
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:37:37.247 --> 00:37:37.830
[END PLAYBACK]

00:37:37.830 --> 00:37:40.329
PROFESSOR: You notice that she's
not talking over any of it.

00:37:40.329 --> 00:37:41.930
We put the B-roll
in because we needed

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:44.140
to give the video a little
bit of space to breathe.

00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:47.010
Otherwise it would have been
just her talking constantly

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.090
and saying facts.

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:51.520
So we wanted to help with the
pacing of the video, which is

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.740
what Chris was talking about.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:53.948
So that's why we shot B-roll.

00:37:53.948 --> 00:37:58.549
So if you're--
especially you, Paul,

00:37:58.549 --> 00:38:01.090
because I imagine you're going
to shoot some stuff maybe with

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:04.370
a boat, sort of like you have
access to certain equipment.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.550
Whoever you're filming
with, you're not only

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.570
going to shoot, Paul,
but I would also

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:13.090
spend some time maybe just
doing a pan of your environment,

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:14.970
shooting some of the
equipment that's around.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.270
It may not be super
relevant to what you're

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:18.980
talking about exactly
in those moments,

00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:20.790
but you can always
have that footage

00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:23.306
to intersperse like we did
here, if that makes sense.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:30.250
And as Chris was saying,
you're not always

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:32.566
going to shoot B-roll yourself.

00:38:32.566 --> 00:38:36.380
NASA, I guess, is
what you guys used.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.800
And all of their
stuff is-- they're not

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.030
copyrighted or licensed.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:41.990
So you can use that footage.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:45.535
There's a lot of-- there a
lot of photos and pictures

00:38:45.535 --> 00:38:46.410
that you can look up.

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.040
I'm going to talk a little
bit more about music

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.860
that you can use, and I can
hit graphics as well next week

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.844
during the editing lecture.

00:38:54.844 --> 00:38:56.260
But there are
resources out there,

00:38:56.260 --> 00:39:00.790
if you want certain footage that
you just can't shoot yourself.
