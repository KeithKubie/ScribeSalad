00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:02.970
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're just
really excited to have Wajahat

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.940
here at Google.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.840
And I'm going to let him kind
of speak a little bit about

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.120
himself and his journey
as a writer.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.700
At the end, we'll open it up to
a discussion, so if anybody

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.320
has questions for him,
definitely stick around to

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.420
speak with him.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.150
And we also have lunch
with him after.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.280
If anybody hasn't eaten yet,
feel free to join us.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:25.558
So Wajahat?

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:26.554
WAJAHAT ALI: All right.

00:00:26.554 --> 00:00:27.550
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.800
WAJAHAT ALI: Thank
you, Suhair.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.060
Thank you, Suhair
for inviting me.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.380
Thank you Google for filling up
this vast auditorium with

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.360
my admiring fans.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.420
Being at Google marks the apex
of my professional career.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.650
I've traveled far and wide to
finally be here, across the

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.070
great white 237 from a
mysterious land known as

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.820
Fremont, known as Fremontistan
to all the Muslims,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.210
Pakistanis, and Afghans who live
there, home of the best

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.470
chutney kabab outside
of Kabul.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.510
Thank you for inviting me to
your home, Google, known to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.200
the world as the premier search
engine, known to your

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.520
enemies as the Death Star, and
known to all South Asian

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.920
parents as a fertile factory
for future spouses of their

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.820
unmarried children.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.970
In fact, today's
Google speech--

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.710
and I'm being totally
serious--

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.680
has solidified my worth as a
human being for my family

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.890
members, who in their typical
South Asian bluntness see my

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.990
professional career
as a writer as--

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.940
I quote them--

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.460
"useless."

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.240
Today they said, try to
get a job at Google.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.390
And I told them that--

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.040
I'm not making this up--

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.330
I said Google invited me
to speak for them.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.590
And they're like, ha, ha but
after the speech, get a job.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.080
Stop being useless.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.500
True story.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.575
Honored to be speaking here
today, but mostly--

00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:55.750
and I won't lie.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.650
This whole speech will
be very honest--

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:00.530
I'm mainly excited to be eating
at the famed Google

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.820
cafeteria, which
I-- thank you.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.760
People are nodding their head.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.240
They're like that is
why I work here.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.539
I came from Pakistan just
for the cafeteria.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.250
I hear it's a modern Shangri-la
of gluttonous

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.310
excess and unbridled
awesomeness.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.180
And also--

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.920
I won't lie.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.250
Just bear with me--

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.610
I have been told by every single
Pakistani working at

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.400
Google that I have to try the
infamous Google bathroom,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.200
where like a robot
cleans your butt.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.570
Right?

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.410
Or something?

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.920
Yeah, I heard it is a religious
experience, life

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.670
changing experience, and as
such I have loaded up

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.030
on fiber and water.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.910
But continuing, I'm now going
to begin my speech with a

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.550
pathetic attempt to kiss up
to Google shamelessly by

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.820
celebrating the recent
remarkable failures of your

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.170
competition.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.310
First, congratulation, Googlers
on the recent Apple

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.950
iPhone 5's dismal
map application.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.470
Congratulations.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.370
I used their map app to get to
Google today, and I ended up

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.000
at Yahoo instead.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.770
Let's take a moment to
simultaneously mock and pity

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.280
the people who bought Facebook
at $32 a share.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.280
I have just made that
my Facebook status.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.400
So Googlers, Like it.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.480
The irony will be priceless.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.770
Let it be known, when and if I'm
ever invited to speak at

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.880
Facebook or Apple, I shall
mock Google Plus.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:24.490
Sorry.

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.640
No offense to anyone.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.110
I'm equal opportunity.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.790
I also like to thank Security
who for some reason kept

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.920
calling me Rajeev.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.810
I didn't correct them.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.350
Thank you Rajeev, whoever you
are, for your parking spot.

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.180
Once I entered Google, I saw
so many South Asians, I

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.770
thought I was at Cisco.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.890
And a part of my heart swells
with pride, and I looked at

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.650
these random South Asians,
I did the Miyagi look.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.730
For those of you who have seen
Miyagi, I'm talking about Pat

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.520
Morita from the original
"Karate Kid," not

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.500
Will Smith's son.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.280
At the end of "Karate Kid," Pat
Morita, Miyagi, looks at

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.650
Daniel-san with a
sense of pride.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.060
He looks at him like this.

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.580
And I looked at these random
South Asians with pride in my

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.910
face, and they just kept
staring back at me, not

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.190
eliciting the response
I wanted.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.660
And I think a few of them are
like who's this weird tech

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.570
support from India?

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.980
I do not hail from India.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.110
The family hails from the
motherland known as Pakistan,

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:21.860
which is the most popular
country on Earth right now.

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.340
When people think of Pakistan,
they think of rainbows and

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.150
cupcakes and ponies
and babies.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.480
Pakistan is the most toxic brand
name in the universe.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.300
This is a true story.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.140
A few of my friends
have heard this.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.240
A Palestinian man came
up to me last year

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.490
and said the following.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.950
Bro-- bro--

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.890
things are really bad in
Pakistan right now bro.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:50.675
When a Palestinian takes pity
on you, you're effed.

00:04:50.675 --> 00:04:51.100
All right?

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.220
You're effed.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.810
And to make matters worse,
I have the hat trick of

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.810
kryptonite toxic brand names.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.140
I'm an American Muslim of
Pakistani descent or a

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.630
Muslim-American Pakistani.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.810
Awesome.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.940
Being Pakistani-American is so
bad right now that I'm forced

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.112
to tell people I'm pre-partition
Indian.

00:05:12.112 --> 00:05:13.490
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.380
WAJAHAT ALI: This
is a good crowd.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.810
This is a good crowd.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.430
Yeah, Muslim-Pakistani American
as a brand name is

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.860
about as popular as death,
taxes, and herpes.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.230
No offense to herpes.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.780
But speaking about stories, in
all honesty, the title of

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.946
today's story is, I think,
From Chaiwallah to--

00:05:32.946 --> 00:05:33.620
FEMALE SPEAKER: Playwright.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.290
WAJAHAT ALI: To Playwright.

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.270
The Rise of a Pakistani-American
writer.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.990
True story.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.640
I was in Nepal, Suhair was
after me for a title.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:40.370
I was exhausted.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.750
I wrote the title, thinking it
was a joke, that no one would

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.220
ever seriously consider
that as a title.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.120
Suhair, two days later, sends
me the official Google

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.880
letterhead that says "From
Chaiwallah to Playwright."

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.500
FEMALE SPEAKER: I liked it.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.770
WAJAHAT ALI: The Rise of--

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.120
I was hoping-- a Pre-partition
Indian Writer.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.880
But no, I am indeed a
Pakistani-American writer.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.690
And speaking about stories, I'll
tell you a quick story

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.090
about how I got to
Google today.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.180
But before I talk about stories,
there's this great

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.340
quotation by a poet Muriel
Rukeyser, which says the

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.620
following: the universe is made
up of stories, not atoms.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.640
The universe is made of
stories, not atoms.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.370
Here's another great quote.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.150
Human beings are natural
storytellers.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.480
They can't help telling
stories.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.040
They turn things that aren't
really into stories, into

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.680
stories because they like
narratives so much.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.400
Everything, faith, science, love
needs a story for people

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.960
to find it plausible.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.740
No story, no sale.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.040
That's writer Adam Gopnik in
"The New Yorker" talking about

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.890
Jonathan Gottschall's book "The
Storytelling Animal,"

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.170
which posits that the human
being is the unique

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.070
storytelling animal in
all of existence.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.940
That's how we operate.

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:55.750
That's how we communicate.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.130
That's how we learn.

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:00.200
Even in ancient seventh-century
Arabia, the

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.780
storyteller was valued more
than the swordsman.

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:03.680
I know you guys won't
believe me.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.890
It's a true story.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:09.450
Now this was a culture where
tribes needed the most skilled

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:13.310
swordsman because raids were
part of daily activity.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.665
And they needed protection.

00:07:14.665 --> 00:07:18.970
Yet in those days, when a famed
talented poet came to

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.010
their land, they insisted
he would stay and

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.730
perform for the community.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.930
And again, this makes sense
considering that the human

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.480
being is a unique storytelling
animal.

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.350
Stories give humans identity
and purpose.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:33.680
Think about religion.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.540
Regardless if you like religion
or not, it's a

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.100
powerful force.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:37.650
Christians--

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.740
how do they learn about
how to behave?

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.170
Their morals, their etiquette?

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.030
The stories of Jesus.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.510
In fact, Jesus taught through
parables which are stories.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.455
For Muslims, very popular right
now, for those of you

00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:52.460
who don't know, they follow
the Hadith, which is a

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:55.850
collection of stories that talk
about the etiquette of

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.310
the prophet Muhammad.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.320
Stories give humans identity
and purpose.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:04.030
They also help us pass down our
values, ideals, beliefs,

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:04.970
and cultures.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.000
For example, wherever I've
gone in the world, every

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.010
single culture knows the story
of the boy who cried wolf.

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.950
Every culture, every language.

00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.000
Every culture knows that that's
a story you tell your

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
children to teach
them not to lie.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.150
Now we could sit there and be
didactic and say hey, don't

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:23.640
lie or I'll hurt you.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.790
But instead we couch that moral
in a narrative, in a

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.560
story, in a story featuring a
whining annoying boy and a

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.039
hungry murderous wolf,
which is slightly

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.309
disturbing, but it works.

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:37.460
Stories are also how we
brand and present

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.860
ourselves to the world.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.130
Every major company has an About
Us section, which talks

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.770
about their origin.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.250
Stories are how we
meet people.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.840
Stories help us communicate.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.250
Stories are how we learn
about one another.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:51.640
In America, in fact, when you
meet someone for the first

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.120
time, you often ask them hey
man, what's your story?

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.950
Followed by you're paying
for the bill.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.810
Successful stories, the ones
that stick and resonate, need

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.740
people's emotional investment.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.120
So let me tell you of a quick
story today in a half hour

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:09.250
about a dude named
Wajahat Ali--

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.410
that's me--

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:13.780
born in El Camino hospital,
raised in Fremontistan,

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.000
California, graduate of
Bellarmine an all-boys Jesuit

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.020
Catholic high school, who got
an English degree from UC

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.680
Berkeley, despite not knowing
any English when he was born,

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.160
for the first four years of his
life, ended up writing a

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.690
play in college for a English
class assignment, who then

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.620
went to law school at UC Davis,
got licensed as an

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:37.950
attorney, couldn't find work,
applied to Google,

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:39.370
didn't get the job.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:41.880
Somehow I ended up
with an unlikely

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.680
irreverent odd career--

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.650
or hobby, according to my
South Asian family--

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:50.290
as a professional paid writer
or professional lafunga,

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.500
according to my family.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:55.400
Lafunga for those of you who
speak Urdu means loafer.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.430
And now he is at Google
speaking.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.560
So are you guys still with me?

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.110
That was awesome, enthusiastic,
wonderful.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:06.180
You just really, just inspired
me to continue.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:06.490
All right.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.070
Here we go.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:13.020
Once upon a time, there was a
shy, awkward, constantly sick,

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.525
only child of Pakistan immigrant
parents, born in Bay

00:10:16.525 --> 00:10:19.670
Area, California, who was the
only left-handed member of his

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:22.480
entire family, which made every
single family member in

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.360
Karachi, Pakistan think
he was a djinn--

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.350
true story--

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.640
who walked around in a white
shirt smeared with lentil

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.460
stains and sweat patches, who
was addicted to chai, because

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.630
his grandfather used to feed
him his chai with teaspoons

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.570
when he was a kid.

00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:40.050
And when the kid, who grew up,
he had his own little small

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:41.920
chai cup with his own chai.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.520
And every day, this
kid was healthy.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:49.410
And healthy is a Pakistani
term for big boned.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:52.170
And healthy and big boned are
always accompanied by this

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:56.170
motion, which is very,
very subtle.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.350
He was so healthy that his
grandmother and mother used to

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.710
be able to find pants for him
only in the young adult

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.700
section of Mervyn's when the
kid was six years old.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.820
And-- true story-- they bought
these pants, and because the

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.770
kid was so healthy, they had to
roll up the pants sleeves.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:16.960
And when the kid asked how come
his pants were different

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.030
from everyone else, the mom
said it's fashion sense.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:22.680
It's a good fashion sense.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.070
He was so healthy that he went
to Harker School in Saratoga

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:26.990
where there were uniforms--

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:28.270
humiliating.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.430
He was forced to wear
Husky pants.

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.040
And these Husky pants--

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.160
true story--

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:37.730
have a big patch on the right
side of your butt with big

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.850
bold letters saying Husky.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.640
Very subtle.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.300
When entering preschool, the
appropriately titled Child's

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.720
Hideaway, the kid only spoke
three words of English.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.490
The three words were
the following.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.520
"Shut up" because his mother
used to tell him shut up,

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.000
"idiot" because his
mother used to say

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.570
often shut up, idiot.

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:59.210
And for those of you who were a
child of the '80s, you guys

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.420
remember that commercial
uh oh spaghetti-o?

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.590
Anyone?

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.110
One or two people,
three people.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.190
I'm old and decrepit.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.580
Awesome.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.030
Uh oh spaghetti-o.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.910
And the kid couldn't speak
English, so he said uh oh

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.680
pas-getti-o.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.640
Three words of English.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.510
A year later while attending
James Leach Elementary School,

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.780
the teachers didn't know what
to do with this kid or any

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.850
other minority, as
a matter of fact.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:22.120
So they put him and the four
other minorities in ESL, which

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.830
is English as Second Language.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.170
It was him, two Asian-American
girls, the black kid who was

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.460
there because he was the only
black kid in school, spoke

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.220
perfect English, and this kid.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.270
True story.

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.220
And for several months, a
teacher used to stand in front

00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.760
of this kid and used
to say whatever.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.780
And the Pakistani kid looked
back and said "whatewer".

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.670
And the teacher said
no, no, whatever.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.460
And the kid looked back
and said whatewer.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.040
This happened for months.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.280
And until finally the kid
figured out that Vs and Ws are

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.460
not the same.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:58.030
The kid also made many, many
fateful trips to the

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:01.710
motherland, Karachi, Pakistan,
which left many deep

00:13:01.710 --> 00:13:04.060
impressions literally.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.650
For example, the first time
he went, he got hit by a

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:07.880
motorcycle.

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:08.580
Awesome.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:10.360
Four years old.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.590
Kid goes straight
up in the air,

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.260
lands flat on his forehead.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.760
Forehead explodes.

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.220
Doctors say if he would have
landed one inch to the left or

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.170
one inch to the right, he
would have been pffbt--

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.380
flatlined.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.880
The local doctors apparently
didn't have sophisticated

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.300
equipment, and they operated on
him with a dull knife and

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.520
spoon, which gave him a scar to
this day that makes it look

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.170
like a Klingon baby.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.190
In the '90s, he proudly showed
off what he called the Klingon

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:41.300
scar to women thinking it would
work in getting dates.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.450
It didn't.

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.180
In the 21st century, he evolved
his pop culture nuance

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.040
and said this is the Harry
Potter scar, thinking it would

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.820
get him women.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.680
It didn't.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.970
Apparently at age nine, because
he didn't have enough

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:58.650
of Pakistan, he went back,
where he got pneumonia--

00:13:58.650 --> 00:13:59.430
awesome--

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.430
which went undiagnosed
for 2 1/2 weeks.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.530
And so he lost 40 pounds and lay
dying essentially on the

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:08.340
straw mat on the second floor
of his grandmother's

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.720
building-- true story.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.690
And the grandmother's tenant,
a Pakistani whiskey-drinking

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.200
American-educated doctor, who
talked like this in an

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.810
interesting accent--

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:18.980
that's how he talked--

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.470
came upstairs to do a routine
check-up and said (PAKISTANI

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:23.800
ACCENT) oh my god, this
boy has pneumonia.

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.470
Take him to the hospital.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:26.560
Which they did.

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.140
And they said (PAKISTANI ACCENT)
Oh, he has pneumonia.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.030
Oh, good you brought him.

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.800
That's good.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.750
And, true story, it
was very casual.

00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.230
And they're like (PAKISTANI
ACCENT) yeah, if it wasn't one

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:36.790
more week, he would have
not-- bicharo would

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.360
have not made it.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.060
And so I survived.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.770
And again in high school, the
kid said you know what?

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.000
Let's go back to the motherland,
where in high

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.970
school, he went back and
contracted malaria and a 104

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.830
high temperature
for three days.

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:54.070
Whatever doesn't kill you gives
you mosquito larva in

00:14:54.070 --> 00:14:55.460
your bloodstream.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.590
Rewind, fifth grade, again at
Harker School in Saratoga, the

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.170
overweight, sweaty, socially
awkward, Pakistani,

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:07.370
left-handed, healthy boy with
lentil stains on his shirt

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:09.620
also suffered from
severe allergies.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:13.470
He was so sick that he had
missed 37 days of school.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.050
They were about to
kick him out.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.740
He had to make a plea to the
principal to let him stay.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.870
OK, the school was just about to
kick him out and finally a

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.230
competent doctor named
Dr. Biederman--

00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:26.540
who did not work at Kaiser.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:28.100
No offense to Kaiser--

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.240
give him medication that
actually worked.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.450
And so this kid recovered, but
had to work harder in fifth

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:35.450
grade than he did in all
of high school to

00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:36.980
make an epic comeback.

00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:41.060
Tutors, after schools learning,
catching up a

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.830
month's worth of work.

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:47.570
Things were looking bleak, until
one day, his fifth grade

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.290
teacher, Ms. Peterson, hailing
from Kentucky, asked the class

00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.530
to write a one page fictional
short story.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.260
Now this was 1991, a strange
time in America, where Madonna

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:03.580
had conical breasts, Z.
Cavariccis were all the rage.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.160
Anyone know Z. Cavariccis?

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:05.730
You had them?

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.870
Thank you for being bold
enough to admit it.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.460
We all owned a pair.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.130
Will Smith was known as
the Fresh Prince.

00:16:12.130 --> 00:16:15.335
And Kevin Costner was chosen
to play Robin Hood.

00:16:15.335 --> 00:16:17.090
You guys remember this?

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:21.500
So because of this, the kid
decided to write a parody and

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.980
satire of Robin Hood.

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.240
And the kid's story went
from one page to

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.370
five pages to 10 pages.

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.710
The teacher loved the kid's
story and made him perform it

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:33.720
in front of the fifth grade.

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.940
For the first time ever, this
sweaty, healthy, [URDU]

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.510
healthy kid, awkward, shy,
performed the story.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:42.000
The classroom loved it.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.430
Then they said perform
it in front of the

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.030
fifth and sixth grade.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:46.600
They loved it.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:51.090
The kid brought home the
story to his father.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.500
The father reads the story and
says (PAKISTANI ACCENT) Beta--

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.800
which means son--

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.220
you might have a talent.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.010
You should consider
becoming a writer.

00:16:59.010 --> 00:17:01.800
The mother, who was in the
kitchen, overheard this, with

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.829
fear in her eyes, ran out and
said (PAKISTANI ACCENT) yes,

00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:07.569
but first become a doctor.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:08.700
This was 1991.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.010
The age was 10.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.569
Let's do a group exercise.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.839
In South Asian families, there's
a holy trinity of

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:14.940
professions.

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:15.910
Let's go with number one.

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:16.619
What's number one?

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:17.250
AUDIENCE: Doctor.

00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:18.210
WAJAHAT ALI: Doctor.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:18.850
Number two?

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:19.160
AUDIENCE: Engineer.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.319
WAJAHAT ALI: Engineer.

00:17:20.319 --> 00:17:21.050
Number three?

00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:21.680
AUDIENCE: Lawyer.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.310
WAJAHAT ALI: Not lawyer.

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:23.750
No one cares about
lawyers, yet.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.270
Number three is a dubious
businessman who somehow makes

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.050
a lot of money and buys a
suburban home, marries a wife

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.250
who's around seven
on the hotness

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:32.080
scale, and has a Lexus.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.010
Number four?

00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:34.030
Failure.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.560
All right?

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:37.400
Those are your four options
as occupations.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.930
But because of this momentous
occasion where this kid told

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.190
this story, for the first time
in his life, this overweight,

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:47.460
shy, awkward, healthy, lentil
stained boy, who was healthy,

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.850
gained confidence and a sense
of empowerment, and for the

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:54.250
briefest of moments, for about
two hours after the story,

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:56.130
even some popularity.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.560
And ever since that day, the
awkward boy ended up spending

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.710
all of his free time investing
in the passion of

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:04.970
storytelling, performance,
movies, and reading.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:07.310
During the summer, him and his
best friend [? Kashif ?]

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:09.820
made their own home movies,
because no one invited them to

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.560
parties because they
were dorks.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.090
And they wrote, directed, acted,
and edited in their own

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.090
homemade movies, such as the
ambitious and epic "Formula"

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.010
trilogy, featuring a diabolical
scientist who

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.120
creates a formula that
could destroy Earth.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.010
But each time his nefarious plot
is thwarted by the gruff,

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:26.130
surly detective--

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:27.230
played by me--

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.950
who breaks protocol and a few
necks but saves the day.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.930
They also do their own takes
on popular movies.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.800
If you guys remember, in the
1991, there was a celluloid

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.570
classic by the name of "Tango
and Cash," starring Kurt

00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:40.190
Russell and Sly Stallone.

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.500
We did our own called "Lambada
and Doe." Think about it.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.600
The boy grew up, stayed healthy
and end up going to an

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.910
all-boys Jesuit-taught high
school, Bellarmine, where he

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.240
emerged as the token
representative of all things

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.910
Pakistan, South Asia,
Muslim, and Islam.

00:18:55.910 --> 00:18:57.720
He must have given eight
talks on Islam

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.350
throughout his entire career.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.780
He had a choice--

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.000
to stay isolated in the corner
as the token, not sharing his

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.490
religious or cultural identity,
or be authentic, be

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.300
himself, be open, and
communicate his

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:15.240
multi-hyphenate identity to his
Catholic diverse peers.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.780
So he embraced his role as the
cultural ambassador of his

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.860
peoples and enjoyed
relating tales and

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:23.600
communicating stories.

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.030
In his senior year, he decides
he's going to try his hand at

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:27.150
improv comedy.

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:30.640
And he successfully joined the
school comedy troupe entitled

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.850
The Sanguine Humours, where he
created the endearing popular

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:38.500
comedy icon known as Captain
Brown Man, an ornery, one-eyed

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.200
pirate captain with a hook for a
hand, who always entered the

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:46.620
stage saying daar, the name
is Captain Brown Man.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.600
It worked.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.650
At that time, it
was a huge hit.

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.160
We weren't that politically
correct in those days.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.070
Once upon a time, continuing,
there was a young healthy,

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.160
overweight boy who grew up,
entered UC Berkeley and

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.690
decided to go to the gym for
the first time in his life.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.190
And he slimmed down.

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.370
And he decided that lentil
stains would always be on his

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:05.970
white shirts.

00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:08.330
So he started wearing
black and gray.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:12.230
And then he dressed a bit
better, was socially active,

00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:14.170
joined a lot of student groups
such as the Muslim Student

00:20:14.170 --> 00:20:16.770
Association, which apparently
makes him a member of Ikhwan

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.030
and Hamas and Hezbollah for
the rest of his life.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.110
I'm just kidding.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.220
This is taped, right?

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.320
I'm just kidding.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.960
Barack Obama is not a
Muslim president.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.100
If he is Muslim, he is the
worst Muslim of all time.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.240
The dude eats pork openly.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:35.300
All right? (PAKISTANI ACCENT)
I love America.

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:38.030
So I was a member of the Muslim
Student Association,

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.570
joined the Student Advocate
Office, and ended up taking

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.460
way too many academic units
because I had no idea what I

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.120
wanted to be when I grew up.

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.260
And every day, this kid--

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:47.920
me--

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:51.090
ended up running around like a
crazy, headless chicken, not

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:53.450
sleeping too much, and having
crazy fun times.

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:57.020
Along with a few friends at UC
Berkeley, we created the first

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:59.180
sketch comedy troupe entitled
The [? Gawad ?]

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.370
Squad, where they wrote,
directed, and

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.200
edited their own sketches.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:06.600
Over the next three years,
I ended up playing a gay

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.640
vampire, a Scottish
immigrant-owner of an Olive

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:12.470
Garden, a Pakistani student
living with belligerent

00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:18.390
Italian immigrants, a
well-endowed Italian-American

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:20.110
liquor store owner--
don't ask--

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:22.210
and a Ukrainian weight
lifter, among many

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.820
other enduring titles.

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:27.450
This boy spent his nights,
tee-totaling, a Muslim dork

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.620
who didn't drink, who never
partied, spending an

00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:33.930
inordinate amount of time in is
awesome apartment playing

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:39.260
host and playing video games,
such as NBA 2K and NFL 2K,

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:43.220
entertaining similarly dorky,
horny, virginal,

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:47.100
Muslim-American bachelors,
engaging in practical jokes,

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:51.020
sophomoric humor, and pretty
much being dorks, 24/7.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:54.550
And as the perpetual host of
these dorks, he ended up

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:58.640
making vats of chai every
day for four years.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.620
By the end of his junior year,
his chai had become infamous

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.950
across the nation, legendary
because it nourished the

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:08.160
bellies of horny, single,
dorky, Muslim men.

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.980
And even when I was lucky,
a few women came into the

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.320
apartment, only for
five minutes.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.660
His senior year of college, he
was chosen to be a board

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:18.370
member of the student group,
Muslim Student Association,

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.930
which of course brands him a
lifetime member of Hezbollah,

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.020
Hamas, Ikhwan, and
everything else.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.820
I'm just kidding.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.350
Because this is on YouTube.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:29.070
He reluctantly accepted.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:32.290
The year was 2001.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:36.160
Also on a whim, that same year,
he decided to apply to a

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.190
short story writing class.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.810
He had three choices.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.560
Each class was taught by
a different professor.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:45.960
One class was taught by this
guy named Ishmael Reed.

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.070
The guy--

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.830
this is me now--

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.390
I had no idea who Ishmael
Reed was.

00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:52.420
I simply liked the
name Ishmael.

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.270
It was very biblical.

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.840
And I'm like you know what, I'm
leaning towards applying

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.320
to Ishmael's class.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.420
I asked a faculty advisor out of
all these three, who should

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.320
I apply to, because I can
only apply to one?

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.130
He said well, this guy, Ishmael,
he kind of lets you

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.350
do your own thing.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.720
He gives you freedom.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:08.170
Done.

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:08.730
Sold.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.490
The dude's name was Ishmael.

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:10.430
He gives you freedom.

00:23:10.430 --> 00:23:13.450
I applied to Ishmael Reed's
class on a whim.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:14.760
3:58 PM.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:16.550
Wheeler Hall, third floor.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.260
Deadline was 4:00 PM.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.960
I wrote it in pen.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:23.820
I didn't have lines, so the
paper went like this.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:26.160
It was curving this
way with my ink.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.180
It looked like a Lahori
publication of a book.

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.730
For those of you who know about
Lahori publication, you

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:34.000
know they don't print their
stuff in a straight line.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.610
And all I had was a 12-page play
script, because you had

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.550
to submit a 15-page
short story.

00:23:40.550 --> 00:23:41.920
I didn't have a short story.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.560
So I submitted one
of my [? Gawad ?]

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.890
Squad scripts about two horny,
thieving English noblemen and

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:50.810
a magical donkey that
wore a monocle.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:51.960
Yeah, I know.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.230
It was genius.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:56.740
The play was entitled
"All This for an

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:57.750
Ass." It's all I had.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.030
I submitted it.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:01.620
All was well, because I
got into the class.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:02.780
It's 2001.

00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:07.620
Senior year I was 20, about to
turn 21, until one day, the

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.970
two towers fell.

00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:11.720
And there was madness.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.290
And all of us 20-year-olds,
who were just kids, just

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.360
students, part of the Muslim
Student Association, all of a

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.440
sudden became the accidental
activists, the cultural

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.125
ambassadors of 1,400 years of
Islamic civilization, where we

00:24:24.125 --> 00:24:26.730
were forced to know everything
about Iraq and Afghanistan and

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.640
the Koran and Prophet Muhammad
and Muslims and South Asians,

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.120
and hell, even Sikhs,
and everything.

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:36.020
And we were just students,
but we got hate

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:37.380
mail coming from people.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.370
We had to represent a community
that was terrified

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.270
and afraid.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:42.220
Muslim women who wore the
hijab, which is the head

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:45.730
covering, at UC Berkeley were
afraid of going out to school.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.910
It was a crazy time,
crazy climate for

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:49.100
those of you who remember.

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.400
And for whatever reason,
someone, my roommate who made

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.970
the website, for the MSA,
decided it would be fun to

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:58.560
name me the social coordinator
and public relations liaison.

00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:02.350
So guess who was getting all the
press contacts and all the

00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.570
interviews?

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:04.740
Me.

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:07.540
I ended up becoming what I call
the accidental activist

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.120
for about 75% of
my senior year.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.990
For three weeks after 9/11, I
couldn't even go to school.

00:25:13.990 --> 00:25:18.230
Now, fast forward three weeks,
I'm in Ishmael Reid's class.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:21.710
I'm up to perform
a short story.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:22.550
Crap.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:24.350
I got to write a short
story, take it to

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:25.390
class, and perform it.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:30.530
At 4:00 AM, I came up with a
story about two ogres who were

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.510
married for 50 years celebrating
their 50th wedding

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:36.780
anniversary who secretly hated
one another, poisoned each

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.020
other's goblets and are waiting
the entire time to

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.380
kill one another.

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:41.970
I know, genius.

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:45.450
This was before "Shrek,"
so I was a genius.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.510
I was just late on
that ogre cake.

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.890
Six hours later, 10:00 AM, go
to class, read the story,

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:54.340
which was entitled "Bulbous
and Rotunda's 50th Wedding

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.990
Anniversary." Class loves it.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:59.240
I'm terrified, because I think
Ishmael Reed's going to chew

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.450
me out for missing class
for three weeks.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.880
Ishmael says see
me after class.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.300
I'm scared out of my mind.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.450
Ishmael says you're a
natural playwright.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.200
You don't know it.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.790
Don't waste your time in my
short story writing class.

00:26:12.790 --> 00:26:14.810
I'm going to take you outside
of my short story writing

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:17.030
class, and you're going to
have to write me a play.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:17.860
Write me a play.

00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:18.770
Write me 20 pages.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:20.150
You pass the class.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.060
I'm like dude, you're crazy.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:23.280
I don't know how to
write a play.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.320
Just let me write
short stories.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.240
He goes nope.

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.130
Write me a play.

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.190
You know what?

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:30.980
As an African-American, we have
been through this before.

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.720
I can see 10 years down the
line, it's going to be a tough

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:36.290
time for Muslims
and Pakistanis.

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.230
Your stories aren't
being told.

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:41.250
What people do see is an
extremist narrative.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:44.350
Sometimes, not only the way to
fight back, but the way to

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.500
push forward is through
arts and culture.

00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.550
You should write me a story
about a family.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:49.530
You know what?

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:50.690
Make it a Pakistani family.

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:51.400
You know what?

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:52.320
Aren't you a Muslim?

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.060
Make it a Muslim-American
Pakistani family.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.045
You ever read "Death of a
Salesman?" I'm like yes.

00:26:56.045 --> 00:26:58.070
You ever read "Long
Day's Journey into

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.940
Night?" I said yes.

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.110
Something like that.

00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:01.910
All right, bye.

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.430
So I'm like crap.

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:05.570
I get to write 20
pages of a play.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:06.740
I've never written a
play in my life.

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:08.580
What am I going to do?

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:11.320
Now, for those of you who don't
know, Moslems celebrate

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.770
something called Ramadan.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:15.490
And up to a certain age, when
you're young, at the end of

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:17.270
Ramadan, you get something
called eidi,

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:17.990
which is like money.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.820
So I was like 20, and that was
the last year I got eidi.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.100
I got like $20.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.610
I was broke, and I was poor.

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.540
I took the $20 to this cultural
relic of the 20th

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.100
century known as Borders.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:29.560
You guys might remember it.

00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.110
I went to the Drama section.

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:32.845
I said Plays, picked
up two plays.

00:27:32.845 --> 00:27:34.990
They came within $20.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:38.110
Being the son of Pakistan
immigrants, thank you, I

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.370
looked at the refund policy.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:43.940
And they said within 15 days,
if you return the plays in

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:46.510
good condition, you get
your money back.

00:27:46.510 --> 00:27:47.440
I'm like done.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.430
Read the plays within 15 days,
went back every 15 days, got

00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:51.270
two more plays.

00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:54.310
Did this for two months, tried
to figure how to--

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:55.910
true story.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:27:57.080
Hey, it was their policy.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:59.280
I just exploited it.

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.570
Son of Pakistani immigrants.

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.140
We stretch $1 to make it $20.

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:03.700
I'm proud.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:04.890
I don't care.

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:09.540
Figure out how to write a play,
started the play for my

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:13.570
21st birthday in
November 2001.

00:28:13.570 --> 00:28:17.800
And finished it for my
23rd birthday, 2003.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.330
The way that happened is
submitted 20 pages and Ishmael

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.950
liked it so much, every couple
months he said give me five

00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.840
more pages, give me
five more pages.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.430
Finished it as a birthday
present to myself

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:27.760
at the age of 23.

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.610
And because of that, Ishmael
Reed in 2003 invited me to

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:34.610
Spencer's Grotto in Berkeley and
said the script is great.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.400
And now we do a staged
reading.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.150
I, of course, asked what's
a staged reading?

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:42.870
He said my wife here, Carla
Blank, she's a theater scholar

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:43.770
and dramaturge.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.290
She'll direct the
staged reading.

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:47.350
Carla looked over at him
and said really?

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.765
I will?

00:28:47.765 --> 00:28:49.200
He goes yeah, yeah, yeah,
you'll do it.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:50.120
True story.

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.980
So I went to Sheik Google--

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.460
true story-- and typed in staged
reading to figure out

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:56.450
what it was.

00:28:56.450 --> 00:29:00.280
Staged reading is essentially
when you get a couple actors,

00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:02.500
you put them on a couple of
chairs, and they act out the

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.080
play while reading the script.

00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.070
That's a staged reading.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.260
If you're successful,
you get 50 people.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.110
Now mind you, at this time, I
was 23 years old, jobless, had

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:14.320
to move back home, where I was
in my high school bedroom, and

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.520
I woke up every day to
find $5 in my wallet.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.450
And when I asked who put the
$5 in my wallet, my father

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:23.460
said to me he used to sneak
the $5 in my wallet every

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:25.230
night, because he said
(PAKISTANI ACCENT) no man

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:27.380
should be without $5.

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.390
And so out of both pity and
kindness, I moved back to my

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:32.420
family home, with nothing
much going on for

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.220
me except this play.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.000
Now what happened was I believed
in the power of

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.420
storytelling.

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.070
This is now 2003.

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:40.200
Interesting time.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.060
And I wanted to inspire and
empower my South Asian and

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.520
Muslim communities and make
them believe that there's

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:48.330
power in their stories.

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:49.720
And I wanted to make
them realize that

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.230
their stories had value.

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.480
So what we did is I said I'm
going to reach out to my

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.310
community first and foremost.

00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:59.830
So what we did was, we used the
internets to make a call

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:04.120
to anyone who was remotely brown
with a pulse who wanted

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:06.580
to audition for this play that
I'd written called "The

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.700
Domestic Crusaders" about a
family of Muslim-Pakistani

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.650
Americans, six characters, a
grandfather, the Pakistani

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.870
immigrants, and their three
American-born children, who

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:18.360
all convene on the family
house for one day.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.530
Six roles.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:23.890
I said anyone remotely with a
tan, with a pulse, interested

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:25.210
in performing.

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:26.750
That's the only prerequisite.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.880
Come try out for this play.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.350
Now we did auditions
at Chandni.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.930
Every community has a Chandni.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.790
Chandni Restaurant slash
community hall is where people

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:40.230
go to get married, get divorced,
have buffets, have

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:43.150
religious experiences, convert
to Islam, convert out of

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.250
Islam, do ameens, do bismillahs,
do the Hanukkahs,

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:47.260
do Sikh weddings.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.340
Every community has a Chandni.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.100
I told the Chandni owner
I'm going to do

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.140
additions at your place.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:53.900
It's a local place.

00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:55.910
Can you just give me a space?

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.940
He said I'll let you come
on the weekends.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.980
You have to buy at least
seven buffets.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:02.280
I'm like done.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:04.650
I'll promise that the people
who come audition, I'll

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.160
convince them to buy buffets,
which happened.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.830
The first week, the first time
we did it, eight people, 8 to

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:12.330
13 people did it.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.010
They came in, did the
staged reading.

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.710
They were very hesitant,
skeptical.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.650
But they read the script and
within an hour I could tell

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:19.810
they were jazzed.

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.540
The second week, word of mouth
spread, 20 people.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:23.810
did the audition.

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:27.250
At the end of a month and a
half, 135 people auditioned

00:31:27.250 --> 00:31:28.610
for the play.

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.760
Now we need a place
to stage the play.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:34.030
So we went to Chandni's
competition, Mehran

00:31:34.030 --> 00:31:37.240
Restaurant, which is right
next door to Chandni, not

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.270
making this up, in Newark,
California.

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:44.330
And I said to Fayaz, the owner,
I said what will it

00:31:44.330 --> 00:31:49.280
cost for me to use your hall,
transform it into a dinner

00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.020
theater experience, and
you could give me

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.530
a South Asian buffet?

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.990
He said $15 cost.

00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:57.520
I realized I couldn't
handle it.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.140
So I brought in a heavy hitter,
my father, as my

00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.350
messenger, who came in, rolled
up his sleeves, had a sit-down

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:06.540
with Fayaz, and said
the following.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:08.322
(PAKISTANI ACCENT) Fayaz.

00:32:08.322 --> 00:32:11.450
Why do you disrespect
me this way?

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.070
True story.

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.290
We've known each other
for a long time.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:17.020
I've given you good business.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.580
$15?

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.880
$15?

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.720
I will make you good business.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.130
And we will transform Mehran
into not just a community

00:32:26.130 --> 00:32:29.000
hall, but into a dinner
theatre experience.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.680
And Fayaz thought about it, and
he brought the cost down

00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:39.240
to $6 for a five course buffet
meal, endless supply of chai,

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.530
and kir dessert with the hall.

00:32:41.530 --> 00:32:42.240
OK.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:46.160
I went to another relative, an
uncle, and said if I gave you

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:49.400
a dinner theatre experience,
stage reading, and

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.840
a buffet for $15.

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.170
Would you come?

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:53.120
True story.

00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.550
Uncle looks at me and says
(PAKISTANI ACCENT) if you make

00:32:55.550 --> 00:32:57.970
it $10, I'll think about it.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.200
So we made it $10.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.940
We made it $10.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:05.520
And they said if 50 people
showed up, it'd be a success.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:08.900
We publicized using this
antiquated technology from the

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.345
20th century called Evite--

00:33:10.345 --> 00:33:11.340
you might remember it.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:12.890
It still exists--

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:16.670
used listservs, reached out to
local South Asian communities,

00:33:16.670 --> 00:33:19.350
organizations, members,
word of mouth spread.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:22.700
Guess how many people
showed up?

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:23.790
Interactive crowd.

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:25.230
Love it.

00:33:25.230 --> 00:33:26.775
450.

00:33:26.775 --> 00:33:28.710
450 people showed up.

00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:30.940
The capacity was 220.

00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.050
We fit 350.

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:33.870
Don't ask me how.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:37.560
And most people who showed up,
to be honest, they showed up

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.180
out of curiosity.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:39.750
And they said--

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.026
I want to speak Urdu,
but I know this is

00:33:41.026 --> 00:33:41.550
going to be on YouTube.

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.770
But a lot of Pakistani uncles
were like (PAKISTANI ACCENT)

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:45.030
this is-- what is
this, this play?

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:46.660
We'll come out and see it.

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:47.650
Let's see it.

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:49.910
And one Pakistani uncle came
up to me and said--

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:50.760
true story--

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.530
he said beta-- son--

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:54.010
why don't you do something
useful with

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:56.580
your life, like protest.

00:33:56.580 --> 00:34:00.560
Look what's happening in 2003,
all that's happening.

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.240
Go protest.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:03.710
What is this playwriting,
shaywriting?

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:04.090
True story--

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:06.020
I'll get back to that
uncle in a second.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:10.010
So we had no money and we
rehearsed for this play in the

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:11.969
backyard of Ishmael Reed--

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:13.159
my producer--

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:14.860
and Carla Blank, his
wife, the director.

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:16.980
And just a quick note
on Ishmael Reed.

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:17.630
I was so--

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.389
I was such a bumpkin that in
college, I didn't know that

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.690
Ishmael Reed was a MacArthur
genius winner, twice-nominated

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:24.449
Pulitzer writer.

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.550
And in his backyard means
six other Pakistanis are

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:31.179
rehearsing where my mom made the
dhal and biriyani on the

00:34:31.179 --> 00:34:35.040
weekends and I, of course,
supplied the chai.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:35.714
We did the play.

00:34:35.714 --> 00:34:36.860
The play was a huge success.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.130
We're like awesome,
great, wonderful.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.600
I think I'm done with my life.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.110
I decide to go to law school
to become "honorable."

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:46.600
And during the first year of law
school, during the summer,

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.120
where we're supposed to actually
do something useful

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.710
like apply to a corporation,
an opportunity presented

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:56.520
itself to perform the play
at the Berkeley Repertory

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.150
Theater, which is a major
regional theater.

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:00.560
We decided we'll do it.

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:02.160
I was completely broke,
had no money.

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.140
I got a little bit of money
from my friends.

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:06.690
Again, we performed.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.350
We did the rehearsals in the
backyard of Ishmael Reed and

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:10.430
Carla Blank.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:12.260
We needed to dress the set
to make it look like a

00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:13.630
Pakistani-American home.

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:16.310
So naturally, we used furniture
from my home.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:19.310
My grandmother comes home one
day, comes downstairs, and

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:21.940
says beta, are we moving?

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:25.400
And my grandmother is
a 75-year-old heart

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.690
patient at that time.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.380
We had to sit her down and say
no, no, It'll come back in

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.460
three days, we promise.

00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.320
Now the play was always
intended for a global

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.810
multi-cultural audience.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.590
People, again, made fun of us,
said no one would show up.

00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:41.350
We had no money, so we had to
stretch the dollar into $20,

00:35:41.350 --> 00:35:42.990
use new media.

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.120
Needed to create a press
release, so went to Sheik

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.150
Google, type in press release.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.720
How to make press release.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.210
Figured it out, wrote a press
release, sent it out.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:55.140
Got local press, got the front
page of SF Chronicle which

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.340
then intrigued a BBC journalist
to come by to the

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.280
2005 Berkeley Repertory Theatre
performance, which was

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:06.140
a week after the 7-7 London
subway bombing, of course,

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.310
perpetrated by Pakistani
Muslims.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:12.480
And everyone at that time, 2005,
finally Pakistani came

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.540
in the news, unfortunately
for wrong reasons.

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.040
And everyone was curious
about this city

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:17.440
in India named Pakistan.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.500
And you're like no, dude,
Pakistan's a country-- just

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.400
don't worry about it.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.790
Pakistan's a different
country.

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:24.340
But everyone was curious.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.640
Play sold out.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.170
Got standing ovations,
multi-cultural audience.

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:31.470
A couple months later we did it
at San Jose for 9/11/2005.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:32.940
Play sold out again.

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:33.730
BBC--

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:37.400
that same journalist-- sent back
word to BBC headquarters.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:42.460
They did a 10-minute piece on
us, all right on 9/11/2005.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:46.230
The BBC folks liked the play so
much that they said can we,

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:50.520
on our BBC letterhead, solicit
every theater in London to

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.940
perform this play,
because it's so

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:53.410
important and we need it.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:57.500
I thought about it
and said yes.

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.220
Yes, you can.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.140
But at that time, 2005--

00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:03.100
2005, for those of you who
remember, if we can go into

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:08.450
our 1985 DeLorean and do time
travel back to 2005, it was a

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.560
crazy time where Dixie Chicks
were considered traitors.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.260
You guys remember this?

00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:16.010
Dixie chicks are the whitest
women on Earth.

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.800
They're blond.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:18.230
They sing country music.

00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:20.270
They love the God, and
they're married.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.390
Could you imagine what
they would have done

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:22.720
with a guy like me?

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.760
2005?

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.550
So a lot of Pakistanis and
Muslims-- and the play's not

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:27.560
controversial-- were like do you
really want this message

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.860
out there right now?

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.690
And the feedback we got from lot
of theaters was they liked

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:35.260
the play, but they wanted
me to change it.

00:37:35.260 --> 00:37:37.750
So I said how do you want
me to change it?

00:37:37.750 --> 00:37:38.920
Oh they're like, you know,
just some other

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.060
things, just change it.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:43.820
I'm like can you tell me what
you want me to change?

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.438
And they're like, just
you know-- ehh

00:37:45.438 --> 00:37:46.740
[WISHY WASHY SOUNDS]

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.510
And so we realize that was code
word for take away some

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.750
of the politics, take away
some of the religion.

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.770
So we decided we had to wait.

00:37:53.770 --> 00:37:55.980
Fast forward.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.635
Now I would think that
I have these

00:37:57.635 --> 00:37:59.150
two successful premieres.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:00.270
Life would be awesome.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.240
I'd become a wealthy
playwright.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.310
I'd travel the world.

00:38:03.310 --> 00:38:06.750
And I'd sleep on the bed of
money with dozens of women,

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.620
and my life would be made.

00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:09.500
Wrong.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.530
Fast forward, 2007.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.280
I graduated from law school.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.310
And I end up back in my family
home in my high school

00:38:17.310 --> 00:38:21.730
bedroom, completely broke with
my father putting $5 bills in

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:23.490
my wallet every day.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:25.780
Out of desperation and
frustration, I decide to write

00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:26.780
an article.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.040
And this article was a truncated
article from a

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.230
report from actually a paper
I'd written in law school

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:36.310
about Blackwater and private
military firms in Iraq.

00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:37.900
I submit it to an
online magazine.

00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:39.030
It got published.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.460
They said if you want to submit
any time, submit it.

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:42.520
I said really?

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.320
They said really.

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.410
I was hooked.

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:45.950
I started submitting op-eds.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.130
I wanted to interview this dude
named Seymour Hirsch,

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:50.490
who's this Pulitzer-winning
journalist, just

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:51.290
for the hell of it.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:53.410
Because if you're jobless
sitting at home going crazy,

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.050
and you get ideas like I want
to interview Seymour Hirsch.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:59.020
So I went to Sheik Google,
Google Seymour

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.510
Hirsch phone number.

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:02.020
And I found one.

00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:03.110
I swear.

00:39:03.110 --> 00:39:05.280
Sorry Seymour Hirsch.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.770
And I cold call Seymour
Hirsch.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.230
Guy picks up the phone.

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.100
I'm like I'm a freelance
journalist, Seymour Hirsch.

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.360
I would like to interview you.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.060
He says call me back
two weeks later.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:15.940
We'll schedule the interview.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.830
I call him back two
weeks later.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:19.050
He was a bad mood.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:20.990
I'm like I'm that
Muslim-American journalist who

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:22.450
wants to interview you.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:22.880
He goes huh?

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.340
I already did the Muslims.

00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.740
I did Al Jazeera.

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.870
And I'm like no, no, this
is something else.

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.330
So he said well, if you want
to-- after 20 minutes--

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:32.060
being the son of Pakistani
immigrants, I kept him on the

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:33.970
phone, convinced him
to talk to me.

00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:35.550
He said well, if you want to--

00:39:35.550 --> 00:39:37.810
if we do this hypothetical
interview, throw me a

00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:39.110
hypothetical question.

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.720
I threw him a hypothetical
question.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:41.450
He answered it.

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:42.860
I said if we did a hypothetical
interview, that's

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:43.260
how it'd go.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:44.980
He goes hypothetical
interview?

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:46.560
This is the effing interview.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.100
Get out your recorder.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.200
Let's go, let's go.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:51.760
I didn't have a recorder, so I
sat there with my phone on my

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.850
shoulder and typed transcript
of the entire interview.

00:39:54.850 --> 00:39:55.920
That was my first interview.

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.880
It got published, led to another
online magazine saying

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.100
if you want to publish
anytime, go ahead.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.260
I said sure.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.080
Within six months, I published
50 articles--

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:07.180
maybe 75 within a period
of a year.

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:09.280
And all a sudden, people were
calling me a journalist.

00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.500
I said OK.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.620
People are inviting me to
journalism conferences to give

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.600
talks to journalists, which I
thought was kind of hilarious.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.050
But I went because it
was free, and they

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:18.400
gave me free food.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.350
Now fast forward,
spring of 2007.

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:24.160
I get a job in a kind of shady
immigration law firm run by

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.230
South Asians.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.410
And I get a lot of free time.

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:29.880
So I'm working as an
attorney finally.

00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:33.080
And there's a guy named Barack
Hussein Obama who could have

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.260
become President.

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:37.180
And I thought to myself the
tides are changing.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:41.880
Maybe is now the time for this
play "Domestic Crusaders."

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:45.760
So also, I was about
to turn 28.

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:48.770
And anyone who's younger than
the age of 30, you'd realize

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.910
that some of us go through a
premature midlife crisis.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.770
And I thought I would die
by the age of 30.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:54.910
I literally thought
I would die.

00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:56.930
I thought I would wake up at the
age of 30, have a cardiac,

00:40:56.930 --> 00:40:58.880
like heart attack die--

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.730
like the Earth would open
up, swallow my body.

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:01.520
It'd be over.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.700
So I'm like I need to do
something before I die

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.750
at the age of 30.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:07.100
The only thing I've done which
is worthwhile is this play

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.940
"Domestic Crusaders." I
have to get this play

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.350
staged in New York.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:14.100
For whatever reason, I said that
we have to do it on 9/11.

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:16.030
And then I said I have
to get it published.

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:20.710
This is what I must do before
I die at the age of 30.

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:23.750
Now what happened is I found
someone called the Nuyorican

00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:28.130
Poets Cafe in New York that
said if you raise $24,000

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:31.460
within one year, we'll give you
five weeks in our theater.

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:38.190
We'll give you from 9/11/09
to October.

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.530
They said you have to raise
$24,000, and we'll

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:41.610
give you the space.

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:47.040
So what I did was I created an
elevator pitch in the form of

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.770
a half a page email.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.840
I used Sheik Google.

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.180
I used the internets.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:55.760
I used your competition
Macebook.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.330
I used the Twitter-- is Twitter
your competition?

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:00.990
Not yet, right?

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.390
Not yet.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:02.060
Not yet.

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.390
I used Twitter.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:07.300
I use the blogosphere I used any
network I could and sent

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.590
this elevator pitch in the form
of an email out, like a

00:42:10.590 --> 00:42:13.350
message in a bottle to
do fund raising.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:15.290
I also opened up a
Paypal account.

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:17.910
The first fundraiser was done
by my Vietnamese-American

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:20.710
friends from high school
who raised me $1,500.

00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:22.030
A lady by the name
of [? Zebag ?]

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:24.470
[? Ball ?] all the way in New
York read my stories, said I

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.220
believe in what you're
trying to do.

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:27.510
Let me invite you to New York.

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.110
Maybe we can raise some money.

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:32.070
Went to New York for the first
time in my life, raise the

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:33.650
second $1,500.

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:35.560
Word of mouth started
to spread.

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:39.120
And little by little, $5 here,
$10 here, $15 there, I ended

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.740
up raising $31,000.

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:45.800
The last money came two weeks
before the play's premiere due

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.130
to an anonymous check.

00:42:47.130 --> 00:42:47.720
Thank you.

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:50.980
But what really happened was I
realized we needed messengers,

00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:53.720
because no one wanted to hear
the story of a Pakistani

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:58.070
chaiwallah, doing a play with
six Pakistani characters who

00:42:58.070 --> 00:43:00.570
aren't doing bhangra or
blowing themselves up.

00:43:00.570 --> 00:43:03.700
And I realized in the world
we live in, we need to get

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.590
validated by the people.

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:06.850
Now who are the people?

00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:07.990
I'll finish up in two minutes.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:09.050
Who are the people?

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.940
Good question.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:12.470
After every "Domestic Crusader"
performance, someone

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.010
from my ethnic community--

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:15.030
"ethnic"--

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.891
used to come up to me and
say the following.

00:43:16.891 --> 00:43:17.793
(WHISPERED) Psst.

00:43:17.793 --> 00:43:18.244
Wajahat.

00:43:18.244 --> 00:43:19.150
Come here.

00:43:19.150 --> 00:43:19.780
I'm like what?

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:20.646
[INAUDIBLE] come here.

00:43:20.646 --> 00:43:22.005
I'm like what's up?

00:43:22.005 --> 00:43:23.930
(PAKISTANI ACCENT)
Play was great.

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:26.110
But what do the people
think about it?

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:27.835
I'm like well you saw the
play in front of people.

00:43:27.835 --> 00:43:29.650
And there were people to your
left, people to your right.

00:43:29.650 --> 00:43:30.530
The people seem to like it.

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:31.420
They gave a standing ovation.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:33.910
Like (PAKISTANI ACCENT) Bsht,
not those people.

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:35.620
The People.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.610
And here is just some community
interaction.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:41.300
The people is a code
word for who?

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.260
AUDIENCE: Intelligence.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.180
WAJAHAT ALI: Not intelligence.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.690
Nice job of being politically
correct.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:45.170
AUDIENCE: White people.

00:43:45.170 --> 00:43:46.330
WAJAHAT ALI: White people.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:48.050
Yes, the white people.

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:50.440
I said don't worry about
the white people.

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.110
The white people are OK.

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:54.270
You don't have to hold the
white people's hands.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:56.300
I have faith in the
white people.

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.810
I love the white people.

00:43:57.810 --> 00:44:01.410
Some of my best friends
are the people.

00:44:01.410 --> 00:44:02.360
Don't worry about it.

00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:02.970
It'll be OK.

00:44:02.970 --> 00:44:05.670
But we realized we need
messengers and validators.

00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:09.350
So I made a list of 250
people I respected.

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.810
I really respected.

00:44:10.810 --> 00:44:14.050
Writers, poets, playwrights,
activists, and I didn't have

00:44:14.050 --> 00:44:15.620
any of their email
or contacts.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:19.390
So for a year, until 3:00 AM at
night, using Sheik Google--

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.580
I'm not making this up-- and
search engines, I found any

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:24.040
email contact I could--

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:27.260
a publicist, a manager,
an agent, anything.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:31.970
Created an Excel sheet, send
out my half-page elevator

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:33.900
pitch, half-page
elevator pitch.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.350
I got the contact of Emma
Thompson, Academy Award

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:38.620
winning actress.

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:41.140
Through her publicist, she sends
me an email back finally

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.250
saying your play sounds great.

00:44:42.250 --> 00:44:43.190
I want to read it.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:44.430
Send me a hard copy.

00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:46.390
I send a hard copy.

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:47.612
I think, you know what,
I'm never going to

00:44:47.612 --> 00:44:48.160
hear back from her.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.900
A couple months later, a friend
of mine, Gundar Strads,

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.910
who gets all the "Domestic
Crusader" mail, says, hey,

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:56.450
there's a letter from some
lady named Emma.

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:57.520
Emma Tumps.

00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.750
Emma Tumps.

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:00.050
You know anyone named
Emma Tumps?

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:01.520
I'm like I don't know anyone
named Emma Tumps.

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:02.600
Oh wait, Emma Thompson.

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.310
I mean, Emma Thompson?

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.200
Fricking read the paper right
now, Ned, what's going on?

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.260
Don't waste time.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.170
He mails me the letter.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:11.070
Emma Thompson writes me a
two-page handwritten letter,

00:45:11.070 --> 00:45:12.720
saying how much she loves
the play, how she

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.490
wants to support it.

00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:16.450
And she gives me her personal
email address, says contact me

00:45:16.450 --> 00:45:18.160
if you want help.

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.630
Being the son of Pakistani
immigrants, I said sure, I

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:22.770
need some help.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:24.620
Can you give me a
review blurb?

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.220
She gave me a great review
blurb, where she attaches her

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:29.470
name to the play and says
help me and Wajahat

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:30.880
staging this play.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:32.670
Then she says ask me if you
want anything else.

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:37.660
So I said well, if you are
asking, why don't we-- why

00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:41.080
don't you give me some funds
if you want to just donate.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.650
So she sends me a check
for like about $1,500.

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.720
We get people like Yann Martell,
the author of "Life

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.610
of Pi." We get people
like Dave Eggers.

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:52.190
We end up getting all these
validators, diverse

00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:54.840
invalidators, not just the
people, but also the ethnics.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.580
Right?

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:58.550
We go to Sheik Google,
press Press Release.

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:01.600
Using all our contacts, we send
out the press release to

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:02.970
every mainstream outlet.

00:46:02.970 --> 00:46:05.440
It's about August 2009.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:09.270
The play's premiering 9/11/2009
in New York.

00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:11.020
Two and a half weeks before
the play, we don't have a

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:15.220
single article on us, not
a single interview.

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:16.070
I had faith.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:17.200
I said wait for it.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.540
Within the last week, if you
build it, they will come.

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:22.710
And within the last week of the
play's premiere, we got

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:23.930
"The New York Times" feature.

00:46:23.930 --> 00:46:24.715
We got MSNBC.

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:25.790
We got NBC.

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:26.580
We got Al Jazeera.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.790
We got local, national,
international press.

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:30.910
People thought we would fail.

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:32.470
9/11 opening night.

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:34.080
Diverse multicultural crowd.

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.140
Sold out.

00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.820
Word of mouth spread.

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:39.590
We ended up selling out week
three, week four, and week

00:46:39.590 --> 00:46:42.050
five by the beginning
of the third week.

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:45.770
The Nuyorican Poets Cafe, who
was terrified that we will

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.650
sell no tickets, told us at
the end of our run that we

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:51.440
broke their 40-year box
office records.

00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.040
And then-- yeah, thanks.

00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:53.880
And then after--

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.110
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:46:55.110 --> 00:46:57.670
WAJAHAT ALI: I'll take
one "wow!" Fine.

00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:58.870
Cause this is Google, right?

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:01.890
People are like (PAKISTANI
ACCENT) Pssht, five weeks.

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:04.030
Why wasn't it 50 weeks?

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:05.260
Loser.

00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.660
Do you have Google
stock like I do?

00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:08.460
No.

00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:09.650
I'm better than you.

00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:10.620
I know what Pakistanis think.

00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:11.310
It's all good.

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:12.490
It's all good.

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:13.230
But I sold out.

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:15.450
And we broke the box
office records.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:19.050
And finish, to finish,
I came back and I had

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.200
this dream, this vow--

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:21.140
I was 28--

00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.010
to publish this play by
the time I turned 30.

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:27.720
Long story short, through this
journalism career, blogging

00:47:27.720 --> 00:47:31.000
career, lawyer career that
just kind of fortuitously

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.550
bubbled up in the last two
years, I had a connection with

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.540
a Pulitzer-nominated author and
publisher of McSweeney's,

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:37.530
Dave Eggers.

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:39.540
And the email literally
went like this--

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:40.800
half-page email--

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.310
hey dude, I have a good idea.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:45.630
McSweeney should publish
"Domestic Crusaders." Here's

00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:46.770
10 reasons why.

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:49.430
If anyone has received emails
from me, they realize it seems

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:51.290
like it's sent by a six-year-old
child.

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:53.330
I don't use capitalization,
grammar, anything.

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:54.590
It's like pidgin English.

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:55.870
And I didn't even use
one, two, three--

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:57.090
I just did dashes.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:59.060
I'm like you guys, I've
written a play.

00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.600
The play's important.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.740
It'll help you with the
multicultural audiences.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:03.720
You like the play.

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.820
And so, why not?

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:08.050
He responds back to me in
typical professional fashion

00:48:08.050 --> 00:48:10.030
dude, that's a great idea.

00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:11.170
Let me give it to my board.

00:48:11.170 --> 00:48:12.240
It's not up to me.

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:16.400
The board reads the play,
unanimously decides to publish

00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:20.480
the play, and then a day after
turning 30, I held the first

00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.530
copy of the "Domestic Crusaders"
that got published

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:27.150
in January 2001, is now being
taught at universities--

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.966
thank you.

00:48:27.966 --> 00:48:28.820
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:32.040
WAJAHAT ALI: And I can now
announce that I just signed

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.520
the contract right
before coming to

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.810
Google at Postal Annex.

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:35.820
I sent it off.

00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:38.690
And "Domestic Crusaders," after
10 years, is actually

00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:41.980
going to be in London in 2013.

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.120
And Emma Thompson, who's been so
nice, sent me an email last

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.090
night, said invite--

00:48:47.090 --> 00:48:48.000
I look forward to it.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.710
I'm going to come see
your production.

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:52.630
Come eat dinner at my house.

00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:54.100
I will cook for you.

00:48:54.100 --> 00:48:55.800
I really want to meet
you and your wife.

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:58.780
She really loved my marriage
story, which is on my blog.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.670
Shameless, shameless
promotion.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:02.010
But that's Emma Thompson.

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.300
And people like Dave Eggers, and
people like Carla Blank,

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:07.430
my director, people like Ishmael
Reed, a community who

00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:10.480
believed in me that 10 years now
down the line, after I had

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:11.856
left the play, because
I published and

00:49:11.856 --> 00:49:13.050
I'm like I'm done.

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:14.740
And the play got a
life of its own.

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:17.330
And then after I'd published it
and left, people have been

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:19.570
coming to me for the past two
years-- universities,

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:22.240
colleges, student groups,
and now England.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.090
And it's been a long
fulfilling journey.

00:49:24.090 --> 00:49:25.660
And I want to end
it on this note.

00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.910
That uncle in 2003--

00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:29.440
remember at Mehran Restaurant
who said (PAKISTANI ACCENT)

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.590
Beta, do something useful.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:32.850
Go protest.

00:49:32.850 --> 00:49:35.140
That uncle came up to me about
three years ago when we were

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:36.720
doing the play in New York.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:39.380
That same uncle came up to me
and said listen, I've been in

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:41.100
this country for 40 years.

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.540
I've done everything right.

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:43.850
I'm a successful engineer.

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:44.960
I've paid taxes.

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.120
I've raised my kids right.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:47.430
I've never done anything
wrong.

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:50.660
I turn on the TV, and they still
see me as either a cab

00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:52.400
driver or a terrorist.

00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.800
I wish I would've made
one of my sons into a

00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:56.480
storyteller like you.

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:59.070
I realize there's so much
value in storytelling.

00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:00.470
Keep doing what you're doing.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:01.720
I support you.

00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:04.200
And so that's something
fulfilling after 10 years.

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:07.920
And now I get to travel
the world, and I

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.400
don't ride my law degree.

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:11.170
I ride my pen.

00:50:11.170 --> 00:50:15.100
And once in awhile, when I'm
lucky, someone makes chai for

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.360
me for a change.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.460
So thank you for having
me, Google.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:18.347
I'm done.

00:50:18.347 --> 00:50:19.341
You guys have five minutes?

00:50:19.341 --> 00:50:29.290
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:31.380
WAJAHAT ALI: You hear
that, YouTube?

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.670
You hear that?

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:34.423
All right.

00:50:34.423 --> 00:50:36.150
AUDIENCE: This was
very engaging.

00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:37.550
I was just wandering
through the halls

00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:39.165
and heard you talking.

00:50:39.165 --> 00:50:42.420
And you were engaging enough to
keep me occupied for your

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:43.140
entire story.

00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:43.400
So thank you.

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:44.120
WAJAHAT ALI: Thank you sir.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.130
Thank you for that.

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.900
The check is in the mail.

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:49.920
You performed admirably.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.610
Thank you for that.

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:52.040
I appreciate it.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.850
AUDIENCE: I actually wanted
to know about

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:54.440
your upcoming stuff.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.590
I know you're working on a
screenplay and another play.

00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:58.670
So if you can tell
us about that?

00:50:58.670 --> 00:51:00.810
WAJAHAT ALI: Sure, the
upcoming stuff.

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:03.210
I'm working on my first movie
screenplay with a really cool

00:51:03.210 --> 00:51:05.440
director by the name
of Josh Seftel.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.350
He made this movie called "War,
Incorporated." I wish I

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:07.900
could tell you more.

00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:09.320
It's a really cool story.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:11.760
It's a fictional take on a real
life character who does

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.760
some amazing work.

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.600
So I'm learning how to
do a screenplay.

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:16.290
That's fun.

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.190
Me and Dave Eggers, for
two years, have been

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:19.630
working on a TV pilot.

00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:22.800
HBO commissioned us on a pitch
we made about an American

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.220
Muslim cop in the Bay Area.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.510
I really like the damn pilot.

00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:27.760
I'm not just saying that
because we wrote it.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.680
But I really think
it's damn good.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.770
And it's a very, very
Bay Area pilot.

00:51:31.770 --> 00:51:32.870
It's not just San Francisco.

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:34.170
It's East Bay and
San Francisco.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:36.590
It's very real, very nuanced,
and layered.

00:51:36.590 --> 00:51:37.660
We did the third draft.

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:39.090
I kicked over the third
draft to Dave.

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:40.550
He has to do the final edits.

00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:41.750
Let's see what happens.

00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:45.450
And somehow, this weird
circuitous professional path

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:46.990
has led to me being
a researcher on

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:49.370
Islamophobia in America.

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:52.930
And I've been working on some
upcoming research about the

00:51:52.930 --> 00:51:56.320
rise of Islamophobia, but
specifically labeling and

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.790
singling out the Islamophobes.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:02.410
And we label them in a big
report we did last year called

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:05.310
"Fear, Incorporated, The Roots
of the Islamophobia Network in

00:52:05.310 --> 00:52:07.820
America," where we, for the
first time ever-- it was a

00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:10.440
six-month investigative report,
where we traced all

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:14.030
the funding, traced the major
Islamophobic players and how

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:16.860
they have created these memes
that have entered in the

00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:19.090
mainstream, such as President
Obama's a Muslim.

00:52:19.090 --> 00:52:19.860
He isn't.

00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:23.020
Or anti-Sharia threat,
and so forth.

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.520
So it's a really weird path.

00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:27.260
But my family would really,
really like me

00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:28.680
to still be an attorney.

00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.620
And they're still trying to
figure out what I want to be

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:31.375
when I grow up.

00:52:31.375 --> 00:52:34.220
But not my parents-- my
parents, nontypical,

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.880
nonstereotypical South
Asian parents--

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.860
I want to give a shout
out to my parents--

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.020
have always supported me since
I was like 9 or 10 years old.

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.910
So they keep telling me
to do what I'm doing.

00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:44.290
But the larger family--

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:46.920
Pakistanis are a breeding
people.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.980
We travel in a horde
of 60 or 70.

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:54.190
So they to this day still think
I failed in my life and

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:55.690
have not utilized
my law career.

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:57.690
And they think literally I just
sit there doing emails

00:52:57.690 --> 00:52:59.750
all night till 4:00 AM.

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:00.810
But that's what I'm working
on right now.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:01.920
AUDIENCE: Great talk.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.760
WAJAHAT ALI: Thank you.

00:53:02.760 --> 00:53:04.470
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to know
what you think of the

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:09.007
state of Muslim arts is in the
US, and what we could do to

00:53:09.007 --> 00:53:09.981
encourage it.

00:53:09.981 --> 00:53:12.300
WAJAHAT ALI: Ah, crap,
a thesis question.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.300
The state of Muslim
arts right now.

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:17.680
Actually, it's a very
good question.

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:23.650
Real quick, I think it's not
surprising that after 9/11, we

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:28.280
saw a figurative creative
explosion of American Muslim

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.610
artistic endeavors.

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:33.320
And any time you look at any
ethnic minority, it usually

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:38.520
takes tremendous pain or love
that inspires this, right?

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.780
African Americans, Irish
Catholic, Jewish Americans.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.200
Jewish Americans and African
Americans, not surprising,

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.720
suffered tremendously--

00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:47.280
also, some of the creators
of the best

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:48.390
art in America, right?

00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:50.540
And I think there's a permanent
fork road in the

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:51.550
timeline of 9/11.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:53.810
We want to escape, but hopefully
we've reached the

00:53:53.810 --> 00:53:55.550
post-post-9/11 climate.

00:53:55.550 --> 00:53:58.560
And what we saw in the past 10
years is you see American

00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:01.670
Muslims, like lawyers, doctors,
and engineers, who

00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:04.960
left the trinity to do
stand-up comedy.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.350
Now we see people like Willow
Wilson, my friend who's a

00:54:07.350 --> 00:54:10.290
graphic novelist and writing
a book called Alif.

00:54:10.290 --> 00:54:13.420
You see people emerging
in spoken word.

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.780
And what we're witnessing now--
and this is a test for

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:16.980
the American Muslims--

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:21.290
is when it comes to any ethnic
minority that doesn't have

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:25.450
mainstream publicity, they
want every single

00:54:25.450 --> 00:54:29.340
representation to be an
avatar of perfection.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.240
So they're like this is our
one shot at having a play.

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.170
This is our one shot
of having a Muslim.

00:54:34.170 --> 00:54:35.680
We have to tell every
single story that

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:36.730
exists under the sun.

00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:38.480
We have to show how
we're perfect.

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:41.520
And every time you expose warts,
there's tremendous push

00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.310
back from the community,
which is what me

00:54:43.310 --> 00:54:44.530
and others have witnessed.

00:54:44.530 --> 00:54:46.340
Because they want the avatar
of perfection.

00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:50.050
But what we know is that good
art reflects the warts.

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:50.940
It makes it interesting.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.195
No one want to see
a perfect story.

00:54:52.195 --> 00:54:53.210
It's boring.

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:54.870
And you want art to resonate.

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:57.630
So what we're seeing now is
a shift where I think many

00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:59.380
American Muslim artists--

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.250
I know many of them.

00:55:00.250 --> 00:55:03.270
They've had such tremendous
strain on them to always make

00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:06.300
their art quote-unquote
"Islamic." Right?

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.240
There's always a tendency among
Muslims circles that the

00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:09.330
art has to be Islamic.

00:55:09.330 --> 00:55:10.460
What does that mean?

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:12.380
And there's like this religious
police that says you

00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:15.280
didn't say Bismillah and
[URDU], didn't have

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.130
four suras in there.

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:17.040
This is not Islamic.

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.560
And they completely
dismiss it.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:22.160
And what I want is to see
more artists who just

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:23.540
happen to be Muslim.

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:28.130
And that must mean also the way
our art gets better is to

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:30.170
change the mentality of American
Muslim communities

00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:32.470
where you have to
make a big tent

00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:34.280
approach to American Islam.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:37.180
That means that if a person
identifies as Muslim, I'm not

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:39.950
interested in their piety
or their religiosity.

00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:41.890
If they identify as a Muslim,
and they're willing to

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:44.860
contribute to the dialogue and
give something back, we have

00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:46.620
to give them that space.

00:55:46.620 --> 00:55:48.320
We have to acknowledge
that space.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.000
And likewise we have
to acknowledge

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.640
artists in that space.

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.750
It might not always be
religious or pious or

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.730
conservative or liberal or
progressive, because the

00:55:55.730 --> 00:55:57.460
progressives go into the

00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:59.350
conservatives, all these labels.

00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:02.510
My concern is number one make
the art good, because I think

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:04.570
good art attracts
good audiences.

00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:06.110
Make it authentic.

00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:09.260
And I think we as a community,
then, through our art, can

00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:12.220
really push the boundaries and
make the tent of American

00:56:12.220 --> 00:56:15.530
Islam bigger to encompass
all the stories,

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:16.830
not just one story.

00:56:16.830 --> 00:56:18.320
And I hope I answered
that question.

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.170
But we're seeing it now.

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:22.680
Finally 10 years later, we're
finally seeing the shift where

00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:26.030
you see an artist say I'm
writing a play, not about

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:28.420
Muslims or Islam, just
a play about people.

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:29.830
And I happen to be an
American Muslim.

00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:30.690
And that's OK.

00:56:30.690 --> 00:56:32.540
And if an American Muslim
says you know what?

00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.660
I want to write a play which
has a political edge and a

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:38.100
religious edge, they should
have that space too.

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:39.470
I hope I got you there.

00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:41.190
AUDIENCE: Obviously the--

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:44.770
you mentioned earlier
your ties to the--

00:56:44.770 --> 00:56:47.650
the purported ties that people
make of you to these extremist

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:49.340
groups and all of this.

00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:52.140
I'm curious if that started
as a result of "Domestic

00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:55.180
Crusaders" or as a result of the
"Fear, Inc" publication.

00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:55.630
WAJAHAT ALI: Right.

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:57.400
So I joked--

00:56:57.400 --> 00:57:01.330
I was joking about my fictional
ties to extremist

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:04.160
groups-- quote unquote
"extremist groups." Look, it

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:07.590
started as a result of the
publication of "Fear,

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:11.100
Incorporated," where we
literally named all the names

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.470
of the key Islamophobes.

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:15.560
And we went into it very
strategically, knowing that's

00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.750
how they'll retaliate.

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:20.885
Because one of their key goals
is to marginalize any American

00:57:20.885 --> 00:57:24.650
Muslim voice that becomes
prominent, either in Google or

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:28.350
politics or the media, that
threatens their narrative,

00:57:28.350 --> 00:57:30.280
which paints a civilizational
war between

00:57:30.280 --> 00:57:31.750
the West versus Islam.

00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:34.200
So any time an American Muslim
voice emerges in the

00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:36.700
mainstream, they want to
marginalize that voice.

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:38.450
It's been happening for
the past 10 years.

00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:40.400
Strategically, we knew that
was going to happen.

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:43.410
I looked at my track record,
and I'm like OK, let

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:44.430
them come after me.

00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:46.870
And after the publication of
"Fear, Inc." which has been a

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:51.980
year, they have tried in very
desperate, amusing fashion to

00:57:51.980 --> 00:57:55.190
call me like Wajahat
Ali, a man of hate.

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:57.180
And every time they print out
something, I just sit there

00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.260
and read and laugh with my
friends, which I don't know if

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:00.090
it's normal.

00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:02.430
Because my friends get really
upset on my behalf.

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:04.040
They're like Wajahat Ali,
look what they did.

00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.630
All my friends-- regardless of
ethnicity, they're like I

00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:06.840
can't believe they did that.

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:08.220
I just think it's very funny.

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.420
So I just read it and I laugh.

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:13.340
And they make these bizarre
obtuse links.

00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:15.710
So they said I was a member of a
social group, Muslim Student

00:58:15.710 --> 00:58:16.680
Association.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:19.390
And they make these crazy links,
and then they say look,

00:58:19.390 --> 00:58:22.420
I am a pawn of the radical
Muslim Brotherhood with the

00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:25.650
agenda to infiltrate America and
replace the Constitution

00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:27.270
with Sharia.

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:28.770
So this has been happening.

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:31.500
But because we've seen a shift
in the past one year or two

00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:34.880
year, where the Islamophobes
have become so extreme.

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:36.380
And unfortunately, they've
infiltrated

00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:37.260
the Republican Party.

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:40.410
The Republicans now even are
like, this is bad news for our

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:42.690
brand name and our party, which
is why you see people

00:58:42.690 --> 00:58:46.820
like John McCain and even
Boehner go against Michele

00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:49.340
Bachmann, who, if you don't
know, last year Michele

00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:53.510
Bachmann came up with a memo
saying these names of these

00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:54.840
American Muslims--

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.180
she named the names--

00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:59.070
are part of the radical Muslim
Brotherhood agenda.

00:58:59.070 --> 00:59:01.660
As a result of this witch hunt
and fear mongering, she was

00:59:01.660 --> 00:59:04.930
blasted by John McCain, Boehner,
and even her former

00:59:04.930 --> 00:59:07.750
campaign manager, Ed Rollins
who said it was shameful.

00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:11.200
But she raised $1 million in
a month, based on that

00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:12.550
fearmongering.

00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:15.870
So they try to come after me,
but it's been very minor.

00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:19.340
Mostly because I have
deliberately spoken to a

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:20.660
multicultural audience--

00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:22.240
deliberately, intentionally--

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:25.630
and I've never said anything
really radical, I mean, if you

00:59:25.630 --> 00:59:26.670
look at my stuff.

00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:29.530
I stand by my political
opinions, even those that

00:59:29.530 --> 00:59:30.590
might be unpopular.

00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:32.360
I've tried to be very fair.

00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.890
They've tried to attack me,
but it hasn't stuck.

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:36.920
And that's why I'm like OK,
if you want to come after

00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.170
me come after me.

00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:41.100
I'll come after you, which
is what we're doing.

00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:43.670
And my hope is to expose
Islamophobes.

00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:46.380
I want to be very transparent,
because they're a poison to

00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:49.390
America, and specifically in
light of Anders Breivik the

00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:52.150
Norwegian murderer who
killed 77 people.

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:56.090
He left behind a 1,500-page
manifesto, where he cites all

00:59:56.090 --> 00:59:57.890
these American Islamophobia
that are mentioned in the

00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:59.190
"Fear, Inc." report.

00:59:59.190 --> 01:00:01.810
And experts have said that they
didn't cause him to do

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:05.370
this, but he emerges from
the same ideological

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:06.460
infrastructure.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:08.040
So we want to expose
them because we

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:09.270
see them as a poison.

01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:11.570
And when you expose people like
this, yes, you get hit.

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:14.070
But I've been very lucky, that
nothing's been able to stick.

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:15.670
So that's why I joke
about it so openly.

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:17.650
I'm like, yeah, Barack Obama,
my Muslim president.

01:00:17.650 --> 01:00:20.860
We hang out and have dhal
and drink chai.

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:22.090
Sometimes we eat pork.

01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:22.720
I'm just kidding.

01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:23.720
I don't eat pork.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:24.680
He's not Muslim.

01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:28.450
If he is Muslim, he's the worst
Muslim of all time.

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:29.250
Chillax.

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:29.920
All right.

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.910
I hope I answered
your question.

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:32.950
I went a little too
detail into it.

01:00:32.950 --> 01:00:33.630
Yeah, good?

01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.986
Good.

01:00:33.986 --> 01:00:37.240
AUDIENCE: Probably a two part
question, one is just building

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:40.990
on what you just talked about,
what's happening with the

01:00:40.990 --> 01:00:43.840
recent movie and with
the [? stuff ?]

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.690
going on YouTube.

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:50.590
So the entire process, I also
want you to talk about the

01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:53.720
mentality of the
people and your

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.751
psychoanalysis of the situation.

01:00:55.751 --> 01:00:58.030
WAJAHAT ALI: My psychoanalysis
of the situation?

01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:59.180
Wow.

01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:00.740
I should have gotten
paid by Google.

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:01.910
Google needs to pay
me next time.

01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:02.820
Go ahead.

01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:06.040
You are a playwriter, so I
believe you would have that

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:06.521
[? deal ?].

01:01:06.521 --> 01:01:11.880
And the second is do you think
about doing these plays

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.132
yourself, going out in Muslim
countries to actually build

01:01:16.132 --> 01:01:19.680
awareness within those countries
about what they are

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:23.430
fighting for or what America is
for or what the values are.

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:25.450
WAJAHAT ALI: You cheated with
a two-part question.

01:01:25.450 --> 01:01:26.470
But I'm going to answer.

01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:30.410
Very quickly, I think, when it
comes to this unfortunate

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:33.240
movie that was released on
YouTube and subsequently has

01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:37.140
spurned protests across Muslim
communities that have resulted

01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:40.840
in deaths, I think extremism
begets extremism.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:45.590
And I say that because the
makers of this documentary, if

01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:48.720
you look at their ideological
ties, one of the film's

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:52.570
promoters deliberately said,
[? specifically ?] he said we

01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:56.530
hoped this would happen, which
he's talking about the riots.

01:01:56.530 --> 01:02:00.070
And he has ideological ties to
people like Pamela Geller and

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:02.760
Robert Spencer who were some
of the key Islamophobes we

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.840
mentioned in "Fear,
Incorporated," who are members

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.450
of the hate group Stop
Islamization of America.

01:02:07.450 --> 01:02:12.410
So do they have a right
to create inflammatory

01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:13.640
material like this?

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.780
I strongly believe they do.

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:18.990
Does that give a right
to anyone to

01:02:18.990 --> 01:02:20.550
respond with violence?

01:02:20.550 --> 01:02:21.450
No.

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:26.780
As a Muslim, I think those
Muslims who try to rationalize

01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:31.090
and validate their violent
response by saying they are

01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:34.410
defending the legacy of the
Prophet Muhammad, are in fact

01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:36.470
betraying the legacy, spirit
and [? etiquette ?]

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:37.760
of the Prophet Muhammad.

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:41.530
And I'm not just saying that
to mince words, to be nice.

01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:42.510
I sincerely mean that.

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:45.820
I had tremendous anger when I
saw people respond violently.

01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:48.590
At the same time, what we should
know is that there's

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:50.200
1.5 billion Muslims.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.680
And even in countries like
Libya, in Egypt, what we saw--

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.490
and I'm glad due to
globalization, we can finally

01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:56.760
get this in the mainstream--

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:59.550
you saw protests against
the violent protesters.

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:03.260
You saw 30,000 Libyans come out
peacefully protesting the

01:03:03.260 --> 01:03:06.380
violent protests that killed the
ambassador Chris Stevens.

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:09.840
And even you saw images of
Muslims worldwide saying this

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.070
does not represent Islam.

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:12.610
So when people say why
does the Muslim

01:03:12.610 --> 01:03:13.720
world behave like this?

01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.700
You say, it's not the
Muslim world.

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:16.720
Islam doesn't speak.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.340
Muslims do.

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.700
And there's 1.4 billion
Muslims.

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:22.160
It's just some minority faction
in Pakistan, Egypt,

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:22.660
and so forth.

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:26.570
But a problem exists within
these countries, and it's very

01:03:26.570 --> 01:03:27.530
deliberate when you see
the countries--

01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:29.260
Tunisia, Egypt, Libya.

01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:30.605
I mean, you see-- they
went through the

01:03:30.605 --> 01:03:32.070
Arab Spring last year.

01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:34.820
It's not surprising at all to
me that certain factions are

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:37.050
trying to play up on this,
which they do.

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:39.780
And I think what we're seeing
now, though, is a shift where

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:41.640
people understand that
it's not the majority

01:03:41.640 --> 01:03:43.240
of Muslims in America.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.570
The narrative still persists.

01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:45.630
It's troubling.

01:03:45.630 --> 01:03:48.300
And I think, again, extremism
begets extremism.

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:52.220
And this is why stories are so
important, because you need

01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:53.890
more narratives out there.

01:03:53.890 --> 01:03:54.530
Right?

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:57.090
You need more narratives than
the rage boy cover that came

01:03:57.090 --> 01:03:58.430
out on "Newsweek" last week.

01:03:58.430 --> 01:04:00.340
You guys see that cover?

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.360
Out of all the messengers, they
chose Ayin Hirsi Ali.

01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.090
"Newsweek" has every right.

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:05.990
But it's like I always joked.

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:08.260
I said asking Ayin Hirsi Ali
to talk about Muslims is

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:11.570
asking like Mel Gibson to do
a convening about Jews.

01:04:11.570 --> 01:04:14.280
Just because the Jews will be
like out of all the people

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:16.820
that you could choose, why would
you choose someone who's

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:19.910
made a creator out of being
inflammatory and

01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:22.970
scholastically incorrect
with their analysis?

01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:23.550
Right?

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:25.570
And so, again, you see
sensationalism

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:27.320
dominate the news.

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:31.570
But I think it does bring up
good points about art, the

01:04:31.570 --> 01:04:35.570
role of art, the power
of art, cartoons.

01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:37.240
People say art exists
in a vacuum.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.120
It doesn't.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.510
It informs the vacuum.

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:40.390
It reflects.

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:41.410
It informs the vacuum.

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:42.340
It reflects society.

01:04:42.340 --> 01:04:46.910
And sometimes, unfortunately,
it explodes that vacuum.

01:04:46.910 --> 01:04:48.880
And I think there's a
responsibility for Muslims

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.200
also to step up--
clergy, artists,

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:53.320
writers, and they have--

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:55.160
to denounce that act.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.320
And I think there is a strategy
that needs to be to

01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.890
respond intelligently, which
is something that

01:05:01.890 --> 01:05:03.180
sometimes we don't do.

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:06.640
Pakistani uncles take a chai and
yell at Bill O'Reilly at

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.090
their home.

01:05:08.090 --> 01:05:10.590
It's fun to yell at Bill
O'Reilly and Fox News, but

01:05:10.590 --> 01:05:12.660
maybe there's some more
important strategies.

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:15.570
For the second question, very
quick, interest has come from

01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:16.970
many Muslim countries--

01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:17.610
"Muslim" countries.

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:20.800
Pakistan is really interested,
and they see value in it.

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:23.030
I think if we pull it
off in England--

01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.780
I signed the contract.

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:24.950
Let's see what happens--

01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:27.760
I think we go transatlantic
first, and I think it will

01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.800
trickle down to other
countries.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:33.590
But the beautiful thing about
being published is people are

01:05:33.590 --> 01:05:35.140
reading it all around
the world.

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:36.590
And I know LUMS University--

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:38.720
anyone who went to LUMS
here in Lahore?

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:39.430
One person.

01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:40.860
Congratulations.

01:05:40.860 --> 01:05:43.070
LUMS University has
taught the play.

01:05:43.070 --> 01:05:45.120
So it's good.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:48.840
I hope I was able to answer your
two-part thesis question.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:49.695
Thanks, guys.

01:05:49.695 --> 01:05:50.510
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:51.320
WAJAHAT ALI: Thank you.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:52.070
Thank you, Suhair.

01:05:52.070 --> 01:05:53.320
Thank you, Google.
