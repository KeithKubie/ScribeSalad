WILL BURTON: What the hell
are you guys doing in my song?

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.330
MAX VON ESSEN: It's my song!

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.049
ROBERT FAIRCHILD: We'd
almost be in love!

[MUSIC - GERSHWIN, "WHO CARES?"]

00:07:44.859 --> 00:07:47.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you all
for being here at Google today.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.250
We really appreciate it.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.630
Can you just take a minute
and introduce yourselves,

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.700
and tell us your
character names,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.741
and everything like that?

00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:56.507
And if you're a director,
say that kind of thing well.

00:07:56.507 --> 00:07:57.340
MAX VON ESSEN: Sure.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.840
I'm Max Von Essen.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.620
I play Henri Baurel
in the show, who

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.301
is part of a love
triangle of three men, who

00:08:03.301 --> 00:08:04.800
are all in love
with the same woman,

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.675
or think they're in love
with the same woman,

00:08:06.675 --> 00:08:08.370
or want similar things.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.650
And he's actually only one
the main French characters

00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:12.150
in the show.

00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:14.410
So I'm a French
guy, kind of torn,

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.415
I know I'm in love with
Lise, played by-- well,

00:08:17.415 --> 00:08:19.222
she'll tell you.

00:08:19.222 --> 00:08:19.930
I'm kind of torn.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.510
I desperately want
to be a performer

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.593
and move to the United
States, and go to New York,

00:08:23.593 --> 00:08:26.880
and be a performer, perform
at Radio City Music Hall.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.660
But I know what my parents are
sort of gearing me up towards,

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.160
taking over for the
family business.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.760
So he's very torn in his life.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.820
Torn as far as his
relationship with Lise,

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.434
and his life in
general, as to what

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:39.809
he feels he should
be doing, what

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:41.428
his passion is to be doing.

00:08:41.428 --> 00:08:42.428
LEANNE COPE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:47.580
MAX VON ESSEN: I'm not sure.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.231
LEANNE COPE: OK.

00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:49.980
Can you hear that?

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.580
I'm Leanne Cope, and
I play Lise Dassin.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:56.890
She is the lucky
lady who has three

00:08:56.890 --> 00:08:59.820
men fall in love with her.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.670
She's a young girl who, she's
actually Jewish, and was

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.205
hidden by the Baurel family
during the Second World

00:09:06.205 --> 00:09:07.150
War in Paris.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:14.810
So she comes out of hiding,
and she bumps into Jerry,

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.760
who is kind of an instant,
love-at-first-sight thing.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:25.040
But she is also engaged to
Henri, so she's very torn.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.126
But there's a happy
ending in the end.

00:09:27.126 --> 00:09:28.750
I think, happy for
everyone in the end.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.083
Everyone figures out where
they should be going in life.

00:09:31.083 --> 00:09:33.790
So yeah, I play Lise Dassin.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:36.580
WILL BURTON: I'm Will Burton.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.180
I am playing Adam
Hochberg today.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.040
I'm actually an understudy.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.390
I cover him as
well, on some days.

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.830
But Adam Hochberg is a
Jewish-American soldier

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.770
who fought in World War II,
and decided, afterwards,

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:56.010
to stay in Paris, and
pursue his writing career.

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.580
He's a composer.

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:02.220
So he's decided to stay
in Paris to be inspired.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:05.360
And his muse becomes Lise.

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.800
He falls in love with Lise.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.560
And he meets these
two gentlemen,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:15.710
and they all become
buds, and that's

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.885
kind of Adam's part to play.

00:10:17.885 --> 00:10:19.510
ROBERT FAIRCHILD:
I'm Robert Fairchild.

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:23.600
I play Jerry Mulligan, the
role made famous by Gene Kelly.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.940
And he's a soldier
in World War II

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:31.550
who stays in Paris on
the GI Bill to study art,

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.670
and falls in love
with Lise, and becomes

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:35.572
best friends with these guys.

00:10:35.572 --> 00:10:37.530
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON:
I'm Christopher Wheeldon,

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:40.550
the director choreographer
of "American in Paris."

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.050
Thank you.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:47.130
I play this guy who is
happily choreographing

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:50.210
in the ballet world, when
one day, a big Broadway

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:51.670
producer came
along and said, hey

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:53.650
do you want to direct
a Broadway musical?

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.470
And I said, sure, why not?

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:56.500
Let's have a go.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:59.610
That's my role.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.500
And I just-- sorry, Jill.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.730
I just want to say, Will's
actually making his debut

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:05.560
tonight as Adam Hochberg.

00:11:11.264 --> 00:11:12.680
JILL PAICE: My
name is Jill Paice.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.940
I play Milo Davenport, who,
apparently, nobody loves.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.734
Thanks.

00:11:18.734 --> 00:11:20.150
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON:
We love you.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.060
JILL PAICE: I'll take these two.

00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.060
She is a rich
American heiress, who

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:28.360
arrives in Paris right at
the height of the new, sort

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.830
of, art scene that's coming up.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:37.340
And she chases this guy
for most of the show,

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.890
but also commissions
a ballet, which

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.570
will star Lise, that Jerry
will do the set design for,

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:45.640
and Adam will write
the music for.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.860
So I think I'm very important.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.187
And I love me.

00:11:51.187 --> 00:11:53.020
STUART OKEN: At the end
of the show, anyway.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:53.700
JILL PAICE: Yes.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.075
STUART OKEN: Hi,
I'm Stuart Oken.

00:11:55.075 --> 00:11:56.820
I get to play producer.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:12:00.630
I had the great good fortune
to be offered a chance

00:12:00.630 --> 00:12:05.320
to conceive of how
we might approach

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.270
bringing "An American in Paris"
to Broadway, which had never

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:08.770
been.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.580
It had only been this 1950 movie
that had been quite famous,

00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.880
but had never found
its way to Broadway.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.110
And it was a bit
of a dated movie,

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:21.200
although there were lots
of wonderful things in it.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:26.190
So along with Chris and Rob
Fisher, our musical supervisor,

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:28.650
and Craig Lucas, our book
writer, and of course,

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:32.070
with the magnificent George
and Ira Gershwin songs

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:34.680
to work with, we
had the good fortune

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:39.380
to be able to spend the five
years it took to realize

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.310
Chris's vision, with Bob
Crowley, and Natasha Katz,

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.300
and his wonderful
team of designers,

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:48.300
and then to have this amazing
company bring it to life.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.810
So we've had a
wonderful journey.

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.320
And I'm proud to be here.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:51.820
Thank you.

00:12:55.889 --> 00:12:57.930
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm going
to fall off this chair.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:58.400
MAX VON ESSEN: Are you OK?

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.680
FEMALE SPEAKER: I really am.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.080
I don't usually wear heels.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.413
I don't know if you've bumped
into me around the office,

00:13:03.413 --> 00:13:05.786
but this is a special occasion.

00:13:05.786 --> 00:13:10.360
It's not working
out so well for me.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.260
So yes, you're here.

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:16.000
You're playing at the Palace
Theater now, but you opened,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.944
your world premiere was
in Paris, France, correct?

00:13:19.944 --> 00:13:21.610
Can you tell us a
little bit about that,

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.909
how that came to be?

00:13:23.909 --> 00:13:25.700
STUART OKEN: That
usually comes back to me.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.575
I'll tell you a little,
and they can tell you

00:13:27.575 --> 00:13:30.110
what it was like to be there.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.890
You know, "American
in Paris," right?

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:35.260
So you always have
to go somewhere.

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.470
If you do a new musical--
and we are a new musical,

00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.969
even though it feels
like maybe it's

00:13:38.969 --> 00:13:42.200
not-- the first time it's
on stage, different script,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.230
different song order, different
people, different character

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.570
conceptions, it's new, and
it takes you a lot of time.

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:51.336
This is very different
than a revival, which

00:13:51.336 --> 00:13:53.460
you can kind of rehearse
and do, because you're not

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.320
rewriting every day.

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.080
Anyway, we needed to go
somewhere to work on the show,

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.390
to, so to speak,
get the kinks out,

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.780
but to really get our rhythm.

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.070
And we had to pick
a place to go.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.800
And there was a wonderful
producer in Paris,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.710
his name is Jean-Luc Choplin.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:13.530
And Jean-Luc, who I
oddly happened to know,

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:19.650
because we both spent 10 years
working at Disney between '93,

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.820
I think, and 2004.

00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.790
And Jean-Luc has become
the artistic director

00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:30.220
of this exquisite theater, a
historic, beautiful building

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.030
called Theatre du Chatelet.

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.740
And France does not
have much of a history

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.870
of doing American musicals.

00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:40.520
It's actually one of the
countries in the world

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.280
where we just haven't
resonated with this very

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.530
unique American art form.

00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:50.307
But Jean-Luc started bringing
productions in English

00:14:50.307 --> 00:14:51.265
that he'd put together.

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:54.350
He'd only run them two or
three weeks at the most,

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:58.580
but he'd bring in wonderful
performers and artists

00:14:58.580 --> 00:15:01.244
mostly from England,
because you do something

00:15:01.244 --> 00:15:02.660
in the original--
he only performs

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:03.720
in the original language.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.040
So he was developing an
audience for American musicals,

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.040
and he did the classics.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.329
He did Sondheim.

00:15:09.329 --> 00:15:10.620
He did Rodgers and Hammerstein.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.180
He did Lerner and Loewe.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:14.630
And after about six,
seven years of doing that,

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.320
he thought that it possibly
was the time for his audiences

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.870
to actually have a
brand new musical.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:24.020
But this seemed like a
rather safe one, because it

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.970
had familiarity to them.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.960
The story had empathy
for French characters,

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.530
and the music was so well known.

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:35.370
So fortunately, serendipitously,
we managed to come together.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.400
And we rehearsed in America.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.450
It was our production
here in America

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:40.840
that was all put together.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.870
And then all of it
went over to Paris,

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.200
where the scenery
was all built there,

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.320
the costumes were
all built there.

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:51.030
And our whole company,
like 75 of us,

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:54.020
lived in Paris for
3 and 1/2 months,

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:56.350
and not only got
to make our show,

00:15:56.350 --> 00:16:00.190
but got to experience
the beauty and the joy

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:04.500
of being in a location together,
and building the authenticity

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.710
inside of our company.

00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:07.300
So that's how it happened.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: That sounds
absolutely fantastic.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.745
Now, some of you are from
New York, some of you

00:16:14.745 --> 00:16:15.880
are from elsewhere.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.600
Leanne, I know that you're
actually from England,

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.010
and you were in the Royal
Ballet, is that correct?

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.870
LEANNE COPE: Yeah, I'm from
a small town called Bath.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:27.842
Whenever I say that
here, they're like, what?

00:16:27.842 --> 00:16:29.720
You were born in a bath?

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.870
Don't worry.

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:33.700
It's a small town
southwest of London.

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.310
But I moved to London when I
was 11 and studied at the Royal

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.790
Ballet School, and then
danced with the Royal Ballet

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.540
Company for 12 years.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:44.469
So ballet is silent art
form, so to suddenly,

00:16:44.469 --> 00:16:46.760
after 12 years of performing
on stage, to suddenly have

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.660
to open my mouth
and speak and sing

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.480
has been terrifying, but
liberating and amazing.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.507
So yeah, this is kind the
first venture into spoken word.

00:16:57.507 --> 00:16:58.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.417
And it's your first
venture as well, correct?

00:17:01.417 --> 00:17:04.000
ROBERT FAIRCHILD: Yeah, I danced
with the New York City Ballet

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.450
in Lincoln Center, and I've
been there for 10 years.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:07.910
And that's how we met, actually.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.060
I've been in a lot of his
ballets at the company.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:13.690
And he asked me, can you sing?

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:17.280
After we did some gala
where I was tap dancing.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.950
And I said yeah, I think so.

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:24.034
And that's kind of how this
whole collaboration started

00:17:24.034 --> 00:17:24.950
between the two of us.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:30.180
And it's so liberating to
be on stage telling stories

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:32.900
for 10 years, without
opening your mouth,

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.106
and then to get the opportunity
to speak, and sing, and dance

00:17:37.106 --> 00:17:37.980
all at the same time.

00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.746
It's just the
coolest opportunity.

00:17:40.746 --> 00:17:43.370
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can you tell us
a little bit about the audition

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.990
process?

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:49.000
Because compared to the
sort of rock and roll,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.290
heavy movement shows
that have become

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.980
popularized in
recent years, this

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.860
is kind of a throwback to the
very classic days of Broadway.

00:17:57.860 --> 00:18:01.280
The big sweeping dance
numbers, it's beautiful.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.080
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON: Well,
the audition process was tough.

00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:07.730
There are many reasons to do "An
American in Paris," of course.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:12.240
The great music of
George and Ira Gershwin,

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.360
the phenomenal setting.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.190
But I think we all agreed
that unless we really

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:23.300
found the cast that could handle
the dance in the show, really

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:27.450
embody these characters,
and not just be-- there's

00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.540
a history of ballet dancers
having been on Broadway,

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.570
and there tends to be a little
bit of a sort of, oh, you know,

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:38.330
great dancers, but shame they
can't really sing or act.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:39.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.600
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON:
So we really wanted

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.670
to find true triple threats.

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:46.980
I actually call Leanne
a quadruple threat,

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:53.660
because a triple threat is a
singer, an actor, and a dancer.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.340
But she also has to be a
ballet dancer, on pointe, which

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:58.500
is a very specialized skill.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:03.010
So it made the search for
Lise particularly challenging.

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:05.860
And I also work with
the Royal Ballet a lot.

00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.482
I'm artistic associate there.

00:19:07.482 --> 00:19:09.690
And so I've known Leanne
since she was in the school.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.930
And we actually grew
up in the same county.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:15.740
I was born about an hour away
from where Leanne was born.

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:18.510
But I didn't know her
at that age, though.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:22.587
So somebody said,
we were searching,

00:19:22.587 --> 00:19:23.670
we were looking in London.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:27.230
We had an extensive
audition search

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.260
all across the United States.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.020
And somebody said,
oh, well you know,

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.510
Leanne Cope actually sung
once in the music competition.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:36.140
And she's got kind
of a nice voice.

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.760
So I grabbed her between
two shows of Swan Lake.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.760
There was a matinee and
an evening of Swan Lake.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.000
She still had her
feathers in her hair.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.822
And I kind of managed
to sort of bully her

00:19:46.822 --> 00:19:47.780
into the dressing room.

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.514
Because she said-- I said to
her, so I hear you can sing.

00:19:50.514 --> 00:19:52.680
And she's like, yeah, but
I only sing in the shower.

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.660
So I'm like, OK, well,
get in the shower.

00:19:55.660 --> 00:19:58.100
So I kind of plopped
her in there,

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.670
and she knew "The Man I
Love," and she sang "The Man

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.890
I Love," and it was very
clear in that moment

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.573
that this was somebody
who really could sing.

00:20:08.573 --> 00:20:10.250
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.830
Was that a little
nerve wracking for you?

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.720
LEANNE COPE: It was terrifying.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.540
Because I hadn't had
any singing lessons--

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:22.060
I used to sing in the choir at
school, and at the Royal Ballet

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.140
School, it was compulsory to
take another musical instrument

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.000
or to sing.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.350
So I tried piano for a year.

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.710
I was terrible.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:30.310
I tried flute.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:31.240
I was terrible.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.640
So I thought, OK,
let's just try singing.

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.910
And I really enjoyed it.

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.940
But yeah, as I hadn't
sang in front of anyone

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.050
for a very long time,
that was terrifying.

00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.050
But now, after having
200 shows under my belt,

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:48.314
it's not so bad to have to
sing in front of you guys.

00:20:48.314 --> 00:20:49.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:52.920
Well, and I did not look
up anything about the show.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:55.220
I knew nothing about anybody
before I went to see it.

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.820
And afterwards,
when they told me

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.530
that this was your first time
singing, and your first time

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.570
singing, I was blown away.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.420
I never would have guessed,
in a million years.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.000
It really was incredible.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.290
And I mean, I'm sorry that
I'm gushing a little bit here.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:17.960
But the dance, the
choreography was beautiful.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:21.440
When you were
writing this version

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.090
of the show, the
show for the stage,

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:28.900
how did you decide what kind
of dance was going to go where,

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:31.470
and how to
incorporate the ballet

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.700
in a way that made sense?

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.616
STUART OKEN: Let me say
something before Chris

00:21:34.616 --> 00:21:35.940
answers most of that question.

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.670
The movie, among all the
things it's known for,

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.190
it's known for this
how-many-minute ballet,

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:45.020
15-minute ballet at
the end of the movie.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:45.520
Famous.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:46.130
Never been done.

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.630
I think if it won
the Academy Award,

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:49.190
it won it almost
for that reason.

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.789
It was revolutionary.

00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:53.330
And when I was thinking about
how to do this, when they said,

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:55.790
do you want to do this, I
said, if we don't run straight

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:58.940
toward the ballet, instead of
being afraid of the ballet,

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.240
we can never possibly succeed.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:03.650
Because our goal is to have
an audience, even if they

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:05.250
don't know the
movie, come in and be

00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.200
surprised about what they see.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.730
But to be surprised, you've
got to see world class ballet.

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:13.280
And you needed to have ballet
not just be at the very end,

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.220
but be the language of the show.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:18.620
And honestly, it was the
most terrifying thing of all,

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.590
because who could do that?

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.290
I mean, the people you
could point to and say,

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:27.120
that person could direct this,
that person could make this.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.170
Because I didn't want
just a choreographer.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.200
I wanted someone who'd
conceive the show

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.830
in the language of movement.

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:35.800
And without Christopher,
there'd be no show.

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.160
And without people like
Robbie, and Leanne,

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.960
and the other people that
have those quadruple ,

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:44.050
skills we wouldn't have been
able to lift the show to where

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:44.550
it is.

00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:46.510
So that was in our heads.

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:48.340
Now how he figured
out what to do,

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.670
you can talk about
how you saw dance,

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.430
but that's how
Christopher's here,

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.190
and that's how the
show has come to exist.

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:58.060
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON: Well,
I think as Stuart said,

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:02.780
we wanted our story to drive
straight through to the ballet,

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:04.660
and then continue
through the ballet.

00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.790
Because in the movie, the
ballet at the end of the movie

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:15.410
is kind of a voyage through--
a sort of postcard voyage,

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:17.270
in a way, through Paris.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.940
A sort of chase.

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.240
And the ballet at
the end of our show

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.860
is the crashing together
of the various art forms

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.570
that our characters are
developing in Paris.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:31.060
So Adam's composition,
Jerry's set design.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.840
And that idea actually
came kind of late.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:37.890
Jerry is the set designer,
and Lise, of course,

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:41.550
as the ballerina, Milo
as the benefactress.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:45.660
So even though the ballet
kind of sits almost

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:51.219
as an abstract piece of dance,
with a very sensual pas de deux

00:23:51.219 --> 00:23:52.010
at the heart of it.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:58.170
So the story of the ballet, in
a way, is the romantic climax,

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:01.400
I suppose, of the coming
together of Jerry and Lise.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.190
But around it, the framework
is fairly abstract.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:09.449
Inspired by the art
of Mondrian, that's

00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:10.740
where Jerry's art kind of goes.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.800
At the beginning of
the show, the design

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.660
sort of captures some
of the more, sort of,

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:17.700
figurative sketches of his work.

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:20.570
And you can also
track his development

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:24.220
and his inspiration,
the inspiration

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.610
he gets from the artists
of the time in Paris.

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.270
But you know, it was daunting.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:32.270
The ballet was daunting.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:36.660
Because as Stuart said,
it's really, aside

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.789
from the great performances,
the one thing that

00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:40.080
really makes the movie special.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:45.340
And we wanted it to be very
much the heart of this piece.

00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.080
And then, of course, how
do you get an audience

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.090
to really believe in that?

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:53.934
Especially, perhaps, people that
may be intimidated by ballet,

00:24:53.934 --> 00:24:55.600
or have never been
to the ballet before,

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.980
or may think, oh, god,
that sounds boring.

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.730
So we begin the show with
a seven minute ballet.

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:06.510
And so it's kind of like, this
is what you're in for, folks.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.175
But it's very much-- there
are three ballets in the show.

00:25:09.175 --> 00:25:10.550
There's the opening
ballet, which

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.570
is very descriptive
of Paris emerging

00:25:13.570 --> 00:25:16.690
from this terrible, dark
period of occupation.

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:21.470
So you get these
kind of shifting,

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.220
this sort of
ever-shifting panorama

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.340
of streets with bread lines, a
collaborator being flushed out.

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.880
It's very dark.

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.820
But it moves quickly.

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:34.300
It's quite cinematic, in a way.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.370
Then the middle
ballet closes at one,

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:40.920
and it very much sort of
tells a fast-forward story

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:47.830
of Jerry and Milo, Milo sort
of wooing Jerry, and taking him

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.900
around Paris,
supporting his art.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.700
Lise rehearsing the ballet.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.160
Jerry and Lise kind of
meeting secretly at the Seine,

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.650
and then Jerry going
to a bar with Milo,

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:00.780
and it sort of, in
a way, it kind of

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:02.980
ties up all of the
stories that we've

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.440
been following through Act I.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.682
And it's very colorful, in
contrast to the first ballet,

00:26:07.682 --> 00:26:08.515
which is quite dark.

00:26:08.515 --> 00:26:13.847
It's very colorful and
dynamic, and exciting.

00:26:13.847 --> 00:26:15.180
And it's a great piece of music.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.940
The Second Rhapsody
for Piano and Orchestra

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.449
by George Gershwin.

00:26:19.449 --> 00:26:20.990
Everybody knows the
Rhapsody in Blue,

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.840
but very few people know this
fantastic second rhapsody

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.040
that he wrote.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.700
And then, of course, the
final ballet, which I

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.580
already described.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:32.940
And then, in between,
there's a big tap number,

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:37.230
there's a fantastic Broadway
style number, fantasy number

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.260
the Gallery Lafayette.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:44.190
So our show lives and breathes
with different dance forms.

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.800
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right, and
I'd love to talk about that.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.850
It feels like there's not five
minutes that goes by where

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:54.070
you guys aren't dancing.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.940
It's multiple shows every week.

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.440
And I see people switching
between character shoes,

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.750
and pointe shoes, and tap
shoes, and lots and lots

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:06.050
of costume changes as well.

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:08.000
Now, was that difficult,
having to switch

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.960
between all these
different mediums of dance?

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.210
And with the costume
changes, and mic pacs.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:16.010
Did you have to dance
with the mic pacs on?

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:17.720
LEANNE COPE: My mic
pac's in my wig.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.300
FEMALE SPEAKER: Oh!

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:21.884
How did they-- I'm just
going to accept that.

00:27:21.884 --> 00:27:22.384
Okay.

00:27:22.384 --> 00:27:23.240
LEANNE COPE: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:23.970
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON:
It's actually

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:25.632
embedded into her skull.

00:27:25.632 --> 00:27:28.965
LEANNE COPE: Now I
have a flat head.

00:27:28.965 --> 00:27:30.840
ROBERT FAIRCHILD: It's
actually really funny,

00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.630
because there's this moment
in the pas de deux, where

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.790
I come up behind
her, and there's

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.150
this kind of caressing moment.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.440
And sometimes my cheek
hits this battery pack.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.514
I'm like, she's a robot!

00:27:40.514 --> 00:27:42.402
It's so weird.

00:27:42.402 --> 00:27:45.240
Anyway.

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.810
LEANNE COPE: I found, I'd
never danced in heels before.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.770
Now I love wearing them.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:53.244
But the transition from
pointe shoes to heels,

00:27:53.244 --> 00:27:54.910
throughout the show,
is quite difficult,

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.510
just for your calves, mainly.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:27:58.280
No, I know.

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.113
LEANNE COPE: And the
girls that have to tap,

00:28:00.113 --> 00:28:01.740
as well, I don't know
how they do that.

00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:03.114
I'm lucky I didn't
have to do it.

00:28:03.114 --> 00:28:03.910
Well, I couldn't.

00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:04.870
I can't tap dance.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.960
But the girls that
go from pointe shoes,

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.270
to character shoes, to
tap shoes, and walk up

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.020
flights of stairs.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.270
MAX VON ESSEN: It's also
crazy with the amount of time

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:15.674
we have, which for some people,
at certain times, is seconds.

00:28:15.674 --> 00:28:16.590
FEMALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.120
MAX VON ESSEN: And I mean you
run off-- I'm obviously, well,

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.100
not obviously, but I don't
dance very much in the show,

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.170
and I don't have to switch
between all kinds of shoes

00:28:23.170 --> 00:28:24.586
and stuff, but a
lot of people do.

00:28:24.586 --> 00:28:26.705
But I do have some quick
changes, as we all do.

00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.705
And it was crazy, because
we obviously tried out

00:28:28.705 --> 00:28:29.630
the show in Paris.

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:33.510
And the crew, very few people
on the crew spoke English.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.320
So here, imagine now, you have
16 seconds for a quick change.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.910
You're trying to say, what
are your pants, the order,

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:39.451
and your shoes, what
needs to happen,

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:41.340
and your mic pack,
and all these things.

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.180
And then you kind of
get into a groove.

00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:44.857
But in Paris, in
France in general,

00:28:44.857 --> 00:28:47.190
things are very different,
and work laws and everything.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.020
Two days later, we'd have a
completely different crew.

00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.509
It's not like New York, where
your dresser is your dresser.

00:28:52.509 --> 00:28:54.800
So you were like, oh, good,
now I got the quick change.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.550
Then you'd run off
stage two nights later,

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.653
you're like, who are you?

00:28:58.653 --> 00:29:01.856
Who is this person who's
pulling down my pants right now?

00:29:01.856 --> 00:29:04.910
Hang on, I've not
ever said that before.

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:09.520
No, but it really
was-- no, but it really

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.880
was a crazy experience.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.940
And I always find
it so fascinating.

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:16.160
I wish you could bring
a friend, or like,

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.500
I wish my mom could come
backstage and watch from

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.635
the wings, because
that is really what's--

00:29:20.635 --> 00:29:22.468
LEANNE COPE: More going
on offstage than on.

00:29:22.468 --> 00:29:24.080
MAX VON ESSEN: Yeah,
it's so complex.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.650
And we have very little
space, especially

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:27.399
here in New York, in
the Broadway theater.

00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:32.450
And it's such a choreographed
ballet back behind the scenes,

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:33.190
as well.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:34.690
So there are a lot
of quick changes,

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:37.620
and there are a lot of going
in and out of different shoes.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:39.919
And it's pretty incredible
what's happening backstage.

00:29:39.919 --> 00:29:41.710
I really wish people
could see it sometime.

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:44.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well, it's
incredible from the audience's

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:45.580
perspective, as well.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:47.420
At least for me,
because I'm watching,

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.369
I think during the ballet,
you're wearing a yellow dress,

00:29:50.369 --> 00:29:51.910
then you switch to
a different dress,

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:53.500
and then you're back in the
yellow dress, and I'm like,

00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:55.040
wait, she just ducked down!

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:55.970
What happened?

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:56.954
It was literally magic.

00:29:56.954 --> 00:29:57.870
MAX VON ESSEN: Velcro.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:59.090
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's
how it appeared.

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.006
MAX VON ESSEN: Velcro.

00:30:00.006 --> 00:30:01.040
Velcro.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.960
LEANNE COPE: Though that
originally wasn't in the plan.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:05.460
I was originally
in the yellow dress

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:06.920
for the whole of the ballet.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:09.490
But we got to the pas de deux,
and I heard that orchestra,

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:13.540
and I thought, I don't think
this pas de deux is yellow.

00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.450
For me it didn't.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:18.640
And I think I just didn't
feel like that music said

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:19.630
yellow to me.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:23.170
But they came up with this other
costume, and I think it works.

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think it does.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.370
Really, I thought
that it-- I don't

00:30:26.370 --> 00:30:28.495
want to give it away if
you haven't gone to see it,

00:30:28.495 --> 00:30:30.340
because you should,
but no, I thought

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.260
that it worked very, very well.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.676
I know exactly
what you're saying.

00:30:32.676 --> 00:30:34.626
LEANNE COPE: And
when she is-- there's

00:30:34.626 --> 00:30:36.000
a moment where
she's in her head,

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.499
and she's thinking
she's with Jerry,

00:30:37.499 --> 00:30:39.285
and that's when she's
wearing one costume,

00:30:39.285 --> 00:30:41.910
and then when she's actually in
the ballet, she's in the other.

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:44.470
So it kind of makes
sense to have the change.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.320
But yeah, that took a
lot of workshopping,

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.640
that costume change.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.790
FEMALE SPEAKER:
It was impressive.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:57.870
So let's talk for a second
about the ensemble, if we could.

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:02.070
So you are-- I
learned a word today.

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:04.630
It's called track.

00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:06.510
It's called track.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.680
I guess it's a phrase.

00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.380
I don't know.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.370
I learned a thing.

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.760
I'm learning new things
every day here at Google.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.820
So explain to me and to
everyone else, what is a track,

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:20.620
and what does that mean for a
person who's in the ensemble?

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.870
WILL BURTON: You know, a
track's difficult to explain,

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.120
and we as actors, when
we're trying to tell people

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.880
about our job, use the word like
everyone knows what it means,

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.280
but most people outside theater
don't know what it means.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.530
And so what it is, as
an ensemble member,

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:38.240
I think it-- I play a
bunch of different parts

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.150
as the show goes on.

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:45.380
And that route through
the show is my track.

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:50.000
So there are people who, just
like I cover Max and I cover

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.160
Brandon, the guy who
was supposed to be here,

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.617
their tracks, I
know exactly what

00:31:55.617 --> 00:31:57.200
they do throughout
the show, including

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.900
all the backstage
choreography, to make

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.525
sure I don't get hit
by anything that's

00:32:00.525 --> 00:32:02.860
flying in and out of the wings.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.530
So a track just describes my
route from the top of the show

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.710
to the end of the show.

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:09.800
And there are, I guess,
four other people

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:13.610
in the show that know my track.

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:15.110
And we have swings
who are offstage,

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:17.320
who don't do the
show every night,

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:21.030
who know multiple, like
four, five, six tracks,

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.940
so that on any given night, if
someone's in, someone's out,

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.850
this person can go
into this track.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:29.600
If he's out, I go
into his track,

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.974
another guy goes into my track.

00:32:30.974 --> 00:32:32.390
So that's the
meaning of the word.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:33.400
MAX VON ESSEN: Is that
how it became swing?

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.609
Like, you swing into a track?

00:32:34.609 --> 00:32:35.316
Do you guys know?

00:32:35.316 --> 00:32:36.860
Is that why you
call them a swing?

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.030
FEMALE SPEAKER: I was
just going to ask that,

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:39.196
because that's another word.

00:32:39.196 --> 00:32:43.080
MAX VON ESSEN: Swing is an
offstage ensemble member,

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.727
who's a swing, and covers, like
Will said, five, six, seven--

00:32:46.727 --> 00:32:48.810
and we have swings now who
are learning even more,

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.060
because it's a difficult show.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:52.490
And there injuries, or
people just get sick,

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:53.850
and you need a night off.

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:55.892
And we've had a lot of
people swinging in and out

00:32:55.892 --> 00:32:57.683
of the show, because
it is a difficult show

00:32:57.683 --> 00:32:58.420
for the ensemble.

00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.640
WILL BURTON: And that
job, I have to say,

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.764
really is truly incredible.

00:33:00.764 --> 00:33:03.740
Because in this
show in particular,

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:08.480
the tracks are very complex,
because we, as the ensemble,

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.030
we're moving a lot of the sets
into place and out of place,

00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.980
and there's little
spikes on the stage

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.020
everywhere for all
of our little things,

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:19.260
and we have these big screens
that are projected onto,

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.770
like perfectly projected
onto these screens,

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.420
so if they're not
in the right place,

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.980
the projections are
all whacked out.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:31.060
So the swings, their job is
just insanely complicated,

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:33.770
and I don't know how they
do it as well as they do.

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:35.070
But we have amazing swings.

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:36.736
JILL PAICE: We call
them the Navy SEALs.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:41.880
STUART OKEN: Our
company on stage is 25,

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:44.380
but our company is 35.

00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.940
So what the audience
doesn't necessarily know

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.200
is that we really
do need 35 people

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:54.710
to be able to do a show with
25 people, eight times a week,

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:56.240
for an extended period of time.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.830
So we're all part
of the same company,

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.539
but different people
do different things.

00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:00.330
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:01.710
Well, I'm going
to touch on that.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:03.200
Just to remind
everybody, there's

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.554
microphones on
either aisle here.

00:34:05.554 --> 00:34:07.970
If you have any questions,
feel free to line up over there

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:11.889
and we'll give you a point
when it's your turn to talk.

00:34:11.889 --> 00:34:16.840
So speaking of that, you have
this very, very large Broadway

00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.929
family.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.179
While I was hanging out
with you guys before,

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.889
you were telling me
about birthday cakes,

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:27.580
and how everyone buys
each other birthday cakes.

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:30.789
Do you have any fun
backstage stories

00:34:30.789 --> 00:34:32.517
that you could share with us?

00:34:32.517 --> 00:34:33.600
MAX VON ESSEN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:37.058 --> 00:34:39.030
JILL PAICE: I never go!

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.459
ROBERT FAIRCHILD:
You hosted one!

00:34:40.459 --> 00:34:41.500
JILL PAICE: I hosted one.

00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:42.155
Yeah, we do.

00:34:42.155 --> 00:34:44.030
I think similar to
probably how you guys have

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.719
these kinds of
things, we do what's

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:48.280
called SNOB, which is
Saturday Night On Broadway.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:52.730
And after the second show, we
will stay after and maybe have

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:56.139
drinks and pizza, and we
even had one of our producers

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:59.530
host the most amazing sort
of southern comfort food one.

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.570
And it's just a chance
for us to sort of unwind.

00:35:01.570 --> 00:35:03.319
Yes, we still have a
matinee the next day,

00:35:03.319 --> 00:35:05.590
but it sort of gives you
something to look forward to.

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:08.240
Like you'll be on stage in the
middle of a costume change,

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.274
and you'll be like, vodka!

00:35:12.274 --> 00:35:13.190
It'll get you through.

00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:15.254
WILL BURTON: Our
day off is Monday.

00:35:15.254 --> 00:35:16.670
So that's why it's
Saturday night.

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:19.770
Our day off is Monday, and so
we just have one show Sunday,

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:22.510
but by the second
show on Saturday,

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.560
generally we're pretty tired.

00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.200
So that's why SNOB exists.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.150
MAX VON ESSEN: I do
remember, in Paris, too,

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:28.640
we had a lot of
space in the wings,

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.740
which is very rare on Broadway.

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:30.656
We don't have it here.

00:35:30.656 --> 00:35:32.487
But the Parisian
crew, they would like,

00:35:32.487 --> 00:35:33.320
they got so into it.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.962
They learned the choreography.

00:35:34.962 --> 00:35:35.920
They would dance along.

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.294
While we be in a
number on stage,

00:35:37.294 --> 00:35:39.086
you'd see them in the
wings, dancing along.

00:35:39.086 --> 00:35:40.669
We don't have that
kind of space here,

00:35:40.669 --> 00:35:42.913
and also, the New York
crew is a little different.

00:35:42.913 --> 00:35:45.754
I don't imagine these
guys dancing along.

00:35:45.754 --> 00:35:47.170
ROBERT FAIRCHILD:
That's not true.

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:47.530
MAX VON ESSEN: Really?

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.321
ROBERT FAIRCHILD: Oh,
Stairway To Paradise.

00:35:49.321 --> 00:35:50.940
MAX VON ESSEN: Tell me!

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.750
ROBERT FAIRCHILD: We
have this new stage

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:54.170
manager, her name's Julia.

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:58.399
And she's just in between
all the furniture backstage,

00:35:58.399 --> 00:35:59.940
just doing this
interpretive dancing.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.555
It's pretty-- it's a sight.

00:36:01.555 --> 00:36:02.680
STUART OKEN: She's amazing.

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.380
She's a lot of fun.

00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:04.980
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON: I
actually only met her.

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:06.180
She'd been on the
show for a while,

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.638
because I was away
over the summer.

00:36:07.638 --> 00:36:10.270
Because as the director,
you do actually

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:14.760
end up suffering serious
FOMO, because you

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.970
get so attached to your
family, and you build the show,

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:21.120
and you really are Big Daddy,
you're taking care of everyone,

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.720
and making sure
that they're giving

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.360
a good-- a great performance.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.760
And then you leave.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.460
And they all get to
stay behind and have

00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:30.510
Saturday Night On Broadway.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:33.587
And I follow it on
Facebook from afar.

00:36:33.587 --> 00:36:35.420
But the first time I
met Julia, I came back,

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.130
and I walked into the
office, and she just

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:40.504
goes, what have you done?

00:36:40.504 --> 00:36:41.920
And I wasn't sure
whether that was

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.200
a good thing or a bad thing.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.500
And then she launched into, this
is the most amazingly complex

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.750
show that I've ever worked on.

00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:52.640
Because really, for the
crew and the stage manager,

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.930
the calling of the show
is a feat of virtuosity.

00:36:55.930 --> 00:37:00.070
I mean, every cue has to be
absolutely bang on, mostly

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:00.770
for safety.

00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:04.070
I mean, we have so much scenery
in our show, and most of it

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:05.620
moves around on deck.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.980
Traditionally, Broadway
shows have a lot of tracks,

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.270
and trucks that kind of
track on, and track off.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.310
MAX VON ESSEN: Different tracks.

00:37:11.310 --> 00:37:11.630
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON:
Different kind.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:13.130
MAX VON ESSEN: Like
an actual track.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.192
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON:
Like a railroad track.

00:37:15.192 --> 00:37:17.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you
for qualifying that for me.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.483
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON: Our
show, one of the reasons

00:37:19.483 --> 00:37:23.450
why it feels so dancey is
because the scenery dances

00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:24.070
as well.

00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:28.870
I mean, the side
walls of the building

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:35.200
are where the wings-- where
the side stage space ends.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:38.646
And the back wall, you know,
our BP, our back plastic,

00:37:38.646 --> 00:37:41.020
which is the backdrop, is
right up against the back wall.

00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.961
So there's very,
very little space

00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:44.460
in the wings for
all of the scenery,

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.300
and it gets-- so
it comes offstage,

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.740
it gets hooked on
to the big chains,

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.710
and then winched up so that
other pieces can come in.

00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:54.660
Meanwhile, you've got
dancers and actors

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:58.210
zipping around and
changing costumes.

00:37:58.210 --> 00:38:01.770
So their job, I think,
is highly stressful.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:04.987
It's sort of like NASA mission
control back there every night.

00:38:04.987 --> 00:38:06.570
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
it looks like we

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:09.000
have a question over here.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.080
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you
so much for being here.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:13.110
As a native New Yorker,
it's so exciting for me

00:38:13.110 --> 00:38:17.890
to get front row seats to a
Broadway show, so thank you.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.500
So I'm really curious
about the underlying story.

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:24.450
It seems to be a little bit in
the background of World War II,

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:27.170
and the Jewish female
who comes out of hiding.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:30.960
So I'm curious, maybe,
how was that received back

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:35.150
when it was a movie decades ago,
versus how it was received now,

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.660
both in, maybe, the
States or in Paris.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.670
I'm also curious if any of you
did any reflection or studies

00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:44.370
to relate to that
period of time,

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:47.782
and maybe for the
character, I forget

00:38:47.782 --> 00:38:50.600
the character's name, but the
Jewish female who comes out

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.680
of hiding.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.060
And lastly, if anybody
ever reached out to you

00:38:54.060 --> 00:38:57.890
to share their story, or to say,
wow, this really spoke to me,

00:38:57.890 --> 00:39:01.110
or it was difficult for me
to watch this, or just really

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:02.841
curious about that story line.

00:39:02.841 --> 00:39:04.840
MAX VON ESSEN: Chris, do
want to tell them first

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.910
how you went from the
movie, and updated the--

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.493
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON:
Sure, yeah sure.

00:39:08.493 --> 00:39:13.430
So, I mean, the movie touches
on and suggests that this

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:15.300
is right after the war.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.940
But in 1952, I
think it was, well,

00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:21.940
it was obviously still very
raw, and very difficult

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:29.190
to place it into a rich and
realistic historical context.

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:31.660
So one of the things that was,
I think, appealing to Craig

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:35.520
Lucas, our writer, when we
were approached to do this,

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:39.490
and we all agreed that there was
no point in trying to recreate

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:41.780
this beautiful movie on stage.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:45.660
It was a moment in time,
and it is what it is,

00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.590
and the stars were the
great stars of their time,

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:50.830
and it was our
responsibility to find

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:55.130
the new great stars of
our time, and to perhaps

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:59.360
place this story in a
more accurate historical--

00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.780
within a more accurate
historical context.

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:10.490
So Craig took it back to sort
of the eve of the liberation,

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:13.220
or just after the
liberation of Paris.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:20.240
And I think he really relished
in the opportunity to flesh

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.490
out these characters.

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:25.390
It's still sort of a similar
structure, a character

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.320
structure, as the movie.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:33.680
But obviously, when
dealing with Lise Dassin,

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:36.290
Lise Dassin in
our production has

00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:40.870
been in hiding for the
duration of the occupation,

00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:45.180
and the show opens,
really, with her first day

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.635
back out on the
streets of Paris.

00:40:47.635 --> 00:40:50.260
STUART OKEN: It's worth saying,
she wasn't Jewish in the movie.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.530
CHRISTOPHER
WHEELDON: She wasn't.

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.070
STUART OKEN: So that
was something that--

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:53.730
AUDIENCE: The character wasn't?

00:40:53.730 --> 00:40:54.890
STUART OKEN: The character
was not Jewish in the movie.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:55.600
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON:
It was suggested

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.700
that she was in hiding, but
because her parents were

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:58.450
in the resistance.

00:40:58.450 --> 00:40:59.533
STUART OKEN: That's right.

00:40:59.533 --> 00:41:00.872
AUDIENCE: Oh, fascinating.

00:41:00.872 --> 00:41:02.330
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON:
Yeah, it was.

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:04.540
We were able to go a
lot further with that.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.289
STUART OKEN: There's
some belief, I think,

00:41:06.289 --> 00:41:08.650
that in 1950, when they made
the movie, some of these--

00:41:08.650 --> 00:41:10.600
it was a little too
close to the war.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.190
And there's so much there that
suggests something deeper,

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:16.760
but they stayed away from it.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:20.360
So Craig making the
choice to say, well, let's

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.610
just put her there.

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:23.570
Now she's got a reason
for living in hiding.

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:26.160
Now there's secrets
that can't be exposed,

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.110
so when Jerry learns
about her history,

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:30.260
everything makes sense.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:33.450
But he doesn't know about
her, and those are things

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:34.980
that really were differences.

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:38.740
The big one is, you
said, moving from 1950

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.870
to the moment the war ended.

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:45.250
So the impact on every character
really is the war, right?

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:49.080
It's about a lot of people
coming out of a very dark time,

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.580
and actually, you
said this earlier,

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.120
I think, Leanne,
or somebody did,

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.080
that eventually, everyone
develops a sense of empathy

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.580
for everybody else.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.580
They kind of get why they're all
in this place at the same time.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.180
And the right things do happen.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:08.200
But there's a lot of confusion
when you come out of a war.

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.970
JILL PAICE: And I
think for us as actors,

00:42:09.970 --> 00:42:12.980
getting to live in Paris for
two months, and so much of Paris

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:15.610
is preserved as it
was back in that time.

00:42:15.610 --> 00:42:19.070
So to see the very locations,
the Galleries Lafayette,

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.100
the Ritz, Montmartre, things
that we reference in our show,

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:23.370
to go and see them.

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:26.820
We also happened to be there
when the Musee Carnavalet was

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:30.240
doing this amazing photography
exhibit on the liberation

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.360
and on the resistance fighters.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.600
So we all went, all of us,
and spent a day there, sort

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.550
of absorbing this experience.

00:42:39.550 --> 00:42:42.330
And I think more than
anything, being there

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:46.160
made sure that we didn't make a
character of their experience.

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:48.420
So it became very real to us.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.806
And we were very well received
by the French audiences, which,

00:42:51.806 --> 00:42:54.180
we weren't sure when we went
there what it would be like.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:57.290
And our first sort of
run through in front

00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:00.330
of an invited audience was
flabbergasting, because they

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:01.240
were on their feet.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.260
And you look over, and the crew
were clapping in the wings.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.620
And we just felt so
embraced by this culture

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:08.620
and by these people.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:11.950
I have a real
affection for them now.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:13.627
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:13.627 --> 00:43:14.710
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:15.670
A question over here?

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:16.370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:17.720
I loved this show.

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:19.890
It was one of my favorite
shows I've ever seen.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:21.520
And I also love the ballet.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.440
I actually was at Lincoln
Center last night.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.210
And I really care about
the ballet as an art form,

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:30.110
and I care about the fact
that the audience is aging.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:32.031
And one of my hopes
for the show would

00:43:32.031 --> 00:43:33.530
be, seeing how
popular it is, and it

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:36.491
won the Tony, is that it can
expand the exposure that ballet

00:43:36.491 --> 00:43:38.115
is getting with the
general population,

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:42.340
and perhaps raise the profile
and attendance of the ballet.

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.930
And I just wonder
if that's something

00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:46.260
you guys have talked about,
if you planned for that,

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.780
if there's anything.

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:49.363
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON:
I think, I mean,

00:43:49.363 --> 00:43:54.550
it was certainly a
very attractive reason

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:59.450
to do this show, for me,
was to put some real ballet

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:03.400
on Broadway, and put
it out for an audience

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:06.050
that perhaps hasn't had the
opportunity to go to the ballet

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:07.800
before, or as I said
before, may have

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.840
some sort of preconceived
notion that it's

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:12.010
stuffy or old fashioned.

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:17.110
I have to say that for
me, the joy and confidence

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:20.140
that I get from
hearing the biggest

00:44:20.140 --> 00:44:21.860
ovation of the
night, every night,

00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.390
on Broadway, for a non-ballet
audience, be for the ballet,

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:27.660
and hear the comments of
the audience as they leave.

00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:30.120
Sometimes I lurk,
which can be dangerous,

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.840
because sometimes you
hear bad things, too.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.763
But hearing people
say, oh, you know,

00:44:35.763 --> 00:44:37.596
I didn't know ballet
could be that exciting.

00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:42.847
Or just having notes
left for me saying,

00:44:42.847 --> 00:44:45.430
we're really excited to come see
you work at the New York City

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:48.700
Ballet, or go see the ballet
at American Ballet Theater.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.510
It's really encouraging.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:52.090
And I think we're lucky.

00:44:52.090 --> 00:44:54.890
I think we're part
of a generation where

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.200
the audience for ballet
is being reinvigorated.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.990
There are, now,
young choreographers

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:02.260
who are excited about
making dynamic ballet again.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:08.090
And ballet that focuses
on the human condition

00:45:08.090 --> 00:45:11.410
and a connection between people.

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:15.800
It went through a period of
this sort of intensely physical,

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.240
it became very much about
what the body could do.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.160
And now I think
it's veering back

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:27.114
towards a more narrative base,
which is very, very exciting.

00:45:27.114 --> 00:45:28.530
And particularly
here in New York,

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:30.220
I think [? our ballet ?]
incentive

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.652
has a lot of really, really
exciting new work going on.

00:45:32.652 --> 00:45:34.110
AUDIENCE: It would
be neat if there

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:36.872
was a promotion for the ballet,
for the audience as they

00:45:36.872 --> 00:45:38.080
leave your show or something.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:38.800
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON: Yeah.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:41.110
LEANNE COPE: We were at
the Broadway flea market

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:42.792
the other day, and
this guy came up.

00:45:42.792 --> 00:45:45.292
We were signing posters, and
this guy came up, and was like,

00:45:45.292 --> 00:45:48.410
I hate ballet, I hate opera.

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:50.990
And I just didn't know
what he was going to say.

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:54.184
He was quite scary, the
way he came up to us.

00:45:54.184 --> 00:45:55.475
ROBERT FAIRCHILD: I hate opera.

00:45:55.475 --> 00:45:56.840
I hate classical everything.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.410
LEANNE COPE: But
I love your show.

00:45:58.410 --> 00:46:01.412
And we're like,
oh, thank goodness.

00:46:01.412 --> 00:46:05.280
But like Chris said, at
the end of the ballet,

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:09.340
I still, every
night, kind of feel

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:12.910
very emotional that the audience
is receiving ballet that way.

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:15.700
And I genuinely do think
that people are like,

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:17.610
oh, OK, I can give
this a go now.

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:19.930
Maybe I will take a trip
up to Lincoln Center.

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:24.570
And vice versa, because I think
maybe a ballet fan wouldn't

00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:26.800
necessarily come
and see a musical,

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:29.570
because they might
think it's not for them.

00:46:29.570 --> 00:46:31.930
But then, knowing that
it's Christopher Wheeldon

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:34.260
choreography, they'll
come down to see the show,

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:36.051
and then they'll want
to see more musicals.

00:46:36.051 --> 00:46:38.410
So I think it works
both ways, actually.

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:40.807
I'm hoping it will.

00:46:40.807 --> 00:46:42.890
FEMALE SPEAKER: I think
we have time for one more.

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:44.889
Over here.

00:46:44.889 --> 00:46:45.430
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:48.430
My question is also about
ballet, and specifically

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:50.990
for Christopher and Robert.

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:53.010
I'm a subscriber at
the NYCB, and I've

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:54.700
been familiar with
your work for years.

00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.700
And I'd love to hear you
talk a little bit about

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:59.800
how your experiences
with the NYCB

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.740
informed your work
with the show,

00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:04.172
and maybe what the
differences and the challenges

00:47:04.172 --> 00:47:05.880
are that you face
working in pure ballet,

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:06.969
versus a Broadway show.

00:47:06.969 --> 00:47:09.260
CHRISTOPHER WHEELDON: Well,
actually, it's interesting.

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:13.030
I think my experiences working
with the New York City Ballet

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:17.240
as a dancer and a choreographer,
and also with the Royal Ballet,

00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:21.570
in our show, for me, it's
almost the coming together

00:47:21.570 --> 00:47:27.320
of my two balletic
worlds, my upbringing,

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:31.620
my training in London, in
sort of a more narrative based

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:32.200
works.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:34.491
You know, the Royal Ballet
are famous for the big story

00:47:34.491 --> 00:47:35.510
ballets.

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:38.990
And for such a small
country, we actually

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:44.160
had two of the great, great
narrative ballet choreographers

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.680
that ever lived, Sir Frederick
Ashton and Sir Kenneth

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.470
MacMillan, creating works
for the Royal Ballet.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:53.656
So I grew up in that
world, like Leanne,

00:47:53.656 --> 00:47:55.030
and then I moved
to New York when

00:47:55.030 --> 00:47:57.510
I was 19 because I wanted
something different.

00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:01.700
And I'd had a chance to dance in
a ballet by George Balanchine.

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.110
And it was the first
time, it was liberating.

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:07.800
It was for my school
performance in London.

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.570
Suddenly I was just
kind of thrust out

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:14.800
onto the stage, and just
really devouring space,

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.645
and it was the music
that was driving me.

00:48:17.645 --> 00:48:18.520
There wasn't a story.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.490
It was just really purely about
sort of an emotional response

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:22.740
to music.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:26.610
So that encouraged me
to move to New York,

00:48:26.610 --> 00:48:29.430
and I built my
choreographic career

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:32.550
really learning from the inside
of these great Balanchine

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:35.910
and Robbins works, and the
works also of Jerome Robbins.

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:40.240
So having the chance to kind of
bring those two worlds together

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:44.720
and put them on the stage
in this beautiful show,

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:46.510
I feel like I was
able to really draw

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:49.450
from both of those experiences.

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:56.390
ROBERT FAIRCHILD: I
feel like for me, it's

00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:59.120
been whar-- I've had
the opportunity three

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:02.472
times in the past two weeks to
go dance back with the New York

00:49:02.472 --> 00:49:04.430
City Ballet, because that
was kind of the deal.

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:07.010
My boss said, well, I'll let
you go on Broadway for a year

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.660
if you come back and dance
for me every once in awhile.

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:13.760
So I had three
shows, and honestly,

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:18.110
what I've learned from doing
Broadway and this show,

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:22.510
and telling stories,
has informed everything

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:24.720
about my dancing in a
completely different way.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:28.380
I go back on that stage,
and my thought process

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:30.140
is completely different.

00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:31.860
Whether there's a
story or there's not,

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:33.670
there's something
happening in my brain.

00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.160
There's something
being told, and I

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:40.140
think that's why ballet can
become unrelatable sometimes,

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:43.070
is because people
don't relate themselves

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:45.660
to who they are in
the moment, as people,

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.110
and put that into their dancing.

00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:52.120
And when we get to
do that in the show,

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:55.120
the dance is a real part
of the storytelling.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:00.610
It's these people, when words
can't describe your feeling,

00:50:00.610 --> 00:50:03.470
song can't describe your
feeling, but movement does.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:06.260
And that's something
so incredible to get

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.990
to learn through this
show, and then, to bring

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:12.800
that back to New York
City Ballet, and just

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.910
kind of permeate that world
with what we're doing,

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:17.114
is just so incredible.

00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:18.280
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.905
I'm looking forward
to seeing the show,

00:50:19.905 --> 00:50:22.479
and I'm looking forward to
having you back in ballet.

00:50:22.479 --> 00:50:23.520
STUART OKEN: Not so fast!

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.640
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
this has been fantastic.

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:32.180
I've been, personally,
very excited.

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.971
Everyone here in the
audience has been very

00:50:33.971 --> 00:50:35.680
excited to have you guys here.

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.720
