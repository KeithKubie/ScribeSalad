Speaker 1:          00:00          How long have you been doing this?

Speaker 2:          00:02          I mean like for TV, for animal planet. Uh, three years I guess, but to go on x. The reason I got into that and doing it for TV is because I've been doing it like my whole life. I grew up in Zimbabwe. My mom was a bush pilot, so when we weren't on Safari, she was like flying us these remote place in the middle of Bush and we were going out on safari and like, as long as I can remember, this has been what I do

Speaker 1:          00:25          now. When you go on Safari, you and those open jeeps walking safaris. Whoa. Yeah. What are you doing?

Speaker 2:          00:33          Uh, we take a four, five, eight and elephant gun. Put it on your shoulder.

Speaker 1:          00:38          Walking Safari. God Damn Man. Only during the day, right. CanNot move at night. And what do you do when you're confronted? Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:45          I mean, I've had some pretty close calls. Uh, my wife Jess is here with me. I saved her from a hippo.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Oh yeah. We've had some pretty close calls. Fuck man. One of my scariest pictures I ever saw was this guy, this African guy running down the street and a hippo is chasing them and you look at the size of the hippo and you're like, good Christ. That thing is huge

Speaker 2:          01:04          there, Joe. They're the scariest animals on earth, like interacting with the hippopotamus there. So erratic. They're so unpredictable. If they feel threatened at all, I mean, yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:13          they're just, this video is fucking bananas. Oh yeah. This guy's on a row, a motor boat, and the hippo is swimming after him like a torpedo. So this is where I'm from. This is in Bob Way. Really? Yeah. So it was this common that they swim that fast.

Speaker 2:          01:28          They can move. I mean this, that this is uncommon to have one chase the boat and come that close. But uh,

Speaker 1:          01:33          fucking big it is, man. Yeah. So when you've had these close encounters, what do you do? You shoot at the air, shoot at the ground, scare him away.

Speaker 2:          01:43          Fortunately I've, I've never had to put an animal down, but I know people that have,

Speaker 1:          01:47          does your picture look at? That's it. That's the one. What in the fuck, how fast is that big bastard run?

Speaker 2:          01:54          Uh, I don't know. You'd have to look up the exact speed, but definitely at top speed. Definitely faster than humans. But they don't have the maneuverability, you know, you can kind of duck and dodge behind.

Speaker 1:          02:02          They're just don't run in a straight line. Exactly. Exactly. Fuck that. 20 miles. Miles 19 yeah. Yeah. What does a person run? A Rhino runs 31 Jesus Christ. Jesus. A fucking Cheetah convert 75 miles an hour. I thought it was like 50. Ah, fuck yeah. Stephanie, five crocodiles almost as fast as the fucking hippo. Yeah, they're, they're odd miles an hour for a croc. Fuck that. Let's be for sprinters around 2122 maybe. That's a stain. Yeah. That's also a sprinter. [inaudible] sprinter, doughy white guy like us. Fuck Jesus Christ. So you just, if you're chased by a hippo, is there a move that you do? Do you just have to go left and right and Zigzag? Yeah, maneuverability get. So like when we got chased, we got behind a termite mound and then it kept going straight. Like, you know, hiding behind termites now thinks that safety like termites. Oh my God, dude, that's so crazy.
