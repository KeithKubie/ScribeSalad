- I didn't get the job.

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:05.104
- In some countries, no
one's ever had a job.

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:05.772
 Perspective.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.373 line:0%
- Stop!

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.675
 You've participated
 in a trolling cliche.

00:00:09.708 --> 00:00:12.045
 Have some perspective.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.113 align:start size:88% position:13%
 By using this attack
 of equivalency,

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:18.251
 a wise and sagely troll like
 you can look down from on high

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:22.121 size:88% position:44%
 and neg away any discussion
 you don't see as important.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.790 size:88% position:44%
 Think reality TV's
 rotting our brains?

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.659 align:start position:0%
 Well, don't forget about
 starving children in Somalia.

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:28.661 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Did you just say
 children in Somalia?

00:00:28.694 --> 00:00:31.130 align:start position:0%
 Well, you shouldn't compare
 that to the conflict

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:31.964
 in East Timor.

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.667 size:84% position:42%
  East Timor? Have
  some perspective.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.604
 The sun will someday expand
 and engulf our entire planet.

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:40.840 size:88% position:44%
 Well, this kind of logic is
 the perfect way to ensure

00:00:40.873 --> 00:00:43.409 align:start size:88% position:13%
that we never talk about
anything ever again,

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:45.478 align:start position:0%
  which, actually, now that
  we're thinking of it,

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:49.182 align:start position:0%
it's a great idea, specifically
as it pertains to you.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.817 align:start size:88% position:13%
 You don't care
 about these issues.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.318 size:88% position:44%
 You care about being right.

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:54.821 align:start position:0%
 People are capable of
 being upset about more than

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:56.422
 one thing at a time.

00:00:56.455 --> 00:00:59.158 size:84% position:42%
  For example, the person
  you're watching right now

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.594
is upset about world
hunger, climate change,

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:05.198 size:84% position:42%
  and the fact that your
  mother gave birth to you.
