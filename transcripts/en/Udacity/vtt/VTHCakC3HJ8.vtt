00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.160
We can take this a bit farther.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.511
Right now the location preference allows
us to enter a string of arbitrary size.

00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:07.426
We'd like to make it so

00:00:07.426 --> 00:00:11.150
that the preference is at least three
characters before accepting input.

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.370
The default preference
doesn't allow us to do that.

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:17.370
We're going to create
a custom preference view.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.300
A custom preference view is similar
in construction to any other

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.970
custom view in Android.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.278
So, consider this an introduction
to creating custom views.

00:00:25.278 --> 00:00:28.712
A custom preference view can both
change the way the preference

00:00:28.712 --> 00:00:32.919
is presented in the list, what happens
when it is clicked, and in this case,

00:00:32.919 --> 00:00:37.800
the way the alert dialog behaves that is
used to back the edit text preference.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.560
We're going to give our custom
view a custom attribute for

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.318
the minimum length of the location.

00:00:42.318 --> 00:00:45.383
Mostly because custom
attributes are cool.

00:00:45.383 --> 00:00:47.390
So let's start there.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.350
We'll create a new values
file called attrs.xml.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.920
We build custom attributes using
the declare-styleable tag.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.460
Each attribute in declare-styleable
has a name and a format.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.070
The next thing to do is to create our
custom edit text preference by creating

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.280
a new class that extends
edit text preference.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.380
And that new class will create
a constructor that uses a context and

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.830
an attribute set.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.510
That attribute set is what we use to
read the value of our custom attribute.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.634
We call
context.gettheme.obtainStyledAttributes

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:22.390
passing in this value.
