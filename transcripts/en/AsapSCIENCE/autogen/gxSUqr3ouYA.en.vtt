00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 Have you ever wondered about the relationship between a number 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.920
 Drowned in swimming pools every year 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.080
 How many Nicolas Cage films in the same year? 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.140
 Or what about a 99.26% relationship between divorce rates in Maine, 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.620
 And between the rate of individual consumption of industrial fertilizers? 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.860
 Or the 99.79% link between spending on science, space and technology 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.180
 And the number of suicide bombers hanging, or suffocation, or suffocation? 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.400
 The mere existence of a link of a kind between two events does not mean 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.980
 That one reason for the other. 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.320
 This assumption is a logical fallacy. 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.060
 We are also deceived by such headlines 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.680
 "Those who have sex more are making more money" 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.920
 Unfortunately, "this" does not always equate to "that". 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.680
 Also, there seems to be no potential relationship between cheese consumption, 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.220
 And the number of dead suffocated under the quilt of their family. 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.480
 However, this is sometimes unclear. 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.060
 Various studies have found that women who live in menopause and follow hormone therapy 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.020
 They are less likely to have heart disease. 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.840
 Making doctors believe that hormone therapy may protect against heart disease. 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.100
 But when a sample of women is subjected to a controlled randomized trial 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.520
 He found that hormone therapy actually doubles the risk of heart disease. 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.640
 Finally, when re-analyzing the original data, they find 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.620
 That women undergoing hormone therapy are of the social class, 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.160
 They practice a healthy diet and exercise. 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.600
 This was the real reason for their low risk of heart disease. 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.260
 In another case, it was found that those who slept at night under the lights in their childhood, more prone to problems of myopia. 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.100
 But in fact there is a strong correlation between parents' short-sightedness 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.940
 And the presence of the same symptoms in the child, the fact that the parents are short-sighted more inclined 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.900
 To leave the lights of their children's rooms lit. 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.540
 These are examples of the "hidden or third variable" when we find that "A" does not cause "B" 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.900
 But we find "C" causing them together. 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.320
 It's like talking about people with lung cancer 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.680
 "Well, they all have lighters in their pockets 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.820
 Therefore, lighters must cause cancer " 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.080
 Without realizing that smoking is a dispersed or hidden variable. 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.040
 Scientists are doing their best in their studies to avoid this. 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.440
 But the situation is getting worse when the media exploit these potential random relationships. 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.240
 In a study about the relationship of chocolate to weight loss was found 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.200
 The ability of scientific reports to raise curiosity and interest. 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.160
 A PhD in microbiology has done a real clinical trial 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.420
 In which participants were grouped into three groups. 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.480
 The low calorie diet team, the low-calorie diet team with a piece of chocolate (weighing 42.5 grams) 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.860
 The third team retained its usual protection. 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.140
 Three weeks later, the chocolate team was the biggest weight loser 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.000
 But journalists use science badly. 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.460
 The author tested 15 participants and studied 18 different measures, including weight loss 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.340
 Cholesterol, sleep nature, blood pressure, happiness ... etc. 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.460
 When you study a small number of people while measuring a large number of things 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.020
 This ensures that you obtain meaningful statistical results 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.440
 A topic that we have addressed in a fun clip on our Veritasium channel if you would like to see it. 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.860
 The result can easily vary 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.420
 Such as chocolates are associated with lower blood pressure, for example. 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.380
 And if the study was reviewed by other scientists 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.320
 These results can then be announced. 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.880
 Instead, it was published in a magazine worth 600 euros 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.000
 Fabricated the name of a false institute 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.300
 "Institute of Diet and Health". 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.420
 He then sent a press release to dozens of media bulletins. 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.500
 In a nutshell, the headline "Be graceful with chocolate" is the front page 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.980
 However, we can not get rid of the bond altogether. 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.900
 Related evidence is an important part of science 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.140
 Because double blind trials are not always possible and immoral. 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.060
 Sometimes the link is the most appropriate guide available 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.640
 When each causal relationship is systematically investigated. 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.620
 Linking can be used as an effective tool for assessing cause-effect relationships 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.540
 And to develop more and more science. 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.300
 Tyler Vigen is very thankful to tell us his plan for these important connections 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.940
 You can see his site or his book "False Interconnections" for more specific examples. 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.340
