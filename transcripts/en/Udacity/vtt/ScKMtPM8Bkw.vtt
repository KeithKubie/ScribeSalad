We just looked at the polynomial x squared plus 8x plus15. But what if I change

00:00:04.888 --> 00:00:09.771
this very slightly. Instead, I'd like us to look at x squared minus 8x plus 15.

00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:14.572
Let's see if we can factor this. As before, I'm going to say that this is equal

00:00:14.572 --> 00:00:19.370
to the product of two binomials. One of which is x plus some number a, and the

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.266
other of which is x plus some number b. In this case, what do a and b need to

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:28.357
multiply to equal. And what do they need to add to equal?
