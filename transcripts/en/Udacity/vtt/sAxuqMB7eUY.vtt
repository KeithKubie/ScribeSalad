00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.830
So, one last thing I would like to teach you today

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.160
is called template inheritance. Now, we can make this quite complex,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.080
but for our purposes we're just going to do this simple thing

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.400
that'll make our templates much easier to use. If you notice on

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.350
a web page, let's draw one, most web pages have, you

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.190
know, a title and a footer. And then they have some

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.840
content in the middle. Now this might be the page slash.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.040
And then you might have another page that looks identical. You know,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.515
maybe this is the slash like about page. It also has a

00:00:27.515 --> 00:00:32.170
title. It also has a footer. The same title and the same

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.470
footer. And it has some different content. When you're generating HTML, you

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.190
don't want to have to generate the, you know, write the same title

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.570
and the same footer over and over again. Just like in your

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.620
code when you use functions and classes to better organize your code,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.720
so you don't have to write the same piece of code over

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.230
and over again. You can organize your templates in the same way,

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.910
and that's what I want to talk about right now.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.470
You can use template inheritance. So you can have

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.030
one template that includes the header, and the footer.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.290
And then you can have a bunch of sub-templates that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.890
use, that just that redefine the content in the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.970
middle. So here's how we're going to organize our code now.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.120
So here's what we have right now in our

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.690
code. We have shopping list ,html and we have fizzbuzz.html.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.260
And these files don't have anything in common and we want to

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.170
give, we want to add a little title to this page. We're going to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.730
make each of these inherit from base html. And we're going to make

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.780
each of these inherit from base html and base html is going to have

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.510
some common html that these two templates will share. to make them

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.350
match a little better. And I'll just go ahead and show you an

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.170
example of how to do this. So, the first thing I'm going

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.870
to do is, I'm going to make a new file called base html.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.420
I'm going to go ahead and put in it things I want

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.880
these files to have in common and I'm also going to do

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.310
a proper html document this time. I saved it as base

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.370
html. Now, remember, html documents start with a doc type and

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.920
then we have the html tag and then we have the head.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.900
And within the head we can have the title. And so both our

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.600
pages will share this title. Within html we have body. Now, I'm going

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.260
to add a new syntax here. Okay, so then we have our, we

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.030
have our body, open and close, and then we close our html.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.670
This is the basic structure of an html document. And it's what goes

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.990
inside body that makes the page unique. Now we can change our title

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.810
too, while we're at it. But let's just worry about the body. In

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.930
Jinga, the syntax that we can use will look something

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.370
like this. The syntax for creating a block, and a

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.990
block is something that'll be shared amongst templates. You just

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.000
say squiggle percent block and then you give the block a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.970
name and in this case we are going to call it

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.720
content. And then you can say end block and we can

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.170
make each of our templates use this block of content.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.860
So let's show how we would use this base html in

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.750
shopping list. At the top of shopping list, I'm going to say.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.630
Let's add some code to our body that all of our templates

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.600
are going to have in common. I'm going to add a little, a header

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.190
across the top. Okay, so I just added a little title that we're

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.598
going to put across the top of our page. It's just an H1

00:02:59.598 --> 00:03:02.130
and I give it a little bit of extra styling. This is

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.720
CSS. We gave it a background color of ddd and a foreground

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.910
color of 888. This is just kind of. Gray with slightly darker gray

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.380
on top of it. I got rid of it's margin and

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.440
I gave it a, a height of 50 pixels. Also, I am

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.600
also going to add a little style to the body. This will make

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.910
a layout, a little bit nicer, margin 0. Okay. So lets go

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.680
ahead and use this template in our shopping list. The syntax

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.340
for this is quite simple. All we do is at the top

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.000
of our file we say extends dot HTML. This this tells this

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.060
template that we're going to be a part of base dot HTML.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.900
Now, let's see what this does in practice. Let's make

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.340
sure everything's saved. Nothing here is changed and our main handler

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.720
were still rendering shopping with html. Let's go to our front

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.460
page. Okay, it's still quite a mess here, let's reload this.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.120
Once I reload we can see that the header that I

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.030
wrote is here. The kind of gray on gray background, but

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.760
none of our content is here. Let's look at the source

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.000
for this. Okay, we basically see, this is our base.html file.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.280
But we're not seeing any of that content. Because that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.780
was in that block content, and we didn't overwrite that. So

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.050
let's go ahead and take a look at our templates again.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.080
This is our base html. This is basically what we were

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.940
seeing as the source in our browser. But our shopping_list.html hasn't

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.640
actually filled in this content yet. And let's see how we

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:21.600
do that. All you do is here you say block content.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.380
And this, this line here, block and then the name content,

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.690
matches this line here in base.html. And let me

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.050
put a closing one at the bottom, endblock, and we

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.850
save this file. And we go back to our

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.510
browser. And when I reload this page, we see all

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.930
of our stuff down here now. Within our base

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.960
html template. And when we view the source, we can

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.210
see we have the base html header. Then we can

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.240
see we have our form content here in the middle,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.610
and then we can have down here there's, it's hard

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.610
to see because of the scrolling, but the end of

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.880
the base html template. So that's pretty handy. Right, this

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:01.450
allows us to separate the content of our pages and

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.830
the templates for that content from the surrounding content that

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.450
all of our other pages might have in common. And

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.030
I use this a lot in this in this course.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.230
Especially during the blog and some of the other things.
