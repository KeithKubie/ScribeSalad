00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.199
Vsauce!

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:02.199
Kevin here.

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:07.059
The Colorado potato beetle, first observed
innocently eating native plants in the Rocky

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:13.749
Mountains in 1811, went crazy when potatoes,
native to South America, were introduced to

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:14.749
the U.S.

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:20.640
These beetles were like, “Wow potatoes are
delicious” The beetles were right.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.320
But their potato-hunger is so devastating
to crops, entire propaganda campaigns were

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.000
launched in World War II and again during
The Cold War claiming that the CIA was dropping

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:40.360
the “American Bug” in places like Germany
and Eastern Europe as a form of insect warfare.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.690
The Colorado potato beetle has been a major
potato problem.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.550
But potatoes have never been paradoxical,
right?

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.960
Wrong.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.780
ENTER: THE POTATO PARADOX.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.090
It goes like this: say you’ve got 100 pounds
of potatoes and 99% of their weight is water.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:17.159
The other 1% of their weight is solid potato
stuff -- starches, proteins, pectins, minerals,

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.369
that kind of stuff.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.420
You leave them out overnight and they dry
out a little bit.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.310
When you wake up, they're only 98% water,
that would make 2% of it solid.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:36.959
So, how much does your sack of spuds weigh
now?

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:43.189
While you think about it, let's get real for
a second with real potatoes, not paradoxical

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:44.189
ones.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.869
So, real potatoes are 79% water by weight.

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.570
So I cut this to exactly 100 grams, which
means this 79 grams of water.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.310
Looks thirst quenching.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.799
79% is a lot, but we can go higher.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.880
Per 100 grams, Watermelon is 91% water.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.640
But what’s more water than watermelon?

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.569
Lettuce.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.420
Lettuce is almost 95% water.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.760
Meaning, salad is 5% away from being soup.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.019
Back to our paradox… probably a good idea
to get back to that.

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.060
Probably broke the scale.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.239
Anyway, we have 100 pounds of paradox potatoes,
and the percentage of water weight goes down

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:43.290
by 1% overnight so their weight today would
be 99 pounds.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.879
A common answer.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:45.879
And a good one.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:57.739
If by "good" you mean…

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.990
After this tiny change, your sack of spuds
would actually weigh 50 pounds.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.730
The 1% shift in composition cuts its weight
in HALF.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.730
How?

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.830
Well, the easiest way to visualize the solution
is with potatoes.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:21.170
100 of them.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.790
OHHHH NO NO…

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.780
So here are 100 potatoes.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.459
You must hug your potatoes so that they know
that you care.

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:45.239
This one painted potato, a lovely space age
silver, is the 1% of solid potato matter that

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.470
we start with.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.610
The other 99 represent the water.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.980
When the potatoes dry out, the amount of solid
matter doesn’t change.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.160
Only the water goes away.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:05.790
So, if we remove ONE unit of water we now
have 99 pounds of stuff, 1 of which is dry,

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.069
98 of which are water.

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.819
So, let’s just do a little calculation here.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:19.530
98 out of 99 is 98%... but .989899.

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:26.430
We don’t want all those point 9 things,
we just want 98 percent.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.200
Okay, so that's too much water.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.560
Let’s just remove another water, alright,
so now we have 97 out of the 98 pounds here

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.810
are water.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:44.410
So, we’ll do 97 out of 98 and...

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.490
98.979591836%.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.350
That’s too much.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.220
It’s just too much water.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.310
There’s got to be a better way.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.850
Here’s the problem: This is lowering really
slowly because for every unit of water that

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.050
dries away, the total amount that's left ALSO
goes down.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.230
To see how many we need to take away, let’s
look at the final result.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:10.330
Excuse me, potatoes.

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.000
Okay, here’s what we’ve got going on here.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.390
Okay, so.

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:23.020
We need to reduce how much water we have not
to 98 or 97… but to 49.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.330
And here’s why:

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.050
So we have 98%, 2% solid, but we only have
1 solid unit.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.020
So let’s turn that 2 into a 1.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.970
So, we’ll divide 2 by 2 and we get 1.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:42.240
So we’ve got to do the same thing now to
our 98, so we’ll divide 98 by 2 and that

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.710
equals 49.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:50.540
So 49 plus 1 equals 50, and 50 pounds is the
answer.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.660
So, we’ve got to get rid of SO MANY water
potatoes.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:03.060
I don’t know how many are left, but it should
be 49 waters and 1 solid.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.160
And 49 divided by 50 is exactly 98%.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.160
We did it!

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.160
That’s the answer.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.490
The potato paradox comes into play every time
there are two items and the concentration

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.300
of one doubles.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.770
That requires the other one’s size to be
reduced by half of the whole, whether it's

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.890
doubling from 1% or .00001%.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:28.250
Or 10%.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:32.530
Ask your friends to solve this problem and
see what they say.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.080
Most of the time, our first response is to
assume that not much has changed since 1%

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.080
is so small.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.890
This isn't something to be ashamed of -- our
brains evolved to compare quantities like

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.610
this: there’s one wooly mammoth and there’s
five of us.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:54.629
Or, how much food do we need to keep the family
surviving through the winter?

00:06:54.629 --> 00:07:00.280
Evaluating concentrations is more abstract
and not usually a life-or-death issue that

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.830
natural selection would play a role in shaping.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.940
Unlike other famous paradoxes, time travel
ones for example, the POTATO paradox is a

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:20.530
VERIDICAL paradox, which means it has a TRUE
solution we can all agree on and prove, but

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.130
is nonetheless surprising.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:28.990
So, the potato paradox is a kind of paradox
not built on misunderstandings or impossibilities

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:37.020
or speculation but instead, is one that really
teases out how the mind works.

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:44.720
Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a vintage
potato toy to turn into a potato man before

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:51.180
he loses 1% of his water composition and half
his weight.

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:57.880
And as always - thanks for watching.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:06.200
The awesome potato paradox animation at the
beginning of this video was created by VFX

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.220
wizard Eric Langlay using After Effects.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.260
If you want to learn how to do cool visual
effects, there are dozens of courses just

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.290
on After Effects over at Skillshare.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:20.010
And they’re taught by experts who really
know what they’re doing, so you’ll really

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:25.030
learn what you’re doing, whether you need
to know the basics -- OH, LOOK OUT -- or you

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.480
just want to learn some new techniques.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.050
Which, I think we all can always use some
new techniques.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:34.590
An annual Skillshare subscription is less
than ten bucks a month and the first one thousand

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:38.820
people to use the promo link at the top of
this video’s description will get their

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:46.080
first two months for just 99 cents, which
is less than this potato cost me.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.670
And I would give this guy an arm… or a hand…

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.120
I guess he has an arm, but the hand, it’s
broken.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.940
Listen, this thing is 60 years old.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.180
It’s amazing that it… ok, let’s see
if it... doesn’t.

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.580
What if it stood… will this hold it?

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.580
WILL THIS HOLD IT?

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.300
IT HOLDS IT!

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:09.720
The Potato Man lives and breathes in a potato
stand.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.610
I didn’t mean for that to rhyme, but it
did.

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.260
Let’s look at this thing for a second.

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:17.710
Mr. Potato Head Funny Face kit, this was the
original thing.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:23.220
And it really wasn’t just for potatoes,
you can see you can make peppers, beets, oranges,

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.220
apples…

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.770
OHHH NOOOOO!

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:31.890
Really, it was all about turning vegetables
into people, which I think is something we

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.500
can all get behind.

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.890
*sigh* I have so much to clean up.
