00:00:05.225 --> 00:00:06.760
CASEY WHITELAW: So good evening.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.730
And I wanted to say first,
thank you all for being here.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.480
I know that all of you
have somewhere else

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.992
that you could be tonight.

00:00:12.992 --> 00:00:14.950
So thank you for making
the choice to come here

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.597
and the effort to come here
and be part of this community.

00:00:17.597 --> 00:00:19.430
And that's what tonight
is all about, right?

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.356
It's a community.

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:23.480
It's for all of you to be
part of Women Techmakers,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.880
and more broadly the
community of women in tech.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.059
So why am I standing up here?

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:30.600
It's certainly not
for me to tell you

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.890
my story of being
a woman in tech.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.920
But that's also
part of the point.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.600
It's because it's a problem.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.400
It's something that
I care about very

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.110
deeply that I'd like to see
better representation of women

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.694
in technology.

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:45.776
And I think that it's
important that it's not just

00:00:45.776 --> 00:00:48.610
women's voices that we hear, and
it's not just a women's problem

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.990
to increase the representation
of women in technology.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.540
And so I thought I would
share some of my thoughts

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.410
on diversity, and
specifically, on inclusion.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.830
So last year, I went
to Grace Hopper.

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:02.930
Who knows about Grace Hopper?

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.480
Great.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.230
This is the Grace
Hopper Celebration

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.812
of Women in Computing.

00:01:07.812 --> 00:01:09.770
It's a conference that
they call a celebration.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.040
And I love it.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.294
It changes the mood immediately
when it's a celebration.

00:01:14.294 --> 00:01:15.710
People who've been
there, you know

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.126
there's a lot more
smiles than you

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:19.390
would expect to see
at something that

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.860
would be called a conference.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.660
And for me, as a manager--
so as Marilyn mentioned,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.580
I'm a manager here
at Google-- it

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.140
was filled with really
interesting information

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.570
essentially about
supporting women

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.625
in their careers in technology.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:34.080
And at a really
high level, it was

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.010
about thinking
outside of the box

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.455
rather than there being
one kind of engineer.

00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:41.080
You might break that
box down and think

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.930
there's male engineers
and female engineers.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.770
And surprise,
surprise, there might

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.790
be some differences
between these groups

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.020
that you might want
to take into account.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.200
And it was about all the
different aspects of a career,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.200
from hiring, recruiting,
interviewing, things like that,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.591
supporting women
in their careers,

00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:02.090
looking for leadership
opportunities

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.830
and how to promote women
leaders in tech companies.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.740
But when I actually got down to
thinking about the content that

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.870
was being presented, the
advice that was being given,

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.760
almost none of it was
actually specific to women.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.250
All of it really,
or almost all of it,

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.760
was about treating
people as individuals.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.140
Like I said, instead of there
being one box for engineers,

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.440
for example, and
splitting into two boxes,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.210
it was really about treating
people as the individuals

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.370
that they are and
realizing that everybody

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.480
has a different set of needs
that you need to support.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.430
A good example of that
might be recruiting.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.890
So Google, famously,
and many tech companies

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.610
do technical interviews, right,
where you get up in a room

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.820
and you're asked some
technical questions.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.377
And usually,
traditionally, these

00:02:53.377 --> 00:02:54.710
have been done on a white board.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.950
Right?

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.533
So at some point
during the interview,

00:02:56.533 --> 00:02:58.580
you'll end up writing
on a white board.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.780
You'll write some code on a
white board, which, by the way,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.730
is not what we spend our
time doing at Google.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.150
Right?

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.260
This is not the job that
you're being hired to do.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.900
We don't stand around all day
writing code on a white board.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.630
We write code on computers
sitting down or standing up

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.630
if you have a standing
desk, writing at a computer.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.430
And it turns out
that many people--

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.390
this may come as a huge shock
to you-- many people perform

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.440
better if you ask them to write
code on a computer the way

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.140
that they're used to doing all
the time rather than saying,

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.070
hey, guess what?

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.030
Stand up here and write
code on a white board.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.150
And it turns out
the reason that we

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.880
were talking about this at
Grace Hopper is that that's

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.520
particularly true for women.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.710
So it was something that
they were all pointing out

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.830
in terms of making sure that
your hiring processes work well

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.020
for women.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.720
But actually, more
generally than that,

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.540
it doesn't mean
that all of a sudden

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.310
you ask men to stand up
and write at a white board

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.480
and you ask women to
sit down and write

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.460
at a desk with a computer.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.240
It's about having the option so
that everybody can demonstrate

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.460
their skills in the right way.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.860
And that goes for everybody.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.032
And I've talked to
plenty of men as well

00:04:09.032 --> 00:04:10.490
who would much
prefer to be writing

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.020
their code on a computer rather
than writing at a white board.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.880
And so this is getting to
this point of inclusion.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.380
Right?

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.370
So essentially,
for me, inclusion

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.040
is about creating an
environment where people

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.420
can be themselves, express
themselves as an individual,

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:27.884
and be the best
that they can be.

00:04:27.884 --> 00:04:29.300
And that's something
that I wanted

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.182
to talk to you a little
bit about tonight.

00:04:32.182 --> 00:04:34.140
So again, you might be
thinking, why am I here.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.080
I'm a white man in tech.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.400
What could I possibly have
to say about inclusion?

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.220
What story do I have?

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.910
And so, actually, I've
spent a fair bit of my life

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.180
in places where I haven't
been in the majority.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.160
And the story I want to tell
you tonight is from 20 years ago

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.500
when I was living in Japan.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.590
So I was just out of school.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.430
I was on an exchange
student program in Japan.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.920
And so I was living
with a Japanese family.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.670
And I spoke a little bit
of Japanese when I first

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.110
got there, but almost nothing.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.980
And the family that I was living
with was not in a big city.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.760
They were in a tiny village
literally surrounded

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.790
by rice fields in quite
a remote part of Japan.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.910
And this meant
that I was not only

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.860
the only foreigner
in my village.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.160
I was the only non-ethnically
Japanese person in probably

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.820
at least 10 kilometers
around where I was living.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.610
And it meant that everybody that
I met, everybody that saw me,

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.750
knew immediately who I was.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.930
And actually, they
didn't know who I was.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:38.560
Right?

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.770
They knew what I. I
was the foreigner.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.050
I was the gaijin.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.420
Who's heard the word
"gaijin" before?

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:50.550
Yeah, so gaijin, it
just means foreigner.

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.470
It's an abbreviation.

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.110
The real word is a gaikokujin.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.640
And it's not necessarily
a bad word in itself.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.520
But it depends how
it's being used,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.410
and certainly depends on
how you're hearing it.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.210
All I knew is that
all of a sudden,

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.920
that was a word
that I heard a lot,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.610
like I literally
couldn't walk down

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.390
the street without
hearing this word at least

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:13.600
a couple of times.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.490
Not every single time, but
every time I would go out,

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.600
somebody who maybe had never
walked past a gaijin before,

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.997
would see me and
then would start

00:06:21.997 --> 00:06:23.580
talking to their
friend about the fact

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.930
that they just saw a gaijin.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.670
And I knew for sure
that every time I

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.170
heard that word that it was me
that they were talking about.

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:32.420
It was not a random coincidence
that they were using this word.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:35.810
It was definitely 100% me.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.270
And the thing that
this made me feel--

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.740
I mean, it might be
something that many of you

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:44.960
have felt too-- is just
different, like immediately,

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.070
obviously, completely different.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:49.830
And it was a difference that
was pointed out to me every time

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.680
I heard a word like that.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.620
And at first, I thought
it was my problem,

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.730
like there was something
wrong with me because of this,

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:01.060
something wrong that
I was doing that was

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.011
making me feel this way.

00:07:03.011 --> 00:07:05.510
And there were definitely things
that I could do to improve.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:08.190
And so I thought I'm going
to really learn Japanese

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.010
as well as I can and really
understand Japanese culture

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:12.910
and try to get past this.

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.210
This is a problem
that I can solve.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.500
And I worked really
hard at those things.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.290
And so I worked really
hard at learning Japanese.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.290
And it's something that
I'm really grateful for,

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.665
like having
something that really

00:07:23.665 --> 00:07:27.620
drove me to learn Japanese
really well while I was there.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.670
But despite that, I had this
experience multiple times

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.820
while I was living
in Japan where--

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.810
and my Japanese was getting
better while I was there.

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:37.960
I'd start a conversation
with somebody.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.940
And I'd talk to
them in Japanese.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.650
And they'd listen.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:43.650
And they'd look at me.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:46.340
And then when I stopped
talking, they'd then immediately

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.910
turn to the Japanese
person standing next to me,

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.655
and they'd go like this and say,
look, he can speak Japanese.

00:07:52.655 --> 00:07:55.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:57.170
And this happened a few times.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:58.800
So I'd get used to
trying to ignore it.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.466
And I'd turn back,
and I'd speak to them

00:08:00.466 --> 00:08:02.600
some more, like come on,
let's have a conversation.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.760
We can do this.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.990
And they'd listen.

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.990
And they'd look.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.060
And they'd turn back and
say, he's really quite good.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:11.070
It's amazing.

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.530
And I felt like just saying,
I'm here, like hello.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.830
I'm a person.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:18.290
You can talk to me.

00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:21.117
And for some people, there
was just like this basic--

00:08:21.117 --> 00:08:23.075
I don't know if this
resonates with any of you,

00:08:23.075 --> 00:08:26.440
if you feel like you've been
in a situation like this.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:29.360
But for some people, it was
just impossible to get over

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.059
that barrier where they
stopped treating me just

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:36.289
as a stereotype,
stopped treating me just

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:39.330
as the gaijin, the foreigner,
and started actually

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:41.650
connecting with me as a person.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.890
And this was by no
means universal.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.150
And I had a fabulous
time in Japan.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:47.970
And the reason that
I had a fabulous time

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.280
is because of those
people who looked

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:55.780
past the stereotypes, who looked
past me just being a foreigner,

00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.000
and talked to me as a
person realized that I came

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.550
from a different background, I
had a different set of skills,

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.820
and I had a different
set of experiences.

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.160
And that was actually part of
the wonderful thing in terms

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.530
of friendships and so forth.

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:14.780
We could have conversations
and exchange ideas

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.140
that two Japanese
people speaking together

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.770
might not be able to
have because we've

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:23.950
got a different mix of
information and background

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.310
and so on.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.450
And so that's why I think
it's so important for us,

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.240
it's so valuable for us, to
be treated as individuals.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.450
And that goes for everybody.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:32.950
Right?

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:36.160
I think that all that
everybody in this room

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.480
wants is for us to be
valued for who we are.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.330
Like I said, we all have
different backgrounds,

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.620
different experiences.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.580
We all have different
skills and abilities.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.510
We all have goals and ambitions.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.750
We're all working in tech.

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:51.650
And we all want to do something
amazing like change the world

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:54.020
through working in tech.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.360
And the right way
for us to do that

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.460
is by building an
inclusive environment.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.850
And it's something that's
equally applicable, I think,

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:03.460
to men and women.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.500
If we can understand people
as individuals and the things

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.390
that they need, the
right way to understand

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.550
who they are and then help them
through their careers, that's

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:17.210
what I think will really build
a truly diverse workforce,

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:21.360
a place where we can all
be happy being ourselves.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.350
So with that, I wanted to
hand the rest of this evening

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.030
back over to all of you.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:27.060
You're all individuals.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.980
And you're all here as
part of a community.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.340
I hope that you've
enjoyed yourself tonight.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.350
I hope you've learned something.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.630
I hope you've had some fun.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:36.340
And I hope that you
meet somebody new.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:40.160
I hope you take a chance to
meet somebody new here tonight.

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.970
Thank you so much
for coming out.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.590
And it's been a real pleasure
having you here at Google.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.190
Thank you.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.940
