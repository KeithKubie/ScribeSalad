[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.000
SPEAKER 1: Hello, everyone, and
welcome to the 2017 TensorFlow

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.820
developer summit, and I'm
delighted to see all of you

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.160
here today.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.320
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.400
SPEAKER 2: Today we are excited
to announce TensorFlow 1.0.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.900
TensorFlow's
philosophy has always

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.370
been to give you the power
to do whatever you want,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.723
but also make it easy, and
this makes it even easier.

00:00:28.723 --> 00:00:32.025
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:34.251 --> 00:00:36.750
SPEAKER 3: We really were hoping
to build a machine learning

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.280
platform, for everyone in the
world that was fast, flexible,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.204
and production ready.

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:43.620
SPEAKER 4: The
point of TensorFlow

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.700
was to figure out
how can we give

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.116
this back to the
community, and be

00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:47.610
able to use
TensorFlow to further,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.890
whether it's the research
or their production needs?

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.860
SPEAKER 5: It's how
we express our ideas,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.830
and it's the piece of
software our engineers

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.984
and scientists spend most of
their time interacting with.

00:00:57.984 --> 00:01:00.150
SPEAKER 6: So TensorBoard
is a really exciting tool.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.691
It's something that
will let you take

00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:03.140
the confusing
world of TensorFlow

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.280
and start to dive into it.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.030
SPEAKER 7: It's just
a really amazing time

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.065
to be an AI researcher.

00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:09.440
SPEAKER 8: One of the projects
that we've been working on

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.722
is using deep learning
for retinal imaging.

00:01:12.722 --> 00:01:14.930
SPEAKER 9: Can we use deep
learning and reinforcement

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.279
learning to generate
compelling media?

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:19.070
SPEAKER 10: But this
is just the beginning.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.214
The TensorFlow community
is truly global.

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:23.630
SPEAKER 11: We want to see all
the amazing things that you

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.710
guys can do with TensorFlow.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.580
Thank you very much.
