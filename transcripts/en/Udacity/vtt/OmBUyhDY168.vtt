00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To solve this, I looked at the ratio--the ratio of this side to that side--

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and compared it to this and that.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's see--over here we have 5 m over 12 m,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and I know that must, must, must be equal to whatever this side is--I'll call it x/18 m.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Again, these units cancel out.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This ratio 5/12 seems to be pretty important.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I'm going to multiply both sides by 18,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and when I carry out this multiplication, I find 7.5 m.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, this ratio, 5/12--I'm going to put it in parentheses to show that it's important--

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
every single time we see a 22.6 degree angle in a right triangle

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I know that look at this side over that side will give me this ration 5/12.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That may seem trivial, but it's actually deeply, deeply important.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In fact, since we're going to be using these ratios so often,

00:00:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
let's agree on a way to refer to the sides of a right triangle.
