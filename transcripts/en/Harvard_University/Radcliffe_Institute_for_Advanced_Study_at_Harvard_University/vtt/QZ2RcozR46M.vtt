00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.100
- Hey, welcome back, everybody.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.109
I hope you had a
good lunch break

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.500
and got a chance to
see the poster session.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.650
There were amazing
posters there.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.590
We now have the first of
our two keynote speakers,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.980
followed by a panel and
the last keynote speaker.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.040
I want to thank Ellen
Douglas for coming in

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.860
at the last minute
and rescuing us.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.960
We had Tony deBrum from
the Marshall Islands

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.070
who was going to talk
about sea level rise.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.960
But we wanted to talk
about sea level rise,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.130
as you saw the issues
in the previous panel.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.440
And so Ellen has graciously
agreed to talk about them.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.260
We've had the stage set
with the previous panel.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.890
And on Monday this week, we also
had Kerry Emanuel from MIT talk

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.600
about hurricane risk
and how to evaluate

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.130
hurricane risk, which it turns
out, is not a trivial matter.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.000
One point that he made and
which is quite interesting

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.260
is that, number one,
sea level rise is not

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.876
the same throughout the globe.

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:07.500
It's going to change
depending on where

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.590
you are for various factors,
not the least including

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.120
gravitational attraction.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.480
So we know roughly how
fast it's rising here,

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.740
but we don't know if
it's going to take off.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.610
There's a range
of climate models.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.420
And when you start to think
about mitigation, which

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.370
is probably what we're going to
have to deal with because we've

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.995
already dumped CO2
into the atmosphere,

00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:28.661
and we're going to
have to live with it,

00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:31.722
and live with ocean level rise,
then the question becomes,

00:01:31.722 --> 00:01:32.680
how do you mitigate it?

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.700
And that mitigation is going
to depend very strongly

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.660
on where you are-- what
the coastline looks like

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.270
and what the bathymetry is.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.230
So Ellen, who's a professor
of hydrology at UMass-Boston

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.450
has studied this
extensively, and has

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.890
worked on mitigation
strategies for cities,

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.340
and is actually very
directly involved

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.900
with developing mitigation
strategies for Boston.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.510
So we'll have a talk and have
about 15 minutes for question

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:02.870
and answer afterwards.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.714
So Ellen, thank you.

00:02:04.714 --> 00:02:08.304
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:10.220
- Hi, everyone.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.860
Can hear me?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.780
Is my mic on?

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.880
Oh, great.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.210
So yeah, thanks for
having me here-- happy

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.540
to fill in, last minute.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.800
I love talking
about sea level rise

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.242
and how we can deal
with it in Boston.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:23.700
So what I'm going
to do is give you

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.650
a whirlwind tour of some of the
projects I've been involved in,

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.670
dealing with that.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.940
But I wanted to give you a
little bit of a precursor

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.750
to begin with.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.540
We're used to hearing,
recently, about a lot

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.720
of different records that
are being broken, right?

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.950
We have record
temperatures every year.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.050
We have record
temperatures in the months.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.320
And just recently, July 2016
was deemed the hottest month

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.590
ever recorded.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.510
So we're breaking
a lot of records.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.180
And I always like to mention
that records are always

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.000
going to be broken.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.666
Theoretically, they'll
always be broken.

00:02:56.666 --> 00:03:00.212
But usually what happens is, the
time between records increases.

00:03:00.212 --> 00:03:01.920
But what we're seeing
with climate change

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.420
is that the records
are being broken

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.950
faster and faster and faster.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.710
And so it gives us an idea
that something's going on.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.210
Also I don't know if you noticed
but, just a couple of weeks

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:11.490
ago, we had a King Tide.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.360
And so there was a
whole bunch of pictures

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.570
that were taken of
places around Boston

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.100
and the surrounding area
where you see that there's

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.360
water just at high
tide, in places

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.550
that generally
didn't see flooding

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.730
before-- so more evidence
that things are happening

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.140
that are unprecedented.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.140
And of course, we know this
from the International Panel

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.810
on Climate Change, when
they, in their last report,

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.246
came out and said that,
"warming is unequivocal."

00:03:37.246 --> 00:03:39.120
And in other words,
there's no doubt anymore.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.410
And it's extremely likely
that humans are the cause.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.810
And so what do we
do with that, then?

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.850
Well one of the
things that Boston

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.390
did was the Green
Ribbon Commission, which

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.680
is a part of a little--
committee in Boston

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.690
decided they wanted to do
a vulnerability analysis

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.150
for the city of Boston.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.960
But before that, they
wanted to pull together

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.500
a scientific consensus on
what climate change means

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.400
for Boston.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.720
And so this Climate
Ready Boston initiative

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.915
was born just last
year, summer of 2015.

00:04:12.915 --> 00:04:14.790
And the first thing we
did was bring together

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.200
four teams of scientists from
around the city to look at,

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.490
what is the latest-- what is the
most recent science on climate

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.420
change impacts for
Boston, with regard

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.720
to temperature, storms,
precipitation, and sea level

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:29.220
rise.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.303
And I'm going to talk to
you about sea level rise.

00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:34.130
So the ultimate
outcome of this project

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.080
was, they took the consensus
from the scientists,

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.370
did a vulnerability
assessment, and then next

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.790
we'll look at plans for
reducing the vulnerabilities

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:43.775
that they identified.

00:04:43.775 --> 00:04:45.150
I'm going to talk
about-- so this

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.360
was called the Boston Research
Advisory Group, or BRAG.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.560
I'm going to talk about the
results of the Sea Level Rise

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.860
Team in the BRAG.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.890
This is a list of
the people that

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:56.060
were involved in that team.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.350
Myself and my colleague
Paul Kershen at UMass-Boston

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.809
led the BRAG teams.

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:05.100
So I don't know how much--
this is kind of last minute,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.140
so I don't know how
much you've already

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:07.223
seen about sea level rise.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:11.080
But I want to talk a little
bit about the process.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.600
There's a lot of
different factors

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.766
that go into sea level rise.

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:16.240
Of course, as the water
warms, it expands.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.780
So that's called
thermal expansion.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.820
Also, you have melting of ice,
of glaciers, and ice sheets,

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.510
adding volume to the water.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.870
You have vertical land movement.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.870
So sometimes, in some places,
the land is subsiding.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.160
Some places, it's uplifting--
compaction, other things,

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.980
all these add to sea level
rise as we experience it

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:37.180
at any location.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.200
Over the 20th century,
thermal expansion

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.040
was really the driving factor.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.690
But in the 21st century,
as we move further

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.800
into the 21st
century, what really

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.780
is striking is the
potential for ice melt

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.029
and the melting of the glaciers
to really add and accelerate

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:54.320
the sea level rise that we see.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.650
So in the ice sheets,
there's a potential of tens

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.827
of meters of sea level
rise, were they to all--

00:05:59.827 --> 00:06:01.410
and now, they're not
going to all melt

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.560
in the next few centuries.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.556
But there's a big potential.

00:06:04.556 --> 00:06:06.180
And that's one of
the big uncertainties

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.050
in being able to project
sea level rise, especially

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.780
out into the later part of
the 21st century-- just how

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.920
much of that ice
is going to melt?

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.690
So the other thing, that
I know Kerry talked about

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:22.600
earlier this week, was
that sea level rise is not

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.400
experienced in the same
way in every location.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.140
So here in Boston, we're
not going to see just

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.520
global mean sea level rise.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.440
GMSLR is just Global Mean.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.160
That's just the average sea
level rise around the planet.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.570
We're going to experience a
different rate of sea level

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:38.584
rise because of this
vertical land movement.

00:06:38.584 --> 00:06:40.292
Here in Boston, we're
actually subsiding.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.940
And part of the
vertical land movement

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.000
is in response to
glaciers that were

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.390
like 12 to 20,000
years ago-- the land

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.060
is still adjusting to that.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.190
We also have changes in
ocean dynamics, which

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.540
I'll talk about in a minute.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.450
And we have something
that's called ice sheet

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:58.810
fingerprints, which
I think you've had

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:00.000
a little bit of exposure to.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.958
But that is one of the
coolest things I learned

00:07:01.958 --> 00:07:03.440
as being a part of this BRAG.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.940
So I thought it was
very interesting

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.439
and I wanted to
share that with you.

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:10.380
So the ocean dynamics is-- as
you know, I'm a hydrologist.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.480
So I deal with freshwater.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.390
So I didn't have any real formal
training in ocean dynamics.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.010
And I found out that
the surface of the ocean

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:19.490
is actually very bumpy.

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:22.120
Because of currents, it's
not flat like you'd think.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.740
And so as those currents make
their way around the globe,

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.020
the different elevations
of the water surface

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.280
are very different.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.630
And as those elevation
as those currents change,

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:36.540
it changes-- it affects the
elevation of the water surface.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.262
So as warming occurs,
sometimes we're

00:07:39.262 --> 00:07:40.720
expecting that some
of the currents

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.650
may slow down, which may
cause a relaxing of the water

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:48.990
surface at the current and shift
the water at the shoreline.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:53.870
There's also changes due to more
or less saltiness in the ocean

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:55.210
and warmth.

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.880
And then we have
these big climate--

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.460
what they call teleconnections--
where these big climate

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.070
events-- one, in
particular, in the Atlantic

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:08.240
is called the North
Atlantic Oscillation, which

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:14.200
effects where currents go and
also affects the sea levels as

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:14.700
well.

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:18.550
So these ocean dynamics
could impact sea level rise

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:23.150
along the New England coast as
much as 10 centimeters by 2100.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.250
So there's all these
factors besides just

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.110
the thermal expansion
that add to the sea level

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.590
rise we may see.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.659
This idea of ice fingerprints
is pretty amazing.

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.169
So as ice sheets
melt, they add water.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:38.089
That's obvious.

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:39.630
But one thing that
I didn't realize--

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.250
I never quite understood until
I was a part of this BRAG--

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.810
is that the ice sheets
are so massive that they

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:45.980
have a gravitational pull.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.300
And they actually pull
the water up to them.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.240
And as they melt, then
that mass reduces,

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.120
and so the gravitational
pull reduces.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.270
So when you're close to an
ice sheet that's melting,

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.960
the water level--
even though water

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.010
is being added to the
ocean at that point,

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:04.660
the water levels are actually
depressing, going down.

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:07.560
That means it's distributing
farther out into the ocean.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.610
So when you're far
away from an ice sheet,

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.200
the water level's actually going
up because of that ice sheet

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:12.700
melting.

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.680
And so they can model--
they've gotten better

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.880
at modeling and predicting
these kinds of impacts.

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.030
So this line, here,
is how the ocean

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:25.170
would look if it was just a
flat surface around the sphere.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.780
But this line here
shows that impact

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.820
where the massive
ice sheet is pulling

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:31.800
the water up next to it.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.840
And then as the ice sheet
melts, this water level

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.940
actually drops here and
goes up farther out.

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:40.880
So we're going to be--
because we're very far

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.150
from the Antarctic
ice sheets, we're

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:47.580
actually going to be seeing
more than global mean sea level

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.790
rise because of this relaxing
of the gravitational pull

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:52.920
from the ice sheets.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.794
Which I just think that's
really fascinating.

00:09:54.794 --> 00:09:56.450
I would have never thought that.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.550
So because we're close to
Greenland, as Greenland melts,

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.990
we're actually going to see
a reduction in sea level rise

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.480
because we're
close to Greenland.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.710
But Greenland is pretty small
relative to the Antarctic.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.930
So as the Antarctic
melts, or if it collapses,

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.660
we're actually going
to see as much as 20%

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.730
or more increase over
global mean sea level rise

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:23.970
because of that impact of that
mass redistribution of water.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.740
And so all those
things were taken--

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.670
the BRAG looked into all
those different factors.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.940
And actually, Rob DeConto,
who works at UMass-Amherst,

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.680
has a method for incorporating
all that into a model that

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.810
can then project levels
of sea level rise,

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:42.920
specifically for Boston here.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:48.150
So out of the BRAG came
some specific predictions

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:51.676
of sea level arise under the
different emissions scenarios.

00:10:51.676 --> 00:10:54.050
You probably learned something
about emissions scenarios.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.320
If we have low carbon
emissions, because we

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.070
go to renewable energy
sources, or if we continue

00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:04.370
on with the high
burning of fossil fuels,

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.280
we have high emissions scenario.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.290
So here is the high emissions
scenario sea level rise.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.350
So it could be as
high-- the mean

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:13.740
around four to five
feet of sea level rise,

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.470
could be as high as seven
feet of sea level rise

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:17.950
by the end of the century.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:20.840
Whereas if we follow the
lower emissions scenarios-- so

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.860
if we reduce our carbon
emissions in the atmosphere,

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.870
we could then have
sea level rise

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.380
that's more in
the realm of three

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.130
to four feet, two to four feet.

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:32.080
So what we do now--
what the take away

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.880
from for many of the things
that came out of the BRAG was,

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.710
what we do know makes
a big difference

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.444
later in the semester.
(LAUGHING) Semester!

00:11:39.444 --> 00:11:41.250
You can tell-- later
in the semester

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:42.560
and later in the century.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:43.060
Right?

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:43.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.420
- Quite a long semester.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.300
- Yeah, that's a very
long semester, right.

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:48.040
Yeah, you probably
won't see the impact

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:49.165
by the end of the semester.

00:11:49.165 --> 00:11:50.229
- The final exam--

00:11:50.229 --> 00:11:51.270
- Yeah, the final, right.

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.040
There will be a test at
the end of this century.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.670
How did we do?
(LAUGHING) That's good.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:01.270
So that was one Initiative
that Boston generated

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.230
to try to assess what
climate change means

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:05.690
for Boston specifically.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:07.200
And they're just
finally releasing,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.530
I think it should come out
in the next month or so,

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.590
the results of the
vulnerability assessment

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.430
that used the
scientific consensus

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.220
from the BRAG for
the four impacts,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:21.010
and then look at places in
the city that's vulnerable.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:22.760
Another project that
I was involved in

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.490
was actually funded by the
Federal Highway Administration

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:26.700
and Mass DOT.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.310
I'm an engineer, so I like
to deal with the stuff that's

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.320
on the ground.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.210
So we worked, we were hired
by Mass DOT and the Federal

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.380
Highway Administration, as part
of the climate change pilot

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.100
project to look at the
impacts of sea level

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.560
rise and coastal
storms on the Central

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.190
Artery, what we affectionately
know as the Big Dig

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.180
around here.

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.650
So I'm going to tell you
just a little bit about that.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:49.816
Here's our project team,
and included several people

00:12:49.816 --> 00:12:51.200
from UMass-Boston.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.300
Our modeler was Kirk
Bosma from Woods Hole

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.030
Group down in East Falmouth,
and Mass DOT personnel.

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:59.820
So we all worked
together on this.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.810
And the main
objective was to see

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.075
what was vulnerable in
the Central Atery project.

00:13:06.075 --> 00:13:08.700
And we're not just talking about
the tunnel but all the highway

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.030
infrastructure and the tunnels
that were a part of it.

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:14.950
And then how could
we-- what could we

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:17.342
do to reduce those
vulnerabilities?

00:13:17.342 --> 00:13:19.300
So this is just an image
of the Central Artery.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.924
I'm sure that you're
all pretty-- well,

00:13:20.924 --> 00:13:22.080
maybe you're not.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.580
You're not, maybe,
from around here.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:24.830
So this is the Central Artery.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.880
Here's a picture of what it
looks like now, where the Rose

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:29.170
Kennedy Greenway used to be.

00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.330
It was an elevated highway.

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.180
Now it's a tunnel
under the city.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.810
And so you can imagine that
an agency like Mass DOT

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:39.740
worries about things
like tunnel entrances.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.920
What happens if water goes
in the tunnel entrance?

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.504
Or they have these
big vent buildings.

00:13:43.504 --> 00:13:45.878
So when you've got this tunnel,
you need to ventilate it.

00:13:45.878 --> 00:13:47.510
So they have these
big vent buildings.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.440
And they have vents
right at ground surface.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.800
So you have to worry
about what sea level rise

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.950
or coastal flooding could
look like in these areas.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.270
And I've done a lot of work.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.780
I've been working on
this for over 10 years

00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.140
along with my other colleagues.

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.210
And what we had
previously done was just

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.570
what is called a bath tub mat.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.542
So you just take a flat
surface, and you cut it

00:14:05.542 --> 00:14:07.750
through the terrain, and
you say, anything below it's

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.120
going to be flooded and
anything above it is not.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.360
Well that's fine when
that's, basically,

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.310
all you have the
money or time to do.

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.300
But really, what
you need to do is

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.050
develop a model that can
simulate waves, and wind,

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:21.790
and ocean current
so that you know.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.970
Because this map
shows a flat surface

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:29.440
at 12 feet where flooding
would be in Boston.

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.170
But this actually shows
how a hyrdodynamic model

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.710
would simulate the
same kind of an event.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:39.110
And so you can see the red
means higher than 12 feet.

00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:42.830
So along-- this is actually
a simulation of a nor'easter.

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.360
One of the reasons that
nor'easters impacts us

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.560
in Boston is because
Boston Harbor is open--

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.230
opens right up to the Northeast.

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:52.680
So people along the South coast,
here in Quincy in those areas,

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.620
are going to get higher
impacts because of waves,

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.220
and because the water is
push-- because of storm surge--

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.150
than they are in
the Northern coast.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:05.670
So that's why we decided that we
would-- because we had funding

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:08.020
from the Federal
Highway Administration

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.690
and from Mass DOT, we built
this big, fancy-shmancy model

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.930
that actually includes
much of the Atlantic

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:19.500
so we could bring in nor'easter
storms and hurricanes

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.160
to assess what those would
look-- what flooding would

00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:25.180
look like from those events.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:29.340
And we also, because Mass DOT
was interested in understanding

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.942
the vulnerability of
individual structures-- so

00:15:32.942 --> 00:15:34.650
the vent buildings,
the tunnel entrances,

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:38.010
things like that-- we had a
very fine-resolution grid.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:40.520
So all of these little
dots-- the model

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:42.910
had a prediction
for all those dots.

00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:46.250
So this ended up being a
very large numerical model

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.976
that was built.

00:15:46.976 --> 00:15:48.600
But it really was
the next step that we

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:52.810
needed to take beyond
the bathtub maps.

00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:56.570
We incorporated sea level
rise, we picked points off

00:15:56.570 --> 00:16:00.320
of the highest
emissions scenario

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.710
to look at what coastal
flooding would look like now,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.740
in 2030, and 2070,
and ultimately 2100.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.330
And the outcome
of this-- so this

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:11.920
was like a two year project.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.340
And the outcome of this
model was the probability

00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:19.210
of flooding at
different locations

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.060
throughout Massachusetts--
throughout Boston.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:26.210
So it was funded by Mass DOT--
they were most interested

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.600
in the Mass DOT structures.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.700
But it also gave
us a map where you

00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:32.920
could-- where other people,
other communities all

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.860
along the coastline could look
at the results of this model

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:38.540
and say, what does that mean
for flooding for us as well?

00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:43.920
So this is an image of, as
you can see, the Boston area.

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.690
The little-- the
green here-- so this,

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:49.070
right now, is the
probability of flooding.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.900
So the greenish color
is around 1% chance.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:55.590
So if any of you ever heard
the term, The 100 Year Flood

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.140
or the 1% Chance
Flood, that's the one

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.130
that FEMA worries about a lot.

00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.910
So we were able to
actually predict

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:06.109
what the probabilities
of flooding were.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:08.900
And this is the
Greenway in East Boston.

00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.550
Here, we have South Boston.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:15.411
Here, we have down where
I am on Columbia Point,

00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:16.369
up here in Charlestown.

00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:17.760
So this is current conditions.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.470
So there is some probability
of flooding in parts of Boston

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.579
under current conditions.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.079
But the probabilities
are low-- 1% or less.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.451
But when we get to 2030,
you see the colors change.

00:17:30.451 --> 00:17:32.700
Not only do the colors change,
but the extent changes.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:36.280
So now the probability is
more in the area of 2% to 5%.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.630
So now we're starting
to see, rather than once

00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:40.030
every 100 years
on average, we're

00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.610
seeing once every 50 years
or more-- probability

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:47.120
of flooding-- and also seeing
much greater extent of flooding

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.430
in these areas as well.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.220
And then we get the 2070.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.290
And then we start seeing
a lot of flooding.

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:54.670
And in particular, we
see a lot of flooding

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:58.610
in here, in Cambridge
and Back Bay

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.910
because-- so what
we're doing here

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.090
is we're modeling sea level
rise plus the addition of storms

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.150
coming in on top of that.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.870
So a storm surge--
so by 2050 to 2060,

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:10.740
somewhere around
in there, if you

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:14.110
get an event-- a storm
surge on top of a high tide,

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.460
it can actually get
around the Charles River

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.410
dam and the Amelia Earhart dam.

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:21.095
And then you begin to have
flooding in these areas that

00:18:21.095 --> 00:18:22.970
weren't used to being
flooded, because that's

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:24.136
why the dams were put there.

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:27.520
So we have flooding in
Cambridge and those areas,

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.710
a lot of flooding up in
Charleston and Somerville,

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:34.310
and of course, South Boston,
South End, and all these areas.

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:40.220
So this gave Mass DOT a chance
to figure out what is the risk.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.290
What's the probability
of getting flooding?

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:44.940
And we could also take a
particular probability--

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.480
a 1% flood probability-- and
see what the depths would be.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.990
So here, we're looking at
the same sort of scale.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:56.110
The Greenway in East Boston,
under current conditions,

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.150
has a potential.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.549
If it's a 1% event,
if that occurs,

00:18:59.549 --> 00:19:01.590
the depths are going to
be around a half a foot--

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:04.430
a half a foot to a
foot-- so not anything,

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.880
probably, terribly disruptive.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.040
But if you get into 2030,
then you get an extension,

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:13.590
then the flooding depths
get more extensive,

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:14.510
and they get deeper.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:16.970
And again, as you
can imagine, by 2070,

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.470
not only do you
have a higher chance

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.280
of flooding in more areas,
but you also have more depths.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.210
So this gave Mass
DOT-- and anybody else,

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:28.770
basically, in Boston that's
interested in the impacts

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:31.300
of coastal flooding, which is
the combination of sea level

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:35.980
rise and coastal storms-- some
information to how to plan,

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.120
how to think about what
sea level rise could mean.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.630
And of course, we can zoom in.

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:43.010
Mass DOT and others can look
at individual infrastructures.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.260
I showed this map to
a bunch of CEOs that

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:47.680
had property in South Boston.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.510
And there was literally
a verbal gasp in the air

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:55.000
because the blues are around
30% to 50% probability, by 2070,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.270
of flooding.

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.490
So that's a really
high probability

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.140
of flooding occurring
in these areas.

00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:04.210
So then you can start
looking at what are we

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.590
going to do about it.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.600
So other things that come out
of this model are the timing.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.140
So the water comes in, we
know what the depths is,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.330
how long does it last?

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:16.130
So how deep it gets, how
long the flooding lasts.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.630
Then you can start
figuring out what

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:18.410
we're going to do about it.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.451
So you could do something
as simple as putting up

00:20:20.451 --> 00:20:21.630
flood-proof doors.

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:24.847
We found out in the Big Dig,
there are a lot of doors.

00:20:24.847 --> 00:20:26.430
There are an enormous
amount of doors.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.160
So as they replace
doors over time,

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.050
they replace them with
flood-proof doors.

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.570
So that's a fairly easy fix.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.170
There's also, in areas that
are going to be flooded,

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.640
but it's going to be
either less than two feet,

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.370
or it's going to occur
over a very short time,

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.190
you could put up these
things called temporary flood

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.950
barriers.

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.790
Aquafence is a builder of
these temporary flood barriers.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.800
And Massport actually
has bought a system

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.250
of these temporary
flood barriers.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:57.590
And this shows a picture of
them doing an emergency-- see

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:58.440
how long it took.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.240
And it took them like,
I think, 45 minutes

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.319
to put up the temporary
barriers around

00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:04.360
this particular building.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.950
So they went and did a drill.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.430
So there are ways that
you can protect yourself

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:11.650
that aren't terribly
expensive and can

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:13.357
be put away in the warehouse.

00:21:13.357 --> 00:21:14.940
And then when you--
the good thing is,

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:17.170
we have three to
five-day lead times

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.440
now, for big storms
that are coming in.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.170
So you have time to prepare.

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:25.960
So this gave Mass DOT
a chance to really

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.030
know what sea level rise
and coastal flooding

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:32.404
would mean for their
particular infrastructure,

00:21:32.404 --> 00:21:33.570
and then to be able to plan.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.640
So the good news, for
them and for Boston,

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.720
is that over the short term,
currently, there is exposure.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.100
There is risk of flooding.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.650
And we kind of all
knew that, right?

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.382
Now we just know what
the probability is.

00:21:43.382 --> 00:21:45.090
So it's fairly low
probability right now.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.011
So we have time
to figure out how

00:21:47.011 --> 00:21:48.260
we're going to deal with this.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.230
But by the time you
get to 2030, you

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:54.980
have to start worrying about
more substantial flooding

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:58.150
and incorporating
this flood-proofing

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:01.520
and accommodation
into the maintenance

00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.490
of these particular buildings.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.870
The bad news is there
were some-- even

00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:10.040
under current conditions,
there are some tunnel openings

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.200
that are vulnerable.

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.190
So you have to think
about what we would

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:13.560
do if a storm did come in.

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.590
And those vulnerable tunnel
openings do increase over time.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.884
So Mass DOT is doing a lot
of ground truthing right now,

00:22:21.884 --> 00:22:23.800
making sure that the
stuff that the model said

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.070
is actually true.

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:28.770
And then they're also developing
a plan over the long term

00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.580
with how they're going to
incorporate this information.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.810
Just one more quick
thing about other things

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.340
that we've been doing
related to sea level

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.580
rise in the Boston area.

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:41.760
My colleague, Paul
Kirshen and I have

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.020
been working for about the last
eight years in East Boston.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:47.370
We had a research
project that was

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.820
funded by NOAA, the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:54.400
Administration who was
interested in knowing

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.310
what sea level rise
and coastal flooding

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.790
means for environmental
justice communities.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:02.540
And so we picked East
Boston as a focus area.

00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:05.970
And the first thing we did was
we had two research projects.

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:07.700
So this is research in action.

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.790
We had two sequential
research projects

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.464
where we went in and met
with East Boston residents,

00:23:14.464 --> 00:23:16.380
found out what they knew
about climate change.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.720
We gave them some ideas of what
we knew about climate change,

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.530
and then surveyed the
residents to find out--

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:25.850
and told them about what are
the options-- how can you

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:28.960
protect yourself, how can
the city protect itself

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:33.050
from these flooding events--
and then got feedback

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:38.700
from the individual residents
as to what they felt would work

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.250
and wouldn't work.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:44.650
And out of that, then,
came a series of workshops

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:49.860
where we brought together
people from Boston agencies--

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:54.360
Massport, Mass
DOT, National Grid,

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.460
the City of Boston,
all kinds of agencies

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:59.140
that were going to be
doing individual adaptation

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:02.280
strategies in East Boston--
brought them together

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.390
with the residents
of East Boston,

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:07.570
had some workshops where
people shared their values

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:08.900
and their priorities.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:12.520
The whole purpose was--
the hypothesis here

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.690
was that, if you develop
a plan, rather than having

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:18.020
all the individual
agencies develop

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.340
their own plans for
their own infrastructure,

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:24.730
if we got together and came
up with a plan that shared

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:28.250
the plan across agencies
and across stakeholders,

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.030
we could not only
meet the requirements

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.670
of the individual
agencies, but also

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.480
have a lot of co-benefits
for the residents

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.630
and other people
involved in the area.

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:40.860
So we brought together--
and this was mostly

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:43.270
led by Paul Kirshen--
the residents

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.590
with the governmental and
infrastructure agencies, shared

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:51.150
values and plans, and
then engineers came up

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:53.690
with a conceptual
flood-proofing, flood

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.280
protection plan for East Boston.

00:24:56.280 --> 00:24:58.790
So people just got together,
rolled out these maps,

00:24:58.790 --> 00:25:00.640
and said, OK, what's important?

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.660
People listened to
different stakeholders

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.830
giving presentations,
and sat down,

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.710
and hashed out what was
important, and ultimately came

00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:10.470
up with a map of
important features,

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:13.420
within East Boston, that
needed to be protected,

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.770
that were valued by
both the residents

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.220
and the government
agencies and infrastructure

00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:20.650
agencies that were involved.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.260
And ultimately, out of
this came a conceptual plan

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:29.180
that included a flood wall, that
included some landscape berms,

00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:31.730
and some beach nourishment,
and things like that.

00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:35.830
And the great thing about
this is, since the NOAA--

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:41.040
the NOAA funded research that
we did lasted for six years.

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:45.650
And then Paul and
NOAH-- N-O-A-H,

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:49.180
which is the neighborhood of
affordable housing community

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:53.460
advocacy group in East Boston--
went and got a Kresge grant.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:58.230
Yeah, so we were funded by NOAA
and we were working with NOAH.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:05.330
It was hard-- N-O-A-A, N-O-A-H--
so, got a Kresge to actually

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.250
develop a real adaptation
plan for the city of Boston.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.682
And then very recently, the
Coastal Zone Management--

00:26:12.682 --> 00:26:15.140
it's hard, that's kind of washed
out-- but the Coastal Zone

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.330
Management has given
the city of Boston money

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:25.110
to actually start designing
protection for East Boston.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.970
And that includes-- so one
of the things that came out

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:30.270
of this model-- we have--
so you saw the flood

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:35.250
maps from the model
that showed flooding,

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.720
and the probabilities, and the
depths at different places.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.800
The other thing that the model
shows you is flood pathways.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.840
So there are places
along the coast that

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.140
are an entryway, that if
you block that entryway,

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.180
you can actually save a lot
of the flooding behind it.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.930
So what the Coastal Zone
Management-- Massachusetts

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:55.100
Coastal Zone Management
has actually given money--

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:59.080
a grant to the city of
Boston to develop designs

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:02.270
for closing those gaps.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.670
So one of the gaps
was the flood pathway

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:07.750
that leads to all that flooding
that happens in the East Boston

00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:08.590
Greenway.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.050
The other is a
flood pathway that

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:14.320
leads to flooding that comes in
up by the Schrafft's building

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.970
up in Sullivan square.

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.850
And that leads,
ultimately, to water

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.160
that gets behind the
Charles River dam.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.580
So you close these two
flood pathways and you

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.830
save a lot of flooding.

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.660
So you don't have to do all
of that individual home flood

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:29.380
proofing.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.890
So I really like this East
Boston project because it

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.730
started by talking with the
residents, and now has ended--

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:39.300
is currently in design stage.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:42.480
So it was really a
great example of how

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.370
you can work with a
whole bunch of people

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:46.411
and come out with something
that's actually going

00:27:46.411 --> 00:27:48.470
to happen-- be on the ground.

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.960
So I'm going to end there.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:54.640
My colleague, Paul
Kershen, started this work

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:58.300
in East Boston
with a study called

00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:02.180
"Climate's Long-term
Impacts on Metro Boston."

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:04.280
And one of the take
away messages from that

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.480
was that, "The most
expensive option, when

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:08.910
dealing with climate
change, is to do nothing."

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.611
so that's what I wanted
to leave you with.

00:28:11.611 --> 00:28:15.348
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:18.600
- Thank you very much.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:21.350
So we have time for
questions allocated.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:23.390
They're bringing the
mic up to the front.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:29.807
So we ask that you line up,
and identify yourself, and ask

00:28:29.807 --> 00:28:30.390
your question.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.840
I wanted to-- I don't
know if it's out of key

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.550
to talk about another
town in the area.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:40.060
But-- so every winter
, there's a nor'easter.

00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.480
And we see these news
things of Scituate.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:43.980
- Yes.

00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:49.610
- And it just kind of boggles
my mind that it's there.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.500
And I just don't know what
will become of Scituate

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.190
in the future in 2070.

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.500
- Well, Scituate's been the
focus of a lot of-- I mean,

00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:01.190
Coastal Zone Management, they've
done a lot of monitoring there.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.750
They're doing a lot of
site-specific evaluations

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.190
of how to protect Scituate.

00:29:06.190 --> 00:29:09.790
Because it's just the
geometry of the embankment

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:13.091
there, that-- they get blasted.

00:29:13.091 --> 00:29:14.340
They're just unlucky, I guess.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.390
- OK, so we'll take
our first question.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.400
- Hi, I'm Melissa
Goodman from Harvard,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.960
and this year from Radcliffe.

00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.530
And my question
is, in Chicago-- I

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:24.600
know that in the middle
of the 19th century,

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.500
they raised Chicago up-- all
the buildings and all the land,

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.740
about six feet because
Lake Michigan smells.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:37.520
But anyway, I'm curious whether
actually raising the city

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:40.532
is just so expensive
or so impossible

00:29:40.532 --> 00:29:42.240
that that's not even
part of these plans.

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.730
Or is part of that
thinking in there?

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:49.430
- Well we haven't gotten to--
so what most agencies in Boston

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.960
and entities in Boston
have done at this point is,

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:55.730
either they're in the process of
or have completed vulnerability

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.920
assessments to know exactly
what is vulnerable in the city.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.430
And the city of
Cambridge and a lot

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:04.890
of communities along the coast
are doing these vulnerability

00:30:04.890 --> 00:30:07.320
assessments, looking at
different levels of sea level

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.370
rise, and saying,
OK, what buildings

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.920
are going to get flooded,
and things like that.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.580
Now, once those vulnerability
assessments are done

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.660
and we're getting to
the end of that phase,

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:19.520
that's when the hard
part comes to try

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.750
to figure out what to do.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:23.786
I've heard people talking
about raising the city.

00:30:23.786 --> 00:30:25.160
There's another
thing that people

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.868
have talked about for
the last, probably,

00:30:26.868 --> 00:30:30.770
20 or 30 years, about putting
a barrier along the harbor

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:31.470
islands.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.880
So those are the
kinds of things,

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.463
now, that we're going
to have to start

00:30:34.463 --> 00:30:36.360
looking at the feasibility of.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:39.030
There's all those ideas, but
is it really feasible to do it?

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:43.480
So I don't have the answer
yet, but maybe in 10 years.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:44.970
- Next.

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.560
- My name is Ned Bacon.

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.500
That last comment goes
directly to my question.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.940
I'm aware there's been
a lot of studies--

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.610
there's been a lot of
talking about the problem

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:59.530
here in Boston, which
is the really easy part.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:00.180
- Right.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.566
Talking is always easy, right?

00:31:01.566 --> 00:31:02.300
- Yeah.

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.550
And at the same time, I see
this enormous amount of building

00:31:06.550 --> 00:31:10.320
that's going on, particularly
down in the seaport district.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.490
And I'm wondering if the people
who are doing that-- or you

00:31:14.490 --> 00:31:17.660
see General Electric
coming in and getting

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.620
financial concessions
from the city,

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:24.120
as opposed to contributing
to a potential solution

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.610
to this problem.

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:28.950
I'm wondering if
those-- I don't know

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:33.240
if you're in touch with the
developers in that community,

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.385
but are they living in
a parallel universe?

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.770
- Well I can't-- I have given
these talks so many times that

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:44.380
I can't believe they're
living in a parallel universe.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:47.595
So one of the reasons
that the Boston--

00:31:47.595 --> 00:31:51.880
that the BRAG-- the Climate
Ready Boston Initiative

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.800
came out was to
really focus on Boston

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:59.170
and figure out what's
vulnerable, and how much,

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.710
and what needs to be done.

00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:07.600
And this Mass DOT study that
I showed you was done-- funded

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.300
by Mass DOT and the Federal
Highway Administration,

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.290
but it's also available
to pretty much anybody who

00:32:13.290 --> 00:32:15.630
wants to use that
information to figure out

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:16.990
what their vulnerability is.

00:32:16.990 --> 00:32:19.250
So the information's out there.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.480
The city is not,
to my knowledge--

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.300
now, I'm a hydrologist,
I'm not a policy person--

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:29.380
but to my knowledge, the city
is requiring that people who

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.070
build-- they're requiring
that they account

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.810
for climate change in some way.

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:40.090
But they're not
specifying how they do it.

00:32:40.090 --> 00:32:43.650
And I know there's been a lot
of murmuring about the fact

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:48.907
that General Electric is
building this big building

00:32:48.907 --> 00:32:51.240
in the middle of the seaport
where you see there's going

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.050
to be a 50% chance of flooding.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:56.730
And so I've heard talk about
making the first floor 12 feet

00:32:56.730 --> 00:32:59.970
instead of 8 feet, so that they
can actually lose the bottom 4

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:03.200
feet and still have an 8 foot
structure-- things like that.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.920
So I don't believe that
people are unaware,

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.820
but it's certainly
not stopping them.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.159
That's all I can say.

00:33:10.159 --> 00:33:12.200
There are a lot of people
that shake their heads.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.450
Yes?

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.449
- Hi, how are you doing?

00:33:13.449 --> 00:33:15.960
Matt [? Mulvy. ?] I'm
a Division Commander

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:18.690
in the first Northern District
for the Coast Guard auxiliary.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.830
But I wear another hat
with the Department

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:23.500
of Defense in the Air Force.

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.340
And I'm dealing with a lot
of potential construction

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.250
on the Atlantic coast.

00:33:30.250 --> 00:33:32.860
And looking at the
FEMA maps, should I

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.600
add another foot or two to those
when I'm looking at base flood

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:37.090
elevations?

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:38.850
- To the FEMA maps-- well, yeah.

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:42.530
So FEMA is-- (LAUGHING) how
much you gonna pay me for this?

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:45.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:47.870
- Well the projects
we do, we expect

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.320
them to last 30 or 40 years.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.320
And I don't want to go
into some building that's

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:53.850
got four feet of water
in it based off the maps

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:54.900
that we have now.

00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:58.225
Yeah, so the FEMA maps simply
look backwards in time.

00:33:58.225 --> 00:34:00.100
They don't incorporate
climate change at all.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.080
So FEMA maps are developed
using the historical data.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.520
And this is by law.

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.880
I mean, FEMA has no choice.

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.050
This is how Congress
designated that they

00:34:08.050 --> 00:34:10.252
would develop these flood
insurance rate maps.

00:34:10.252 --> 00:34:11.960
They look in the
history, they figure out

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.626
what's the probability
of flooding given

00:34:13.626 --> 00:34:16.110
our historical
record-- 100 year,

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:19.280
500 year-- so that's the
1% chance and the point .2%

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:22.130
chance of flooding.

00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:24.760
What you add to that--
that's one of the reasons

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.000
we did this big
model for Boston,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.290
because we added sea
level rise into Boston

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:32.760
and allowed the model to
simulate storm surge, and wave

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.190
actions, and things like that.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:37.050
Because there are a lot of
other things besides sea level

00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:41.409
that's going to
impact the coastline.

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:43.710
And so what you add
to the FEMA maps,

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:48.489
if you're going to do that,
all depends on how vulnerable--

00:34:48.489 --> 00:34:49.929
how much risk you can take.

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:53.540
So if you have a system--
if you have a building that,

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.610
if it gets flooded,
oh well, it's messy.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:00.700
But you just clean it out
and you put stuff back,

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.800
then you could probably handle a
5% or a 10% chance of flooding.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.649
But if you have something
like the Big Dig,

00:35:07.649 --> 00:35:10.190
where people drive through it,
and you don't want to fill up,

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.270
then that has a very low risk.

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.170
I mean, you could only handle
a very low risk of flooding.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:17.732
So those sea level rise
projections, remember,

00:35:17.732 --> 00:35:19.690
that I showed you-- those
things that tailed up

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:22.520
depending on what the emission
scenarios looks like-- you have

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.920
to make a decision
as to how much risk

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.890
you are willing to take.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.080
And then, based on
that, the lower the risk

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:33.520
you can take the higher, you
have to raise your elevation.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:38.110
So I can't give a
one-line answer to that.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:40.740
And I wouldn't anyway,
because I'm not getting paid.

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.640
No, I'm just kidding.
(LAUGHING) I don't know

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:46.350
if that answered the
questions, sorry.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.900
- So I'm Pete Girguis
on the faculty here.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:53.730
So this is all in the
context of flooding.

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:56.654
But I'm really thrilled
to be able to ask

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:57.820
a hydrologist this question.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:36:02.497
So what are the potential
impacts on freshwater?

00:36:02.497 --> 00:36:04.580
In other words, as we start
to see sea level rise,

00:36:04.580 --> 00:36:07.430
are we going to have--
see impacts on freshwater,

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:09.930
on our water table, and do you
have a sense of how extensive

00:36:09.930 --> 00:36:10.595
that might be?

00:36:10.595 --> 00:36:11.110
Thank you.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:12.650
- Yeah, that's a
really good question.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:14.800
So I have been-- it's
interesting, I'm a hydrologist

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.820
and I got involved in sea level
rise for the last 10 years,

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:19.403
and I'm finally getting to the
point where I can start looking

00:36:19.403 --> 00:36:20.860
at freshwater impacts again.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.630
So in Boston and in
many coastal cities,

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:27.062
we have those that duel impact.

00:36:27.062 --> 00:36:28.770
We have the ocean
coming in from one side

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.000
and we have rivers
with flood waters

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.250
coming in from the other side.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.070
And we also have
storm drains, right?

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.880
Where do the storm drains end?

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.490
In the ocean, usually.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.630
And when they were built,
it was above high tide.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:42.550
Well when the high
tide rises to the point

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:45.350
where it plugs up the end,
then that storm water that

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.720
comes in-- usually when
we have a storm come in,

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.240
and we get a storm
surge, and so it goes

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.750
above the elevation of the
outlet of the storm drain,

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:54.932
and so water can't flow
out there anymore--

00:36:54.932 --> 00:36:57.140
we also have a lot of
precipitation falling and a lot

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.070
of storm water that's trying
to get out of that drain

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:04.990
and can't because it's being
blocked by the storm tide.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:07.900
And so what happens is
the water just backs up.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:12.890
So the combination of freshwater
flooding and ocean flooding

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:15.750
is going to be that,
upstream, there's

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.560
going to be a lot
more flooding upstream

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:21.530
and upriver because the water
just can't get out the way

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:22.580
that it would normally.

00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:25.930
Now in the Charles-- we
have the Charles River dam

00:37:25.930 --> 00:37:32.690
that was actually developed,
designed with 6 massive pumps

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.840
that were designed to pump the
largest flood that was ever

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.261
recorded on the Charles.

00:37:37.261 --> 00:37:38.760
So the Charles River
dam is actually

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:43.040
going to be OK for a
while, up until 2060, 2065.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.580
It's going to be able
to maintain that level.

00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:47.894
But the storm drains and
all the smaller rivers

00:37:47.894 --> 00:37:49.810
are likely going to see
more flooding upstream

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:52.775
because of that.

00:37:52.775 --> 00:37:57.450
- Lisa [? Tripp-- ?]
what about the airport?

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:00.380
I notice it's close to
what you put on your map

00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:02.880
but doesn't involve it.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.950
Is it somehow immune from--

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:06.890
- No.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:08.770
No.

00:38:08.770 --> 00:38:10.070
- -- all these floods?

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.200
- No, actually it's not.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.570
And that's a very good question.

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.860
So the maps that I showed
you were made for Mass DOT,

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.840
so we basically
masked out anything

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.190
that was outside of
Mass DOT infrastructure.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:24.030
But Massport asked that
question a long time ago,

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:25.240
what about the airport?

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:28.140
So actually, they've
used a lot of the output

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:30.995
from the model that
was built for Mass DOT.

00:38:30.995 --> 00:38:33.620
And one of the things that Mass
DOT right from the beginning is

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:35.328
say, we're going to
make this information

00:38:35.328 --> 00:38:37.630
available to other agencies
and other communities that

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.505
want to use it for
their own, because it's

00:38:39.505 --> 00:38:41.630
the best available information
right now that there

00:38:41.630 --> 00:38:43.450
is in the Boston area.

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:46.270
And so Massport has actually
done their own vulnerability

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:47.460
analysis already.

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:51.900
And that's why they bought
the temporary flood barriers,

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:56.250
because they now have a really
good idea of-- interestingly,

00:38:56.250 --> 00:39:00.290
it's not until about 2070
that the actual airport itself

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:00.890
is impacted.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:02.566
It's fairly high up.

00:39:02.566 --> 00:39:04.190
It doesn't look at
when you're landing,

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:08.080
but it's actually fairly
high up above the high tide.

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.880
But they do have vulnerability
and they actually

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:12.870
have a resiliency
officer, now, who

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.924
has implemented a
lot of strategies

00:39:14.924 --> 00:39:15.840
for dealing with that.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.070
Because the airport is
an important recovery

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:24.030
and evacuation component as
well as normal transportation.

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:26.730
- Hi, my name is Gwill York,
and I'm asking this question

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:29.460
as the chair of the Museum
of Science here in Boston--

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.760
really was happy when I've seen
these maps that the museum's OK

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.760
until 2060.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.850
So that was-- whew,
I'll be long gone.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:37.590
But I wanted to ask,
because I've now

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.920
been starting to
see, a lot of maps

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:42.310
and thinking about where
the water's going to go.

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:46.180
And the green ribbon
Commission is convening.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:50.240
And we convened all the
cultural institutions in Boston

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.010
at the Museum of Science
earlier this week

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:54.670
to talk about this because
we've got collections,

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:57.000
we have historic
buildings, we have

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.445
all kinds of different things.

00:39:58.445 --> 00:40:01.290
But I asked there
and I'm going to ask

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.410
here, who's convening everyone?

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:04.910
Because it was just Boston.

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:07.652
And I live in Cambridge,
and there's Arlington,

00:40:07.652 --> 00:40:09.360
and there's Somerville,
and there are all

00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:10.790
these different communities.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:14.580
So where's the conversation
about having us really

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.850
be coordinated?

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.040
It looks like we're,
as you said, coming up

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.600
with the end of figuring out
where the water will go if it's

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:22.430
just left, if we do nothing?

00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:26.069
But who's coordinating all this
activity of and great research

00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:27.110
and entering into action?

00:40:27.110 --> 00:40:30.220
- That's a very good question.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:33.290
You know, so,
miss, I've actually

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.240
been thinking about
this question a lot.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.170
Because as a hydrologist, I
think about storm water a lot,

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:40.440
with extreme precipitation.

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.250
And every town is responsible
for their own storm water

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.970
management.

00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:47.290
Wouldn't it make sense if all
the towns got together and came

00:40:47.290 --> 00:40:50.980
up with a plan that worked
so that everybody could sort

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:53.460
of take advantage of the
information others had

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:54.750
that all makes logical sense?

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:57.780
And actually, when it
comes to the adaptation

00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:00.350
for coastal flooding,
that's beginning to happen.

00:41:00.350 --> 00:41:03.260
So because the flooding
is so extensive

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:06.610
and it gets worse
over time, people

00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:08.700
within city of Boston and
surrounding communities

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:09.950
are starting to work together.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.780
There's this-- I forget
what it's called,

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.970
but there's a group of mayors
in Boston and surrounding

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:15.860
communities.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.270
It's called the Mayor's
Summit or something like that.

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:19.300
I should know the answer
to the name of that.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.900
But anyway, they've
gotten together

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.850
to commit to working together
to come up with a plan.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:27.400
The same thing has to happen in
other areas of climate change

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.620
impact with precipitation, and
flooding, and things like that.

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:33.320
I don't think it's happening
yet because one of the drivers,

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.600
here in New England,
as we are a home rule

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.980
place-- so every
town has jurisdiction

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:41.855
over their own things--
and people don't always

00:41:41.855 --> 00:41:43.980
like to work with other
people because, number one,

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.396
it's kind of
overwhelming to think

00:41:45.396 --> 00:41:47.310
about dealing with
somebody else's problem

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:49.100
when I can barely
deal with my own.

00:41:49.100 --> 00:41:52.050
But I think we're going to
have no choice but to move

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:53.986
towards that.

00:41:53.986 --> 00:41:55.360
But I don't think
it's happening.

00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:57.693
It's beginning to happen, but
it's not happening as much

00:41:57.693 --> 00:41:59.480
as it should, probably, yet.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:02.890
But the more we talk
about this stuff, it will.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:04.090
OK, thank Ellen again.

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:04.990
