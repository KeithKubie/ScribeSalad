&gt;&gt;Presenter: Hi everyone, I’m Catherine
Eng and I’m on the Authors at Google team

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.580
here at Google Los Angeles.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.500
It’s my pleasure, today, to welcome Gustavo
Arellano to our campus today to talk about

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.539
his new book “Taco USA: How Mexican Food
Conquered America.”

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:22.529
Gustavo is the editor of OC Weekly, an alternative
newspaper in Orange County, California, and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.839
he’s the author of “Orange County: A Personal
History”, a frequent commentator for L.A.

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.400
Times and Marketplace, a lecturer with the
Chicana and Chicano Studies department at

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.570
Cal-State Fullerton.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.640
Gustavo also writes the very popular and nationally
syndicated column “Ask a Mexican” in which

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.809
he answers any and all questions about America’s
spiciest and largest minority.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.850
This award winning column has a circulation
of over 2 million in 39 newspapers across

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.060
the U.S. and was published in book form in
May of 2007.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:02.550
Gustavo is a long, lifelong resident of Orange
County and is a proud son of two Mexican immigrants,

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.040
one of whom was illegal.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.530
Please help me welcome Gustavo Arellano.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.530
[Applause]

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.130
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Thank you, thank you.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.190
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Thank you.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.690
I would first like to thank you for all the
contributions you’ve made to the understanding

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.030
of the Mexican culture and, you know, the
format that you’ve put it in is just really

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.030
unique and special.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.430
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Thank you, I appreciate
it.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.430
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Thank you.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.850
One of the first questions we have is why
are so many Mexican foods like chili and salsa

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.960
and tacos, of course, been turned into a national
and international money maker and yet, from

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.880
an outsiders view, not a lot of that money
is being filtered back into Mexico?

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.720
What are your thoughts on that?

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.070
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: What, the book, “Taco
USA” I address that.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:55.020
There’s this misconception that it’s only
rapacious Americans who are making all this

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:03.120
money on Mexican food or Mexican food stuffs
like Tequila, like hot sauce, tortillas, Fritos,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.550
Doritos and all these different things, but
that’s not necessarily true.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.550
What happens is, when it comes to food or
the production of food, it’s a business

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.710
and business is capitalism and capitalism
is rapacious, so in the book you have everyone

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.300
ripping everyone off.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.520
Mexicans ripping off Mexicans, Americans ripping
off Mexicans, Mexicans ripping off Americans,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.200
Koreans coming in and ripping off Mexicans,
Mexicans coming in and ripping off Koreans

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.360
and when I first started doing this book,
part of me, you know, you have that sort of

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.850
jingoistic thing like no person other than
a Mexican can make Mexican food, everything

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.850
else is fake.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.100
But that’s not the case, food is food is
food.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.569
I think what matters, ultimately, is the foods
good, after that, I mean, you cannot ding

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.850
someone for ripping someone else off.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.070
I mean, they’ll get theirs in the afterlife
but

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.160
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: here in the terrestrial

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.900
world, they would do it too.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.790
One example I had was Taco Bell.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.410
We all know what Taco Bell is, of course.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.610
They got, Glen Bell, the founder of Taco Bell,
he got his idea for making these tacos from

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.370
a restaurant in San Bernardino that still
exists, Mitla Café, it’s on the corner

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.380
Mount Vernon and Sixth Street, now celebrating,
in San Bernardino, celebrating its 75th anniversary.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.640
So that kind of sucks, okay, that’s fine,
but then at the same time I also interviewed

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.200
the founder of El Torito, Larry Cano, who
is a Mexican guy and he admitted to me his

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.400
business strategy was he would tell his trusted
employees, “Okay, you’re gonna find Mexican

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.710
restaurants around the United States that
are popular, you’re gonna get a job at those

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.640
restaurants, you’re gonna work there for
a month, you’re gonna steal all their secrets,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.130
then you’re gonna get fired and then you’re
gonna come back to me and we’re gonna rip

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.130
em’ off.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.760
So, you know, it goes both ways.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.760
[Laughs]

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:42.760
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Nice.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.760
That’s great.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.230
Also, in “Taco USA” you talk about the
history of Mexican food in the United States

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.840
and its evolution.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.300
Everywhere from the TamaleMan to the Chili
Queens to Taco Bell and Tex-Mex food that

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.040
you were saying, what are your thoughts on
authentic, on authenticity and how people

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:07.160
really kind of portray that theirs is authentic
and yet they’re doing it here in the United

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.890
States so how authentic could it be?

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.890
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Exactly.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.709
When it comes to food there’s always going
to be that question of authenticity.

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.470
What is authentic, what isn’t?

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.569
And the funny thing is, most people, they
really do care about that question and they’re

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.460
incredibly passionate about it.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.419
I was one of those people, again, before I
started doing this book I was one of those

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.000
people that there’s real Mexican food and
then there’s fake Mexican food.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.410
But as I started doing the research for the
book, doing the research for the book took

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:39.240
me about two years, well, a lifetime of eating
Mexican food with two years of actual intense

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.800
research via eating Mexican food all across
United States.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.940
It quickly dawned on me that people’s idea
of what, quote unquote, Mexican food is, is

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:53.610
completely different, yet at the same time
everyone assumed that their Mexican food was

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.240
not only the authentic version but the version
that everyone else ate.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.669
I’ll give you an example, I travel a lot
to Denver, Denver’s one of my favorite cities

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.310
to travel, it’s just a great atmosphere.

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.349
So, over there, the Mexican food is absolutely
crazy.

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.800
Chile Rellenos which we all know what they
are, here in Southern California they’re

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.080
stuffed chilies with cheese and you fry them
in egg batter and voilà, there you have it.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.789
In Denver, you have that but instead of white
cheese it’s yellow cheese, instead of like

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:27.879
the big Anaheim Chilies that we use they’re
smaller squatter chilies from Southern Colorado.

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.759
They put the egg batter, sure, but then on
top of that they wrap it in won ton skin then

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:34.819
fry it and there’s your chile relleno.

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:35.819
That’s one dish.

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:38.800
A much crazier dish is something called the
Mexican hamburger.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.120
A Mexican hamburger is a burrito of beans
and chicharrones, pork rinds, with a hamburger

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.229
patty right in the middle.

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:51.740
Then they serve it to you on a dish and they
cover it in chili, in chili gravy.

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.069
And there, we would call it a wet burrito,
over there they call it a smothered burrito

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:01.080
and it’s covered in this chili gravy that
is orange, bright, bright orange, for the

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.659
Broncos, they love the Broncos so much.

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:05.509
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: It is an amazing dish.

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:09.889
It is an absolutely amazing dish, yet it exists
nowhere else in the United States.

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:13.090
So, when I first found out about the Mexican
hamburger, I asked, “What’s a Mexican

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:14.090
hamburger?”

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.090
They would look at me.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:16.789
“You mean you don’t have them in Southern
California?”

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.350
I’m like, “No, guys.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:19.350
You guys only have it in Denver.”

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.979
And then they got really sad about that.

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.710
They’re like, “Oh, we thought everyone
knew what a Mexican hamburger was.”

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.320
So you go all across the United States and
everyone has this idea of what’s authentic

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.320
and what’s not.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.740
So, ultimately, we’re reduced to having
to acknowledge that there is no such thing

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.330
as authentic Mexican food.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.419
It’s authentic if you say it’s authentic
but really it’s not authentic.

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:42.020
It’s like this existential morass that we
should never really get out of, right?

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.659
Similarly, what matter is, is the food good?

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:50.100
And if it’s good, good for you, and the
great thing, though, about, all this said,

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.630
that question of authenticity is what’s
driven American consumption of Mexican food.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:00.379
There’s always been, in the mind of Americans,
they’ve always known that the Mexican food

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:04.660
in front of them, that it’s great, but there’s
better Mexican food somewhere down the path.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.479
That’s been the course of Mexican food in
this country for over 125 years starting with

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:13.659
tamales, going with what we know now as just
chili in a can, it used to be called Chili

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:19.319
Con Carne, going through Taco Bell, at one
point people thought Taco Bell was quote unquote,

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:22.229
authentic food, or the most authentic food
you could find.

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:26.810
And, of course, every decade there’s a new
Mexican food stuff that comes in to be the

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:28.569
new authentic Mexican food.

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:32.129
In the '80s it was fajitas, now fajitas are
as American as Doritos.

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:33.569
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Absolutely.

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:40.129
And, you know, I’ve noticed in a lot, you
know, of the Carl's Junior commercials and

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:45.559
some of the brands that are out there now,
that the Chipotle Chili is like the end all

00:07:45.559 --> 00:07:46.559
to chilies.

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:49.029
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: And that one is just really,

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:52.990
it’s got a great smoky flavor but as far
as depth of flavor compared to all the other

00:07:52.990 --> 00:08:00.770
chilies like the Guajillo and Cascabel, you
know, is it ignorance on their part or is

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.839
it just lack of experimentation?

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:04.839
What is your thought on that?

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:07.059
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: I don’t think it’s
ignorance as much as they just haven’t been

00:08:07.059 --> 00:08:08.059
exposed to it.

00:08:08.059 --> 00:08:11.419
And, of course, I guess that’s ignorance
in a way where if there’s something in front

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:15.270
of you and you don’t know it that’s ignorance,
but at the same time, as you know, with foods

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:16.800
there’s different trends that come in.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:19.340
There’s different trends that fall in and
out of flavor.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:24.629
So, for the longest time the only chili that
Americans knew, well no, the first quote unquote

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:29.570
chili that Americans knew came from Mexico,
was a Tabasco pepper that they would eat in

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.300
their Tabasco hot sauce.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:36.750
Then it became chili powder, just chili powder,
you created from, was it Tabasco pepper?

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.300
I don’t think it was Tabasco pepper, other
peppers from Northern Mexico.

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.360
Then it became hot sauce.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.360
That, for them, was their perception of peppers.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.459
Oh, then, of course, just chili peppers from
New Mexico.

00:08:46.459 --> 00:08:51.040
Which we now know is the Ortega pepper or
Anaheim chili that came from New Mexico.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.750
So these were all different traditions that
would come into the United States.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:00.649
Then, of course, the Jalapeño comes in once
nachos became popular in the 1970s, all of

00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:01.829
a sudden people were eating jalapeños.

00:09:01.829 --> 00:09:05.680
Then Chipotle, the chipotle pepper not the
Chipotle burrito chain that really kicked

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.870
in, in the late 1990s and so forth.

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.880
But now you’re starting to see more peppers
come out habanero, people are starting to

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:14.650
realize what habaneros are, you’re having
these habanero eating contests.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:19.660
Google YouTube there’s this great clip,
I think it’s this 13 year old boy he’s

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:23.579
like, “I’m gonna eat a habanero” and
he chomps, he bites into it full on and then

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:26.180
within 20 seconds his face turns crimson.

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.180
He’s like, “Ahh!”

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.180
[Laughter]

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.180
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Well, typical teenager
going

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:32.040
[Makes monster-type noise]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: But people are realizing

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.040
that.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.490
Did these peppers become invented in those
decades?

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.470
Of course not, they’ve always existed in
the United States.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:43.300
One big thing though that’s happened is
those peppers come up along with Mexicans.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:49.430
Or, rather, get into the main stream so the
chipotle pepper, it’s most famous use is

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.570
around central Mexico with Poblano cuisine,
Chilango cuisine, food from Mexico City.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:59.329
That, those traditions didn’t really penetrate
the mainstream of the united States until,

00:09:59.329 --> 00:10:05.070
really, the 1970s and 80s with Rick Bayless
and Diana Kennedy and other chefs, you know,

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.970
here in Southern Califor--, or just here in
Santa Monica actually, the Two Hot Tamales.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:15.420
But they really didn’t explode into the
American consciousness until Chipotle, the

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.030
Chipotle burrito chain, which interestingly
enough doesn’t use chipotles.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.170
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Right.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.740
And that’s what leads me to my next question.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:29.500
You know, you talk about the hot sauces and
sauces in modern day cuisine and, you know,

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:35.720
what is, you know, and the habanero we were
talking about, you know, at what point does

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.791
burn your insides out
[Laughter]

00:10:36.791 --> 00:10:41.769
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: and look how much heat I
can take supersede the flavor and the balance

00:10:41.769 --> 00:10:43.579
of a well balanced salsa.

00:10:43.579 --> 00:10:45.649
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Exactly.

00:10:45.649 --> 00:10:49.980
Americans, the world really, the world has
always been enticed by heat, by spices.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:54.490
That’s what made Columbus, so they told
me elementary school, sail the ocean blue,

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:57.069
“Oh we need to get some pepper and salt
and what not.”

00:10:57.069 --> 00:11:01.350
And then when it comes to the chili pepper,
Americans have always been entranced by it

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.680
but also scared by it.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.639
So they’re like, “Oh my gosh!” like,
“It’s gonna kill us.”

00:11:05.639 --> 00:11:12.130
In fact, the first, the very first write ups
of Mexican food in the United States, they

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:13.170
were negative.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:17.480
They were from scouts who were going across
what’s now the American Southwest during

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:20.949
the Texan War for Independence and also before
the Mexican-American War.

00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:29.160
They would write these dispatches that would
say, what was it, oh okay, that after the

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:34.519
Texan war, after one battle, that the vultures
or buzzards, they wouldn’t eat the corpses

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:40.250
of dead Mexican soldiers because Mexicans
eat chili pepper and if the vultures would

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:46.079
eat their corpses they would die because their
flesh was so spicy and so filled with peppers

00:11:46.079 --> 00:11:47.079
that they would die.

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:52.101
And later on, through the 1850’s, 1860’s
you still had this urban legend that if you,

00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:56.910
you know, in Texas wherever there were corpses
of dead Mexicans, you shouldn’t have your

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:01.320
cows eat on the grass there because the cows,
cause that chili pepper, it’s still there

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.820
and the cows are gonna eat it and they’re
gonna die.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.589
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: So Americans, so part

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:07.519
of that it’s like they’ve always known
that about Mexican food, that it’s super

00:12:07.519 --> 00:12:08.519
spicy.

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:12.610
So that masochistic tendency in our culture,
you wanna eat the spiciest, hottest thing

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.610
alive.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:16.610
That’s where you have your chili contests,
chili, you know, chili with beans or, no,

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.810
no not with beans, don’t talk to Texans
about that.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:21.330
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: But the, chili, you know,

00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:26.689
chili cookouts and so forth, but at the same
time, again, Americans, when it comes to Mexican

00:12:26.689 --> 00:12:30.629
food, they don’t just eat what’s in front
of them, they won’t just accept it.

00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:32.819
They always want something more.

00:12:32.819 --> 00:12:38.660
That’s one thing that critics of fast food
Mexican, they’ve never got the American

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.520
palate, the American palate is much more refined
than we give them credit for.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.550
We used to, Americans used to eat something
called taco sauce.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:51.770
Taco sauce basically tomato paste with vinegar
and a little bit of chili, it’s pretty disgusting,

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:53.259
you should not eat taco sauce.

00:12:53.259 --> 00:12:58.670
But Americans ate that for decades and decades
until other consumer, or, other marketers,

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:05.260
rather, other producers started making better
hot sauce; Tapatio, Cholula and onward, and

00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.540
those became multimillion dollar empires as
well.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:12.240
And, you know, you taste Tapatio, it’s not
gonna fry you; it has a certain flavor to

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240
it.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.600
And then on top of that you skip over actual
fresh produced salsas, you know, freshly made

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:24.050
salsas, go to Trader Joes, go to Whole Foods,
you have whole aisles full of these really

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:25.149
tasteful salsas.

00:13:25.149 --> 00:13:29.630
So, again, on one part, Americans do wanna
get fried by Mexican food but on the other

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:31.660
hand, you also want the best possible experience
imaginable.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.670
And that’s the great thing about Mexican
food, that you have the whole panoply of experiences

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:37.170
all within this one cuisine.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:38.430
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Yeah.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:43.480
It’s funny you bring up the Tapatio and
one of the first questions I get, and you

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:48.970
touch upon this in your book a little bit,
is about the, about the charro who’s on

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:53.050
the front of the bottle and I always get the
question, “Why does he have blue eyes?”

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:54.050
[Laughter]

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.380
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: They give him, Tapatio,
of course, is amazing hot sauce.

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.040
We all know it here in Southern California,
it’s a little Mexican with a massive sombrero

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:03.660
with a smile and yes, he has blue eyes.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:08.930
And the reason he has blue eyes is, it’s
in regards to, the word Tapatio, Tapatio refers

00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:14.389
to somebody, it’s a nickname for somebody
from the city of Guadalajara in Jalisco.

00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:17.839
Jalisco, I like to describe Jalisco as the
Texas of Mexico.

00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:21.600
It’s a place that, it’s a really great
place but people there, they think a little

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.720
bit too highly of themselves but at the same
time they have that right to do that.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.660
Jalisco is that birthplace of Tequila, Jalisco
is the birthplace of mariachi and as it so

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.639
happens to be, Jalisco is also a place where
you have a lot of very light skinned Mexicans

00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:37.649
with blue hair, or blue hair
[Laughter]

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:39.769
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Blue eyes and blond hair.

00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:45.970
So a lot of people say, “Oh, typical Mexicans
always trying to scrub off their brown skin.”

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:51.060
But you talk to the founders of Tapatio who
actually come from Mexico City but they spent

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:56.500
a couple years in Jalisco but they said, “Well,
no, this is how the people from Jalisco look

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.540
like so we’re just depicting what’s truthful.”

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.540
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Right.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.930
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: But, of course, Americans
are like, “Mexicans don’t have blue eyes.”

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:05.360
So silly, so silly.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.149
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: I did notice, I’m married
into a Mexican family and I do notice that

00:15:10.149 --> 00:15:15.360
the way that Americans use Tapatio compared
to the way a lot of Mexicans use it, in my

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:20.720
wife’s family, they just use it to put on
the popcorn or maybe on some sort of potato

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:26.110
chip but not necessarily as a salsa you would
put on your taco or anything else.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.550
Has that been your experience as well?

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.019
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Absolutely.

00:15:30.019 --> 00:15:35.779
For Mexicans, hot sauce, it’s really a condiment
to use on just, on snacks.

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:40.629
So, of course, on Doritos and Fritos and now
you have Tapatio flavor Doritos and Fritos,

00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:41.910
and what do Mexicans do?

00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:46.670
They put Tapatio on those Tapatio flavored
Doritos and Fritos and popcorn, just little

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:47.670
snacks.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.790
But the great thing with a Mexican family,
usually you have somebody there who knows

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.790
how to make salsa.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:57.550
And let’s face it; salsa is much more tastier
than hot sauce.

00:15:57.550 --> 00:16:01.920
The reason why the founder of Tapatio created
Tapatio in the first place was because he

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:06.870
couldn’t bring his salsa to work because
they said, “It’s not in a bottle so it’s

00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.870
unsanitary.”

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:11.600
So he needed to create something that he could
package in a bottle so he made Tapatio.

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.420
And, of course, Americans, some Americans
do know how to make salsa but most Americans

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.379
don’t so they’ll just buy, they’ll just
go with what’s at the store and they’ll

00:16:19.379 --> 00:16:21.519
just get Tapatio and pour it.

00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:23.550
Hey, Tapatio’s great, it’s.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.889
My favorite hot sauce right now, though, is
Gringo Bandito.

00:16:26.889 --> 00:16:32.040
Gringo Bandito is a hot sauce made by Dexter
Holland of the Offspring, you know the famous

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.150
punk band?

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.600
And I kid you; well I’ll tell you the story
of Gringo Bandito.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.430
The first time someone gave me a bottle of
Gringo Bandito, it has Dexter just like the

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:45.290
charro on Tapatio, so imagine, you know, big
old sombrero, big old [inaudible] but instead

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:50.129
of a Mexican it’s Dexter Holland, you know,
blonde hair punker with sunglasses going like

00:16:50.129 --> 00:16:51.129
this with guns.

00:16:51.129 --> 00:16:52.959
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Somebody gave me the bottle

00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:54.819
and I threw it in the trash can immediately.

00:16:54.819 --> 00:16:58.449
It was that, “Oh, dumb Americans thinking
they can steal Mexican food.”

00:16:58.449 --> 00:17:03.080
But then I became smart, I got smart so about
20 minutes later I fished it out of the trash

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:08.320
can, I opened it and it’s great sal, hot
sauce, you have to have it here at Google.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.100
It’s an amazing hot sauce.

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:11.310
I would dare say it’s better than Tapatio.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.640
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Wow, that’s a bold statement.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.500
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: It is a very bold statement.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:15.500
I’ll stand by it.

00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:22.810
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: You touched upon Tequila,
um, you know, that’s a huge, huge moneymaker

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:29.560
and I know there are specific limitations
on where it’s produced, how it’s produced

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.150
and other things about, you know, how you
can call it Tequila.

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:37.630
Can you touch upon that a little bit and,
again, how come a lot of the other Mexican

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:42.310
spirits didn’t take off like the Mescal
and the Tepache and stuff like that?

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:43.490
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Oh, I love Tepache.

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:50.070
Tepache is this fermented pineapple drink
that’s cut with brown sugar, it’s absolutely

00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:51.070
amazing.

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:55.960
You have to, you can only find it here locally
at Mexico City style restaurants but you have

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.870
to try it, it’s absolutely good.

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:02.030
In my book there’s a whole chapter devoted
to Mexican alcohol and the reason that Tequila

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:06.400
is, the reason Tequila took off the way it
did, again, going back to the Jalisco methods.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.870
Why did, you know, Mexico has so many musical
traditions, why is it that mariachi got associated

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:13.140
with Mexico more than any?

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:17.770
It’s because there was a concerted effort
in the 1930s in Mexico with the Mexican government

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:21.700
when they were basically branding themselves
to the rest of the world, they made a conscious

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:25.650
effort that were gonna use most of the culture
of Jalisco because in their mind Jalisco,

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:29.521
people from Jalisco, they never inter married
with Mexicans, with Indians, they were all

00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:34.970
proud Catholic capitalists which, not necessarily
true, but those were the myths that were created.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:37.430
That’s why Tequila exploded the way it did.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:42.420
Of course the Mexican government and the Tequila
producers in Jalisco, there were more than

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.650
just Tequila producers period.

00:18:43.650 --> 00:18:45.340
They were very, very zealous.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:52.670
No, zealous isn’t really the right word
but they’re very protective of Tequila.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:57.910
So, technically, it can’t be called Tequila
unless it’s made in 5 states in Mexico;

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.850
Guanajuato, Tamaulipas, in I think Navolato

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:01.150
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Novaleo?

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:05.660
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Novaleon and another one
I can’t remember.

00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:11.380
90 percent of them are made in Jalisco which
is the birthplace Jalisco, or, the birthplace

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:12.380
of Tequila.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:16.000
Tequila is great, don’t get me wrong, I
love it, but as you know, that came at the

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.500
expense of so many other Mexican alcohols.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:21.470
It’s interesting that you mention Mescal
cause if you go to the more popular hipster

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:25.740
bars right now, you’re starting to see this
influx of Mezcal.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.520
Mezcal, Mezcal is basically the angrier cousin
of Tequila.

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:34.250
It’s made the exact same way except Mezcal’s
distilled once and Tequila’s distilled at

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:35.250
least twice.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:39.690
So Mezcal’s much smokier, I think it’s
better than Tequila, frankly.

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:44.263
So that’s just taking off but Mezcal, the
first famous Mexican restaurant in the United

00:19:44.263 --> 00:19:48.430
States was a rest--, was a pop up restaurant
operated by Buffalo Bill of Buffalo Bill’s

00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:53.500
Wild West Show, and on his menu he was serving
Mezcal in 1886 in New York City.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.500
So hipsters who think, “Oh I created something.”

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.540
Uh oh, Buffalo Bill beat you more than a century
ago.

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:01.510
But other great, other great alcohols; Sotol.

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:06.720
Sotol is this, oh my God I can’t even describe
it but it’s this amazing liquor, or not

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:15.050
liquor but it’s amazing alcohol from Chihuahua
made from, basically made from this dry shrub

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:17.080
from the desert of Chihuahua.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.340
There’s one I think that’ll never take
off, Pulque, Pulque is the oldest, one of

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:26.610
the oldest alcohols known to man that’s
made from fermenting the sap of the maguey

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:30.490
plant where Tequila comes from and I don’t
think it’ll ever take off cause it’s basically

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.850
like drinking alcoholic spit.

00:20:32.850 --> 00:20:34.380
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: It’s very frothy.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:36.430
It’s really good, it’s an acquired taste.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:41.530
It’s very frothy but it’s never gonna
take off, then again, I guarantee you if not

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:45.930
next, if not this year but next you’ll start
seeing Pulquerias or some Pulque up here in

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.340
the United States in the hipster bars.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.200
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: That’s amazing.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:54.610
I, you know, hand in hand with drinking Tequila,
like you mentioned, is mariachi music.

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:58.220
And growing up in kitchens myself, you know,
listening to La Nueva

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.170
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: And K-Love and going home

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:05.850
and watching Novelas, that’s how I learned
Spanish and I learned it in a very kind of

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.460
rude way.

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.120
And when I married into the Mexican family
I was very, very timid about speaking Spanish

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:19.050
to my mother-in-law, my father-in-law, but
they were just happy I was trying.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:20.530
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:25.720
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: And you touch in your book,
and mention how a big attitude of Americans

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.910
is like, “How come they’re not learning
how to speak English?”

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:36.010
To where back in the day the immigrants would
definitely learn how to speak English and

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.090
try to get the accent down.

00:21:37.090 --> 00:21:40.930
And now it seems to be almost the opposite
like we wanna know how to speak Spanish the

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:41.930
right way.

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:42.930
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: All the cool words and stuff

00:21:42.930 --> 00:21:43.930
like that.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:44.970
What’s your thoughts on that?

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:48.320
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah, I talk about that
a lot in my 'Ask a Mexican'' book.

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.140
This idea of how Mexicans, they never simulate
into the United States, that the only part,

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:57.000
that the only part that Mexicans, that simulate
into the Mexi-, into the United States is

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.290
food because Americans love Mexican food.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.840
They might not like Mexicans all the time
but they love their Mexican food.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.880
But that’s false.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.600
I mean, that’s demonstrably false.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:12.420
I’m the child of Mexican immigrants like
in my bio, my Dad came to this country in

00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:16.530
the trunk of a Chevy in 1968 and that was
the first time he came here illegally.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.710
He knows how to speak English but he lives
his entire life in Spanish.

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:24.520
I’d say 95 per, 95 percent of the time,
he’s speaking in Spanish, although, he’ll

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.380
only speak English if he absolutely has to
which most of the times he doesn’t have

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.380
to.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:31.790
The first language I spoke when I entered
Kindergarten was Spanish.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:36.630
Now I’m bilingual but I prefer English over
Spanish and I’ll only speak Spanish if I

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:37.850
have to.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:42.180
And I want my children, if I ever have children,
I want my children to speak Spanish but I

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.830
know they’re all gonna speak English and
they’ll probably have a name like Brittany

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:45.830
or Jonathon.

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:46.830
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: or something like that.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:51.430
But that’s the great thing about modern
day America is that in the past you might

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.430
have had that nasty, that really xenophobia
where people would be made fun of if they

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:57.120
can’t speak one language or another.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.620
But nowadays at least people, our generation,
we’re cool.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.090
Like, if your parents don’t speak English
that’s fine.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:04.960
In fact, you wanna learn other languages.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:10.490
Like me, I’m in Orange County, I’ve learned
just cobbling together bits and pieces a little

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:15.030
bit of Vietnamese, I’ve learned how to read
Korean, I don’t know what I understand,

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:18.960
what it means but I know how to read the Hungul,
the Hungul script.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:24.500
I wanna learn Arabic, I think it’s perfectly
fine and so more and more people are starting

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.330
to become like that.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:32.100
We’re, you guys know this at Google, especially,
we’re in a global society, this day of like

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:36.020
borders, of cultural borders just closing
and never opening, they’re done and we’re

00:23:36.020 --> 00:23:37.050
for the better.

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.050
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Yeah.

00:23:38.050 --> 00:23:43.600
And in the news recently they’ve come out
with some stats saying that now the Asian

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:51.930
population is now the largest immigrant movement
more than the Latino movement.

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:53.830
I find that very interesting.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.910
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Oh yeah, that’s awesome.

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:58.860
The great thing with immigrant culture in
this country is you have all these hybrids.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.220
Today we had Dos Chinos.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:06.210
Dos Chinos was created by two Vietnamese guys,
they’re not Chinos but they grew up in Santa

00:24:06.210 --> 00:24:07.610
Anna which is a very Mexican city.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.500
So they grew up their entire lives with Mexicans
calling them Chinitos.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:15.650
Because, of course, for Mexicans, no other
Asians existed except Chinese, doesn’t matter

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.360
if you’re Laotian , Hmong, Thai, you’re
Chinito.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.870
So, instead of being all bitter about that
they’re like, “Hey, we’re Vietnamese

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:27.430
but we’re also Mexican and we’re also
American so we’re gonna create this food

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:29.830
truck and we’re just gonna put all those
combos together.”

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:34.390
And, so, you see their menu, there’s tacos
and burritos but it has like Thai fillings,

00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:38.220
Korean fillings, they just create, and the
great thing about them, they name it, they

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.610
check, basically check off all the Asian enclaves
of Orange County so when they’re talking

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:47.220
about the Bolsa Pork, they’re referring
to Bolsa Avenue, the heart of little Saigon

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:52.100
where they’re talking about Irvine, no it’s
their Irvine Chipotle Pork.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:57.340
Irvine, we have a huge Chinese population
there so they’re referring to Chinese style

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:02.100
roast pork, Korean taco, Garden Grove tacos,
that’s the huge Korean population Garden

00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:09.190
Grove and when they have their taco, their
lunch truck set up you have everyone going

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:10.190
in there.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:14.900
Asians and Mexicans and everyone’s getting
along and under the auspices of great Mexican

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:15.900
food.

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:21.630
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: How do you think the gourmet
taco truck scene has really affected the original

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:27.380
luncherias and, you know, have they brought
more of a spotlight to them or have they kind

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:28.430
of pushed them out of the way?

00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:33.260
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: What’s happened, I mean,
I have my own criticisms of what some people

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:38.480
call the gourmet food truck, what I call the
lux luncheria scenes, some people might criticize

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.460
them but I think it’s actually been the
opposite.

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:45.930
What these trucks have done is legitimize
the traditional luncherias.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:49.590
It’s unfortunate that sometimes it has to
be that way but at the same time it’s great.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:54.100
So, of course, here in Southern California
we’ve had food trucks, in one way or another,

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:55.910
since the 1880s, Mexican food trucks.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:59.890
The first food trucks they were tamale carts,
they would be these tamale vendors who would

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:04.690
get their horse on a wagon, go all across
Southern California, set up their shop at

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.060
the end of the day and just start selling
tamales.

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:12.480
If you read the news accounts from like the
1890s and 1900s in Los Angeles Times, it reads

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:15.850
exactly like the news accounts of these news
accounts of these food trucks today.

00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:19.390
“Wow, there’s all these food trucks and
the lines are long!

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.520
But don’t eat at some of them because they’re
really nasty and they’re roach coaches and

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.790
so forth.”

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:29.520
So we’ve always had a, Americans just in
general, but specifically in Southern California,

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.840
there’s always been that bifurcated response
where one part of the populati--, historically,

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:37.690
one part of the population didn’t wanna
eat at them but they always were popular cause

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:39.720
eventually people realized this is really
great food.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.900
So what’s happened with these gourmet food
trucks is that they’ve, they’ve told,

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.950
they basically showed Americans, “Look,
you can have great Mexi, great food out of

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.280
a food truck and it’ll be perfectly fine.”

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.410
So those traditional luncherias, they’re
not losing their customers at all, if anything

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:54.900
they’re getting more customers now.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:27:00.240
There’s this amazing food truck in Santa
Ana, on the corner of Main and Cubbon, it’s

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.620
called Alebrije’s, just use your Google
Maps of course, just go Main and Cubbon, Santa

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.620
Ana California.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.900
When you get there you’ll see this humongous
pink food truck, it’s pink, pink, pink,

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.000
pink, like Cadillac pink.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:18.000
And now, half of the customers is traditional
Mexican working class space, the other half

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.890
is everyone else who over the years have discovered
this is an amazing food truck.

00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:26.470
He’s become so, and this guy’s an immigrant
from Guanajuato in Mexico and he’s become

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:29.970
so successful that now he has three of these
food trucks coming along.

00:27:29.970 --> 00:27:33.500
Again, eventually, what happened with American,
with Mexican food in this country, it eventually

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.140
gets mainstream and then people, once they
realize, “Hey, this is great food.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:38.890
My neighbors are eating it, why shouldn’t
I?”

00:27:38.890 --> 00:27:41.070
Then they go and start digging in for more.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.550
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Right.

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:48.700
You know, like you mentioned, the tamale that
was the original food from the history of

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:53.850
Mexican cuisine that instead of tortillas
and stuff, it could travel.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:59.040
So that’s why a lot of people carried it
with them and it was a very popular food source.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:05.930
One of my favorite books is called, 'The Food
History in Mexico', and it talks about the

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:14.370
staples, the food staples of the pre Hispanic
era and it was basically corn, beans, squash

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:15.370
and

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:16.370
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Cactus.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.050
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Yeah, and cactus.

00:28:18.050 --> 00:28:24.110
And then, you know, the Spanish came in and
introduced dairy and cows and sheep and goats

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:25.560
and stuff like that.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:31.180
What is your take on like how that’s evolved
and more specifically about Mole

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.180
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Oh, yeah.

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.610
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: And how Mole came in through
the mores in Spain and then brought all those

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:41.431
spices and everything and kind of made this
hodge podge of flavors which is now one of

00:28:41.431 --> 00:28:42.740
the most famous dishes in upper Mexico.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:47.310
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: What we consider to be,
quote unquote, Mexican food, even, quote unquote,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:50.130
authentic Mexican food by definition is inauthentic.

00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:55.010
That’s, so talking about, talking about
Mexican food that’s just another bullet

00:28:55.010 --> 00:29:00.420
in the arguments of people who have this authenticity
debate because what we know as Mexican food,

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.530
it’s a combination of everything.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:07.810
As you, you know, as you pointed out, corn,
squash, beans, cactus, that’s been part

00:29:07.810 --> 00:29:12.150
of, and chili peppers and tomatoes, that’s
been part of Mexican food since the Aztecs,

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.530
since the Mayans, since the Olmecs.

00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:19.320
But everything else that we consider Mexican
food, carne asada, al pastor, Tequila, that

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:24.600
only came into being cause the Spaniards came
in and brought the sheep and the pork and

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:29.900
the chickens and the dairy and the distillation
that created all those dishes.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.090
All those great Mexican beers, Corona, well,
maybe not Corona

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:36.980
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Tecate, Bohemia, for instance,

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:42.830
you see those labels and you read the names
and you wonder, “Hmm, Bohemia beer, I wonder

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:43.830
who made that?”

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:49.410
It was Czech, German and Austrian immigrants
who came in during the, after the 1880s, 1890s,

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:52.130
and they created the Mexican brews.

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:56.070
For the Middle East, you have the Moors who
introduced to the Spaniards rice who then

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:57.460
brought it to the new world.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:02.330
Al Pastor came from Lebanese immigrants who
were sheep herders, Al Pastor refers to sheep

00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:08.050
herders style, or shepherds style, and they
brought it to central Mexico during the turn

00:30:08.050 --> 00:30:09.360
of the 20th century.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.160
So all these traditions all get mixed up into
what’s Mexican food.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.850
One of the great ones, of course Mole.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:19.940
Mole being this impossibly rich, I guess technically
you would call it at stew, I think?

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:21.840
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Yeah the cooking method would
be

00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.230
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah, like a cooking method,
it’s an impossibly rich sauce and every

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:30.390
state in Mexico has their own traditions and
that, of course, depending on what the tradition

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.850
is, it’s gonna have other influences.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:39.700
Some of the best Moles, they have pomegranate,
pomegranate, which we call Granada, that came,

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.680
again, from Spain from the Middle East.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.730
Oranges come from the Middle East.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:46.520
So, I think it’s wonderful.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:51.780
I think that’s why Mexican food has been
able to travel as far as it has because it

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.360
morphs into whatever the regional traditions
are.

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.770
Here in Southern California, right now, we’re
all gaga over the Korean taco as Kogi Korean

00:30:59.770 --> 00:31:01.280
Barbecue famously made.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:07.190
But, before that, the big ethnic fusion was
the, was something called the Kosher burrito

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:09.380
which we now know as the pastrami burrito.

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:13.960
The pastrami burrito came from East Los Angeles
in Boyle Heights during the 1950s because

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:19.910
then Jews lived alongside Latinos, which Jews
like Pastrami, Latinos like burritos, they

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:23.110
both like each other’s food, voilà, the
pastrami burrito.

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:27.730
So it’s that mezclar, you know, we called
it in Mexico mestizaje, that mixing and matching

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:28.730
of all that.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.560
That’s what makes food as great as it is.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.520
And you know, as a chef, you know that if
you make, if you cook the same dish again

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:38.370
and again and again people are gonna get bored
of it.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:43.960
Humans when it comes to food, yeah we wanna
be satiated, we wanna be well off nutritionally

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:49.350
but we also want our palates to dance and
Mexican food, it’s a perfect way to do it.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.670
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: What is the street food scene
like in Mexico City?

00:31:52.670 --> 00:31:58.180
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Mexico City is one of
the great cuisine, great food destinations

00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:01.040
in the world, Mexico City and Tijuana.

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:06.850
Mexico City you basically have all these stalls
and a million, what do you call it, a million

00:32:06.850 --> 00:32:07.850
manifestations of Masa.

00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:10.020
Yeah, I’m trying to be alliterative here.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:14.490
So, basically you have, not just tacos, you’re
gonna have, not just sopas which you better

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:20.370
get after this talk you better get the sopas
at the kitchen right now, but also you have

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:24.210
Huaraches and Mulitas which is half gordita,
half quesadilla.

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:28.350
You have something called the tlacoyos which
is basically an elongated gordita with fava

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:29.570
beans inside of it.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:34.660
You have these; you have quesadillas that
are as long as my forearm, absolutely magnificent.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.640
But since you guys are here in Southern California,
the place to go eat right now is Tijuana.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.400
Don’t believe what the media says about
all these narco wars happening in Tijuana,

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.560
right now the Tijuana food scene is one of
the best food scenes in the world.

00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.450
In fact, for the, shameless plug, for the
OC Weekly, we have a column called Tijuana

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:55.870
Sí, every Thursday we review a new place
in Baja California where you have to go eat

00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:56.870
Mexican food.

00:32:56.870 --> 00:33:00.680
According to my food critic, they have the
best olive oil in the world right now in Baja

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:05.220
California, they have amazing seafood, you
have amazing tacos going all over the place,

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.350
it’s a place where, consider it a day trip.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:11.760
Go down there, it’s a two hour, well from
here two and a half hour drive, spend the

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:13.220
day there just gorging yourself.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:18.400
That’s a place where you can go on a winery
estate and get a ten course meal for 50 du,

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.250
for 50 dollars, that’s the place to go right
now.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:24.080
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Does it get your hide when
people pronounce it “Tiawana?”

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.130
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: “Tiawana?”

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.270
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Just like here in Long

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.630
Beach you call it what?

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:29.840
Juan Perro?

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.750
Instead of Junipero or whatever?

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.830
You know, as long as people try it’s okay.

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:39.490
People sometimes mispronounce my name, like
Arellano or whatever, it’s okay, I tell

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:41.880
them like this is how you pronounce it but
that’s fine.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.590
As long as it’s done with no malice, that’s
fine.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.160
But if you’re doing it on purpose then the
fist.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.160
[Laughter]

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:56.220
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Talking about Masa and how
important was corn, originally, in Mexican

00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.220
society?

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:01.800
I mean, it was cultivated from something that
looked like a wheat and then they grew and

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:07.950
cultivated it, you know, dedicated, I mean
they had Xilonen which is the goddess of corn.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.750
I actually have a holy corn tattoo on my hand.

00:34:10.750 --> 00:34:11.750
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Oh, that’s awesome.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:12.750
Right on his thumb.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:13.750
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: you know, how important is
corn?

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:14.750
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Corn

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:15.750
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: In Mexican culture?

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:18.760
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Next to the Virgin of
Guadalupe, corn is the most important thing

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.280
in Mexican society.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.190
You wouldn’t have Mexico or a Mexican people
without corn.

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.649
More specifically than corn, though, is masa.

00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:34.679
And the invention that connects corn, when
you harvest corn, turning into masa is something

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:39.650
called Nixtamalización which is essentially,
you get these corn kernels, you let it sit

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:46.290
in a live foundation along with ash and then
all this, you know, and then you let it ferment.

00:34:46.290 --> 00:34:52.350
Some of the most important food discoveries
have come from people just letting food rot.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:55.750
Because if you eat corn that’s not processed
again and again and again, you’re gonna

00:34:55.750 --> 00:35:00.180
get poisoned, you’re gonna get poisoned
with something called Pellagra.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:05.280
But the process of Nixtamalización, what
that does it takes out the poisons from the

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:12.580
corn kernels and also it releases from each
corn kernel, niacin and all these other nutritious,

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.620
all this other nutritional value that was
locked there before.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:20.430
So next time [inaudible] and then from there
you can mix up the corn and make masa and

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:23.850
from masa, of course, you get tortillas and
tamales.

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:28.630
Corn and the virgin of Guadalupe that is Mexico,
without those two you would not have Mexico.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:29.770
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Right.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:34.980
I’ve noticed, not only in Mexico, but in
other countries, India, for example, that

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:42.140
a lot of the population who live in the South
are, they have less money than people who

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.140
live in the North.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:48.580
So the food is very, very different from the
South to the North and like in Mexico it’s

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:55.570
a very, in the North like in Chihuahua and
the Charros and everything it’s basically

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:57.720
a protein based meal, you know, lots of protein.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.720
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.720
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: And in the South there’s
not a lot of money for proteins and stuff,

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:06.680
you know, they’re using nuts and chilies
and spices and other things to kind of make

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.680
these meals.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.920
I’ve noticed that, do you have any

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:14.530
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Oh yeah, yeah, this, a
lot of Americans, historically, they thought

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:18.530
Mexican food is tacos, burritos, enchiladas,
you know, just very limited.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:22.200
But Mexico, like the United States, each region
has its own tradition.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:27.170
If you go down South all the way to Oaxaca,
one of the Southern most states in Mexico,

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:28.830
there they’re eating grasshoppers.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:33.240
They dry grasshoppers, they put some salt,
chili and lime and they pop them like popcorn,

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.320
it’s really good, they’re really, really
good.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.500
And there their tortillas, they’re as big
as basketball hoops and they’re called tlayudas

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.730
but then you go up to Northern Mexico and
yeah, it’s very, it's beef.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:44.040
Beef is king there.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.810
Cheese, not yellow cheese, not processed cheese
but Queso Menonita made by Mennonites, Mennonite

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:50.710
colonies in Chihuahua.

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:54.630
Seafood in Baja California, of course, cause
you’re right next to the Sea of Cortez.

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:56.750
Mexico City, you have all this great street
food.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.830
My parents were from Zacatecas so there we
like the stew called birria.

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:04.680
Birria's a goat stew except we make it with
beef, we call it birria de res and we love

00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:09.670
gorditas and we love cactus, you know, one
question I always get in Ask a Mexican, “How

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:12.340
can Mexicans eat cactus, don’t the spines
prick them?”

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.340
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: And I tell them, “No,

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.060
we take them off.”

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.120
But cactus is really, really good.

00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:21.430
So, yeah, that’s the great thing with Mexican
food right now in the United States, you have

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:25.990
Mexican immigrants for all over Mexico, now,
historically most of them, historically most

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:30.410
Mexican migration came from central Mexico,
from Michoacán, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Mexico

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:36.680
City, Sonora also, so what we considered Mexican
food, those are really the traditions of those

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:43.700
regions, tacos, burritos from Northern Mexico,carne
asada from Northern Mexico, Manchaca, Sonora,

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.830
those are the traditions that historically
came to the United States cause those were

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.160
the Mexicans that were coming.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:52.610
Now that we have Mexicans from everywhere,
we can taste all these different traditions,

00:37:52.610 --> 00:37:55.620
especially here in Los Angeles you have such
a great food scene here with Mexico.

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:56.620
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Yeah.

00:37:56.620 --> 00:38:02.190
I know in Chicago is probably the second largest
Mexican population in the country and then

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:08.110
Los Angeles and it seems that, like in Chicago,
a lot of Mexicans from Michoacán have settled

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:12.250
up there and a lot of the Mexicans here in
Southern California are from Oaxaca.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.250
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah.

00:38:13.250 --> 00:38:16.600
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: And I work with a ton of
Oaxacan guys in the kitchen and, by far, they

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:25.040
are the hardest, most dedicated working group
of people from Mexico and yet they get ridiculed

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:28.400
a lot because of their stature and stuff.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:33.860
Have you noticed any kind of, uh, has anyone
ever asked you about that in your column?

00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:34.860
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Oh sure.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:39.050
And, actually, in the book I talk about this
famous restaurant here in Los Angeles called

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:42.670
Guelaguetza, they’re the most famous Oaxacan
restaurant in the United States.

00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:47.230
And Oaxacan cuisine is acknowledged as the
best Mexican food from Mexico.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:51.390
That, restaurants, I think next year they’re
gonna cele--, no '94, they’re gonna celebrate

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:52.390
their 20th anniversary.

00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:56.630
When they first opened here in Los Angeles
no one would eat at this place except two

00:38:56.630 --> 00:39:01.490
types of people; Oaxacan who wanted a taste
of home and their bosses who worked here and,

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:05.050
you know, lived here in Santa Monica on the
Westside cause a lot of these Oaxacans, they

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:09.650
worked in the kitchen, they worked as nannies,
they worked as janitors, they worked as gardeners

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:13.060
and so, they would bring their food to their
bosses and say, “Hey, there’s this great

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:17.610
Oaxacan restaurant you can eat the food of
my home, of my homeland down in Korea town.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:21.960
So the founder of Guelaguetza, or the owner
of Guelaguetza, Fernando Lopez, he would tell

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.430
me, he told me the story for my book that
he would see, he would just bewildered, his

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:30.420
tiny little restaurant was in Korea Town when
it was sketchier than it was today and he

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:35.580
would just see this parade of BMWs and Audis
and Mercedes and I wondered, “Why are these

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.610
people coming to my restaurant?”

00:39:37.610 --> 00:39:38.840
And they were the bosses.

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:42.390
So those are the only two people who wanted
to eat there.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.790
Americans weren’t gonna eat at Guelaguetza
because they still didn’t know what Oaxaca,

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:47.200
what Oaxacan food was.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.830
And Mexicans weren’t gonna eat at Guelaguetza
because, for them, Oaxacans were just dirty

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:55.800
Indians because Oaxacans, the state of Oaxaca’s
always been different from the rest of Mexico

00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:00.290
number one because their mount--, there’s
a mountain range that basically isolates them

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:04.640
from the rest of Mexico and as a result they’ve
kept on to their indigenous traditions.

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:09.180
So a lot of Oaxacans have darker skin, they’re
of shorter stature, a lot of them, their first

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.020
language isn’t even Spanish, it’s whatever
their indigenous language is.

00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.020
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Zapotec

00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:18.110
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Zapotec or Trique or Mixtec
or whatever so they get made fun of in the

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:19.110
rest of Mexico.

00:40:19.110 --> 00:40:23.380
So, again, this authenticity debate, these
Mexicans, they didn’t think Oaxacan food

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:28.800
was authentically Mexican which is such bull
and to me that just shows that a God does

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.990
exist and he has a great sense of humor because
now Oaxacan food, everyone knows Oaxacan food

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:36.780
is the best Mexican food in Mexico and in
the rest of the world.

00:40:36.780 --> 00:40:40.320
And, yeah, Oaxacans are some of the hardest
working people and greatest people you’ll

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.320
ever meet.

00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:46.280
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Yeah and I really regret
it, guys like, chefs like Diana Kennedy and

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.230
Rick Bayless, and, you know, Two Hot Tamales

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:50.230
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah.

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.470
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: And they really took Oaxacan
cuisine because I think it was so different

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:56.490
from what they originally understood and brought
it to the forefront and put it in their books

00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.400
and put it on their television stations.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:04.480
What do you think of chefs like that or like
Rick Bayless who, you know, is a white boy

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:10.430
from Oklahoma, worked in his parent’s barbecue
spot and then really just fell in love with

00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:16.850
Mexico and everything Mexican and now he is
basically the leader forefront of Mexican

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:17.850
cuisine.

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.700
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah, he just got an award
from the Mexican government for his contributions

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:24.480
to Mexican food, or to the promotion of Mexican
food.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.840
I have my problems with Rick Bayless but only
because of an incident that happened between

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:33.250
me, him and Jonathon Gold the pulitz--, the
Pulitzer Prize winning food critic where he

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:38.910
essentially called Jonathan Gold a liar because
we both criticized him for him insisting that

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:43.130
there was, you know, he was coming into this,
he was gonna create this restaurant or he

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.940
was gonna consult on a restaurant here in
Southern California called Red O where he

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.490
was gonna say, “I’m gonna bring the real
flavors of Mexico to Southern California.”

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.090
And we’re like, “Really, Rick?

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:54.430
You’re really gonna introduce Mexican food
to Southern California?

00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:56.380
Come on, you’re a little bit full of yourself.”

00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:01.920
All that said, I’ve been to Frontera and
Topolobampo, they’re great foods, or they’re

00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.920
great restaurants.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.570
He is a great promoter of Mexico.

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:09.340
I’m not, you know, I’m never gonna hold
it against him because he’s a white man

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.730
who’s promoting Mexican food.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.750
A lot of people do have that problem against
him, that’s not my problem at all.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:18.030
And same thing, you know, with the other great
ambassadors, Diana Kennedy who also believes

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:22.700
in this authenticity thing, the Two Hot Tamales
Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger, you know,

00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:27.320
they’re all promoters, they’re all very
strong promoters of Mexican food.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:32.650
America needs those ambassadors, I mean, really
this is sad to say but it’s true, Americans

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:36.961
are more likely to pay attention to what a
white person’s gonna say about Mexican food

00:42:36.961 --> 00:42:40.690
then they would a Mexican chef who doesn’t
know how to speak English, it’s just the

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:41.690
reality.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:45.119
Are you gonna hold it against Kennedy and
Bayless and the Two Hot Tamales?

00:42:45.119 --> 00:42:46.119
I’m not.

00:42:46.119 --> 00:42:48.600
And, frankly, it’s racist to hold that against
them.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:54.270
I mean, you can have your criticisms of people
for, say there business practices or their

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:58.470
pronunciations, like Diana Kennedy, for instance,
despises Tex Mex food, she basically calls

00:42:58.470 --> 00:43:01.830
it glop, which I think it’s elitist in its
own way.

00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:05.340
I’ll criticize her on that but the fact
that she’s a British woman who loves Mexico

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:10.460
and has done more to, you know, promote these
regional traditions and other folks, I’m

00:43:10.460 --> 00:43:11.830
not gonna hold that against her at all.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:14.520
And, again, more importantly for me it boils
down to the food.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:18.690
Kennedy never opened her own restaurant but
Bayless did, great food, never ate at Red

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:20.100
O, though.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.400
Frontera Grill, uh, Border Grill, I love that
place.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.490
Too crowded for me most of the times but I
love it.

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:26.490
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Yeah.

00:43:26.490 --> 00:43:31.360
You know, Diana Kennedy was, is very specific
on, you know, you eat this on this day and

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:37.540
you serve it like this and really, like you
said, it’s a great educational tool because

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:41.830
otherwise I would’ve never known those traditions
unless she wrote about them.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:42.830
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Exactly.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:45.110
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Yeah, well I thank you very,
very much.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:48.930
I would like to open the floor up to anyone
who has a question for Gustavo.

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:50.940
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Don’t be shy.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:55.820
Yeah, and if you could go up to the mic so
the people at home could listen.

00:43:55.820 --> 00:44:03.980
&gt;&gt;male #1: How has the availability of produce
and other ingredients and, actually, particularly

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:09.280
food regulations, how has that affected Mexican
food in America?

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:15.780
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: A lot of, only until very
recently, a lot of Mexican food in this country

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:19.980
was made in a certain way cause you didn’t
have all the ingredients that you had in Mexico.

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:24.210
So, for instance, chili powder, chili powder
was actually created by a German immigrant

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:29.630
by the name of William Gebhardt who wanted
to, he wanted to make, he wanted to make his

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:35.100
chili with Mexican chil, uh, chili peppers
but he’d have to go all the way down to,

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:36.520
uh, Mexico in the 1880s.

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:40.480
So, instead of doing that he’s like, “Instead,
I’ll just buy all those chilies and they’ll

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.530
rot on the way, instead I’ll just create
chili powder.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:46.980
It’s not gonna be the same flavor, it’s
not gonna be the exact same flavor but I’ll

00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:49.040
still get those instances.”

00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:52.540
Same thing with yellow cheese, you know, a
lot of people hate yellow cheese, they’re

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:56.040
like, “That’s not real Mexican food if
it’s covered with yellow cheese.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:57.460
Mexicans don’t eat yellow cheese.”

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:02.660
Historically, no, but I wasn’t the one that
did this research it was actually Robb Walsh

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.961
who’s the dean of Tex-Mex or the dean of
Texan Cooking of food historians and so he

00:45:06.961 --> 00:45:12.080
interviewed these chefs in Texas who go back
to the '40 and '30 and he asked them, “Why

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.080
do you use yellow cheese?

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:14.760
Why do you guys use yellow cheese instead
of white cheese?”

00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.560
And he said, “Well, because we followed
what our customers wanted.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:23.250
They didn’t want white cheese they wanted
something that melted and yellow cheese has

00:45:23.250 --> 00:45:26.450
a faster burning, melting point than white
cheese does.”

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:29.790
And as a result that changed the food.

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:35.380
Again, that said, though, anyone who thinks
that food should stay in a bubble they’re

00:45:35.380 --> 00:45:38.140
deluded because that’s not how food has
ever operated.

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.690
Why do we eat a lot of cactus in Zacatecas?

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:45.710
Because there’s a lot of cactus, if we were
in, say, Mexico City, you’re not gonna find

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:49.230
as many cactuses, cacti there as you would
in Zacatecas.

00:45:49.230 --> 00:45:50.940
So food is always evolving.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:56.230
In the present day nowadays, though, everything
has changed because now you have Mexican produce

00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:02.990
within a day if you went, “Hm, I want this
really exotic herb from Veracruz, well then,

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:06.170
I’ll just go to my local Mexican market
who’s getting it now.

00:46:06.170 --> 00:46:11.070
Like, now there are no borders, now you can
cook just like Mexicans do in Mexico using

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:13.760
their ingredients, anyone can do that now.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.830
I mean, some people still say, “Oh, well
you didn’t make it in Mexico so it’s the

00:46:16.830 --> 00:46:17.830
water.”

00:46:17.830 --> 00:46:19.060
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: But it’s like that debate

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:23.080
that Guinness tastes different in Ireland
than it does here in the United States and

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.730
you do a blind taste test and no one could
tell the difference.

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:26.869
Myths, a lot of myths.

00:46:26.869 --> 00:46:27.869
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Yeah.

00:46:27.869 --> 00:46:28.869
New York Pizza.

00:46:28.869 --> 00:46:29.869
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: New York Pizza, too.

00:46:29.869 --> 00:46:32.900
&gt;&gt;male #1: And you wouldn’t say that regulation
has affected much?

00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:38.450
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: No, regulation has historically
played a big role, also, in Mexican food.

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:42.140
In a bad way in the sense that you can’t
get some food stuff like, for instance, if

00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:46.890
you try to, you can only take over so many
wheels of Mexican cheese right now across

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:49.040
the border, I think.

00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:53.160
I think you have to declare three and then
after that you can only take like 10 and then

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.660
you have to pay a tariff on it.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.720
So it does limit some of the food stuffs but,
again, what do Mexicans do?

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.770
You get a whole bunch of them, hundreds of
these wheels and then you pay people, “Hey,

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.850
be my cheese smuggler across the border.”

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:06.220
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: We do that so, sh.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.100
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Or what happens is we

00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:12.430
have all this regulation then an underground
economy starts up.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:19.320
I actually just wrote about this for the OC
Weekly how in California, food is so regulated

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.850
that you can’t have what’s called, you
know, cottage food.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:28.850
In other words, the small, small batch chefs
or producers of food who want to say, like

00:47:28.850 --> 00:47:33.430
they wanna make jams and jellies and they’re
not gonna make a huge, huge profit off of

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:37.040
it but they do wanna sell it like at a craft
fair or whatever, under California law you

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:42.940
cannot do that, you have to cook in a commercially
licensed kitchen, you have to get these permits

00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.260
this and that.

00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.060
Mexicans, we’ve never paid attention to
that.

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:49.670
So we’ve been buying food and chorizo from
people who make it out of their own homes

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:50.800
for decades.

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:53.810
So people will say like, “Oh, can’t you
get poisoned off of it?”

00:47:53.810 --> 00:47:57.230
Well here I am and look at me I’m perfectly
fine.

00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:00.050
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah, so thank you.

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:06.310
&gt;&gt;male #2: Um, thanks for coming, so actually
there’s a bill in committee on cottage industry

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:07.310
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yes.

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:08.310
&gt;&gt;male #2: You know about it?

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:09.310
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Absolutely.

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:10.310
&gt;&gt;male #2: I don’t know the number.

00:48:10.310 --> 00:48:16.800
So I was gonna say I’m a native Californian
and other than several episodes with Chilies,

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:19.440
Mexican food has really only brought tears
to my eyes twice.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:22.180
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #2: Once was when I left in the late

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:26.300
'90 to go to the Midwest to go to graduate
school and I went to Chi-Chi’s.

00:48:26.300 --> 00:48:27.300
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Ugh.

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:28.441
&gt;&gt;male #2: That brought tears to my eyes.

00:48:28.441 --> 00:48:29.780
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #2: And I thought it’s gonna be a

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:35.020
long dark time away from good quality fresh
food.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:36.020
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah.

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:41.500
&gt;&gt;male #2: The other was when I came back
to California and went to a Oaxacan Restaurant

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.500
in Santa Monica.

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:47.810
I don’t remember the name of it but it was
amazing and I just thought, “Wow!”

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:52.860
It’s not just generic Mexican food but it’s
really, really good Mexican food.

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:53.869
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah.

00:48:53.869 --> 00:48:54.869
Thank you.

00:48:54.869 --> 00:49:01.450
Really quickly Chi-Chi’s was a competitor
to El Torito during the 1970s and '80s and

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:03.660
it came from a guy from Minnesota.

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:06.710
And you might wonder like what do Minnesotans
know about Mexican food?

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:09.340
Well, they know a little bit, but not Chi-Chi’s.

00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:13.869
First of all, the name, which of course is
Spanish slang for a woman’s breast.

00:49:13.869 --> 00:49:18.430
Like, no way on earth could a Mexican restaurant
succeed with a name like that in California

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:21.840
and it didn’t so that’s why it proliferated
in the Midwest and the East Coast.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.609
Now it no longer exists because the food was
atrocious and yeah, it was absolutely atrocious

00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:26.609
food.

00:49:26.609 --> 00:49:28.609
But that’s the great thing about Mexican
food, some people love Chi-Chi’s, some people

00:49:28.609 --> 00:49:32.960
love Taco Bell, I can’t stand Taco Bell,
I’ve tried to, I’ve given it so many chances

00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.970
in my life and it’s never worked.

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:39.761
Del Taco, on the other hand, their burritos,
99 cent burritos, absolutely amazing, for

00:49:39.761 --> 00:49:40.780
what they are.

00:49:40.780 --> 00:49:43.530
But Oaxacan food, oh, it’s a whole other
level.

00:49:43.530 --> 00:49:47.830
So you could have all this, all these different
types of traditions within the panoply of

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:48.830
Mexican food.

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:51.100
&gt;&gt;male #2: For Chi-Chi’s, I’m glad that
you put it in the book.

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.840
I was trying to figure out like the marketing
concept behind it.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:58.630
I thought, “Okay, a guy went to Taco Bell
and he thought let’s serve alcohol and have

00:49:58.630 --> 00:50:01.119
people sit down and there you go.”

00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:03.739
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #2: Right, like that’s it.

00:50:03.739 --> 00:50:07.100
It was awful and there’s probably people
that had really good times there and I feel

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:09.480
bad kind of like slamming on it but

00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.480
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: No, no.

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.480
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Chi-Chi’s will never

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:15.630
be remembered for their food, where people
had the good time was because of all the margaritas

00:50:15.630 --> 00:50:16.630
that they drank.

00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:22.230
So in the 1970s you had Taco Bell and Del
Taco and all these other fast food taco chains

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:27.369
gaining in popularity and teaching people
what Mexican food was or what Mexican food

00:50:27.369 --> 00:50:28.369
could offer.

00:50:28.369 --> 00:50:33.619
The next step was the sit down Mexican restaurants
like El Torito, El Coyote here, El Cholo Café,

00:50:33.619 --> 00:50:38.350
those types of restaurants where you have
a combo plate, you drink your margaritas and

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:42.990
you eat out on the patio, that was a type
of Mexican restaurant, those restaurants have

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:48.440
really gone, at least that genres no longer
as popular as, as, as they were.

00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:52.640
Chi-Chi’s no longer exists, El Torito, their
parent company declared bankruptcy last year

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.250
and now there’s about 50 of those left.

00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:58.260
I predict within 10 years they’ll be completely
gone because people have evolved, now you’re

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.730
going to go eat that great Oaxacan food, now
you’re going to those great food trucks,

00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:05.200
now you’re going to these hole in walls
or you’re going to these higher end Mexican

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:10.010
restaurants like Frontera Grill in Chicago
or Rivera here in Los Angeles, there’s different

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:13.111
traditions and different experiences where
people can get their Mexican food or you can

00:51:13.111 --> 00:51:14.111
just cook it at home.

00:51:14.111 --> 00:51:15.111
Yeah, thank you.

00:51:15.111 --> 00:51:16.111
&gt;&gt;male #2: Thank you.

00:51:16.111 --> 00:51:18.710
&gt;&gt; Michael Brown: Do you think the frozen
margarita’s gonna go anywhere?

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:19.710
[Laughter]

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:23.140
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: The frozen margarita’s
not gonna go anywhere cause in the book I

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:26.770
talk about the creation of the frozen margarita
machine, so there’s always gonna be a market

00:51:26.770 --> 00:51:31.930
for people who just wanna get drunk and, you
know, drunk and frozen as fast as possible.

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:33.830
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: But what’s happened,

00:51:33.830 --> 00:51:37.230
though, Americans, they haven’t gotten tired
of the frozen margarita but they’ve realized

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:38.580
there’s better margaritas.

00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:43.361
Before, there only used to be two Tequila
companies that would serve, you know, sell

00:51:43.361 --> 00:51:47.510
Tequila here in the United States; Sauza and
Jose Quervo.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:52.170
In fact, the reason Tequila tastes the way
it tastes today was because during the 1960s

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:56.910
you had all these Americans going on vacation
to Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco and they would

00:51:56.910 --> 00:52:01.650
drink the margaritas there and then go back
home, bring bottles of Tequila as souvenir

00:52:01.650 --> 00:52:05.340
gifts and then try to drink it and they’re
like, “oh, it’s too harsh.”

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:09.780
So these companies, they changed their recipe
of Tequila so it could be more palatable to

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.530
the American palate, now you have hundreds
of Tequilas.

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:17.560
My God, you have Michael Imperioli doing these
horrible commercials for 1800 Tequila like,

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.510
you know, like Spider from Good Fellows knows
what good Tequila’s about.

00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:23.060
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: So there’s always gonna

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:25.450
be different, there’s always gonna be different
levels of Mexican food.

00:52:25.450 --> 00:52:26.840
And that’s, I think that’s a great thing.

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:33.110
&gt;&gt;male #3: Um, I really like Menudo and one
time when I was in Mexico I had a white Menudo,

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:34.470
haven’t been able to find it here.

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:37.020
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #3: Do you know where I could find

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.020
that?

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:41.280
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah, I laugh because
it’s amazing the fights people will get

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.109
in over food.

00:52:43.109 --> 00:52:49.260
And so here I’m thinking of Mexican food,
so in Arizona, white Menudo, that’s actually,

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:53.100
that’s a tradition, you have white Menudo
Posoles.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:57.530
So Andrew Zimmer in a Bizarre Foods, he went
to Tuscon and he didn’t like the white Menudo.

00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:01.180
He basically nearly started a riot for telling
people like, “I don’t like white menudo.”

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.260
“Oh my gosh, how can you not like it?”

00:53:03.260 --> 00:53:05.030
Where can you find white menudo?

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:10.310
Um, you are gonna have to find regional restaurants.

00:53:10.310 --> 00:53:13.810
One example, oh God, I wonder if you guys
have them here in Los Angeles, I don’t think

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:18.940
you do, but you would try to go to restaurants
that serve the cuisine Guerrero, the Mexican

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.080
state of Guerrero.

00:53:20.080 --> 00:53:26.840
In Santa Ana there’s a place called El Fogon
which is basically, yeah El Fogon, F-O-G-O-N,

00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:32.480
it’s off of Edinger and Standard, Edinger?

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.750
Yes, Edinger and Standard in Santa Ana, El
Fogon is really good.

00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:41.470
So there they serve red Menudo, white menudo
and green menudo.

00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:44.680
Green menudo is the best menudo of them all,
it’s absolutely amazing.

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:48.550
So, but, yeah, white menudo, you’ll find
it at household but in terms of restaurants,

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:53.740
there are few and far in between because that’s,
the red menudo that’s much more popular.

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:58.641
The reason being because that’s more of
a tradition of Jalisco which, again, govern

00:53:58.641 --> 00:54:02.369
most of what we know as Mexican food and still
does, to a certain extent, in this country.

00:54:02.369 --> 00:54:04.790
But go to Tuscon, white menudo all over the
place.

00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:12.500
&gt;&gt;female presenter: Um, Gustavo, so you talk
about, I think, I agree with you about food

00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:16.119
and cultural borders there should, there are
no borders.

00:54:16.119 --> 00:54:20.730
It’s very, we mix a lot and it’s a great
thing.

00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:26.060
So what do you think about our country’s
constant efforts to actually build a border?

00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:27.060
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Uh-huh.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:32.130
&gt;&gt;female presenter: And then the recent legislation,
especially in states like Arizona, or Louisiana,

00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:36.320
or Alabama where it’s actually quite scary
to be a Mexican in those states.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:40.550
And then President Obama just signing the
Dream Act last week.

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:44.470
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Oh, so political and so
many questions.

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:49.550
Starting off with Obama, Obama, what Obama
did in terms of basically allowing undocumented

00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:54.950
youth, in other words people who came to this
country illegally when they were children

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:59.660
and not making them citizens but making sure
that they don’t get deported, it was a political

00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:00.660
ploy.

00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:05.010
I mean kudos to him for doing that but it’s
all politics cause he was getting criticized

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:11.320
so much by Latino activists on it and he’s
gonna be in a very tough election, so he decided

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:17.000
okay I’m gonna say this, they’re not gonna
be citizens but, you know, Latinos will support

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.000
me now.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:23.390
But it was purely political, whatever, I’m
still voting for Alfred E Newman in the fall

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:24.390
election.

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:25.420
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: That’s number one.

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:31.050
When it comes to all this proposed, or all
this anti legislation, this country, it’s

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:35.800
an amazing country, I love this country, but
we’ve always had this xenophobic streak

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:39.040
in our minds that gets disproven again and
again and again.

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:43.870
One of my all time favorite questions for
'Ask a Mexican', somebody asked me, and actually,

00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:45.500
'why don’t Mexicans learn how to speak English?

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.400
Why don’t they assimilate', blah, blah,
blah.

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:50.651
So then I said, “You know what, the United
States government shares your concern, they

00:55:50.651 --> 00:55:54.520
just created this new study that’s showing
that this new wave of immigrants, that they’re

00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:59.150
absolutely dumb, that they don’t assimilate,
that all they wanna do is make money and send

00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:03.230
it back home, and we should really just clamp
down on these borders and not allow these

00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:04.230
immigrants in.

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:06.960
They’re not like the immigrants in the past
that were absolutely awesome and did it the

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.960
right way.

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:12.760
The problem with that study is that it was
written in 1911, it was called the Dillingham

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:18.359
report and the idiot immigrants at the time
were all Southern and Eastern Europeans; Italians,

00:56:18.359 --> 00:56:25.869
Jews, Czechs, Poles, Greeks, Bulgarians and
the lionized immigrants, the immigrants that

00:56:25.869 --> 00:56:31.570
did it the right way were the Swedes, the
Germans, the Irish, all those, you know, all

00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:34.510
those immigrants and, of course, those immigrants
were also trashed on.

00:56:34.510 --> 00:56:40.119
You had Ben Franklin, before there was even
a United States, Ben Franklin railing against

00:56:40.119 --> 00:56:44.800
German immigrants and going to Pennsylvania
saying, he used this really nas--, it’s

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:50.930
not, it’s not a curse word now, but it’s
like this really nasty ethnic epithet against

00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:54.000
these Germans and saying, you know, within
a generation were all gonna speak German because

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.010
all these Germans, they’re not assimilating.

00:56:56.010 --> 00:57:02.860
So, of course, Mexicans, all immigrants, they
all immigrate or they all assimilate and yet,

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.610
at the same time we always have part of our
culture.

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:11.440
That’s why China Towns have been around
for, gosh now, a hundred and fifty years or

00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.490
Little Italys and all that.

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:19.090
So whenever you try to build borders, whenever
you try to keep a country static, when you

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:24.650
don’t allow a country to breathe freely
and just allow people to mingle, you’re

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:26.080
really spelling your demise.

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:31.100
And, again, in this country we always get
proven wrong so I’m an optimist, we’ll

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:35.940
get proven wrong all these, all this anti
immigrant legislation, it’ll be defeated

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:39.840
one way or another and then we’ll move on
and then in 20 years we’ll do the same thing

00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:40.840
again.

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:45.920
So, we always forget but we’re, our better
angels always win, eventually, it takes time

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:46.920
but eventually we do.

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.570
&gt;&gt;female presenter: Well, hopefully food will
help us all get along.

00:57:49.570 --> 00:57:54.500
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: And, again, what’s the
one, what’s the one language we all speak

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.200
here in Southern California?

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.200
Mexican food.

00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:01.790
What’s the one part of Mexican soci, Mexican
society that Americans accepted?

00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:02.790
Mexican food.

00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:08.810
And that’s really the great, that’s a
great indicator that yes Mexicans will eventually

00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:12.460
be fully considered Americans or blah, blah,
blah.

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:15.880
Because Americans already love their Mexican
food, they always have and they always will

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:16.880
and that’s a good thing.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.830
That is absolutely a good thing.

00:58:18.830 --> 00:58:25.859
&gt;&gt;female presenter : Last comment, I just
read your most recent 'Ask a Mexican' question

00:58:25.859 --> 00:58:28.970
and the question is, you know, are a lot of
Mexicans going to Canada now?

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:29.970
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Oh.

00:58:29.970 --> 00:58:30.970
Yeah.

00:58:30.970 --> 00:58:31.970
[Laughter]

00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:32.970
&gt;&gt;female presenter: And I just wanted say
No!

00:58:32.970 --> 00:58:33.970
Stay here!

00:58:33.970 --> 00:58:34.970
We love your food and we love the people.

00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:35.970
[Laughter]

00:58:35.970 --> 00:58:36.970
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Yeah.

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:40.681
More Mexicans are starting to go to Canada
because of that, first of all there’s no

00:58:40.681 --> 00:58:45.180
jobs here, in Canada it’s boom time and
Canadians are so damn nice of course we wanna

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:47.590
go up to Canada.

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:51.440
One of the weird things in my column, it has
a big Canadian audience and so I get a lot

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:56.240
of questions from Canadians and one question
that I’ve been asked more than anything

00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:59.940
from those Canadians, they always go, “Us
Canadians, we’re nice.

00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:01.520
You Mexicans, you’re nice.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.360
Those Americans are a bunch of jerks.”

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.360
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: “Why don’t we get

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.800
our countries together and take over the United
States?”

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.510
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: And these aren’t just

00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:08.510
random people.

00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:13.000
It’s a question that, or a concerted effort
by these Canadians.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.180
This has been asked of me again and again
and again.

00:59:15.180 --> 00:59:21.630
And Americans are nice, again, we go through
our fits and fits, our growing pains but we

00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:26.310
do grow out of it so I’m always an optimist,
again, when it comes to food, that shows the

00:59:26.310 --> 00:59:29.619
path, that shows the way, everyone will love
us one way or another.

00:59:29.619 --> 00:59:31.119
And no, we’re not going anywhere, trust
me.

00:59:31.119 --> 00:59:32.119
We’re not going anywhere.

00:59:32.119 --> 00:59:33.390
&gt;&gt;Michael Brown: Gustavo thank you very much.

00:59:33.390 --> 00:59:34.850
&gt;&gt;Gustavo Arellano: Thank you so much.

00:59:34.850 --> 00:59:35.850
Thank you, thank you all.

00:59:35.850 --> 00:59:39.270
