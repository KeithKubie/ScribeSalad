JULIE ALBRIGHT: Thank you.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.960
Thanks for being here.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.960
Appreciate that.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.610
Well, it's an exciting
moment, and I'm

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.870
glad to be with you
Googlers to talk about this.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.750
I wanted to get us started with
this image which reminded me

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.670
of the American dream.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.550
If I had to ask you to
define the American dream,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.810
I think you might say
something like it's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.530
the little house with
the white picket fence,

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.940
getting married, 2.5 kids,
the station wagon, the dog.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.590
It's that sort of idea.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.350
But when we look now
at what's happening--

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.470
I have a sociology
degree, as you just heard,

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.940
but I also have two
counseling degrees.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.060
So in this study, in
this book, in my work,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.720
I'm looking at the wide
sociological trends that

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.340
are happening in
society, and I'm

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.570
kind of putting on my
counseling hat and thinking,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.300
what are the impacts
on the ground,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.400
on people, on their
mental health,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.882
on relationships,
on the workplace?

00:00:59.882 --> 00:01:01.090
And so that's what I'm doing.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.150
I'm sort of going back and forth
from the large social scale

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.700
to then taking it down
to the personal level.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.490
So this idea of the American
Dream we'll revisit shortly.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.820
The American dream is one of
the myths that we live by.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.050
We tell ourselves stories that
make sense of our social world.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.062
That's one of them.

00:01:21.062 --> 00:01:23.020
Another one that's really
pertinent to the work

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.850
that you do, I
think, is the idea

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.080
of progress, the idea that as
we develop more technology,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.480
we're always moving forward.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.630
We have this notion in our
minds, I think, about that.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.720
And we might sort of
question both of these ideas

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.460
and whether those
are actually true

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.280
or stories that
we tell ourselves.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.440
Now, in this book, I'm looking
at the impacts of technology

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.620
on behavior and on
our social lives.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.990
But one of the chapters
talks about the workforce,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.920
and I opened it with a quote
from Kurt Vonnegut's book

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.270
"Player Piano."

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.860
Now, this was written in 1952,
but the funny thing about it

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.930
is it seems prescient
looking at it now.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.470
But as we go forward
and we're looking more

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.380
into the future of
technological development,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.810
around things like AI
and machine learning,

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.940
and where we're going with
robotics and automation,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.090
it almost seems more
prescient toward that future.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.180
And here's what he said.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.270
"People are finding
that, because of the way

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.210
the machines are
changing the world,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.900
more and more of their old
values don't apply anymore.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.240
People have no
choice but to become

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.570
second rate machines themselves,
or wards of the machines."

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.010
1952.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.710
Now, think about how
that applies today

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.820
with what's going on.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.760
So in this project,
I have a couple

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.000
of ways of understanding
this behavior and technology

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.020
connection, the first of which
is the double helix of DNA.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.360
I'm sure you've seen
images of that before,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.330
but I'm using that as a
metaphorical way to understand

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:06.260
the changes afoot in society,
the idea that the two

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.380
strands represent
technology and behavior,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.560
that technology and
behavior are intertwined.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.240
Technology informs behavior.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.270
Let me put that back up.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.820
And behavior informs
or shapes technology.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.030
And in my view, these
two things will never

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.190
be sort of torn asunder again.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.540
This is our historical moment,
and this is our socio-technical

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.290
DNA from which these
new social arrangements,

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.560
new social patterns,
are emerging--

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.420
from this double helix.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.940
And that's where we
are now, historically,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.300
and going forward.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.780
The other sort of analytical
framework that I'm using

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.170
is I call the triad of
technological immersion.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.260
This is kind of like a symphony.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.810
You know how-- have you
been to the symphony?

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.120
The woodwinds come
in, the strings,

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.730
and the pianos are
coming in, and then

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.950
they're all sort of
playing at the same time.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.940
And that's what's
happening here.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.640
And the first of these
movements, if you will,

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.270
is the idea of the
untethered society.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.330
This is the idea that we're sort
of hyper-attached to devices,

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.890
and at the same time we're
unhooking from many things that

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.500
were traditional for
other generations,

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.830
and I'll talk more about
that in detail in a moment.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.300
The second of the triad is
what I call the internet of me.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.980
This is IoT, the internet
of things, smart systems,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.550
where we have things-- the
smart grid, smart homes--

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.520
where we have things that
are sort of tailored to you,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.420
tailored to your preferences.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.300
For example, the
Nest thermostats,

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.650
if you're familiar with that.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.720
Control them on your phone.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.420
What temperature do
you want it to be?

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.830
And things of that nature.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.970
The third and final
piece of this triad

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.060
of technological immersion
I call the internet of them.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.080
This is where that intelligence
spins out away from human,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.010
human in the loop, where things
are talking to other things.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.050
You have autonomous
intelligence embedded

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.350
in things like
robotics, and the human

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.680
is completely out of the loop.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.060
This is automation.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.570
This is the singularity of these
ideas you've probably heard

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.240
about, where some of
these capabilities

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.090
are going to actually
exceed human intelligence

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.070
and human physical capabilities.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.580
You see one of the robots
here from Boston Dynamics,

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.070
which I'm sure you've seen.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.110
So today I'm going to focus
on the first of this triad,

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:35.170
the idea of coming untethered.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.020
And that's what the focus
of my new book has been.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:42.070
It's this idea, again, this
certain 1950s American dream

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:46.480
image, that many people
aspire to, having that home

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.030
and family, and getting married,
and buying a home, and all

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:49.910
that.

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.510
But what's happening now is
young people, particularly

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:53.500
digital natives--

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.150
we might think of
them as millennials--

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.160
but those that
grew up in a world

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.090
where there always
was an internet,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.420
are unhooking from these
things, in great numbers,

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.070
in fact, and at the same
time are hyper-attaching

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.690
to digital technologies.

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.250
And that's creating a seismic
set of changes in society

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.140
that impacts every vector
that you can think of.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.010
And you go outside on any
street right now right,

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:23.400
you're going to see that head
bent down, kids on phones

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.590
walking around, and that's
really where the emphasis is.

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.870
The idea, also, that
I wanted to make

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.060
mention of-- when
we use our devices,

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.535
we all have our phones, we all
have our laptops, I'm sure,

00:06:35.535 --> 00:06:37.860
and everything, you start
to kind of take for granted

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.200
that everyone's doing it,
because everyone you know

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.050
is doing it.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.130
But I want to give
a nod to the fact

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.790
that not everyone is connecting
wirelessly to the internet

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.190
like you may be doing,
which you are doing,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.620
but that it's
generationally uneven.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.800
And this is from Pew
Internet looking at who's

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.250
connecting to the internet.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.150
And you can see the older
you get, the less likely

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.820
you are to be connecting,
or the less likely

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.390
you are to be using these
devices for that reason.

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:08.392
I have a boat
neighbor named Walt,

00:07:08.392 --> 00:07:09.600
who I talk about in the book.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.530
He's early 70s.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:13.260
The one day he
held up his iPhone.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.060
He's all, see these apps?

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.010
I said, yeah?

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.850
He says, I don't know what they
do and I don't want to know.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:20.640
I just want to get
rid of them all.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.640
I was like, wow, I could
show you what they do.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.230
And he's like, no,
he doesn't want--

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:28.320
I'm not an app
trier, he tells me.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.420
So I thought that was
the funniest thing,

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:32.280
but I'm not an app
trier, but neither

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.870
are a lot of other folks.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.290
So we start to take for
granted that what we're doing,

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:42.380
everyone's doing, but indeed,
that's not exactly the case.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:43.982
So when we talk about
digital natives,

00:07:43.982 --> 00:07:45.690
and this kind of makes
a difference here,

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.730
the idea is the average
30-something-year-old's life

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:51.910
so far, you can see the internet
becomes a thing sometime

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:55.930
in middle school, and mobile
phones become a thing in high

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:56.920
school.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.830
But what's happening now
is kids are growing up

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.560
with these mobile
devices from infancy,

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.090
and that's really
going to change

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.660
their take on the world,
and their brains, in fact.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.128
In 1979, there's a band from
the area called The Tubes.

00:08:11.128 --> 00:08:12.670
I don't know if
you've heard of them,

00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:15.580
but they're kind of a punky
band from San Francisco.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.960
They came up with
this album cover,

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.190
which is sort of a wry
social commentary on the idea

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.110
that kids are
watching too much TV.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:24.970
It's going to
impact their brains.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.172
And this is meant to
be sort of a joke.

00:08:27.172 --> 00:08:28.630
They're a funny
band, but they make

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.220
a lot of social commentary.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.270
But come to 2018 and
this is a real product.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.549
So I don't know how we
went so horribly wrong,

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.340
but what started out as
something that was kind

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.380
of a joke is now a real thing.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:42.789
And there are a myriad of these.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.830
This is just one,
but there's others

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.080
that are with potty
training, and you've

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.450
got that iPad, or in
the bassinet, that

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.620
iPad right overhead.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:56.620
So we're feeding basically
babies, infants, a steady diet

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.370
of digital content and whatnot.

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:03.250
And that's going to
change their brains.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.260
They're going to think
differently than you do,

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:07.960
because they grew up in
this different environment.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.320
And in fact, many of these kids
are learning digital skills

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.440
now prior to learning language.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.480
If you go on
YouTube, by the way,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:21.420
last time I did it, and
look up "baby with iPad,"

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.310
I got over 60,000
hits last time.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.530
So this idea that these kids--

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:27.490
think about this now.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:29.260
Remember I told you
about my friend Walt.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:30.610
I'm not an app trier.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.650
He doesn't know how to
use any of these things.

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.680
This kid has better
digital skills

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.915
than my 72-year-old neighbor.

00:09:37.915 --> 00:09:39.790
I mean, that is wild
when you think about it.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:42.740
When you think this
child can't speak yet,

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.250
that's the part that's
really the shift.

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:49.000
So their brains, we
know from neuroscience

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.210
that what you input
into children's brains

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.430
reshapes their neural pathways.

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:58.270
Their brains are malleable, and
they call it brain plasticity.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.770
Their brains are plastic.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.440
So this input from
digital is going

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:05.980
to reshape the way they think,
and they'll think differently

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.623
than you do in the long run.

00:10:07.623 --> 00:10:09.040
And we don't know
what the impacts

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.960
are going to be of that yet.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.770
So one of the impacts that's
happening in childhood

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.590
is that experiences of
children are becoming

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:20.640
more digital than analog,
more simulated than real

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.330
in many ways.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:25.070
In the 1970s, a lot of kids
would go out play outside,

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:28.770
and before that, ride bikes, do
all these outdoor activities.

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.800
But now kids' experiences
are increasingly virtualized

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.558
and moving indoors,
to the point, in fact,

00:10:34.558 --> 00:10:35.850
I don't know if you know this--

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:40.180
only 6% of kids play
outside anymore at all.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.230
So some people have said that
kids are getting less time

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.810
outdoors than the
typical prisoner

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.730
during the course of the day.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.770
But of course, that impacts
their health, right?

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:52.910
So these are things
all intertwined.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:57.220
Kids roaming has diminished
90% over four generations.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:00.080
I thought this was a really
interesting sort of a map

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:03.710
that we could take a look at,
and it traces four generations.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.410
The great grandfather
at age eight

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:09.230
used to walk six
miles to go fishing.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.520
He's down here.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.140
And then we go to
the grandfather

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:17.720
here, when he was age eight in
1950, he walked about a mile

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.000
to the woods.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Then you go up to the mother,
at the top at age eight,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.660
was walking to the swimming
pool, which was about half

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.980
a mile away.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.970
But now you get to the
kid who, at age eight,

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:35.660
is able to just walk to the end
of his yard or down the street

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.710
and that's it.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.480
So the interesting
thing when you

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.060
think about what
that means, think

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:44.690
about wandering off down
to the woods, or even just

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.570
adventuring around on your
bike or wherever you're going.

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:49.980
There's a lot of things
you have to overcome

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.860
and have to figure out, right?

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.090
One of these is navigating.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:55.920
When you wander off, you got to
wander back and find your way,

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.540
right?

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.808
Maybe a dog runs out at you.

00:11:57.808 --> 00:11:58.850
What are you going to do?

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:02.750
Or a car suddenly, and have
to swerve around or get out

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:03.440
of the way.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:06.210
There's a lot of
obstacles to be overcome.

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.780
So one of the
unintended consequences

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.200
of driving children indoors and
not wandering outdoors and all

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:16.070
is a lack of overcoming,
which then results

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.000
in a lack of resilience.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.470
So we're seeing that
in the colleges now.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.700
Kids don't know what to
do in certain situations.

00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:26.000
For example, there
was a story recently

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.120
where some young folks
had a mouse or a rat come

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.100
in their dorm room.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.850
And they were so
stunned, they called 911,

00:12:34.850 --> 00:12:36.320
because it was an emergency.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.860
So they didn't know how to
handle this kind of situation.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:41.880
So there can be funny
stories like that,

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:45.680
but there can be more serious
or drastic consequences as well

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.490
around this lack of resilience.

00:12:47.490 --> 00:12:50.240
So resilience is
based on experiences.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.700
The experiences are
becoming virtualized,

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.500
and resilience is
dropping, which

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.618
is an important thing for
coping with the things that

00:12:58.618 --> 00:12:59.660
come at you in the world.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.720
So because kids experiences
are virtualized,

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:08.233
it is changing their thoughts
about their own futures.

00:13:08.233 --> 00:13:09.900
I don't know what you
thought you wanted

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.820
to be when you were a kid.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.950
A lot of people used to
say, I'll be a doctor,

00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:18.180
I'll be a nurse, I'll be a
ballerina, a fireman, whatever

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:19.410
that kind of thing was.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:24.270
But now most of the kids want
to be YouTubers, YouTube stars,

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.530
because that's what they see.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.410
That's what they see people
doing, getting all these likes

00:13:28.410 --> 00:13:31.620
and shares, and making
money, in fact, at it.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:35.610
There's a five-year-old kid
making in the $25 million range

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.170
now online.

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.970
So it's just sort of crazy,
but that's what they see,

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.830
and that's what they're
aspiring to now.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:45.712
So I talk about this
as people grow up

00:13:45.712 --> 00:13:47.420
in this sort of
atmosphere, where they're

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.420
immersed in digital
technologies,

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:52.760
as coming untethered, the
untethered generation.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:57.410
And behaviors now tend to
orbit around connectivity

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:00.890
or being online, and
images like this one--

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:04.010
the underwater selfie, getting
the more extreme selfies

00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:06.110
we were talking about earlier.

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:08.960
That's optimized
for social media

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.390
to get the most likes
and shares and interest.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.370
So one of the other things
that's happening now

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:20.120
is that social media
and online connectivity

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:26.460
is ushering in an unprecedented,
you could say, sea of choices.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:30.200
One of them is online dating,
of course, the idea that there's

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.900
just hundreds or
thousands of people

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:34.520
that you could hook up with.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.270
My first work out
of my dissertation

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:41.900
was with eHarmony, helping
hook up people better on there,

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.040
and I helped develop
some of their product.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:47.000
But this idea that easy
come, easy go, there's

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.980
just thousands of choices.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.410
But interestingly,
consumer psychology

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:55.940
tells us that the more choices
we have, the less likely

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.650
we are to choose.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.780
And there was a
famous study of jam

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:03.383
where they laid out 24
varieties of jam in a store.

00:15:03.383 --> 00:15:05.550
Have you ever seen where
they're giving samples out?

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:08.570
Here's some cheese or
ravioli or something,

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:10.760
and you're going to taste
this thing in the market

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.140
or in Costco.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:13.970
Well, that's what
they did with the jam.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:15.860
So they had 24
varieties, and then they

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.000
gave a coupon to buy a bottle
of jam, $3 off or something.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.960
The next day they came and
only had six varieties.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.610
And it's paradoxically
harder to choose

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.660
when you have more choices,
and people we're only 1/10 as

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.210
likely to choose
any jam on the day

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:39.350
when they had 24 choices as
opposed to when they had six.

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.540
So this is playing out
in the dating arena.

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:45.230
It's also playing
out in the workplace.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:49.280
And what's happening, just like
a bad Tinder date, or maybe

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:54.050
an OK Tinder date, people are
ghosting their employers now.

00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:56.330
So with ghosting, you
probably know what that means,

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:57.380
but in case you don't--

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.360
the idea that you're
talking, you go on dates,

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.730
you're texting, and then
suddenly you disappear.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.550
And people are trying to
text and call and email,

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.785
and no response.

00:16:05.785 --> 00:16:07.910
And that's what they're
doing with their workplace.

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:10.820
My brother said a friend of
his had three employees ghost

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:12.410
on them last month.

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.450
They just stopped showing up.

00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:16.000
And they don't call,
they don't text.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.770
And my brother said, now, when
my employee doesn't show up,

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:19.270
I worry.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.320
Did he get in a car
accident or something?

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:23.030
But they just stop
showing up and think

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:25.160
that that's the way to
do it, because there's

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.910
this idea on Monster and on
and Indeed and on LinkedIn,

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:32.060
there's so many jobs that, eh,
I'll just get another one, just

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:33.350
like Tinder dating.

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:36.910
So it's the same behaviors
from online dating,

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.860
and the sea of choices
are now leaching over

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.370
into the workplace and how
people approach their jobs.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.610
This perceived plethora of
choices, of lifestyles--

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.830
there's a million
people I could date--

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.360
is really reshaping adulthood.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.940
So people aren't getting
married like they used to.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.280
They're not buying a home.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.230
They're not having children.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.030
They're not going to church.

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:05.970
They're not joining political
parties like they used to.

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.640
In fact, we've just fallen
below replacement rate

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.942
of children in this country.

00:17:09.942 --> 00:17:11.650
I don't know if you
know what that means.

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:14.233
But when someone dies
off, it's the idea

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:15.900
that another baby is
born and it kind of

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.327
keeps a balance that way.

00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:18.119
And think about it.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:21.750
As people age out of the
workforce, new workers come in.

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:24.099
If you fall below
replacement rate,

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:26.640
meaning you're not having as
many children to replace those

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.040
that are dying off,
it actually can

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:33.160
impact the GDP of a
country, their productivity.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.480
And so the idea being that
once you've sort of fallen off

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.420
that balancing point, it's
very hard for a country

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.170
to re-establish it.

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.290
And so it can have very
serious implications.

00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:47.010
Now, the remedy to that,
and if you think about it

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:50.410
commonsensically, what would
that be, is immigration.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.070
Well, we know how some of
the thoughts and feelings

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:54.760
are about that these days.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.490
So this is a real issue.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.260
And this isn't just
happening here.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.100
This is happening in Japan.

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:02.640
This is happening in Western
Europe and other places

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.490
where these sort of digital
tentacles are growing.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.110
This idea that now we're
reshaping adulthood

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:16.000
and what it means,
one of the aspects

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.850
is reshaping our thoughts
of what our career can be,

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.890
or what work can look like.

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:24.190
And the workforce
now is becoming

00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:27.100
a place where tasking
is the new normal,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:29.500
or gigging, this sort of thing.

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.450
This here is Liz Bryant.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:36.850
She was a newscaster down in San
Diego and decided, forget it.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:40.930
I'm going to buy this
Mercedes Sprinter van,

00:18:40.930 --> 00:18:43.270
and I'm going to go
live, go to the beach,

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.570
or go to the mountain skiing, or
hiking, wherever I want to be,

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:49.630
and I'm going to work out of
my van and live out of my van.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.270
And it's a Mercedes Sprinter.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:55.780
So she said she was born
wild and sprinting free.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.860
She named the van Wild.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:02.440
And now she's on YouTube
making an influencer name

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.450
for herself, and
also on Instagram

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.970
trying to monetize
her adventurous life.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.670
But more and more,
this kind of life

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.520
where people are gigging and
whatnot is becoming the norm.

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.120
Half of millennials are
gigging now, and only 28%

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:17.350
of baby boomers.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:22.030
At this rate, this sort of
gig, work, sharing economy

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:26.060
may be the predominant form
of work in the next few years.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:29.110
There's a whole hashtag,
a whole scene around this.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:32.630
I put this up, #vanlife if
you want to check it out.

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.290
But it's the idea of, hey,
let me show you my van,

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:39.120
and how I fixed it up, and what
I did, and where I'm going.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.060
And so you'll see a whole world
around that hashtag #vanlife

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:46.090
going on.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.250
So again, why does this matter?

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:49.600
Why does untethering matter?

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.310
Well, let's think
about this now.

00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:54.280
If you were post-World
War II, which sociologists

00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:55.990
call the golden
age of the family,

00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:58.780
everybody rushed out after
the war and got married,

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:01.450
and bought their home in
the suburbs, and had kids.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.760
That's where the baby
boom came from, right?

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:05.800
But if you don't
have that marriage,

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.630
if you don't have that 30-year
mortgage in the suburbs,

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.580
you don't have the
kids in a school,

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:16.570
and you're not part of the local
church community, et cetera,

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:17.530
well, guess what?

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.410
When you unplug from all
those things or untether,

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:23.560
that suddenly frees you up
to work anywhere, right?

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:27.280
So it changes that relationship
to even the workplace

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.130
and what you
perceive you can do,

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.760
because now you're
floating free.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.800
You can live anywhere,
be anywhere, be anything.

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.640
And so there's a lot
more of that churn now

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.630
in terms of job hopping and what
you see as your possibilities.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:46.720
Being single means there's
less riding on those decisions.

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.970
So as we talk about this
untethered workforce that's

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.400
sort of welling up, there's
a whole infrastructure now

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.670
that's rising up
around this to meet

00:20:56.670 --> 00:21:01.840
these young, single,
mobile individuals.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.400
This is 20 Mission, which is
down here in San Francisco.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.940
It's a hacker hotel
with this idea

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.360
that you can just sort of
live, or move in, move out.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.130
There's another one
called Common here.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.970
This one's in Brooklyn, but they
have a few different locations.

00:21:17.970 --> 00:21:20.190
You just bring your duffel
bag, drop it on the floor,

00:21:20.190 --> 00:21:21.750
and you're moved in.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:25.050
I lived at USC as a
faculty in residence

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:27.810
for seven years with the
students in the dorms.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.870
And I have RAs,
Residential Advisors.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:35.110
And they helped plan a trip
to the symphony, or a dinner,

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:36.960
or a talk by someone
that would come in.

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.960
We'd have dinner together
and do these various events.

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.710
Well, guess what?

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:43.650
These also have
something like an RA,

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:45.710
planning a ski
trip, or a dinner,

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:47.610
or a party for the residents.

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.070
So in a way, it
becomes like this sort

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:53.850
of extended adolescence
of that college life,

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:59.250
dorm life for young people into
the 20s and 30s and whatnot.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.670
And the interesting thing is
it's this no commitment life.

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:05.640
So with Common, for
example, that you see here,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.770
they say, oh, you
want a different room?

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:08.460
No problem.

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.250
Just let us know.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.290
You can move rooms.

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:11.998
You want to move in
a different building?

00:22:11.998 --> 00:22:12.660
No problem.

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.930
So this sort of no
commitment lifestyle

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:17.670
is something that's
welling up, that you

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:23.570
want to be able to change and
experience different things.

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:25.660
So let's talk about that
for a minute, this idea

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.520
that untethering brings
about different values,

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:30.170
different expectations.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:32.980
One of these is a desire
for a digital interface.

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:36.460
Lots of young folks would
rather text than call.

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:38.620
I heard a stat
recently that said,

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.650
when the cell phones first
came out, 90% of the time

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:43.120
was spent on calls.

00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:46.850
Now 90% of the time
is spent on apps.

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:48.860
So that's a huge shift.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:51.670
So this idea that younger
folks might not even

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:52.900
know how to make a call--

00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:56.110
I had some students that
tried to call someone up,

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:58.600
and they were working
with a big car

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.210
company on a project for SC.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:03.220
And the next week I
said, how'd the call go?

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.170
Well, not very well.

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:06.190
What happened?

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.050
There was an awkward silence.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:09.248
What awkward silence?

00:23:09.248 --> 00:23:10.540
And I was trying to think back.

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.850
I'd talk to the guys,
very jovial, funny guy.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.335
They didn't know what to say.

00:23:14.335 --> 00:23:18.790
They called this guy up
and sat there in silence.

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:20.560
And I was like, wow.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.240
So that's the thing.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.450
Certain skills that you might
take for granted, people that

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.970
are always using
devices might not

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.580
have the face to face
skills, the phone

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:33.010
call skills, these
kinds of skills

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:36.100
that you might have
just grown up knowing.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.270
Surprisingly, they
might not have.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:40.510
So I had my brother call
and do a little primer--

00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:42.610
how do you break the
ice on a cold call?

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:45.280
How do you warm up a new
client sort of thing, things

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.230
that I didn't even realize.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:49.870
Later I said, well, how do you
like that talk with my brother?

00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:51.270
Same gal pops her hand up.

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:53.940
I wish we'd had that
before the phone call.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:54.440
OK.

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.410
So there is also a certain
cynicism toward institutions,

00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:03.320
for example.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.070
So on this one, you
can see on the left

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:08.530
are those that considers
themselves politically

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:12.460
independent, and on the right,
those that are religiously

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.630
unaffiliated.

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.540
And so it goes younger, older,
older, older on each side.

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.870
So this idea that we're
untethering from things

00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:22.030
that, again, people
did routinely

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.850
for generations, younger
people are just unhooking.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:28.100
Churches are saying, how do we
get young people to show up?

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.400
I've had people at yacht
clubs, country clubs,

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:33.550
the rotary saying, we can't
get these young people in here

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:34.060
to join.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:34.643
What do we do?

00:24:34.643 --> 00:24:38.410
And they're at loose ends
trying to figure this out.

00:24:38.410 --> 00:24:40.340
Same thing, likewise,
with marriage.

00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:44.170
Remember we saw that
untethering by generation?

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:46.780
It's the exact
pattern here, the idea

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:51.170
being that between this
marriageable age of 18 to 32

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:56.680
by each generation, and you can
see from Silent, 65% of people

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.310
were married within that
frame, that marriageable age.

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:03.040
And it just gets
smaller and smaller,

00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.490
where it's under around a
quarter now for millennials.

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:09.400
So this, again--
the reason I bring

00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:13.040
this up is not to be old school
or conservative or something

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.770
but rather to say that all of
our foundational sociological

00:25:17.770 --> 00:25:21.460
studies show that being involved
in these kinds of things,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.020
like church, or a
family, in a marriage,

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.010
these are stabilizing social
structures for people.

00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.130
They keep people physically
and mentally healthy.

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:32.620
And as we're unplugging
from these things, what's

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.260
taking the place of these
anchor points in society?

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.330
Here's another change.

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:41.530
It's time compression, this
idea of living in the now.

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:45.640
They used to ask students, well,
what's your five year plan?

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.587
And my mentor is
a CTO at Chevron,

00:25:47.587 --> 00:25:48.670
and he asked his students.

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.290
They looked at him
like he was nuts.

00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:53.410
What do you mean five years?

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.770
So this idea of life
is spinning fast.

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:01.030
And one other aspect to consider
and to think about what this

00:26:01.030 --> 00:26:01.660
means.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.210
If, in fact, young
people are untethered,

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:06.070
in which the
numbers are showing,

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.560
from this American dream,
from getting married,

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.810
from buying a home,
from wanting kids,

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:15.070
from all these sorts of things
that were traditional goals,

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.530
we could say, for
other generations,

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:21.010
these things served as
a kind of North Star

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.780
guiding people
toward their future.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.020
Well, what happens when you
cut all those things out?

00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.430
What is that new North Star?

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:29.920
What's bringing people
into the future?

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:34.650
Ofttimes we see a churn rate of
experiences living in the now.

00:26:34.650 --> 00:26:37.310
And it's not bad to live in
the now and have experiences,

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.480
but you also sort of need
a future to guide toward.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:44.330
And that keeps people moving
and hopeful on the horizon.

00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:46.190
So we need to
really think about,

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:49.570
what's the pull factor now for
people that are untethering

00:26:49.570 --> 00:26:51.040
from the traditional goals?

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:54.550
Don't care how.

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:55.330
I want it now.

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:58.720
I'm sure you remember this
gal from Willy Wonka day.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:00.700
She was just ahead of her time.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.240
The idea that you
want everything

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.758
at the push of a
button right now.

00:27:04.758 --> 00:27:07.300
I don't know if you guys use--
you probably use Uber or Lyft.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.930
But sometimes you
might have said,

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.180
how long's Uber going to take?

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:10.720
Seven minutes.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.410
Let me check Lyft.

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:11.920
Three minutes.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.950
OK, I'm going with that.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:13.480
Yeah.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.140
So this idea that you want it
now, you want it instantly,

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.240
you want it at the
press of a button.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:24.610
7-Eleven and Domino's are trying
out drone delivery of burritos,

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:27.910
because kids want it right
now with their drone right

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.690
to their dorm room.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:32.450
I call this a no latency life.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.370
A lot of the data
center guys I work

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.420
with talk about the
latency of something,

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:38.220
how long it takes
to load a video.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.300
If your video
doesn't load, people

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.280
in just a couple of seconds
will abandon ship, right?

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.193
So this idea of a
no latency life.

00:27:45.193 --> 00:27:46.610
You don't want to
wait for things.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:48.170
You want it to come do you now.

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:49.070
Here's a barber.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:51.590
You just touch the button
and they come to your house.

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.505
There's dog walking,
hair glamming up.

00:27:54.505 --> 00:27:55.880
You've seen all
these things, I'm

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:57.860
sure, but the idea
that you want it now,

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.350
and you want it at
the touch of a button.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:04.610
Another changing value is
the idea of externality.

00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:07.240
Photo or it didn't
happen, I'm sure, pic

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.480
or it didn't happen idea.

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:11.240
But this idea that
there's this enhanced need

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:16.910
for external validation
and external approvals

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:19.620
via social media, for example.

00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:24.860
If you go back to studies
of girls' journals

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.520
going back into the 1800s and
what they were thinking about,

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.248
and what we're
thinking about now,

00:28:30.248 --> 00:28:31.790
they were thinking
about things like,

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.590
I'd like to be more hopeful.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:35.420
I'd like to be more patient.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.430
I'd like to be more charitable.

00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:40.130
And now it's like, I want
to be more beautiful.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.920
And in fact, a lot of this
social media competition,

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.310
if you will, is driving
a lot of young women

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.740
into plastic surgeons'
offices, as they

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.440
want to look more like
their filtered image

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.710
from Snapchat or Instagram.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.860
Another changing value, is
the idea of lack of ownership,

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:01.220
being a transactor versus
an owner, a borrower

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.510
versus an owner.

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:05.210
And we talked a bit about
that, the sharing economy,

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.320
the airBnBs.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.360
Why own a vacation
home or some home

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.310
at all when you can
just go in these places?

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.540
Uber or Lyft where you
can borrow someone's car.

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.900
Rent The Runway, you can
borrow bags and clothes.

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:19.850
And whatever it is,
more and more things

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:23.600
are becoming this transactional
world as opposed to ownership,

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:25.790
and that's really
changing a lot of things.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:31.315
The idea that it's a
customizable world.

00:29:31.315 --> 00:29:33.190
I don't know if you
remember Mr. Potato Head.

00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:35.390
Maybe you were a kid, you might
have had a Mr. Potato Head.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.870
But I didn't realize, the
original Mr. Potato Head, you

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:41.120
bring your own potato,
like a real potato.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.680
But this was the original
customizable toy in a way.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.610
You put this face on the potato.

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:49.720
And I thought that was
kind of a funny thing.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.000
But what's happening
now is, when

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.210
you think about social media
feeds, for example, you see

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.560
what you want to see, right?

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.330
You follow who you
want to follow.

00:29:58.330 --> 00:30:01.030
You get the news you
want to get, right?

00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:04.720
And you can really customize
that world to what you want.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:08.270
And that becomes the expectation
for other parts of the world.

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:10.720
So think about things
like Starbucks, right?

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.750
When you order that
half-caf double.

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:15.040
What are these things?

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.250
But what's the last thing they
say to you at the last minute?

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:21.520
What's your name, right?

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.540
Why do they say that?

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.680
What's your name?

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.210
And they call your name, right?

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:29.380
That specific order that
you want with your name.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.840
How much more
customizable can you be?

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.690
Starbucks has been taking
off, likewise Chipotle

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.960
and these kinds of places
that customize for you.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:41.140
And other places
like a McDonald's

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:45.640
that's a stalwart in food,
that one size fits all

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:49.040
from the industrial era, the
industrialization of food,

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.890
McDonald's has been tanking.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:53.710
And yet, at the same time,
places like Starbucks

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:54.980
are crushing it.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.370
Same thing with the Chipotles
and all in the world.

00:30:57.370 --> 00:31:01.270
So this idea of wanting a
customized to you experience,

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:06.810
whatever that may be, is
becoming more important.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:09.350
So let's think now about a
more traditional workplace.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:10.850
We're talking about
being out there,

00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:13.100
and working, and
gigging, and all that.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:14.960
But these kinds
of shifting values

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.910
are impacting people in
the traditional workplace

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.740
as well, as people want to
be mobile and untethered,

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.020
and their values are
orbiting around that kind

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:25.370
of connectivity.

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.010
And I think this is a
really telling example.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:32.810
This is a study that Cisco did
with the idea that three out

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.690
of five students-- and these
are college and then young

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.670
professionals in their 20s--

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:41.390
think not only they have the
ability to work remotely,

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:45.230
but they have the right, which
is a very different thing,

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.510
the right to work remotely.

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.930
And this is your
incoming workforce.

00:31:49.930 --> 00:31:54.910
7 out of 10 say, hey, why do I
need to be in an office at all?

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:56.480
I can work in the
Starbucks, or I

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.280
can work at home in my pajamas.

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.200
Maybe I want to work
in Bali by the pool.

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.520
Why can't I do that?

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.830
And so this idea of being
untethered from the workplace

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:10.087
is really vexing for
a lot of managers.

00:32:10.087 --> 00:32:11.170
What do you do about that?

00:32:11.170 --> 00:32:14.500
How do you handle
that kind of idea?

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.410
The idea that we
want connectivity.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.990
Young folks say-- a
third say the internet is

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.260
as important as
food, water, or air.

00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.230
And half say it's close
to that important.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:29.140
Facebook went down at one point
in LA a couple of years ago.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:34.080
So many people called 911 that
the Sheriff took to Twitter

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.330
and said, hey, stop
calling us about Facebook.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:40.210
We don't know when
Facebook is coming back up.

00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:42.920
This is not a law
enforcement issue.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:45.930
Could you imagine people
actually called 911?

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:48.480
But they did, and you can
see that guy's tweet on there

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.740
from the Sheriff's office.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.760
Stop calling us.

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.200
This isn't an emergency.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.940
But they thought it was.

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:59.030
So think about now when
you're in your workplace.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:00.620
What are some of the
issues that might

00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.470
arise when you're thinking
about an untethered workforce?

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.330
Well, how do you
create team cohesion?

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:09.230
I know my brother said he
had one gal working somewhere

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:12.020
remotely, and then the rest
of his team was in the office,

00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:15.470
and it's hard to keep
that team exactly together

00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:16.782
in the same way.

00:33:16.782 --> 00:33:17.990
Same thing with productivity.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.157
Are people being productive?

00:33:19.157 --> 00:33:20.000
They think they are.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:20.690
Are they?

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.250
That's another thing.

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:24.770
Communications-- we know
this from the early studies.

00:33:24.770 --> 00:33:28.250
When people aren't face to face,
things can be misinterpreted,

00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:29.900
or people-- you know this--

00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.600
will make more sharp comments--
you see this online all

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:34.340
the time, I'm sure--
than they would

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:35.940
to your face kind of thing.

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.830
So sometimes things can escalate
into not a total flame war,

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.550
but they can escalate quickly
on places like Slack in a way

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:47.522
that, face to face, it
wouldn't be the same dynamic.

00:33:47.522 --> 00:33:48.730
So what do you do about this?

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.180
Companies are struggling.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:52.060
They really don't
know what to do.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:55.690
IBM said, hey, get back
in here, and you're

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.960
going to work shoulder to
shoulder with your colleagues

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.610
or be fired.

00:34:00.610 --> 00:34:02.770
And what's interesting
about that is IBM

00:34:02.770 --> 00:34:05.320
was a leader in remote work.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.860
And yet, they're calling their
people back into the office.

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.530
Other companies are taking
the opposite approach.

00:34:11.530 --> 00:34:12.710
This is automatic.

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:14.860
They have WordPress, right?

00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.989
They had this beautiful
office in town here

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:20.679
that they remodeled
and is gorgeous,

00:34:20.679 --> 00:34:23.710
and there were like
three guys showing up.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.350
There's like 1,500
square feet per guy.

00:34:26.350 --> 00:34:28.060
So they'd say, well,
this is ridiculous.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:31.340
So they said, we're
going all in on remote.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.489
We're gonna sell
this beautiful office

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:36.550
and give you Starbucks cards,
keep you caffeinated up

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.440
for productivity, and that's it.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:40.360
So they're all in on remote.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.600
So you can see we're in this
sort of liminal period where--

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.070
where do we go with this?

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:49.150
Are we all in shoulder to
shoulder, are we all in remote,

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.260
or some hybrid in between?

00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:54.860
And so it's a really
interesting time.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.940
So we have this other thing
called the platform economy,

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:01.060
which you guys know about,
but this is what's changing--

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.150
the relationship of the
worker to the workplace.

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:07.120
As we have more of
these platforms come up,

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.960
we have more the freelancer,
where they're working from home

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.390
or working in a
co-working space,

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:17.590
or the tasker, who could
be a taskrabbit, building

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:19.670
shelves for you, for example.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:21.800
But you can think of a
tasker as an Uber driver,

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.370
for example, picking you
up, driving you somewhere.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:26.140
You may never see
them again, right?

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.710
That relationship can be minutes
long or something like that.

00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:34.330
So we go from decades,
decades-long careers,

00:35:34.330 --> 00:35:38.080
to the shortening of work in
the relationship of worker

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.920
to the workplace.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.500
And that gives a certain
amount of freedom, right?

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:44.760
You work anywhere.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.080
This is Jon Yongfook.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.470
He is traveling the
world, creating startups.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.930
You can work anywhere,
work in your pajamas,

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:54.060
work in Instagrammable
locations.

00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:56.400
So he's out there
Instagramming away

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.260
in all these beautiful
places from Bali.

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:02.280
Here he is in Morocco in his
kind of blue moment there.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.410
And it seems
amazing, but there's

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:06.480
some unintended
consequences, or there's

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:09.250
a cost to all this freedom.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.000
One of the costs is loneliness.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.480
We see that on the rise.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.780
This is Caitlin, a gal
that I interviewed.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.100
She's a writer.

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:19.000
And she's been
traveling the world.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.660
She was here in the Bay
Area, sold all her stuff,

00:36:21.660 --> 00:36:23.610
and went on the road full time.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:24.870
And I sat down with her.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.990
I said, well, how is that
being this digital nomad?

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.210
And she says, well,
it's great, obviously.

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.930
You're seeing wonderful things.

00:36:31.930 --> 00:36:35.310
But she said, you know, I
don't ever stay in a place

00:36:35.310 --> 00:36:39.660
long enough to really develop
those friendships like I had.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:41.940
And then when I come
back to the Bay Area,

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.860
I haven't been spending
time with people.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.320
So my friendships are
kind of distancing.

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.910
So she's sort of
neither here nor there.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:52.860
So she had this Adrienne
Rich poem, If I'm Lonely,

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:55.620
tattooed on her back,
because loneliness

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.600
is such an integral
part of her life now.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.200
So think about what
that might mean.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:06.250
Some of the coworking spaces are
starting to acknowledge this.

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:10.060
You can see this is one I
caught when I was up in Toronto.

00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.550
Shecosystem is obviously
targeting women.

00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:17.410
But look at that, this idea
of coworking plus wellness.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.210
So the idea that
we need to think

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:20.920
about what this
means as people are

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.690
untethering from these things.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:26.070
We're seeing, for example,
in the university system,

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:28.690
and across the country amongst
young people, the highest

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:32.080
rates of anxiety and
depression in 30 years.

00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:33.790
In the university,
we have a quarter

00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:37.120
of the students are on some
kind of psychotropic medication

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.380
for some kind of
mental disorder.

00:37:39.380 --> 00:37:40.720
So the idea that--

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.800
what do we do?

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.010
How do we re-moor
or re-anchor people

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.500
as they're pulling up
anchor from all these things

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:48.920
that stabilize them.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.890
And it's something that you can
think about in the workplace.

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:55.930
So the idea of untethering is
going to amplify in the future.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:59.500
Obviously, you might have
seen some of these iPads

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.460
in the airports.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.520
Have you seen that?

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.430
And so you push what
you want, and then

00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:05.585
they come and throw a
pizza at you and run off.

00:38:05.585 --> 00:38:06.085
Wait.

00:38:06.085 --> 00:38:07.150
And they're gone.

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.830
But a lot of young
people say they

00:38:08.830 --> 00:38:13.750
prefer to order from a
kiosk or from some kind

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:17.450
of a drive-through, because they
don't want to deal with people.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:20.200
So even at McDonald's
they're bringing

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.000
in more of these kiosks.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:25.000
And sometimes they say there's a
line for the kiosk when there's

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.460
no one in line with
a person standing

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.530
there to take your order.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:35.750
So I'm talking about
untethering and taking off

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:36.710
from the workforce.

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.950
But right now it's
kind of a choice.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:39.770
You want a gig.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:43.020
You want to work in Bali, like
Jon Yongfook sort of thing.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.830
But as AI and robotics
and automation

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:48.290
gets more sophisticated,
in my view,

00:38:48.290 --> 00:38:52.080
workers are going to be forcibly
untethered from the workforce.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.760
And I think society is very
ill-prepared to deal with that.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:59.930
We talk about a universal
basic income and that idea,

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:02.832
but the problem with it--

00:39:02.832 --> 00:39:04.040
here's what people say to me.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:07.620
They say, well, Jule, we've
always had change, right?

00:39:07.620 --> 00:39:09.680
We had horse-- this
is the classic--

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:13.640
horses and buggies,
and then we had a car.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.340
Well, here's what they don't
take into consideration--

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:19.240
the pace of change
that's changing.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:22.003
The horse and buggy to
car issue, that car--

00:39:22.003 --> 00:39:23.420
I don't know if
you realize this--

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:28.440
it took 30 years for the
car to reach penetration

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.390
where most people had a
car, 30 years, generations

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:34.070
to get used to this change.

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:36.480
Now take a look at this chart.

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.560
You can see these cars
are going along here.

00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.400
But take a look at these.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:44.600
This is the tablet,
for example, device.

00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.790
Social media, for example--

00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:48.650
these are almost
straight up and down

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:52.010
lines as opposed to the
years that it takes for some

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:53.850
of these other technologies.

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:56.810
So if we extrapolate
the pace of change

00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:59.450
from what's going on in
the digital era, which

00:39:59.450 --> 00:40:01.580
is on the right side
of this diagram,

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.220
and think about what that means
for AI and machine learning

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:08.300
and automation, it's going
to come up on our horizon

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.405
faster than we can
even deal with it.

00:40:10.405 --> 00:40:12.530
So that's where we need to
be thinking about-- some

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:15.830
of the social and psychological
impacts and implications

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:19.520
of the change to the
workforce as we spin up

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.960
those technologies.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.760
The other thing people say--
well, new jobs will be created.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:26.640
Well, yes, that's very true.

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.110
But we're changing.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.600
We're not going
from agrarian times

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.140
into the Industrial Revolution,
which was analog to analog,

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.400
by the way, right?

00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:38.010
Now we're going analog
to digital, which

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:40.300
is qualitatively different.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:43.440
So the idea is the jobs
that are going to come up--

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.380
I just saw a guy present
at Accenture on this,

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:50.640
and all the jobs were robotics
engineer, algorithm engineer,

00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:51.900
on and on and on.

00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:55.680
These take a higher level
of training and education

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:58.920
than going from the farm to
working on the manufacturing

00:40:58.920 --> 00:40:59.880
line, right?

00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:01.900
So we need to
think through that.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.340
How do we up-skill workers?

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.170
How do we train them?

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.400
And here's an
example from Siemens.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.160
Siemens-- this is the CEO.

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.280
He said, people
on the plant floor

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:14.850
need to be much more skilled
than they were in the past.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:20.130
There are no jobs for high
school graduates at Siemens

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:20.850
today.

00:41:20.850 --> 00:41:23.620
And Siemens is a
manufacturing plant.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.290
So think about what that means.

00:41:25.290 --> 00:41:28.860
We have to really
think through that.

00:41:28.860 --> 00:41:31.340
So again, this is going
to be terribly disruptive,

00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.070
and we really have to think
about what that means.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.770
The current plans for this
universal basic income

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:42.410
don't take into account other
aspects of jobs, like purpose.

00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:44.390
It organizes your day.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:46.310
It gives you a sense
of who you are,

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:49.490
identity, and who other
people think you are.

00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:53.160
Money may be a small part
of what a job does overall.

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.340
So we have to think about
all those other things.

00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.810
Right now the talk is
only about the paycheck.

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:03.165
So as, again, we need to
think about the skills

00:42:03.165 --> 00:42:04.540
that we're going
to need, we need

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.790
to think about training
for soft skills,

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:09.460
face to face skills,
telephone skills, skills that

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.250
might be lacking amongst
people that are used to texting

00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:13.120
and whatnot.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.670
I work with a group called
Infrastructure Masons.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:18.010
We're trying to create
scholarships and training

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:21.190
for IT jobs, especially
getting more women

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:23.620
in there, for example,
thinking about training

00:42:23.620 --> 00:42:25.690
for jobs of the future.

00:42:25.690 --> 00:42:29.020
So obviously, untethering
brings up a lot of challenges

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:31.580
for us personally, but
also in the workplace

00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:34.430
that we need to think
through a little bit more.

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:37.490
So I want to thank you
guys for being here,

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.860
and I to thank
Google for having me.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.960
This is my new book, "Left
to Their Own Devices,"

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.433
and there's some today
which I can sign for you.

00:42:44.433 --> 00:42:45.350
But thank you so much.

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:46.954
I appreciate you.

00:42:46.954 --> 00:42:49.906
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:56.160
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much,
Dr. Albright, for coming here,

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.020
and this is a phenomenal talk.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.840
As a parent of some
young children,

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.500
I, of course-- this is something
I'm daily grappling with

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.560
and worried about.

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:09.240
I was a little bit
emboldened to see

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.520
that I'm part of the
94% of bad parents

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:14.968
who don't let our kids go
outside long enough in the day.

00:43:14.968 --> 00:43:16.260
JULIE ALBRIGHT: It's difficult.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.420
AUDIENCE: It's sort
of like World War III

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:20.640
every time we try and
get them to go outside.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:21.960
JULIE ALBRIGHT: Yeah.

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:26.950
AUDIENCE: But I guess
the question is--

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:31.020
it definitely resonates to
say that loneliness, lack

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:33.650
of resilience, those are the
things that could be lost.

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.170
JULIE ALBRIGHT: Yeah.

00:43:34.170 --> 00:43:36.337
AUDIENCE: I also, though,
wonder about the flip side

00:43:36.337 --> 00:43:38.310
of the equation.

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:40.320
If we're leading
towards a life that's

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:44.730
going to be untethered
anyway, would we--

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:48.870
by enforcing our way of
living, are we not preparing

00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:51.680
our children for a
world that is going

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:55.560
to be more untethered, that
requires more digital skills,

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.880
interaction in that regard?

00:43:56.880 --> 00:43:57.797
JULIE ALBRIGHT: Right.

00:43:57.797 --> 00:43:59.280
And I would think that, too.

00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:03.000
And again, I'm not
trying to be Amish.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.440
That's not-- I'm on my device
just as much as you guys.

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.940
Maybe not as much
as you guys, but--

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:11.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:13.110
Tech, socially, I
do all that stuff.

00:44:13.110 --> 00:44:14.260
It's fun to do that stuff.

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:17.130
There's a lot of fun aspects,
and interesting aspects,

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.550
and aspects for connecting
that we never had before.

00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:22.410
So I don't want
to throw that out,

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:23.910
the baby with the bathwater.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:26.730
What I think we need to do
is establish some balance.

00:44:26.730 --> 00:44:29.540
And believe me, I wouldn't
be saying any of this

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:33.900
had I not seen some of the
unintended consequences welling

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:37.660
up around the mental health
issues, physical health issues.

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:40.200
And I explore this in more
depth, but disconnecting

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:43.110
from nature, disconnecting
from the relationships

00:44:43.110 --> 00:44:45.690
with each other without
a device mediating it.

00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:48.120
We are stepping away from
some of the things that

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.660
means to be human.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:53.190
So all I'm saying is of
course we need to prepare.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.040
I'm not anti-device
in any way, but we

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.680
need to sort of swing
the pendulum back.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.330
And if you look at,
by the way, what

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.880
some of the tech executives
are doing with their children

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.200
I think is very telling.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:06.840
When they're going to these
private schools, guess what?

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.910
They don't have
devices in the schools.

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:10.230
They have art.

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.490
They have movement.

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:12.720
They have dance.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.120
They have handmade craft.

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:17.580
They have music
making, all these sorts

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:22.750
of things that are analog and
physical and embodied skills.

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:24.670
That's what they're
teaching their kids.

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:27.420
So I think that is very telling.

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.360
And so this idea that,
again, not no devices,

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.860
but that we balance out.

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:33.520
Kids want parental attention.

00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.470
It's not just kids.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.023
Parents are on a
device, and the kids

00:45:36.023 --> 00:45:37.440
are trying to get
their attention,

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:38.790
and they feel left out.

00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:40.500
So it's both sides
of the equation.

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.790
So just some sacred spaces.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.600
Let's have a family dinner
without a device, for example.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.690
That kind of thing.

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:49.950
Maybe let's not have the devices
charging in the kid's room

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:50.580
at night.

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.130
Kids are sending 30
messages on average

00:45:53.130 --> 00:45:56.010
after going to bed because
the phone's in their room.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.890
There's a global sleep
deprivation crisis at hand.

00:45:58.890 --> 00:45:59.550
Why is that?

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.508
Well, see, we're on our
devices all night long.

00:46:01.508 --> 00:46:03.467
Let's put them somewhere
where the kids aren't.

00:46:03.467 --> 00:46:04.080
That's all.

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:06.780
It's just simple things
to rebalance ourselves.

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.563
But thanks for the
great question.

00:46:08.563 --> 00:46:10.480
AUDIENCE: I have a
question just to follow up.

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:11.938
You were talking
about the students

00:46:11.938 --> 00:46:16.480
at university who had the
dead space on the call.

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:20.740
How do you see this gapping when
kids are in engineering school,

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:24.010
and then they're trying to go
out and interview for jobs?

00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:28.150
Are you seeing a big gap there,
or are the companies such

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:31.150
as ours letting
it go and saying,

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:33.310
you're really good at
this technical thing,

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:35.560
I don't care if you
can speak to people?

00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:36.700
JULIE ALBRIGHT: Right.

00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:37.810
Right.

00:46:37.810 --> 00:46:40.360
Well, overall,
the research shows

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.340
that those who are
most successful--

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:46.310
I mean, you're, let's say,
an executive, a manager.

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:48.160
You've made your
way up the ranks

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:50.602
because you have those skills.

00:46:50.602 --> 00:46:52.060
And that's what
the research shows.

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.560
It's not grades.

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.000
It's not GPA.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.500
It's not IQ.

00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:58.810
It's the fact that you
can relate to people,

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:00.490
talk to people, communicate.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:02.920
That's what
differentiates people

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.803
from being just on one level
or being very successful.

00:47:06.803 --> 00:47:09.220
So those are still going to
be the differentiating skills.

00:47:09.220 --> 00:47:11.200
So we're going to
need some of that.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:14.110
And again, we're trying to
teach some of that at USC.

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:16.690
We did a class on how to
manage your engineering

00:47:16.690 --> 00:47:19.850
career with the CTO of Northrop
Grumman, CTO of Chevron,

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:20.648
and myself.

00:47:20.648 --> 00:47:21.940
And that's part of what we did.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:24.610
How do you give that handshake,
look them in the eye,

00:47:24.610 --> 00:47:25.880
do an interview?

00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:27.370
How do you find a mentor?

00:47:27.370 --> 00:47:30.250
All these sort of soft skill
things that make a difference.

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:32.380
If you want to be at
your level, if you

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.323
want to be an
executive, for example,

00:47:34.323 --> 00:47:35.740
you're going to
need those skills.

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:36.823
And that's the difference.

00:47:36.823 --> 00:47:38.260
What do you want to do in life?

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:40.560
That's going to-- cream
rising to the top--

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.530
is people that
have those skills.

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:46.750
So my point of it is, just as
people come in, to develop that

00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:50.260
management style and skill, we
might need to bring some extra

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:52.840
training in these areas that
maybe a couple of generations

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:53.860
ago we didn't.

00:47:53.860 --> 00:47:55.360
That's my main thought on that.

00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.610
Well, I think we're pretty
much out of time, you guys.

00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:58.380
Thank you so much.

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.797
If you'd like me to sign that
book, I'd be happy to do it.

00:48:00.797 --> 00:48:01.880
And thanks for being here.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:02.920
I really appreciate you.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.270
[APPLAUSE]
