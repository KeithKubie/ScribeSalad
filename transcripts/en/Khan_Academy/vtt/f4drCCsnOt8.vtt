00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:01.920
Where are we?

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:10.950
We are on problem 15.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.220
Let's see.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.890
They have a bunch of
triangles drawn.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.550
So let me get the line tool and
see what I can do about

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.380
drawing these.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.880
I've got a big triangle, looks
something like that.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.040
It's the big triangle, and
there's this altitude to that

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.790
drops down like that.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.230
And there's a smaller triangle
within it that looks

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.480
something like this.

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:46.940
A smaller triangle and then
this is a 90 degree angle

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.410
right here.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.550
It's perpendicular.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:58.220
q, s, p, v.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.530
Oh my God no, I messed up.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.370
I should have done this
ahead of time.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.350
I'm wasting your time.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.320
Bear with me, I drew
this line wrong.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.790
This line is something
different.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.370
That line looks like this.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.840
All right, now I'm
back in business.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.220
t and then r.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.375
It took me almost two minutes
just to draw this thing.

00:01:36.375 --> 00:01:38.810
And it says, note, figure
not drawn to scale.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.840
It says, in triangle
pqr above, qs over

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:50.800
qv is equal to 1/3.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:02:02.410
And it says, pt over
pr is equal to 3/4.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.670
What is the value
of the fraction?

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:14.890
And they want to know area of
triangle pst over area of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.150
triangle pqr?

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.680
Now let's see what we can do.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.910
I haven't been thinking
just yet.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.680
I've just been drawing
and writing.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:30.740
So they say, qs over qv, over
this whole thing, is 1/3.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.360
Fair enough.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:41.180
And they say, pt over
pr is equal to 3/4.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.690
OK.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:42.305
Fair enough.

00:02:42.305 --> 00:02:45.480
So, area of pst over
area of pqr.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.610
So what's the area of pst?

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.470
That would be just the base
times the height times 1/2.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.120
And we'll see the 1/2's cancel
out, we don't have to do them,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.470
but I'll do it just
to figure it out.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:17.940
So it's 1/2 pt times sv.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:35.040
And then area of pqr
is going to be 1/2.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.760
So it's this whole thing,
pr times qv.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.640
So the area of this triangle pst
over the area of triangle

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:04.920
pqr is just going to be 1/2 pt
times sv over 1/2 times the

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.820
area of pqr.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.150
So it's over this.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.250
1/2 pr times qv.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.590
Let's see what we could
figure out.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.540
We definitely see the
1/2's cancel out.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.350
Do we know what pt over pr is?

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.740
Let me see, pt over pr.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.840
They give it right here.
pt over pr is 3/4.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.960
So this term is equal to 3/4.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:39.910
So this is equal to 3/4
times sv over qv.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.220
And now we're at a conundrum.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.430
We know what qv is.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.580
But we only know qs,
we don't know sv.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.200
Let me ask you a question.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:57.920
If qs over qv, over this whole
thing, is 1/3-- so this pink

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.580
distance right here is 1/3 of
this entire length, right?

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.530
Because this distance over the
entire distance is 1/3.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.340
Then sv over qv so then this
is going to be 2/3.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.600
If this is 1/3, this'll
be 2/3.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.730
So then we know that sv
over the whole thing

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.870
is going to be 2/3.

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.980
So this is 2/3.

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.970
And then 3/4 times 2/3,
well the 3's cancel

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.220
out, and you get 2/4.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.530
It equals 1/2, and you
just fill it in.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.490
Next problem.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.640
Hope you get that.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.020
Most of it we just figured out
what the areas were and just

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.890
substituted.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.980
And then we just have to figure
out what sv over qv is,

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.110
given qs over qv.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.580
We figured out that
sv over qv is 2/3.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.685
I hope I did not confuse you.

00:05:54.685 --> 00:05:58.360
It's Thanksgiving and it's not
a good day to confuse people.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:04.560
OK number 16.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:17.840
Let the function h be defined by
h of x is equal to 14 plus

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.380
x squared over 4.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:30.510
If h of 2m is equal
to 9m, what is one

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.930
possible value of m?

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.940
Well let's just figure
out what h of 2m is.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:44.000
So h of 2m is equal to, just
using this definition of its

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.440
function, 14 plus-- we're taking
h of 2m, so it's 2m

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:54.080
squared over 4.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.790
And we also know that
this is equal to 9m.

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.680
And let's see what we can
do to simplify it.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.920
So we could say 14 plus
4m squared over 4.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.740
Just squaring both of these.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.790
This is equal to 9.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.766
This cancels out.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:17.890
Oh, that was equal to 9m.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.570
Sorry.

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.200
And now we're left with 14 plus
m squared is equal to 9m.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.280
We're left with a quadratic.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.370
It might not be obvious
to you.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.270
Let's subtract 9m from
both sides and

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:28.100
rearrange a little bit.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:34.860
You get m squared minus 9m
plus 14 is equal to 0.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.500
All I did is I took this 9m,
put it on this side,

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.360
subtracted 9m from both
sides, and put the

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.210
m squared out front.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.740
Now we have a quadratic and we
need to solve-- figure out

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.280
where this expression intersects
the x-axis, or

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:50.740
figure out the roots
of this quadratic.

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.090
And we can factor this.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:55.580
If you remember your factoring
from later Algebra I or some

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.120
Algebra II.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:03.100
This would be m minus 7 times
m minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:04.120
And how did I figure that out?

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.880
Well I had to figure out two
numbers that when I multiply

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.450
them, equals positive 14, and
that when I add them, is equal

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.440
to negative 9.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:18.840
So 7 times 2 is 14, or
negative 7 times

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.390
negative 2 is also 14.

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.740
And we know it's negative
because it has to go to

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.000
negative 9.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.380
And that's just a review
of what you

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.230
learned in algebra class.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.740
If this was confusing,
you might

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.930
want to review factoring.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.500
Anyway, m minus 7 times m
minus 2 is equal to 0.

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:35.860
That means that m is
equal to 7 or 2.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.780
And you can fill in either one
of those, because they say

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.400
what is one possible
value for m?

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.910
I have a minute left, so and I
only have two problems left.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.940
Well, that's good for one extra
video, so I'll see you

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.540
in the next video.
