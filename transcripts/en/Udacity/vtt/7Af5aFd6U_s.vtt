As we discussed, content-based filters are easy

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.130
for attackers to evade because they can

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.300
very easily change the content, of the

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.870
message that is carrying the spam that they

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:12.920
wish to deliver. They can embed their

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.440
message in things like images, mp3's, Excel

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.020
spreadsheets and so forth, making it relatively

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.470
difficult for the filter maintainers to keep up.
