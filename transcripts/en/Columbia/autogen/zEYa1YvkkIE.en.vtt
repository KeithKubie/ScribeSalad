00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179
masculinity which was at the very
 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.690

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700
beginning of my career I felt that I was
 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.340
beginning of my career I felt that I was
writing about something that will was

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350
writing about something that will was
 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.110
writing about something that will was

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130
me and part of a community in which I
 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.490
me and part of a community in which I
was immersed and I wasn't sure how that

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
was immersed and I wasn't sure how that
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.040
was immersed and I wasn't sure how that
would play out academically but I did

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050
would play out academically but I did
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.750
would play out academically but I did
know that no one had written this book

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760
know that no one had written this book
 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.670
know that no one had written this book
so that was a really important book for

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680
so that was a really important book for
 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.859
so that was a really important book for
me and then the second book that was

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
me and then the second book that was
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.160
me and then the second book that was
really me in terms of my voice was was a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170
really me in terms of my voice was was a
 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.870
really me in terms of my voice was was a
later book that I wrote called the queer

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880
later book that I wrote called the queer
 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.609
later book that I wrote called the queer
art of failure which is really a kind of

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619
art of failure which is really a kind of
 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.280
art of failure which is really a kind of
goofy irreverent book and it it it

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290
goofy irreverent book and it it it
 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.889
goofy irreverent book and it it it
managed to I managed to infuse it with a

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899
managed to I managed to infuse it with a
