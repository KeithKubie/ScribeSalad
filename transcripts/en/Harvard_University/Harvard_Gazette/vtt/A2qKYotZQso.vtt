00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.320
My Harvard education, well, it went on

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.190
for a while. So it is one part

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.349
inspiration and nine parts perspiration

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.900
whereas with the poets it's the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.690
other way around and that's why people

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.980
find them so annoying, they say I'm

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.300
not looking out the window I'm working

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.800
working visually working with

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.800
people and you know capturing something

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.469
extraordinary about ordinary life

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.920
If I could encourage young girls to pick up

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.809
the guitar and maybe be part of that

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.149
movement that would allow that sexism

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.430
in my end of the world to be eradicated

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.829
a little bit that I could do something

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.660
good with this guitar. I took a class

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.760
with a guy named Anthony Kubiak and I

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.199
had taken a few of his classes he was a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.260
wonderful teacher and I started Good

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.659
Will Hunting and it was a playwriting class

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.439
I never took film seriously I, you know, I

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.909
came much more from theatre before

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.100
Put yourself in situations where you can

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.380
play with the best musicians possible

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.350
and play with honesty and integrity

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.659
Oh well it was it was great because I could

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.759
get into the Widener Library stacks

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.700
which is where I put the secret service

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.479
in the Republic of Gilead

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.579
I think the time it's never been better

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.140
for music if you're good you're going to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.689
get through no matter what

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.780
Through music, it's a medium you could

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.009
actually explore everything and then I

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.009
was able to to say okay I do have a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.710
passion this is something I can readily

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.780
sign on to do.
