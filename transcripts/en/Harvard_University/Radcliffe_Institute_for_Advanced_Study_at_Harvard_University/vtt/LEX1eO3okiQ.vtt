00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.416
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:06.320
- Hi.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.430
Welcome to Radcliffe.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.840
My name is John Huth.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.650
And I'm a member of the ventures
faculty for the Radcliffe

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.970
Institute for Advanced
Study hosting this lecture

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.050
in the lecture series.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.250
So today, we're honored to
have Keith Ellenbogen, who

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.970
is going to talk to us
about ocean photography,

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.040
and in particular, the linkage
to inspiring conservation.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.820
He is a highly acclaimed
professional photographer

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.830
who got his MFA from the
Parsons School of Design.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.700
He has a huge number of awards.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.550
So I'm not a big believer
in long introductions.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.200
But suffice to say that he does.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.380
The most recent endeavor,
that I'm aware of,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.550
was he spent time at
the Doc Edgerton Center

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.340
for High Speed Imaging at MIT.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.527
For those of you who aren't
familiar with Doc Edgerton,

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:03.110
he was one of the
people who pioneered

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.819
this idea of
high-speed photography,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:08.210
like you can see a bullet going
through an apple, for example.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.640
There are many iconic
photographs up there.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.890
And he was working with a
physics professor, Allan Adams,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.790
on high-speed photography
with an underwater focus.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.040
And because I'm a fan
of fluid dynamics,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.190
I'm hoping I'll see one
photograph on the topic.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.840
So the format is for the talk.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.830
At the end, the questions
will be open to the audience.

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.395
And we'll take them
as long as we can.

00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:34.010
So Keith.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.444
- Thanks.

00:01:35.444 --> 00:01:38.312
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.150
Hello.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.690
Is this-- can you all hear me?

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.430
I'd like to thank you, John,
and the Radcliffe Institute

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.490
for having me here.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.880
It's really very nice.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.072
So welcome.

00:01:52.072 --> 00:01:54.030
Today, I'd like to talk
to you about taking you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.640
all on a journey beneath the
ocean into an underwater world.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.450
We're a visual culture.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.510
And photography has the power
to captivate our attention

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.160
and spark conservation.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.630
This is a picture
of a barrier reef

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.449
taken within the remote
Tortola Islands in Fiji.

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:13.240
On this assignment, I
was fortunate to have

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.670
eight hours of flight
time on a helicopter,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.000
and was able to capture what
a barrier reef looks like,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.860
and how the barrier reef absorbs
the energy of the ocean waves

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.530
from the island itself.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.470
But it's the underwater
images that are not easily

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.530
seen by people around the world
that I'm interested in sharing

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.190
with you today.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.460
So I'd like to take you all
on a journey underwater,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.990
and on expeditions
around the world.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.490
All right, so first,
what is it like

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.700
to travel with me
on an assignment?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.990
You need a lot of equipment,
both photography equipment,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.830
underwater equipment,
housing equipment, dive gear.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.555
And then you need redundant
systems for everything.

00:02:57.555 --> 00:02:59.680
Once you travel to these
remote parts of the world,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.490
it's what you bring
is what you have.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.740
So you need all of it with you.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.962
And once you get used to
having stuff, you want more.

00:03:07.962 --> 00:03:09.920
So here's what it looks
like when I'm on a boat

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.300
and the seas are calm.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.040
I use, basically,
a Canon 5D Mark

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.600
II, which is a DSLR camera.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.820
So I have adjustable
lenses and full control

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.500
over all of the equipment.

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.050
I also use an CNC
underwater housing,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.840
which basically means that the
camera is sealed in a housing.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.310
And I have full control.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.710
And their two YS-250
strobes-- which means I

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.150
can control all the light
and the camera underwater.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.880
And so that's very important
in the art of photography,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.830
in terms of capturing
the image that you're

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.930
interested in taking.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.790
So underwater
photography has all sorts

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.240
of challenges and problems.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.970
First of all,
you're under water.

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.660
So you have limited
time, air, depth,

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.250
and you have to
find the animals.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:54.710
This picture was taken
of me just the other day

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.490
on an assignment in Belize
photographing Nassau groupers.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.220
I'm at 130 or 140
feet here of water.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.670
And so you have a very
short amount of time

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:06.830
to see and find
what you want to do.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.270
But why I like
this picture is it

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.770
was filmed by someone else
using a little GoPro camera.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.430
And what it caught was
my strobes going off

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.090
as I'm taking a picture.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.380
And what this shows is how you
illuminate an area in front

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.570
of you to capture an image.

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.450
And I want to really highlight
that all of photography

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.120
is about finding
the right light,

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.000
and capturing light
in a lot of ways.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.630
And so one of the things
that's really important

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.520
is controlling where
the light will be,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.540
and what you're photographing.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.520
So when people think of
a coral reef, or reefs

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.020
around the world,
what they think of

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.297
is lots of fish, pretty
colors, and taking them.

00:04:41.297 --> 00:04:42.880
And so I want to
describe a little bit

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.220
about what it means to be
a photographer before we

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.810
go forward.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.500
And here you can see that
the images you want to see

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.042
is all the little
fish coming at you.

00:04:52.042 --> 00:04:54.500
It's always fun when they're
facing you, rather than facing

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.060
away.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.518
And in order to
have this, the fish

00:04:56.518 --> 00:04:59.050
are swimming in-- there's
a strong ebb of a current

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.500
that's moving, really, actually,
quite pulsing fairly strong.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.110
And so I'm swimming
inverted to the current

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.720
holding my breath-- well,
sort of not really breathing

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.865
here-- stabilizing while they
ebb and flow into a photograph.

00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:13.240
Because you want
to fill the blue

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.130
with this beautiful
complementary color

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.550
of the orange.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.620
In underwater
photography, the object

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.630
is to be close to your subject.

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.250
On land, you can be far.

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.990
You can have telephoto lenses.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.950
You can sit and wait.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.540
But in an underwater
environment,

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.670
we need to be close
to what we're seeing.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.530
And so when I say
close, it's best

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.030
when they're within 6 inches
to a couple of feet away.

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:40.612
Less over 6 feet starts
to be more difficult.

00:05:40.612 --> 00:05:43.070
So I thought I would just start
with what-- everyone always

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.070
assumes I just make it to a
place and I take some pictures.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.197
But I wanted to sort
of highlight, to start,

00:05:48.197 --> 00:05:49.530
what it means to take a picture.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.680
This is in Indonesia
in Raja Ampat.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.645
And these are karst
islands, which means

00:05:53.645 --> 00:05:54.770
they are limestone islands.

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.090
And they have an
overshadow here.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.640
But we want to look under water.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.181
And this is what I
want to do is take

00:06:00.181 --> 00:06:02.237
a picture of the
underwater environment.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.820
And really, what I want to show
are three levels of something.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.490
One, corals to the
island, which you

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:08.930
can see here with the black.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.450
And then up in the top right
corner, you can see the trees

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.850
and through to the sky.

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.620
And what I noticed
was-- and you can see

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.040
there's a little silver part in
the center where the black is.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.680
It's sort of a just
fortuitous moment

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.626
where there were [INAUDIBLE]
blenny that were spawning.

00:06:24.626 --> 00:06:26.750
And there were all the
little juveniles were there.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.432
And I saw them swim
in big numbers.

00:06:28.432 --> 00:06:30.140
And what I didn't like
about this picture

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.840
was the black of
the entire island.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.370
But it's what I saw.

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.480
And so when you
wait for photography

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.270
and are patient,
what you end up is

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.580
being able to compose
an image much the way

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.920
you preconceived it
in your own mind,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.420
and then allow that
picture to come

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:49.560
to life through being prepared
for moments with photography.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.920
Here's just another
example of in the Amazon.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.220
This was taken
with-- of a pink--

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.510
this is a river dolphin
down in the Amazon.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.250
And this was taken with a GoPro.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:05.360
And under normal circumstances,
I would have said it was OK.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.790
But if you want, what you
can do is control the light,

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.530
so it has a more
angelic feeling that

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.489
really is representative of the
environment that we're seeing.

00:07:12.489 --> 00:07:14.030
And so I want to
just highlight that,

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.050
when you're seeing
these pictures,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.466
they're taken with a lot of
intent for what I want to use,

00:07:17.466 --> 00:07:19.940
and controlling the camera
and the light in such a way

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.760
as to make the image what
I feel is compelling,

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.230
or my vision of them.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.750
So how do you capture some
of these kind of images?

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:31.380
I can only start by saying
patience and more patience.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.540
This is what I would
say is maybe my best

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.810
bird shot I ever have taken.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.390
And it was a moment
where I was in Mexico.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.160
The weather was really terrible.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.980
And we were doing a project
on local communities

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.302
and small-scale fisheries.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.760
And I noticed that
these birds were

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.329
diving in the same area
almost every day all the time.

00:07:53.329 --> 00:07:55.620
And when the weather was bad,
and we were just stopped,

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:56.850
and I just was observing this.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:58.891
And then after I got my
shots for the assignment,

00:07:58.891 --> 00:08:00.292
I had a day and a half left.

00:08:00.292 --> 00:08:02.750
I said to myself, you know,
I'm just going to try for this.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.490
And this is the kind of shot
that you don't do anything else

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.020
other than set up for one shot.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.880
I was just prepared
for this only shot.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.020
I stood in an area.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.100
And I waited.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.560
And when I say I
waited, I wasn't

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.310
just like sitting there
talking to myself.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.740
I was waiting, half of an
eye in the water, half an eye

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.764
looking at the birds, strobe in,
strobe out, and just waiting.

00:08:19.764 --> 00:08:21.430
And all of the sudden,
they would do it.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.888
And I had varying
forms of success,

00:08:22.888 --> 00:08:24.510
but not the success I wanted.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:25.890
And then all of the
sudden, it came through.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:26.400
And it landed.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.450
And when a bird like this
flies, they're really fast.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.324
And then they stall out
right in front of you

00:08:30.324 --> 00:08:31.620
and virtually stop.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:33.000
It's absolutely incredible.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.049
And then it flies again.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:35.174
It can't land in the water.

00:08:35.174 --> 00:08:37.830
If it were to land in the
water, it would drown.

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:39.789
And so at this very
moment, I pull the trigger.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.413
And I looked at my
assistant behind me.

00:08:41.413 --> 00:08:43.280
And I said, I think
I might have got it.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.910
I was so nervous.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:45.721
Anyway I did look.

00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:47.220
And then I rushed
back to the place,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.580
and opened it up
to see how it goes.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.750
Here's an example of river
herring of a photograph where

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:56.260
you're going to see the animal.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.030
They're there.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.500
But you want to control
the environment.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.060
Because what was so
interesting, to me,

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.980
is the turbulence in
there of the water moving.

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.960
And what I wanted to
photograph was each bubble

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.090
moving, and to show
the rapidness of it,

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:07.890
and stopping that
motion of each bubble,

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:10.100
so the thing was
totally frozen, so you

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.850
get a real strong
feeling of motion moving

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.264
in a very strong current.

00:09:15.264 --> 00:09:16.680
Sometimes, you end
up with moments

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.480
that are just by chance
you happen to find them.

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.370
This is a jellyfish.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.953
And if you look
inside the technicals,

00:09:21.953 --> 00:09:23.790
you can see all these
little juvenile fish

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:25.410
that are swimming in there.

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.930
And when I noticed it, what I
wanted to do is drift with it,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.080
and create a composition.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.200
So I'm looking up
at the jellyfish.

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.420
And through what's
the texture is

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.610
the sky is the water surface.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.440
And then the white is a
little bit of the sky--

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.310
so to create a
composition, as well,

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.200
and to wait for the jellyfish
to move in such a way

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.030
as that you can see the fish.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:51.580
In Palau, these are
humphead wrasse.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:52.080
They're big.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.621
They're like 5 feet long.

00:09:53.621 --> 00:09:55.620
This is one of the few
places in the world where

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:56.400
you can see them.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.070
And they'll actually come in
and integrate close with you.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.194
And so this is an
endangered species,

00:10:01.194 --> 00:10:02.610
of which it was a
picture that was

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:07.140
used by Canon to help support
wildlife, as Canon sees it.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.165
And it's to help endangered
species get awareness,

00:10:10.165 --> 00:10:12.540
and to use photography in a
way to engage with an animal.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:14.300
And only when they
come up close--

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.050
and again, a lot of
underwater photography

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.850
is that sort of
vision or ability

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.210
to get close to an animal.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.780
Here are a few other
moments, in terms of where--

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:32.760
this is a story of aggregating,
mating, tiger grouper.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.025
And they've changed their
entire coloration here.

00:10:35.025 --> 00:10:36.650
And it's like a mirror
in a reflection.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:38.608
Now I knew they would do
this kind of behavior.

00:10:38.608 --> 00:10:40.840
I wasn't sure if they would
do it while I was there.

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.881
And what they do is they
just stare at each other

00:10:42.881 --> 00:10:43.890
for a brief moment.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.650
And then they don't have
a violent interaction.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:47.820
But it's just a showdown.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.120
It's a really
extraordinary thing.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.830
And it's like a reflection
in the sea of each other.

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.080
And you only see this
coloration for a very short time

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.680
when they're during
the spawning season.

00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:00.150
And sometimes in
photography, you

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:04.230
see that animals are equally as
intelligent as we think we are.

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:05.806
And in the water
here in photography,

00:11:05.806 --> 00:11:07.680
one of the challenges
is, how do you actually

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.360
photograph something?

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.590
And what are the modes that
make photography complicated?

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:18.450
And I noticed that this sea lion
kept spinning me into the sun,

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.955
so that it was
constantly backlit.

00:11:19.955 --> 00:11:22.080
And I would keep trying to
do the same tricks where

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.270
I would move away and
it would look at me.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.280
But it didn't.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.500
And eventually, one
of the other sea lions

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.650
sort of blocked the light.

00:11:29.650 --> 00:11:31.410
And it sort of engaged in a way.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.780
And you realize that they are
very aware of the elements

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:38.084
as well as I'm aware of.

00:11:38.084 --> 00:11:40.250
So this you wouldn't notice
it, but this is probably

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:42.380
one of the hardest
pictures I've taken.

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:44.570
This is a purple-eyed
dwarf goby.

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:45.200
It's teeny.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.670
It was taken in Fiji.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.620
And it was just drifting
off of the edge of water

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.170
of the shelf of the reef.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.770
And why it's so difficult is
because it's-- this was taken

00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:56.150
at the macro lens.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:58.880
And what you want
to do is in this--

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.320
it was taken in daylight.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:03.290
And the black is the result
of how you set the camera, so

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:04.460
that you don't have that.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.170
And what you want
is a strong focus

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.760
one to one on the one animal.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.260
And then you want
to blur everything

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:12.410
else in the background,
and keep things in line.

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.200
But when you're drifting,
it's really hard to do.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.892
And so no one believes me that
I practice and control my body,

00:12:17.892 --> 00:12:19.100
my movement, and my strength.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.420
And that's the kind of
image that was really hard,

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:22.250
and where you're focusing.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:23.791
You ever focus really
close, and it's

00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:25.130
hard to keep track of things?

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:27.830
That's what this
was an exercise in.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.760
But they don't move very
much, so that was helpful.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.890
So I'd like to take you
now on a little journey all

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:36.350
the way around the world
to the Phoenix Islands.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:39.440
This is a place in
between Fiji and Hawaii.

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.020
And you can see there's a very
small dot in the very center

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:42.519
there.

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:43.520
That's where we were.

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.876
It was an assignment with
a New England Aquarium

00:12:45.876 --> 00:12:47.750
and partners with
Conservation International.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:52.310
And there was scientists from
Woods Hole, as well there.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.040
And so in this place, this was
one of those assignments where

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.700
it was a--

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.090
it's become one of the
largest marine protected areas

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:00.000
and no-take zones.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.150
The aquarium is doing
tremendous work,

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.190
in terms of
conservation efforts,

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.160
studying about this
place, and conserving it.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.370
And what you get to see in here
are juvenile black-tip reef

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.210
sharks that use the
little lagoon as a place

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:19.290
to grow up and
mature a little bit.

00:13:19.290 --> 00:13:21.600
You see beautiful
coral reefs here.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.600
This is a place that
only few have been to.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:30.810
And again, the sharks peruse
the shelf of the outer reef,

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.030
just slowly looking.

00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:36.820
As we begin to look into the
reef, into some of the things,

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:38.189
you see some small details.

00:13:38.189 --> 00:13:39.730
You can see all
three little shrimp--

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.680
they're sort of
translucent-- hiding

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:49.937
in there, to various
crabs that are there.

00:13:49.937 --> 00:13:52.020
And here's what some of
the scientists were doing.

00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:54.180
They were taking
large core samples,

00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.900
because these corals
grew very, very large.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:13:59.040
They're in pristine waters.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.470
They're relatively
not interfered

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.789
with too many
human interactions.

00:14:03.789 --> 00:14:05.580
And so they take these
large coral samples.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:07.621
And they look at ocean
acidification temperature,

00:14:07.621 --> 00:14:10.140
and a whole bunch of other
things back here in Boston.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.360
And then they'll write
up papers, and have

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.870
a whole bunch of publications.

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:17.760
But what makes conservation,
and photography,

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.002
and integrating the
two so wonderful.

00:14:20.002 --> 00:14:21.460
To me, it was a
moment here-- where

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.630
this is President Tong
of the Kiribati Islands

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.141
with John Kerry
in the background.

00:14:26.141 --> 00:14:28.140
And what the New England
Aquarium has been doing

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.670
is they've been
working with them.

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.240
And he gave a presentation that
was asked for on large oceans,

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.160
on becoming marine
protected areas.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.080
And he used many of
the pictures that I

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.785
had taken from this assignment.

00:14:38.785 --> 00:14:40.410
Albeit, there aren't
many photographers

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.243
who have been there.

00:14:41.243 --> 00:14:43.050
But he did use
them, nonetheless.

00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:47.070
And as a way to show what
it's like to be in a place,

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.950
because it's hard to communicate
what visuals are of a place

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:51.460
without actually seeing them.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.810
And it's that complementary
interaction between scientists

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:59.310
and between photographers
that I think

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:01.860
engage the community about
a place, and make people

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.570
feel connected to it.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.520
On an assignment to
the Turtle Islands,

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.900
which is in the
Philippines and Malaysia--

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.650
it's an assignment about
bilateral countries working

00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:13.520
together.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:18.710
In this one particular area,
there's green sea turtles.

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:21.230
And worldwide, their populations
are really endangered.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.050
But in this one area, there
are really lots of them

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:25.520
all over the place.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.232
And every morning, you would see
sea turtles just walking up--

00:15:29.232 --> 00:15:30.440
you wouldn't see sea turtles.

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.780
You'd see the remnants
of sea turtles there.

00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:34.830
They protected the areas.

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.340
And this is how they
would be marked.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.480
And every day, we looked
for mating sea turtles.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.130
And for the three
weeks I was there,

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:44.320
we really didn't see them,
to be honest with you.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:46.630
And the only way I was
able to see them was--

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.730
finally, I was
sort of frustrated

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.337
that we weren't seeing them.

00:15:50.337 --> 00:15:51.670
We couldn't cover enough ground.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.320
They weren't coming
up to the surface.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.540
So I was towed behind a boat
like a water skier, but slowly,

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.221
and just towed over
long distances.

00:15:59.221 --> 00:16:01.720
And when I saw it finally, I
would break off with my camera,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.880
and snorkel, and free dive
with these for a while.

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.500
And that's how I
would spend time.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:06.790
And they can easily swim away.

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:08.206
But they decided
to stay with you.

00:16:08.206 --> 00:16:12.440
I think they must have
enjoyed the experience.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.949
Anyway, those are
mating sea turtles.

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:17.240
And this is one of those
assignments where there really

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.762
aren't enough hours in a day.

00:16:18.762 --> 00:16:20.720
During the day, you're
looking for sea turtles,

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:23.240
and other coral reefs,
and animals in the reef.

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:26.210
And at night is when they do
all the laying of the eggs.

00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:28.820
And so basically, my day
would start really early.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:31.460
And at night, when here
they would lay their eggs--

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.190
and you would see, again,
the slow motion of the image.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.410
You would see the eggs
that are laid here.

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:41.844
And different approaches,
in the Philippines,

00:16:41.844 --> 00:16:43.260
they let the turtles
lay the eggs.

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:45.900
And as the turtles laid
them, they left them there.

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:48.450
But in Malaysia,
they took the eggs.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:54.200
And they put them into
containers at different depths

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.790
so that the males became males
and females became females.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.980
And then they took
the hatchlings

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:00.699
and released them
into the ocean.

00:17:00.699 --> 00:17:01.740
Two different approaches.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:02.970
Both seemed to be working.

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:06.710
You ever wonder
what it's like to be

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:10.040
a sea turtle when they first
go out at 5:00 in the morning?

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.980
Here's the little
wave that it sees.

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:14.359
And when you're underwater,
this is what it looks like.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.400
And there he is on
his little swim.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.880
Sometimes, nature just finds and
adapts to different conditions.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.369
And so here is a bottle
cap that a crab found.

00:17:30.652 --> 00:17:32.610
And I thought I would
just share a little story

00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:33.985
of what happens
on an assignment,

00:17:33.985 --> 00:17:35.760
and why you need
so much equipment.

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.519
This harmless little cord
here, I thought, got pinched.

00:17:38.519 --> 00:17:41.060
And when I was underwater taking
pictures, all of the sudden,

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.030
my strobes did travel.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:43.127
It didn't flash.

00:17:43.127 --> 00:17:45.210
And I said to myself, well,
maybe I've been tired.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:46.230
I've been working
since midnight.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:47.940
I'm up at 5:00
o'clock every morning.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.273
It's been three weeks like this.

00:17:49.273 --> 00:17:51.230
Maybe I messed up.

00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:52.670
Anyway, I bring it back.

00:17:52.670 --> 00:17:53.897
And I put it back.

00:17:53.897 --> 00:17:55.730
And I noticed a second
camera, same problem.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:57.056
Both cameras don't work.

00:17:57.056 --> 00:17:58.430
And I show it to
one of the guys.

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.180
And he says to me, you
know what happened?

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:00.970
I was like, no.

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:06.380
A mouse came and ate only
the plastic of my cords,

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.670
and wrecked all of them.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.775
Now I only had two left.

00:18:08.775 --> 00:18:11.150
And I'm heading on an assignment
for another three weeks.

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.140
I have to take a day from
where I was-- because you

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.200
had to only get there by boat.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:15.699
There's no internet,
no cell phones,

00:18:15.699 --> 00:18:17.780
no anything-- a day
boat ride to go,

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.587
all the fuel I had to burn
to go to land, send an email.

00:18:20.587 --> 00:18:21.920
I'm embarrassed to fess this up.

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.294
But I did have to
email my mother

00:18:23.294 --> 00:18:29.680
to help coordinate with everyone
while I was off the grid

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.244
how to get two more
for the next one,

00:18:31.244 --> 00:18:33.410
because you don't want to
be without the appropriate

00:18:33.410 --> 00:18:36.280
equipment.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.130
And one other
conservation story that I

00:18:38.130 --> 00:18:41.940
think is really meaningful
is the Atlantic bluefin tuna.

00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:46.050
These ones, every year, go on an
annual migration to reproduce.

00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:48.180
And you can see
them in big numbers.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:50.130
And what they do was,
in the Mediterranean Sea

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.885
where you could see eye-to-eye,
water-to-water, in one area

00:18:52.885 --> 00:18:55.260
when they found the tuna, you
could see-- all those blips

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.680
or dots on the boat are
where the fishing boats

00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.450
are going to catch the tuna.

00:19:00.450 --> 00:19:02.880
And I can tell you that,
in one month of fishing,

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.650
that are licensed
for legal fishing,

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:06.750
they caught the
quota in one day,

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.720
to give you a sense of how much
scale that they're catching.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.249
It's legal.

00:19:10.249 --> 00:19:11.290
It's a good way to do it.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:13.248
But then it's the next
days that we're becoming

00:19:13.248 --> 00:19:15.152
the problems of the fishing.

00:19:15.152 --> 00:19:17.610
And what they would do is they
would use these purse seiner

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:18.390
fishing techniques.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.223
They would swim out.

00:19:19.223 --> 00:19:21.530
They would scoop
up all the tuna.

00:19:21.530 --> 00:19:23.490
They had planes overhead
to spot them-- what

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:24.240
they're not supposed to do.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.698
They threw food in
the water-- what

00:19:25.698 --> 00:19:26.842
they're not supposed to do.

00:19:26.842 --> 00:19:28.800
They did everything
they're not supposed to do.

00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.092
They catch all of them.

00:19:30.092 --> 00:19:31.050
And they round them up.

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:32.883
And then they put them
in these giant cages.

00:19:32.883 --> 00:19:35.700
And you can see the tugboat
going through through the scale

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.350
of the purse seiner nets.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.970
And to give you
a sense of scale,

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.080
the people in the foreground.

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.780
I like this.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:45.750
And what we did is
we would dive in.

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.270
And sometimes, we would
see them in the water.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:50.760
And sometimes, we would see
them in the purse sein nets.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.220
And they were an
incredible animal.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.020
I've never been next
to a fish like this.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:57.240
And to give you a sense of
what the power of it is,

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:02.310
is when it swam by you, it was
like being in a concert where

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.240
you feel the ripple of a
bass going through your chest

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:12.010
as you move back from pure power
of a fish just moving on you.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:13.842
When we did these
very quick dives in,

00:20:13.842 --> 00:20:16.300
they would basically drive the
Zodiac, a little quick boat.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.580
He'd go, you have two minutes
to get in the water and get out.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.550
Because the fishermen
were not exactly happy

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:22.896
we were doing this all the time.

00:20:22.896 --> 00:20:24.520
This is how the sea
looks when it looks

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:25.728
like you're going down on it.

00:20:25.728 --> 00:20:28.150
It's just as large of
a net as you can be.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.150
And when you drop down
to about 150 or 160 feet,

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.920
this is looking back
up to try and give

00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:36.310
a scale of how large
these nets are.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.290
They're actually quite
spacious in there.

00:20:38.290 --> 00:20:40.810
And the fish aren't-- you're
not like packed in like a tiny

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.556
little net.

00:20:42.556 --> 00:20:44.180
And this is the
picture, for me, that's

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:47.060
been the most widely used
of all my photographs.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:49.580
This picture is of the tuna.

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.080
You can see how
reflective they are,

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.210
which is what makes them
so hard to photograph.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.620
And what makes it
so proud for me

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.110
is it was used the picture
to represent the species when

00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:59.720
it was going up for a vote
is an endangered animal.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:02.060
Unfortunately, many countries
abstained from that vote.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.040
So it didn't go through.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.930
But it still feels
very proud to me

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.200
that they use this photo
to represent its species.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.310
And we spent three months.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.780
And I only had three or
four days of opportunities

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:15.202
really seeing the tuna.

00:21:15.202 --> 00:21:17.410
So I thought I would just
transition for a little bit

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:18.880
into the art of
photography, and just

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.338
show some things that I thought
were just really beautiful.

00:21:21.338 --> 00:21:24.280
Because I feel nature is so
spectacular in many ways.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.300
This is in Jellyfish
Lake in Raja Ampat.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.190
Here, you can start
to see texture.

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.990
These are juvenile.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.839
These are eggs of a clownfish.

00:21:35.839 --> 00:21:37.630
And you can see, they're
still in the case.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:40.060
And all the dots are
little eye pupils.

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:44.110
And I think it's for, if
you're a pinhole photography,

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:46.600
there's a certain size that
the eye has to be for it

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.150
to actually see certain things.

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.700
So I believe they are
oversized eyes for really

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.197
such a small creature.

00:21:54.197 --> 00:21:56.530
Here's what polyps look like
when they're open at night.

00:21:59.090 --> 00:22:06.110
Some of what feels like a
painterly side of a clam.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.750
And you can see on
the very bottom,

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.970
while it may look like a
simple and a static picture,

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:14.300
they're actually fairly quick to
close if there's any movement.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.704
They have a lot of eyes.

00:22:15.704 --> 00:22:17.120
On the very top
and on the bottom,

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.530
you can see little
like highlights.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.410
It almost looks
white on the screen.

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:25.550
Those are all eyes all
around the shell of this.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.206
Just some of the movements.

00:22:31.477 --> 00:22:33.560
What's interesting to me
about nature in many ways

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.880
is that color becomes a thing.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.870
We often just say pink,
or yellow, or red.

00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:39.050
But texture, really--
there's a strong gradation,

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:42.750
in terms of coloration.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:45.210
Using flatness where they're
all on the same plane

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.460
and finding ones
so that repetition

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.552
becomes interesting--

00:22:49.552 --> 00:22:51.010
sometimes, it's
about the creatures

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.530
that blend into this, of
which, one, you can see him

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:54.640
in the center there.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.610
It's a crab with its eye facing
to the left, towards this way.

00:23:01.180 --> 00:23:03.280
It's a pygmy
seahorse blending in.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:10.130
And some little motion
of a tiny clinoid

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:15.020
as it starts to crawl
through an anemone.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.390
And lastly, when you want
to flatten out an image so

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.210
that it becomes flat
with the sea around it,

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.640
and just the texture of it
shows, this is what, to me,

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.530
coloration does.

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.930
It so extraordinary
to look at why

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:31.674
there would be those greens and
purples and tones right there.

00:23:31.674 --> 00:23:33.340
So with all the travel
around the world,

00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.840
let me just say that the most
extraordinary places I've ever

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.640
been are Boston and New York.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.480
And no one ever believes
me on these things.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.150
So I'm going to
take you back here

00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.030
to show why this
place is so great.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.722
So this, first of all, is--

00:23:46.722 --> 00:23:48.180
we might as well
start with sharks.

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:49.131
Because, why not?

00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:50.880
This is a project that
I was working with.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.900
This is Greg Skomal.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:54.120
He's tagging a tiger shark.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.132
This is in New York.

00:23:55.132 --> 00:23:57.090
And basically, what
they're studying or looking

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:59.700
at are, when they tag sharks,
is to understand the behavior.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:00.616
Where are they moving?

00:24:00.616 --> 00:24:03.120
How do they move through
the open sea here?

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.649
And so they've caught it.

00:24:04.649 --> 00:24:06.690
And then they're putting
a tag on its dorsal fin.

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.340
This is one way of doing
it where it's in the water.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.310
A second way is when
they lift the shark out.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.350
This is a mako shark.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:16.500
These guys always have a
very ferocious looking eye,

00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:18.480
as you can see right there.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.040
And when they
encounter you, they

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.960
are very skittish and erratic.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.350
Anyway, they're putting
a tag on both of these.

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:27.300
You can see how rough
the sea was that day,

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:29.490
that I'm bobbing in the sea
just over and over again

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.407
waiting for this.

00:24:31.407 --> 00:24:33.990
Here's what happens when a tiger
shark-- when they release it,

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:35.172
you can see the tag on it.

00:24:35.172 --> 00:24:37.380
And then in real time, they
can update and understand

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.810
where it's going
around the area.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:43.009
And some of the sharks that
I've worked on in New York,

00:24:43.009 --> 00:24:45.300
they've been tagged all the
way down to North Carolina,

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.480
and came back up in the
same season, which is pretty

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:50.850
dramatic swimming distance.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.850
And here's what happens
when you take a picture,

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:54.308
and you're a little
bit too close--

00:24:54.308 --> 00:24:56.210
or I didn't mean
to be this close.

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:57.470
And that's the tiger shark.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.220
Although, in this case,
it was a juvenile.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.940
So it's all good.

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:03.770
All right, this is with Greg.

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:05.540
I'm in the air.

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.177
Greg is in the
pulpit on the front.

00:25:07.177 --> 00:25:08.510
And there's a great white shark.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:12.020
This is what you see a
lot of in the Cape now.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.420
And here's why you're
seeing them all.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.530
Here are all the seals.

00:25:16.530 --> 00:25:20.310
And so just a short hop,
skip, and a jump from Chatham

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.590
is to New York, which is
where I live in Brooklyn.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:25.215
And this is a project that I've
now been spending the last four

00:25:25.215 --> 00:25:28.590
years taking pictures to create
awareness with the New York

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.750
aquarium and the Wildlife
Conservation Society

00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.970
to create awareness about
underwater wildlife of New

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:34.342
York.

00:25:34.342 --> 00:25:36.300
It's probably the hardest
place I photographed,

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.680
because the conditions are
much more challenging here.

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.010
One, the animals are
migrating through.

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.510
In most places
around the world, you

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:45.390
know it's relative, right
time of year, certainly,

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.230
you can put yourself
in certain situations.

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.840
But in this, it's
just open water.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.940
You have no way of knowing
when or where something

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.500
is going to be.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.980
And this is Long Island in
the Hamptons looking east

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:57.300
towards Montauk.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.900
And on the right is
the Atlantic Ocean.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.820
And from the air looking down,
we have very diverse habitat.

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:09.920
Here's Great South Bay, which
is a seagrass and wetlands.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.470
And within this habitat, you
see extraordinary animals,

00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:15.710
such as pipe fish.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:17.240
We see bluefish.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.870
These guys, in May, come
in in very cold water,

00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.620
in very shallow
water, buzzing by.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.020
They're extraordinarily fast.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:25.010
And they whip right by.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.060
It's a really
incredible experience.

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:31.450
We have scallops with all those
beautiful little blue eyes.

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.010
And don't be mistaken.

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.850
They're quite fast.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:38.170
And if they see you coming, they
skedaddle away really quick.

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.100
We have nudibranchs.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:40.600
Here it is.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.840
You can see his dot of
his eye in the center.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:48.210
And the green in the background
is the algae that it's next to.

00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:51.180
OK, here's the challenge of
diving in New York and Boston.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.190
The visibility isn't that great.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.810
And the reason it
isn't that great

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:56.760
is not because it's
pollution, but rather

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.680
because it's
nutrient-rich water.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.440
And it's all the plankton,
all the algae in the water.

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.060
All the food source
in the water is

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.280
what makes all these animals
come rushing in here,

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.800
and why it's so rich to see
photographically, visually,

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.350
and from an animal's
perspective.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:12.307
But this is a bait
ball of bunker.

00:27:12.307 --> 00:27:13.890
This is what it looks
like underwater.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:15.360
Now it's hard to see here.

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:17.400
And they're baited
up fairly tight.

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.800
Now I hope to see
this more and more.

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:22.230
This is a moment.

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.330
They don't ball up this
tight all the time.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:27.870
There must be a giant
thresher underneath them deep

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.190
balling them up in this way.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.630
And one day, it will come
up for me through there.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:38.010
And here's what else
we have are wrecks,

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:39.370
lots of wrecks in New York.

00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:45.780
And on these wrecks,
we have conger eels.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:50.630
We have sea bass--
yeah, sorry about that--

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:52.625
and sort of the gradients
of blue mussels.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:28:02.440
We have hydroids.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.180
And then here we had mackerel.

00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:06.970
And this is a night I was
looking for, actually, squid.

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:09.600
But the mackerel came
instead of the squid.

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.390
And at night while I
was going for them,

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.920
I decided to photograph
the mackerel instead.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.874
One baby squid came up.

00:28:16.874 --> 00:28:18.790
And all of the sudden,
the mackerel pegged it.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:22.639
And we never saw
another squid again.

00:28:22.639 --> 00:28:24.430
But here's what happens
on another day when

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.388
a squid actually comes.

00:28:25.388 --> 00:28:27.910
Now this squid didn't actually
attack me or anything.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:32.320
It's on the dome, just
grabbing on a hold of my dome,

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.760
of the round part of the dome.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.250
And this is a moment, for
a photographer, that's

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:36.340
like a panic-stricken moment.

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:37.500
One, do I try for the photo?

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.590
Or two, do I worry
that it's going

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.080
to use its little teeth
right there to bite my dome,

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.360
and flood my camera?

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.684
Anyway, I quickly adjusted
the lights, took one picture,

00:28:47.684 --> 00:28:48.850
and gave him a little nudge.

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:51.925
And off he went.

00:28:51.925 --> 00:28:55.580
In the Hudson Canyon, 100
miles off of Long Island,

00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:56.970
is a flying fish.

00:28:59.810 --> 00:29:02.204
And then strange
sooty shearwaters,

00:29:02.204 --> 00:29:03.620
as they look at
you, and must say,

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:05.320
like, what are you
doing underwater here?

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.403
But you can just see them.

00:29:06.403 --> 00:29:07.340
They dive underwater.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.870
They're really incredible.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:13.060
We have extraordinary
animals that look ungainly.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.220
And they're slow-moving,
like Mola mola here.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.420
But they're really fast.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:17.330
Don't be surprised.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.663
And the people who have seen
them-- although, I have not

00:29:19.663 --> 00:29:23.050
seen it-- jump out of the
water, and just fully launch

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.167
their body out of the water.

00:29:25.167 --> 00:29:27.000
They're often very
curious, and will come up

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.249
to people who are snorkeling.

00:29:29.249 --> 00:29:31.540
And here's what I think is
the most beautiful shark out

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.206
of all the sharks
that I've encountered,

00:29:33.206 --> 00:29:34.717
which is the blue shark.

00:29:34.717 --> 00:29:36.800
When we start to get really
close to these sharks,

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.841
and they come right up
within inches of the lens,

00:29:38.841 --> 00:29:41.270
you can see all the detail
of how it can sense around.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:43.550
So it doesn't just use
its visuals of its eyes.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.130
But also, is using these
other senses much like a radar

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:51.684
to be able to detect, probably,
lots of things around.

00:29:51.684 --> 00:29:53.350
We have sea turtles
that are endangered,

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:56.070
endangered loggerhead
sea turtle.

00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:58.320
And unfortunately, there are
many problems in the sea,

00:29:58.320 --> 00:29:58.830
as well.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:02.295
Here are sharks that have
been entangled in nets,

00:30:02.295 --> 00:30:07.050
others from fishermen,
who let them go.

00:30:07.050 --> 00:30:08.592
But mostly, I want
to just highlight

00:30:08.592 --> 00:30:10.800
the things that are really
extraordinary under there,

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:12.026
which are mahi-mahi.

00:30:12.026 --> 00:30:13.650
And while I've been
looking for a mako,

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.691
and haven't seen a mako
the way I want to see it,

00:30:15.691 --> 00:30:17.850
we do have drifting seahorses.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.700
And this one is just
hiding, and hanging out

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:25.350
with a little grain of
seaweed 20 miles off

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:28.850
of the coast of Long Island.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:32.030
And lastly, we
have a man o' war.

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.470
You don't want to touch these.

00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:36.110
But those two fish
are man o' war fish.

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:39.020
And the amazing thing about this
is on the one day of the sea,

00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:39.950
it just stopped.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:41.260
The wind just paused.

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.760
And when it pauses like that,
you can see through the water.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:46.400
And this is taken from a boat
as we positioned ourselves.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.010
And so it's really just a matter
of time on the sea for that.

00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:53.820
One of the extraordinary
things in New York

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:58.264
is these ancient mariners,
or horseshoe crabs.

00:30:58.264 --> 00:31:00.180
And every year, they
have an annual migration.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:06.400
And on this migration, which is
really important for seabirds

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.300
to come through.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.540
They're dependent on the eggs
from these horseshoe crabs.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.190
And here, you can see them.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.960
And then here, you
would see that they're

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.920
mating and reproducing.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.930
This is taken under a full
picture of a moon at night.

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:24.330
They come in by the thousands.

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:26.220
And in parallel, the
red knot sea birds

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:27.720
come in by the thousands.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.840
And this is extremely important.

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:31.530
This happens in Cape
May, New Jersey.

00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:34.826
And if the horseshoe
crabs are not there,

00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:36.450
the red knots would
not be able to make

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:40.570
their journey all the way
up north through to Canada.

00:31:40.570 --> 00:31:43.890
And because I work with Central
Park Conservancy sometimes,

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.450
you need to be able to show
the plaza in the background.

00:31:46.450 --> 00:31:47.950
One of the turtles--
it probably was

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:51.779
released by someone who bought
one that didn't want it.

00:31:51.779 --> 00:31:53.320
But nonetheless, an
inspiring picture

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.454
that was sort of an
idea that captured

00:31:56.454 --> 00:31:57.870
from other
photographers, who have

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.780
done only surface-level
photographs of wildlife

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:02.577
in the park pond.

00:32:02.577 --> 00:32:05.160
So I'd like to jump to a little
bit of high-speed photography,

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.010
and to show you a little bit
about a few different things.

00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:10.980
So when taking high-speed
photography, normally,

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.720
you shoot cameras that
have about 1,000 frames--

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.400
well, excuse me.

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.424
Let me back up for one second.

00:32:16.424 --> 00:32:18.090
First of all, in
high-speed photography,

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:19.090
you need a lot of light.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:25.350
A normal camera shoots
about 30 frames per second--

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:28.530
video TV, for the most
part, 30 frames per second.

00:32:28.530 --> 00:32:32.550
If you want to use a camera
and it says high speed,

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.170
usually it's 60
frames per second.

00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:35.128
That's not a hard rule.

00:32:35.128 --> 00:32:37.240
But on most cameras, it's
60 frames per second.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.510
Sometimes, it jumps up
to 240 frames per second.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:42.150
And they make it smaller.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:44.310
The cameras that I'm using
are up to 1,000 frames,

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.050
maybe 10,000 frames per second.

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:50.370
And we did-- later, but I
don't have it here today--

00:32:50.370 --> 00:32:52.159
we used one of the
world's fastest cameras

00:32:52.159 --> 00:32:54.450
that was doing 10 million
frames of second on a project

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.760
with the Museum of Science
to look at lightning

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.600
as it sparks and
generates movement.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.160
But what we're
interested in here

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.860
is how things move, and sort
of that invisible, balletic

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:05.471
movement.

00:33:05.471 --> 00:33:07.470
And this is what it looks
like to start to shoot

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:08.786
with these kind of cameras.

00:33:08.786 --> 00:33:11.160
And this is a project that is
with a good friend of mine,

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.910
Allan Adams, who's a physicist.

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:15.480
It's with Jim Bales,
who works as Assistant

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:18.330
Director of the Edgerton
Center, and has just been

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:22.864
a joy of a project to work on.

00:33:22.864 --> 00:33:24.280
And so I thought
what I would show

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:26.170
you is what you
won't expect to see,

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:27.730
something that is
slow moving that

00:33:27.730 --> 00:33:30.220
looks really cool
under high speed.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.150
It's 1,000 frames per second.

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:35.140
It's about 20 times slower
than what your eye sees.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:39.510
And what this is a jellyfish.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:43.050
And you can just begin to
see all the subtle detail

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:48.210
in movement, which to me
looks like just a water, just

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.604
so beautiful.

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:00.160
So the way this plays is it
would play back 30 frames

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.035
per second-- just to
give you a sense of it--

00:34:02.035 --> 00:34:03.160
over 20 times slower.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.810
So you captured
that many frames.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:06.340
And it plays it really slow.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:11.940
And don't be mistaken of it
looking static and still.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.800
In photographing this, you can
see there's like a white dot.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:17.699
I'm moving the
camera and panning up

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:21.060
with this at the same speed
of the jellyfish moving.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.429
So it gives the illusion
of stability and stable.

00:34:23.429 --> 00:34:24.929
But if I just left
the camera, it

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.420
would be out of frame
[SNAPS] like this.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.489
And you wouldn't have
the shot long enough.

00:34:35.697 --> 00:34:37.530
The other technology
that we've been working

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:41.100
on a lot, which is looking
at 360 degree cameras,

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:44.139
and how to understand how things
move in spherical dimensions.

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:46.680
Now normally, with the camera,
I'm shooting in one dimension.

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.690
But learning how to
shoot in all around you

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:51.319
is a whole different world.

00:34:51.319 --> 00:34:53.610
And so in order to show you
what this experience looked

00:34:53.610 --> 00:34:55.770
like-- again, this is
collaboration with Allan.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:57.660
This is working with
MIT, a collaboration

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.970
with the Museum of Science
and their planetarium

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:01.850
to help do this.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:03.270
I went into the
giant ocean tank,

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:04.895
and thought I would
share with you what

00:35:04.895 --> 00:35:07.980
it looks like to dive
in the giant ocean tank

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:09.830
from 360 point of view.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.560
Now you can see me
very faintly, like you

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:16.095
would flatten the Earth out
if you looked at it unraveled.

00:35:16.095 --> 00:35:17.310
I'm all the way on the left.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:19.050
And I'm all the
way on the right.

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.210
I'm in the worst possible spot.

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:26.520
And you can see the multiple
cameras moving around.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.770
And I really like this for
the artistic interpretation

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.870
of how we view ourselves.

00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:33.780
And you can see that
we're feeding the fish.

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.090
And I'm inside the tank.

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:38.040
Now the experience
that you will see--

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.800
I have to pause
and jump over here.

00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.400
This is me here.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:52.240
Now I'm just going to
turn around a little bit,

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:56.100
and show you what it feels like
to be in the giant ocean tank.

00:35:58.770 --> 00:36:01.380
And if you ever wonder, well,
what's happening up here,

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:04.670
we can see up here too.

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:07.070
And so it gives you
a full frame of way

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.535
to do this, to experience
more than one perspective.

00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:12.410
And at some levels, it's
a little nauseating.

00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:14.450
And in other ways,
it's really great.

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:15.590
But it's in its infancy.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:18.574
And you can see that, with
my hand in the bottom left,

00:36:18.574 --> 00:36:20.240
that it sort of looks
like it's missing.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.970
This is where the stitching
overlap isn't perfect yet.

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:24.920
You can see that I'm
not holding any item.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.350
But really, I'm holding the
camera as we're doing this.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:29.932
And there's a pole
there that is invisible.

00:36:29.932 --> 00:36:32.390
And if you're wondering where
all that food is coming from,

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:34.430
you need only turn
the camera around

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:37.260
to see that he's
feeding over here.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:40.100
And if you want to look up, then
he must be around somewhere.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:41.447
Or maybe it just happened.

00:36:41.447 --> 00:36:43.530
Oh, there's the-- oh, just
watch this swim around.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:46.340
I do like this one part here.

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:47.460
We'll go the other way.

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:54.530
I'll straighten you guys out.

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:56.999
I'll say this, that one
of the challenges of using

00:36:56.999 --> 00:36:59.040
this kind of equipment,
it's been-- first of all,

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.748
there are many challenges
along the line.

00:37:00.748 --> 00:37:05.180
Mostly, light is a big factor
on the underwater 360 modes.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.910
But the one other real
challenge of doing this

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:12.230
is learning how to
view something in a way

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:15.290
where not all sides are
as interesting as others--

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.040
and so oftener not,
our perspective.

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.830
And in a world that
we really live in,

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:23.360
we really don't look around
us all the time so crazily.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.160
And the camera sort
of begins to give us

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.740
that perspective of not
sure where our point of view

00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:28.670
might be.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:31.969
But it is a really fun
and interesting space.

00:37:31.969 --> 00:37:34.010
And I think the underwater
world is a great place

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:37.190
to take people into a
world where we're totally

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.851
immersed in a situation.

00:37:38.851 --> 00:37:40.850
And the Dome in the
Planetarium was particularly

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.010
enjoyable to do this.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:44.690
This a arowana.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:45.500
It's in the Amazon.

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.170
This is all taken at the New
England Aquarium through glass.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:53.030
You can see a small little
cricket up on the top.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:38:03.860
OK, you see it accelerate
through, and land down.

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:10.090
Shooting these at the
high speed has been--

00:38:10.090 --> 00:38:11.920
it's actually the
joy of what we're

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:13.600
working on now more and more.

00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.540
And I think the goal
is to how to get this

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.640
into an underwater
environment, how

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:24.430
to push ourselves to be
able to capture faster

00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:26.397
speeds, or slower speeds.

00:38:26.397 --> 00:38:28.480
And the way you take these
pictures in high speed,

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.150
because you can't react
fast enough all the time,

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:34.040
you said it to take
a picture a second.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.560
It's constantly recording.

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:37.660
And when you
capture the shot, it

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.350
records for maybe a second or
two before or after the image

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:42.370
that is taken.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:45.490
So you're able to guarantee
that you capture that moment.

00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.950
And then you look back
at it and watch it.

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.770
And this whole process of
each shot that you take

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:55.480
can be anything from 10
minutes to 20 minutes

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:57.880
to watch and render to even
see if you got something.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:00.130
So the process of really
capturing these over and over

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:02.360
again is quite
difficult and slow.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:06.360
I might not have it on here.

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:10.660
I'll show you the lightning,
if you want to see that.

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:16.890
All right, this is taken
with a still camera.

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:19.470
This is a project that I
was done with Don Campbell

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.890
back there, as well, Allan
Adams, the Museum of Science.

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:26.940
And what we wanted to do is
photograph how lightning moves.

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:31.060
And so first, the way
we did this was we

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.190
looked at, how do you
do it with a camera?

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:34.690
And so you want to
open the shutter.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:36.630
And you take it over
a long exposure here.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.630
And you capture the light
moving back and forth.

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.270
And this was an extremely
wonderful experience.

00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:43.290
So then I said, OK,
well, we'll go down.

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:44.290
We'll use a fast camera.

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:45.190
And they said, well,
what can you get?

00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:47.023
And I said, well, we
can get a camera that's

00:39:47.023 --> 00:39:49.379
capable of 100,000
frames per second.

00:39:49.379 --> 00:39:50.170
So I went in there.

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:51.710
I was thinking, oh, my god,
100,000 frames per second.

00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:52.720
We're going to get a great shot.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:53.890
And I'll be very happy.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:54.512
We go down.

00:39:54.512 --> 00:39:55.720
We start taking the pictures.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.130
And we use the camera.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:39:59.380
And it sparks.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.525
And we don't really
get anything.

00:40:01.525 --> 00:40:02.710
And I'm like, oh, my god.

00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:04.780
And I think Allan probably
knew deep down inside

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.710
I wasn't going to get anything.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.335
But I don't think he
wanted to tell me,

00:40:07.335 --> 00:40:10.060
just because he was
giving me a hard time.

00:40:10.060 --> 00:40:12.700
Anyway, so the
next thing I know,

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.459
we don't get anything-- no
better than a standard camera.

00:40:15.459 --> 00:40:17.500
Turns out that the lightning
is moving way faster

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.170
than a camera that's capable
of 100,000 frames per second.

00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:22.330
I was better just
opening the shutter.

00:40:22.330 --> 00:40:24.070
So I thought we would
be in difficult.

00:40:24.070 --> 00:40:28.480
So we wrote and pitched
an idea to [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:31.540
to ask if they would be
willing to work with us,

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:33.280
and to come down to
lend us a camera that

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.520
was capable of shooting at
10 million frames per second.

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.530
And would they work
with us on this project?

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:40.510
So he flew in from California.

00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:42.220
And we all set out to do this.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:42.730
We set up.

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:43.688
Don was really helpful.

00:40:43.688 --> 00:40:46.270
He made a trip wire that
would send the time,

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:47.890
so that we could
trigger this thing.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.840
Because your reaction
is nowhere near fast

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:55.921
enough to capture these images
without some sort of device to

00:40:55.921 --> 00:40:56.420
do this.

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:58.851
And so what you saw here,
this is at 10 million frames

00:40:58.851 --> 00:40:59.350
per second.

00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:01.084
And what we discovered
here is here

00:41:01.084 --> 00:41:02.500
you can see the
spark of lightning

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.940
right here in the center.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:09.010
And what you would see is it
grow out, and out, and out.

00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:12.820
To give you a sense of what that
is, that was about 20 frames.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:16.060
20 frames of 10 million
frames per second

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:19.198
is about the speed of what
we had here to capture this.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.862
Well, that was the lightning.

00:41:25.862 --> 00:41:26.570
Sorry about this.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:29.240
But this as the superhero
of all superheroes.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:35.990
This is a poison-arrow
dart frog as it climbs

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.700
at about 800 frames per second.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.730
So what we did was this was shot
at the New England Aquarium.

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:51.050
We just misted up though
the glass in the front.

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.940
And then he climbed up.

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.100
And you can see, it's
totally incredible.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.500
He would just grab a
hold, and could literally

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:59.090
climb a vertical surface.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:14.611
These things are
absolutely incredible.

00:42:14.611 --> 00:42:15.860
And you can see him breathing.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:19.190
And this is the joy of
high-speed photography,

00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:27.000
in that the slowness is
really wonderful of it.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.485
He does jump, though.

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:13.058
There's one other shark
on I wanted to show you.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:19.580
Maybe I'll take questions
while I look for this one.

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:21.630
I better take questions
while I look for that.

00:43:21.630 --> 00:43:23.380
- Well, let's thank
the speaker, actually.

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:24.668
- Thank you.

00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:27.602
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:40.970
- With all the predatory
fish and animals in the sea,

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:42.260
I was wondering--

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:44.270
because I had a
brother who surfed

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:46.490
from Ogunquit to New Jersey--

00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:50.750
are they dangerous for
people who are surfing,

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.180
or in the water?

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.460
- The sharks?

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:53.960
- Anything.

00:43:53.960 --> 00:43:57.020
I mean, you had such
an array of them

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.050
that I was wondering
if they're dangerous,

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:04.770
whether they're further
out than people surf?

00:44:04.770 --> 00:44:07.820
- My experience with
sharks is that--

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.840
in order to do
shark photography,

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.250
you have to bait them
in close, to be honest.

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:20.870
And I have had lots of
experiences with sharks.

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:22.760
They're not like
mad predators that

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.460
are just erratically moving.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:28.190
There are dangerous places
to be, in that they're places

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:29.540
where they could get confused.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.139
They could be in water
that's shallow, that's murky,

00:44:32.139 --> 00:44:33.680
where they're looking
for other prey,

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.140
and make accidental attacks.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:38.450
I think most of them are
really do what's called

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:39.942
like test bites on people.

00:44:39.942 --> 00:44:41.150
But they're just big animals.

00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:45.650
So they don't
necessarily intend to do

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:47.180
the damage they may be doing.

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:49.880
They're quite cautious,
sharks, actually.

00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:52.265
So the answer to your
question is, yes, there

00:44:52.265 --> 00:44:54.390
are some areas that I
probably wouldn't go surfing.

00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:56.514
I'm not sure I would surf
right next to the beaches

00:44:56.514 --> 00:44:59.450
where all the seals
are in Chatham, right?

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:02.750
But I would surf
in other places.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:07.430
And I think that the challenge
is not putting yourself

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:09.770
in an area where
there's likely to be

00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:13.460
some of those dangerous
moments in there.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:17.360
But I will say that one thing
that I really want to reiterate

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:20.660
is that they're, typically,
very cautious in the way

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:22.340
that they approach.

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.840
They're not just coming in
hot from around the corner

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.010
and flying in towards you.

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:29.000
Quite honestly, I
don't even think

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.290
you'd know they were
coming towards you.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:32.914
Because they would come in from
another side, or another angle,

00:45:32.914 --> 00:45:35.210
or something like that.

00:45:35.210 --> 00:45:38.846
But I would say to most
people, do not worry.

00:45:38.846 --> 00:45:40.220
The chance of
encountering them--

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:44.180
I never see them when I'm not
looking for them, virtually.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:48.290
But be careful in the areas
that they know are trouble,

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:50.170
I guess is how I'd phrase that.

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:51.170
Yup?

00:45:51.170 --> 00:46:03.220
- [INAUDIBLE] The high
speed shots of the fish,

00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:06.740
you said the camera tracked--

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.620
- Not the camera, me.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.430
We had to track with it.

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.930
- OK.

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:15.500
How did you keep the frame from
showing the movement of this?

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:18.310
- Yeah, great question.

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:20.212
So it's on a tripod.

00:46:20.212 --> 00:46:21.670
And you would pan
and tilt with it.

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:24.220
And if the movement was
too erratic or too quick,

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.510
you would see that, actually.

00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:28.540
But it's on a very fluid head.

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.530
So it's a very smooth
transition like this.

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:35.220
And the movement isn't so great.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:38.066
You're not like whipping it up
in that kind of speed there.

00:46:38.066 --> 00:46:39.690
- You're actually
doing it [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:40.750
- You have to do it manually.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:42.870
And quite honestly, the
other thing you have to do

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:45.000
is you have to adjust
focus manually.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.590
Because as it changes, its
focus changes, as well.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:53.490
So if you're shooting something
small with a macro lens,

00:46:53.490 --> 00:46:56.940
you have to be in rhythm
shooting, panning,

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.130
and focusing all in real time.

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:00.120
And it's confusing.

00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.690
Because you can't over
or under focus wrong.

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:04.890
Because you will see that.

00:47:04.890 --> 00:47:08.610
In slow motion, it becomes
extremely obvious to you

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:09.840
that you're off.

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.900
So a little mistake in
there makes big differences.

00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.920
And I can only say that it
came with lots of practice.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.930
We spent lots of time.

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:21.180
We made lots of
mistakes doing this.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.680
- Thank you so much
for the footage.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:24.000
It's fantastic.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:28.710
I wanted to ask you whether
you would speak a little bit

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:33.540
about what you might
have seen, in terms

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:37.470
of the impact of climate
change at various sites

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:41.280
that I'm assuming you visited
multiple times over the course

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:42.990
of the last few years.

00:47:42.990 --> 00:47:47.100
In my own experience on
expeditions to Great Barrier

00:47:47.100 --> 00:47:51.720
Reef, things have changed--
in terms of three years,

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:56.160
since 2013, multiple
bleaching events.

00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.340
What have you seen?

00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:58.920
What has struck you?

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:02.010
- Well, I can tell you
this, that everywhere you

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:06.150
go in the ocean, the
timing is off now.

00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:09.690
If the things are
migrations of this time,

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:11.460
if the seas are supposed
to be like this,

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.430
it's all off sync
a little bit now.

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:17.210
We have seen that a lot of--

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:20.490
not always the mass bleaching
events that you see everywhere.

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:22.230
But there are
definitely bleaching

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:26.460
of coral everywhere you
go, definitely the seas--

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:30.240
in the Caribbean, it's hard
to find a Caribbean reef that

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:30.780
is healthy.

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:33.720
The only place I've ever been in
the Caribbean that's beautiful

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.700
is in Limones
National Marine Park,

00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:41.010
which is a park there that
still has the gorgeous elkhorn

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:43.080
coral and beautiful.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:47.250
Looks like what a reef look
like ages ago in the Caribbean.

00:48:47.250 --> 00:48:50.380
The problems are the
obvious, that climate change

00:48:50.380 --> 00:48:52.060
is a real issue.

00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:55.230
The overfishing and the
fishing are real problems.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:58.290
And in places like
in the Philippines,

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:00.930
the truth is that, as
the populations increase,

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:04.219
the people who have
to go fish there,

00:49:04.219 --> 00:49:05.760
they have to take
these little boats,

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.531
and go further and
further out to sea.

00:49:07.531 --> 00:49:09.030
And you might say,
well, it's not so

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:10.238
bad to go further out to sea.

00:49:10.238 --> 00:49:12.990
But really, the implication
of further out to sea for them

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:15.240
is that there are
squalls every day in 3:00

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.010
or 4:00 o'clock
in the afternoon.

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:18.630
And so those pushing
the distances

00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:23.250
are make the pushing
coming back to land

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:25.910
a real challenge for them.

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:33.510
And so in Madagascar, we saw
the start of climate change,

00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:35.250
of real bleaching.

00:49:35.250 --> 00:49:39.180
But I wasn't there in
Australia to see that.

00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:41.730
And in the Phoenix Islands
they also had to have had some.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.740
- Thanks for the talk.

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.530
I'm curious, how
long do you typically

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:50.720
spend underwater
at one time on one

00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.250
of these photography
expeditions?

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:54.560
And what is it that limits
the duration of those?

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.660
Is it the amount of
air you have available?

00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:01.610
Or is it, in cold water, maybe
just a temperature issue?

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:03.840
- That's a great question.

00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:06.710
I would spend as long
underwater as I possibly can.

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.720
I'm limited by air is a factor.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.910
Temperature is also,
but to a less extent.

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:16.820
You would wear enough to be
comfortable in those things.

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.640
So it's mostly your air
that you're limited by.

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:21.200
And sometimes, the
objective of where

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:23.090
you're going, like they
may say, the currents

00:50:23.090 --> 00:50:24.920
can switch often times on you.

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:28.050
So a lot of places, you
are very tide dependent.

00:50:28.050 --> 00:50:32.210
So for instance, you
may have 45 minutes.

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:33.770
And that's all you get.

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:36.830
Because once the tide and the
current switches in slack tide,

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:40.580
you can't hang out
there long enough.

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.230
A lot goes with depth.

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:43.790
If you're really
deep, you have to be

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:46.760
prepared to handle the
deeper deeper depths.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.509
And that requires all sorts of
other air, and time, and stuff.

00:50:49.509 --> 00:50:51.050
And so really, it's
a matter of being

00:50:51.050 --> 00:50:52.716
prepared for what you
want to photograph

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:53.720
and being under there.

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.180
Unfortunately, the reality
is is that all the fish

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:58.190
like the strong currents.

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:00.260
Sharks stay in strong
current, because it's

00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:01.590
convenient for them.

00:51:01.590 --> 00:51:04.130
And so you have to
hustle through this.

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:06.770
And you're kicking
really fast But you're

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.680
exerting all of your energy
to stay in those places.

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.450
So you're really
only limited by what

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:15.750
you're prepared to be
in the conditions for.

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:18.960
- You mentioned the Limones
Park in the Caribbean.

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.640
Where is that located?

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.053
- Not far from Cancun,
ironically, of all places, huh?

00:51:28.683 --> 00:51:31.550
- We probably can take
about three more questions.

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:34.820
- Have you done any
photography in colder waters,

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.410
like Northern waters at all?

00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:39.710
And what kind of sea life
would you expect there?

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:41.600
- I haven't been to the
Arctic, or Antarctic.

00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.640
And I haven't been to any of
those under ice conditions.

00:51:45.640 --> 00:51:49.400
That's on my future list of
places to go and things to do.

00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:54.110
But I would say
the coldest water

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:56.930
that I've been diving in
is really locally here.

00:51:56.930 --> 00:52:00.650
Quite honestly, it gets
pretty cold under there.

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:02.840
At the surface it could
be like 60 and 50.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:08.360
But if you go down to 50
feet, 100 feet, 150 feet,

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.700
that temperature can
drop to 40 degrees.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.800
And at 40 degrees
and 50 degrees,

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:14.750
it's pretty cold under there.

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.210
And I can tell you
that you know you're

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:20.720
cold when you have to move
the arms of your strobes,

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.420
and you don't want
to move your own arm

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:25.700
for fear of being colder.

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:32.720
- OK, maybe two more questions.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.660
This one over here.

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.540
Two over here.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:39.050
- I was curious what, if
any, advances in photography

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:42.470
have come about and made
your work easier, and any

00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:43.670
that you would hope for?

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:45.770
Because we work in the deep sea.

00:52:45.770 --> 00:52:48.080
And seawater attenuates light.

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:53.000
So unless we have Jim Cameron
with us, we can only see.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.550
- Well, the cameras are
changing fast and very rapidly.

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.650
And the sensors
are becoming pretty

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:05.480
sensitive to a wide range
and spectrum of light.

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.907
I think, obviously, you want
more sensitivity to light.

00:53:07.907 --> 00:53:09.240
And you want to work with light.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.370
That's the two main things
you're always looking for.

00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:15.980
I think it's not an
easy question to answer.

00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:19.820
But I think that
range is what's there.

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:24.680
What I can tell you from an art
and a photography perspective,

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.230
as I see these cameras
becoming more simple,

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:29.330
as I see Jobs' dream
of everyone who

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:31.100
can take a picture
with their iPhone,

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:33.800
and gets these
incredible shots now,

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.200
you see that the
power of photography

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.910
is really the illusion
of photography,

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:41.150
and really capturing that image
the way you envision it to be.

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:44.229
And all that these other
cameras do, in many instances,

00:53:44.229 --> 00:53:46.520
is they capture these moments
really quite beautifully.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.080
Because the difference
between light

00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:50.379
inside and outside
is very different,

00:53:50.379 --> 00:53:51.920
and can be really
hard to photograph.

00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:53.600
And if you ask me to do
that, I might spend all day

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:54.808
setting that kind of shot up.

00:53:54.808 --> 00:53:57.920
And now these cameras do that
very effortlessly, very easily.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.510
But what they lack
is in the ability

00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:02.120
is how to compose the subtler
things, the motion to it,

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.570
the aperture settings.

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:05.660
And so in some ways,
I feel like there's

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:07.880
a strong education
on understanding

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:10.130
the appreciation and the
aesthetics of the photography

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:13.010
of what makes an image in
looking at those elements.

00:54:13.010 --> 00:54:15.800
Because they, in quick
glances, get skipped over.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:19.790
But in lined up, they really
become readily apparent.

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:21.300
And so in answering
your question,

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.720
I mean, I hope the innovations
of this technology moves

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:26.100
forward tremendously,
more sensitivity to light,

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:27.600
and better lighting,
and lights that

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:30.987
can go deeper, and stay
longer would be great.

00:54:30.987 --> 00:54:31.820
- One last question.

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:34.876
I think it was over here.

00:54:34.876 --> 00:54:36.500
- Hi, Keith, thanks
for doing the talk.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.840
And it was great to
see more of your work.

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:40.730
What I was wondering
is how marine debris

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:43.737
might have impacted your work
and your experience with it?

00:54:43.737 --> 00:54:46.070
Because I've heard stories
from some photographers where

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:48.260
they have to physically
move things out of the way

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:50.210
before they take the
shot to make it--

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:52.793
- You mean, like the trash would
be there that you're moving--

00:54:52.793 --> 00:54:55.622
- Yeah, and plastic pollution
beings so prevalent.

00:54:55.622 --> 00:54:57.330
- I guess people do
those kind of things.

00:54:57.330 --> 00:55:00.530
That's not really the style of
the photography that I do do.

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:03.620
But I will say that
what I do notice

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:07.140
a lot is a lot of marine
debris in the water.

00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.920
And what you notice
a lot with that

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:12.770
is actually animals sometimes
adapting to using them.

00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:14.930
In open water
conditions, they provide

00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:16.110
shelter for a lot of things.

00:55:16.110 --> 00:55:16.943
And it's really sad.

00:55:16.943 --> 00:55:19.960
You see these plastic trash
cans drifting through the--

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.370
not trash bags, just
like plastic trash

00:55:22.370 --> 00:55:24.020
in a bag just drifting.

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.420
And you'll see sort
of fish hanging out

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:27.720
near those kinds of things.

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.620
And it's really amazing to see.

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:37.670
But I think after storms,
especially in remote beaches,

00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:39.830
we would go through,
and you see lots

00:55:39.830 --> 00:55:42.860
of trash, lots of
plastic that are

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:46.280
just up on the beach at
the high tide mark that

00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:49.020
come in a couple of days later
after those types of things.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.560
And it's really quite
sad that it's not there,

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.380
or removed, or--

00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:56.120
- OK, so let's
thank Keith again.

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:57.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:57.320 --> 00:56:00.370
