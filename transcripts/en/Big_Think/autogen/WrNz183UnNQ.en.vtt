00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:09.060
history of the world in every culture in
every language there's expressive play

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:09.070
every language there's expressive play
 

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.460
every language there's expressive play
expressed expressive word play there's

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:11.470
expressed expressive word play there's
 

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.620
expressed expressive word play there's
language used to different purposes that

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:13.630
language used to different purposes that
 

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.660
language used to different purposes that
we would call poetry so I think poetry

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:15.670
we would call poetry so I think poetry
 

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:18.150
we would call poetry so I think poetry
will survive and I don't think it will

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160
will survive and I don't think it will
 

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.410
will survive and I don't think it will
be the end of poetry our tremendous the

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:22.420
be the end of poetry our tremendous the
 

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.690
be the end of poetry our tremendous the
tremendous onslaught of mass media all

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:24.700
tremendous onslaught of mass media all
 

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.870
tremendous onslaught of mass media all
the time that we're suffering and we

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:27.880
the time that we're suffering and we
 

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.670
the time that we're suffering and we
don't really know how to think about

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:29.680
don't really know how to think about
 

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:31.620
don't really know how to think about
I think that puts certain things at risk

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:31.630
I think that puts certain things at risk
 

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:33.270
I think that puts certain things at risk
I don't think poetry will died but I

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:33.280
I don't think poetry will died but I
 

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.880
I don't think poetry will died but I
think that poetry does demand a certain

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:35.890
think that poetry does demand a certain
 

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:38.910
think that poetry does demand a certain
kind of attention to language it does

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:38.920
kind of attention to language it does
 

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.030
kind of attention to language it does
demand a certain space in order to read

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040
demand a certain space in order to read
 

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.450
demand a certain space in order to read
it and I think that space is somewhat

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:44.460
it and I think that space is somewhat
 

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.010
it and I think that space is somewhat
threatened by the lack of attention that

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:47.020
threatened by the lack of attention that
 

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.710
threatened by the lack of attention that
people have in the amount of time that

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720
people have in the amount of time that
 

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.230
people have in the amount of time that
they give to things so I just think that

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240
they give to things so I just think that
 

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.600
they give to things so I just think that
that limits the kinds of experiences

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:54.610
that limits the kinds of experiences
 

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.180
that limits the kinds of experiences
that people can have with poetry but

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:57.190
that people can have with poetry but
 

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.800
that people can have with poetry but
poetry will survive I don't I don't

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:58.810
poetry will survive I don't I don't
 

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:01.200
poetry will survive I don't I don't
worry about that but I do think that it

00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:01.210
worry about that but I do think that it
 

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:06.180
worry about that but I do think that it
may save a few fewer souls if people

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:06.190
may save a few fewer souls if people
 

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:11.590
may save a few fewer souls if people
can't pay attention

00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600
 

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.299
I think they can do both things

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:13.309
I think they can do both things
 

00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:18.250
I think they can do both things
depending on the poet I think that the

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:18.260
depending on the poet I think that the
 

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.059
depending on the poet I think that the
the dark side of MFA programs is that

00:17:21.059 --> 00:17:21.069
the dark side of MFA programs is that
 

00:17:21.069 --> 00:17:23.590
the dark side of MFA programs is that
they're generating more poets than the

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600
they're generating more poets than the
 

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.770
they're generating more poets than the
culture can absorb and there are more

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:26.780
culture can absorb and there are more
 

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:29.890
culture can absorb and there are more
people writing poetry than possibly read

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:29.900
people writing poetry than possibly read
 

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:31.779
people writing poetry than possibly read
it or can certainly earn a living

00:17:31.779 --> 00:17:31.789
it or can certainly earn a living
 

00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:35.049
it or can certainly earn a living
around it and so that's that's a stress

00:17:35.049 --> 00:17:35.059
around it and so that's that's a stress
 

00:17:35.059 --> 00:17:37.390
around it and so that's that's a stress
on the system and I think a painful

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400
on the system and I think a painful
 

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.490
on the system and I think a painful
thing for many young poets who are

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:39.500
thing for many young poets who are
 

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.990
thing for many young poets who are
looking to find a life in poetry that

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000
looking to find a life in poetry that
 

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.419
looking to find a life in poetry that
they're not going to be able to find the

00:17:43.419 --> 00:17:43.429
they're not going to be able to find the
 

00:17:43.429 --> 00:17:45.760
they're not going to be able to find the
very good thing about MFA programs is

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:45.770
very good thing about MFA programs is
 

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:49.299
very good thing about MFA programs is
they're democratizing they bring a lot

00:17:49.299 --> 00:17:49.309
they're democratizing they bring a lot
 

00:17:49.309 --> 00:17:51.490
they're democratizing they bring a lot
of different people to the table it's

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:51.500
of different people to the table it's
 

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.289
of different people to the table it's
not I mean in the history of poetry

00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:53.299
not I mean in the history of poetry
 

00:17:53.299 --> 00:17:54.460
not I mean in the history of poetry
there have been a lot of porches where

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:54.470
there have been a lot of porches where
 

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.440
there have been a lot of porches where
you have to inherit the position of poet

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:56.450
you have to inherit the position of poet
 

00:17:56.450 --> 00:18:00.039
you have to inherit the position of poet
from your ancestors and I think that if

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:00.049
from your ancestors and I think that if
 

00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:02.039
from your ancestors and I think that if
you just leave anyone to become a poet

00:18:02.039 --> 00:18:02.049
you just leave anyone to become a poet
 

00:18:02.049 --> 00:18:05.500
you just leave anyone to become a poet
based on an aristocratic Society then a

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:05.510
based on an aristocratic Society then a
 

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.060
based on an aristocratic Society then a
lot of people are left out who might

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:07.070
lot of people are left out who might
 

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:09.940
lot of people are left out who might
have something to offer and I think the

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:09.950
have something to offer and I think the
 

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:13.149
have something to offer and I think the
MFA program is a way of bringing a lot

00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159
MFA program is a way of bringing a lot
 

00:18:13.159 --> 00:18:14.799
MFA program is a way of bringing a lot
of different people to the table and

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:14.809
of different people to the table and
 

00:18:14.809 --> 00:18:17.500
of different people to the table and
inviting them in so I think that's very

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:17.510
inviting them in so I think that's very
 

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:22.060
inviting them in so I think that's very
good I would be happier if people who

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:22.070
good I would be happier if people who
 

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:25.450
good I would be happier if people who
went through MFA programs also had were

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:25.460
went through MFA programs also had were
 

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.840
went through MFA programs also had were
already by then deeply committed readers

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:28.850
already by then deeply committed readers
 

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.330
already by then deeply committed readers
of poetry because we need readers of

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:31.340
of poetry because we need readers of
 

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.640
of poetry because we need readers of
poetry as much as writers of poetry and

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:33.650
poetry as much as writers of poetry and
 

00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:37.090
poetry as much as writers of poetry and
I think in terms of educating a group of

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:37.100
I think in terms of educating a group of
 

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.149
I think in terms of educating a group of
readers MFA programs are very are very

00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159
readers MFA programs are very are very
 

00:18:40.159 --> 00:18:42.700
readers MFA programs are very are very
good I just think the model of MFA

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:42.710
good I just think the model of MFA
 

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:45.130
good I just think the model of MFA
programs in which a young poet ghosted

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:45.140
programs in which a young poet ghosted
 

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.659
programs in which a young poet ghosted
program publishes a series of books gets

00:18:48.659 --> 00:18:48.669
program publishes a series of books gets
 

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:51.820
program publishes a series of books gets
teaching jobs that's a that's a bit at

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:51.830
teaching jobs that's a that's a bit at
 

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.080
teaching jobs that's a that's a bit at
risk I don't think the culture can

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:53.090
risk I don't think the culture can
 

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.500
risk I don't think the culture can
absorb so many people writing poetry and

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:56.510
absorb so many people writing poetry and
 

00:18:56.510 --> 00:19:02.510
absorb so many people writing poetry and
trying to earn their living in poetry

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520
 

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.190
first of all I think that poetry is very

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:05.200
first of all I think that poetry is very
 

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.460
first of all I think that poetry is very
noble and I always have with me the

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:08.470
noble and I always have with me the
 

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:11.520
noble and I always have with me the
sense of the nobility of poetry and when

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:11.530
sense of the nobility of poetry and when
 

00:19:11.530 --> 00:19:13.470
sense of the nobility of poetry and when
you are entering into poetry whatever

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480
you are entering into poetry whatever
 

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.350
you are entering into poetry whatever
stage you're at you are participating in

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:16.360
stage you're at you are participating in
 

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.120
stage you're at you are participating in
something with a very long and noble

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:18.130
something with a very long and noble
 

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.030
something with a very long and noble
tradition and so I would keep in mind to

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:21.040
tradition and so I would keep in mind to
 

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.710
tradition and so I would keep in mind to
a young poet that you were entering

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720
a young poet that you were entering
 

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.410
a young poet that you were entering
there's something that is very important

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:25.420
there's something that is very important
 

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.660
there's something that is very important
that has always been important in terms

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:27.670
that has always been important in terms
 

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.990
that has always been important in terms
of human concerns the way to become a

00:19:30.990 --> 00:19:31.000
of human concerns the way to become a
 

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.920
of human concerns the way to become a
poet is to read poetry and to imitate

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:34.930
poet is to read poetry and to imitate
 

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:37.170
poet is to read poetry and to imitate
what you read and to read passionately

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:37.180
what you read and to read passionately
 

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.050
what you read and to read passionately
and widely and has involved the way as

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:40.060
and widely and has involved the way as
 

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.090
and widely and has involved the way as
you can it's not important it's not

00:19:42.090 --> 00:19:42.100
you can it's not important it's not
 

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.640
you can it's not important it's not
necessary that you read everything what

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:44.650
necessary that you read everything what
 

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.500
necessary that you read everything what
is necessary is that you care about

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:46.510
is necessary is that you care about
 

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:48.510
is necessary is that you care about
things that you read and you find

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520
things that you read and you find
 

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.550
things that you read and you find
something that really matters to you and

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:50.560
something that really matters to you and
 

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:52.950
something that really matters to you and
you try and make something like that and

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960
you try and make something like that and
 

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.900
you try and make something like that and
I think that as long as you have other

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:54.910
I think that as long as you have other
 

00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.480
I think that as long as you have other
poets before you and that you can learn

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:57.490
poets before you and that you can learn
 

00:19:57.490 --> 00:20:00.390
poets before you and that you can learn
from them then it's always open-ended

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400
from them then it's always open-ended
 

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.160
from them then it's always open-ended
for you there's always someplace to go

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.170
for you there's always someplace to go
 

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:04.140
for you there's always someplace to go

00:20:04.150 --> 00:20:06.150
you don't need workshops you don't need
friends necessarily you can be

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:06.160
friends necessarily you can be
 

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.000
friends necessarily you can be

when I taught at the University of
 

00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.720

we required the poets to take workshops

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:33.950
we required the poets to take workshops
 

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:36.369
we required the poets to take workshops
in in fiction writing and we acquired

00:24:36.369 --> 00:24:36.379
in in fiction writing and we acquired
 

00:24:36.379 --> 00:24:38.200
in in fiction writing and we acquired
the fiction writers to take workshops in

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:38.210
the fiction writers to take workshops in
 

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.899
the fiction writers to take workshops in
poetry and the reason for that is

00:24:40.899 --> 00:24:40.909
poetry and the reason for that is
 

00:24:40.909 --> 00:24:44.110
poetry and the reason for that is
because the fiction writers seemed to

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:44.120
because the fiction writers seemed to
 

00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.239
because the fiction writers seemed to
need to learn how to pay greater

00:24:46.239 --> 00:24:46.249
need to learn how to pay greater
 

00:24:46.249 --> 00:24:48.730
need to learn how to pay greater
attention to language itself to the way

needed to learn to pay greater attention

00:24:53.289 --> 00:24:53.299
needed to learn to pay greater attention
 

00:24:53.299 --> 00:24:58.450
needed to learn to pay greater attention
to character and to narrative that as

many poets don't know how to tell a

00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720
many poets don't know how to tell a
 

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:02.289
many poets don't know how to tell a
story and they don't have a sense of how

00:25:02.289 --> 00:25:02.299
story and they don't have a sense of how
 

00:25:02.299 --> 00:25:03.940
story and they don't have a sense of how
to put things in order to tell a story

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:03.950
to put things in order to tell a story
 

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.769
to put things in order to tell a story
and we thought that poets could learn

00:25:05.769 --> 00:25:05.779
and we thought that poets could learn
 

00:25:05.779 --> 00:25:11.940
and we thought that poets could learn
from fiction writers something about

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:11.950
from fiction writers something about
 

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:15.129
from fiction writers something about
developing a character over time who

00:25:15.129 --> 00:25:15.139
developing a character over time who
 

00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:19.720
developing a character over time who
wasn't just you and also creating a

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:19.730
wasn't just you and also creating a
 

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:21.639
wasn't just you and also creating a
narrative structure so I think it's true

00:25:21.639 --> 00:25:21.649
narrative structure so I think it's true
 

00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:24.639
narrative structure so I think it's true
that that's something that poetry can go

00:25:24.639 --> 00:25:24.649
that that's something that poetry can go
 

00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:27.730
that that's something that poetry can go
to school on fiction poetry can go to

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:27.740
to school on fiction poetry can go to

fiction to learn think that the the the
 

00:25:32.059 --> 00:25:34.419
fiction to learn think that the the the
deepest thing is that many fiction

00:25:34.419 --> 00:25:34.429
deepest thing is that many fiction
 

00:25:34.429 --> 00:25:36.850
deepest thing is that many fiction
writers tell stories but are not elegant

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:36.860
writers tell stories but are not elegant
 

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.970

writers but we're not writing journalism
when we're making literature we are

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:42.080
when we're making literature we are
 

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.080
when we're making literature we are
trying to make something that lasts in

00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:44.090
trying to make something that lasts in
 

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:46.509
trying to make something that lasts in
language and there's no question that

00:25:46.509 --> 00:25:46.519
language and there's no question that
 

00:25:46.519 --> 00:25:49.690
language and there's no question that
many fiction writers began as poets and

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:49.700
many fiction writers began as poets and
 

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.820
many fiction writers began as poets and
it's hard for me to think of any good

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:51.830
it's hard for me to think of any good
 

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.710
it's hard for me to think of any good
fiction writers who don't also read

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:53.720
fiction writers who don't also read

fiction writers who don't also read
poetry that fiction writers learn about

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360
poetry that fiction writers learn about
 

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.070
poetry that fiction writers learn about
the development of metaphor the the use

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080
the development of metaphor the the use
 

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.879
the development of metaphor the the use
of rhythm the way that language is

00:26:02.879 --> 00:26:02.889
of rhythm the way that language is
 

00:26:02.889 --> 00:26:07.450
of rhythm the way that language is
compacted in order to express that the

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:07.460
compacted in order to express that the
 

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:09.669
compacted in order to express that the
feelings that express their own feelings

00:26:09.669 --> 00:26:09.679
feelings that express their own feelings
 

00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:11.230
feelings that express their own feelings
and the feelings of their characters so

00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240
and the feelings of their characters so
 

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.450
and the feelings of their characters so
I think fiction goes to poetry for the

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:13.460
I think fiction goes to poetry for the
 

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:19.080
I think fiction goes to poetry for the
intensity of its use of language

and I wrote an unpublished novel and I
 

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.610
and I wrote an unpublished novel and I
wrote a lot of short stories but what I

wrote a lot of short stories but what I
 

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:40.200
wrote a lot of short stories but what I
discovered about myself is that my

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:40.210
discovered about myself is that my
 

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:43.680
discovered about myself is that my
temperament is so fiery in terms of what
