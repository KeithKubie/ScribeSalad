00:00:00.725 --> 00:00:04.989
Voiceover: Most viral videos
involve like a baby panda sneezing,

00:00:05.035 --> 00:00:08.124
or a Korean pop star's
infectious silly dance,

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:12.241
but in 2004, hedge fund
analyst, Salman Khan -

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:16.278
this is not the Bollywood star, by the
way, Salman Khan, for you Bollywood fans;

00:00:16.278 --> 00:00:20.919
this is a different Salman
Khan - discovered that the
video tutorials he had made

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.427
to explain algebra to his
12-year-old niece became
unexpectedly popular on YouTube.

00:00:26.427 --> 00:00:31.264
A couple of years later, he left the world
of finance to found the Khan Academy,

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:34.099
an educational organization
that today provides

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:39.640
over 3,000 free video lectures
and companion exercises online.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.706
Six years and almost two
hundred million views later,

00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:45.637
Khan has a plan to reform the classroom,

00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:51.390
which he outlines in his new
book, "The One World School
House, Education Reimagined."

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.536
He joins us now.

00:00:52.536 --> 00:00:54.710
We'll play a couple of his
video excerpts in a minute.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.292
Salman Khan, welcome to WNYC.

00:00:57.292 --> 00:00:58.619
Voiceover: It's great to be here.

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:01.728
Voiceover: At what point did you
transition from running the Khan Academy,

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.459
creating and sharing these videos,

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:06.991
to advocating for a major reform
of the educational process?

00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:13.637
Voiceover: There was never
a hard line when it started,
through this whole adventure,

00:01:13.637 --> 00:01:16.990
first working with my cousins,
then the YouTube videos,

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.405
and then eventually getting
funding for this not-for-profit,

00:01:20.405 --> 00:01:21.982
and building up the interactive exercises,

00:01:21.982 --> 00:01:24.811
we've been interfacing a
lot with the school system,

00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:28.835
famously, the Los Altos school district
in northern California started using us.

00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:32.896
When they asked for ideas, I said it
seems like there's an opportunity here

00:01:32.896 --> 00:01:35.877
to not focus class time
on lecture anymore,

00:01:35.877 --> 00:01:37.625
and instead use it for interactivity.

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:40.094
The lecture can happen in the
student's own time and pace.

00:01:40.094 --> 00:01:42.763
We can go to the self-paced reality.

00:01:42.763 --> 00:01:45.122
It, frankly, worked out
well for all involved,

00:01:45.122 --> 00:01:47.984
and we started experimenting
with other schools.

00:01:47.984 --> 00:01:54.176
Then, researchers, education
historians started coming up
to me and the rest of our team.

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:56.429
Actually, there's a lot of
research that backs this up.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:57.926
It's called mastery-based learning.

00:01:57.926 --> 00:02:01.514
The way that we traditionally learn,
where these students are grouped

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:03.372
in these age-based cohorts,

00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:05.760
this is not how humans
have always learned.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.122
We've inherited this from Prussia, a
nation that does not exist anymore.

00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:11.622
I go into depth about that in the book.

00:02:11.622 --> 00:02:13.505
Voiceover: Good old Prussia.

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:18.510
Voiceover: It seemed like some
of these old but proven ideas

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.757
about mastery-based learning,
about self-paced learning,

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:24.777
could now be implemented in a
practical way, using the technology.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:27.423
Voiceover: Is this what you call
Swiss-cheese learning in the book?

00:02:27.423 --> 00:02:32.195
Voiceover: Yeah, once again, the
Prussia model had a positive motive.

00:02:32.195 --> 00:02:35.057
It was the first time that people
said, "How do we educate everyone?"

00:02:35.057 --> 00:02:37.472
If you go 300 years ago,
only the elite got educated.

00:02:37.472 --> 00:02:40.129
When they thought about
that problem, they said,

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:41.625
"Well, it's the Industrial Revolution.

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:43.482
"How do we make a lot of anything?

00:02:43.482 --> 00:02:44.877
"We put 'em on a line.

00:02:44.877 --> 00:02:46.345
"It moves at a pace.

00:02:46.345 --> 00:02:47.956
"At each station, something happens.

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:48.907
"Some of the product is good.

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:50.160
"Some of the product isn't so good."

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.981
So, they applied the same
principles to educating children -

00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:56.409
big batches of kids,
throw knowledge at them.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.653
Some of them will get it.

00:02:57.653 --> 00:02:58.754
Some of them won't.

00:02:58.754 --> 00:03:00.128
What's happening with the Swiss cheese is

00:03:00.128 --> 00:03:01.655
as they go at that set
pace, it just accumulates.

00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:05.745
That's why you see, I think,
otherwise very capable kids,

00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:07.259
they get to algebra, they get to calculus,

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:08.919
and they just hit a wall.

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.124
Instead, we say, "No,
work at your own pace.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:12.424
"Master concepts.

00:03:12.424 --> 00:03:15.755
"Once you master concepts, then the
next concept's going to seem intuitive."

00:03:15.755 --> 00:03:18.252
Voiceover: As we mis
European metaphors here -

00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:20.256
the Prussian model, the
Swiss-cheese learning -

00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:25.003
here's a small taste of
what Salman Khan does.

00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:28.367
This is a clip from a video
posted just last week,

00:03:28.367 --> 00:03:31.011
and I should mention it has
almost 10,000 views already,

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:35.377
and it explains probability
with a Monte Carlo simulation.

00:03:35.377 --> 00:03:41.096
This is about a minute long and
it begins with a special guest.

00:03:41.128 --> 00:03:43.002
Basketball fans, listen up.

00:03:43.002 --> 00:03:44.496
Voiceover: It's LeBron here.

00:03:44.496 --> 00:03:45.755
I've got a quick brain-teaser for you.

00:03:45.755 --> 00:03:48.250
If I'm down three, with 30 seconds left,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.123
is it better to take the three,

00:03:50.123 --> 00:03:52.252
or is it easier to take the two

00:03:52.252 --> 00:03:56.127
and attempt to foul a bad free-throw
shooter, and get another possession?

00:03:56.127 --> 00:03:59.910
"Here's my friend Sal with an answer."

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.966
Voiceover: That's a very, very
interesting question, LeBron.

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:05.713
Calculating the probabilities
of if you were to take a three,

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:08.930
what's your probability of tying the game
and then being able to win in overtime?

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.106
That can be done on paper, but
the scenario where you take a two,

00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:14.276
and you attempt to foul the opposing team,

00:04:14.276 --> 00:04:16.527
and they might make none,
or one or two free throws,

00:04:16.527 --> 00:04:18.986
and then you might get another
possession and you take another two,

00:04:18.986 --> 00:04:20.603
that's more complicated.

00:04:20.603 --> 00:04:21.779
You could attempt to do it on paper,

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.744
but instead I've written a
little computer simulation here.

00:04:24.744 --> 00:04:27.543
This type of a simulation is
called a Monte Carlo simulation.

00:04:27.543 --> 00:04:29.776
Literally, it'll run the scenarios.

00:04:29.776 --> 00:04:33.089
It'll do it as many times as we
put in this variable over here.

00:04:33.089 --> 00:04:35.194
We're gonna set it up so
we get an accurate number.

00:04:35.194 --> 00:04:37.780
We're going to do it a thousand
times for each of those scenarios,

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.273
and see what fraction in each scenario,
which fraction do we end up winning?

00:04:42.273 --> 00:04:45.380
Voiceover: So, a sample
of a Salman Khan video.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.027
If you can deconstruct yourself a little
bit, other than getting people's attention

00:04:50.027 --> 00:04:53.135
by using LeBron James,
what's the technique in there

00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:55.771
that makes it more
user-friendly than other things?

00:04:55.771 --> 00:05:00.130
Voiceover: When I started
these, it was for my cousins,

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.089
and I didn't really
think about it too much.

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:04.480
I just said, "Well, it's for my cousin.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.313
"I'll just do these somewhat
informally, very conversationally."

00:05:07.313 --> 00:05:11.011
I didn't show my face, because
I didn't feel like I needed to.

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:13.796
I was already tutoring my cousins,
and they just heard my voice

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:15.484
and we could see what we were writing.

00:05:15.484 --> 00:05:18.697
Later, we've gotten a lot
of feedback from people,

00:05:18.697 --> 00:05:21.195
and that's why we've tried not
to diverge too much from that,

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:23.286
that they really liked this form factor.

00:05:23.286 --> 00:05:27.535
They didn't feel like there was
someone distant at a chalkboard saying,

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:28.880
"Oh, the next step is XYZ"

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.945
It felt like we were at
the kitchen table together.

00:05:30.945 --> 00:05:33.232
They felt like I was an
older brother or a cousin,

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:35.198
explaining these types of ideas.

00:05:35.198 --> 00:05:38.379
We tried to retain that,
that conversationality,

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:42.900
the humanity in it, the
connection with the learner.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.497
Voiceover: Listeners,
if you want to call in,

00:05:44.497 --> 00:05:46.997
we can take a few phone
calls for Salman Khan.

00:05:46.997 --> 00:05:49.151
I see some people are already calling in,

00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:53.153
who want to do testimonials, that
they've been using the system.

00:05:53.153 --> 00:05:59.939
So, 212-433-WNYC, if you
want to talk to Salman Khan.

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:04.767
His new book is called, "The One World
School House, Education Reimagined."

00:06:04.767 --> 00:06:09.761
212-433-9692, and Miguel in
Queens, you're on the air.

00:06:09.761 --> 00:06:11.041
Hi, Miguel.

00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:14.015
Voiceover: Hi, how are you,
Ryan, and hello, Mr. Khan.

00:06:14.015 --> 00:06:17.122
I just want to let you
know that I understand

00:06:17.122 --> 00:06:19.511
why the video, the
first video, went viral.

00:06:19.511 --> 00:06:25.307
I'm going to college at night, and I feel

00:06:25.307 --> 00:06:30.306
that the professors just want
to go through the whole program,

00:06:30.306 --> 00:06:34.260
so they actually explained all.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.540
They just go through the class very fast.

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:42.638
If I don't understand something,
and I want them to explain it again,

00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:48.313
they will explain one time, but
then they just [unintelligible] -

00:06:48.313 --> 00:06:54.378
Voiceover: So you went to some Salman Khan
videos that dealt with the same material?

00:06:54.378 --> 00:06:59.040
Voiceover: Yes, I went on
Youtube and looked for videos

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.498
so I could understand my calculus
classes, Calculus I and 2.

00:07:02.498 --> 00:07:08.379
Because I was able to see it
once, and again and again,

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:12.517
I was able to understand and
actually pass the classes.

00:07:12.517 --> 00:07:16.766
Voiceover: That's great, Miguel,
and I'm sure that warms your heart.

00:07:16.766 --> 00:07:20.262
Voiceover: Stories like Miguel's,
for myself and the rest of our team,

00:07:20.262 --> 00:07:21.712
that's what keeps us going.

00:07:21.712 --> 00:07:27.265
Voiceover: Are you like the
SparkNotes of YouTube, in a way?

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:31.130
If people are not getting it on their
own, they can go get a quick tutorial?

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:34.182
Voiceover: Yeah, but there's
one thing about that comparison

00:07:34.182 --> 00:07:36.763
that I think isn't completely there,

00:07:36.763 --> 00:07:39.755
which would be whenever people
think about ten-minute videos,

00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:40.996
they think, "Oh, maybe
this is the SparkNotes

00:07:40.996 --> 00:07:42.472
"or the Cliff Notes of mathematics."

00:07:42.472 --> 00:07:44.634
What I always point out
is that we can do as many

00:07:44.634 --> 00:07:46.049
of these 10-minute videos as we want,

00:07:46.049 --> 00:07:50.354
so we're not limited by 50 minutes
or 90 minutes in a lecture hall.

00:07:50.354 --> 00:07:55.897
What we get a lot of feedback from
students on is that we go into depth.

00:07:55.897 --> 00:07:57.523
We have a lot of examples.

00:07:57.523 --> 00:08:00.371
We go into the proofs, the conceptual
"how does it apply to the real world?"

00:08:00.371 --> 00:08:04.270
Voiceover: When you try to use
this, not just in this way,

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:06.543
but as a model for reforming education,

00:08:06.543 --> 00:08:09.407
part of your concept is
called the flipped classroom.

00:08:09.407 --> 00:08:10.383
Explain.

00:08:10.383 --> 00:08:11.907
Voiceover: It's not my concept, actually.

00:08:11.907 --> 00:08:14.152
Very few of the concepts in
the book are new concepts.

00:08:14.152 --> 00:08:15.282
They're re-invigorated concepts.

00:08:15.282 --> 00:08:18.004
This is in the early days when
it's mainly the videos out there.

00:08:18.004 --> 00:08:20.943
I had teachers coming to me, emailing me,

00:08:20.943 --> 00:08:22.138
Saying, "Hey, look.

00:08:22.138 --> 00:08:25.864
"You've already given an
interesting lecture about
probability or about calculus.

00:08:25.864 --> 00:08:30.645
"Why should I use my scarce class time
to do this one-pace kind of lecture,

00:08:30.645 --> 00:08:32.319
"and the students are
sitting there passively?

00:08:32.319 --> 00:08:35.985
"Instead, they can watch your stuff
at their own time and their own pace,

00:08:35.985 --> 00:08:38.725
and then we can use class time
for something more interactive."

00:08:38.725 --> 00:08:41.811
Once again, the flip idea existed
before us, but what I did is,

00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:45.529
what used to be homework is now
class work, problem solving,

00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:47.141
and now you have your peers
and the teacher to help you.

00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:50.334
What used to be class time, which
is lectures, you get on demand.

00:08:50.334 --> 00:08:51.505
You can remediate.

00:08:51.505 --> 00:08:52.884
We think you can go even further.

00:08:52.884 --> 00:08:54.379
In the book, I go into a lot of depth,

00:08:54.379 --> 00:08:55.797
how you can go much beyond,
even doing the flip.

00:08:55.797 --> 00:08:56.755
Voiceover: Such as?

00:08:56.755 --> 00:08:59.047
Voiceover: Even the flip assumes
kind of a Prussian model,

00:08:59.047 --> 00:09:00.543
that we're all going to be learning

00:09:00.543 --> 00:09:02.388
at the same pace, the same
thing, at the same time.

00:09:02.388 --> 00:09:05.389
As soon as you remove
the one-pace-fits-all
lecture from the classroom,

00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:10.269
you say, "Well, maybe we could
have two teachers in the classroom
teaching twice as many students.

00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:14.230
"Maybe we could have every student
learning at their own pace,

00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:16.487
"breaking away from this
assembly-line model.

00:09:16.487 --> 00:09:19.014
"Maybe we could have students
start to tutor each other.

00:09:19.014 --> 00:09:21.123
"Maybe this opens up time for creativity,

00:09:21.123 --> 00:09:22.747
so they can do more open-ended projects."

00:09:22.747 --> 00:09:25.693
Voiceover: Keith in
Washington Heights calling

00:09:25.693 --> 00:09:28.866
with, I think, a little bit of
skepticism about the flip classroom.

00:09:28.866 --> 00:09:30.380
Yes, Keith?

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.861
Voiceover: Good morning, gentlemen.

00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:34.456
I first heard about this
Khan Academy on "60 Minutes,"

00:09:34.456 --> 00:09:39.832
and they showed it in a classroom, where
the kids were learning from Khan Academy,

00:09:39.832 --> 00:09:41.991
and then the teacher would
circulate around the room

00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:43.572
for anybody that needed additional help.

00:09:43.572 --> 00:09:45.570
Don't get me wrong.

00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:48.116
I think the idea is great, and I've
watched a number of your videos there.

00:09:48.116 --> 00:09:51.355
I don't think you can
replace the teacher because,

00:09:51.355 --> 00:09:55.880
even when you're teaching your cousin,

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.274
if you're on the phone with her
and talking to her directly,

00:09:58.274 --> 00:09:59.875
and having interaction back and forth,

00:09:59.875 --> 00:10:01.639
when she says, "I got that point.

00:10:01.639 --> 00:10:03.261
"Move on," or, "I don't have this point.

00:10:03.261 --> 00:10:05.764
"Repeat it," somehow it's different.

00:10:05.764 --> 00:10:07.623
Let me explain it better.

00:10:07.623 --> 00:10:08.849
Let me explain it differently.

00:10:08.849 --> 00:10:11.178
When I'm teaching my
students, I have interaction.

00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:13.210
I stop at each point.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.030
"Do we get it?

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.916
"Do we not get it?

00:10:14.916 --> 00:10:15.910
"Who doesn't get it?

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.783
"What needs to be further explained?"

00:10:16.783 --> 00:10:19.649
There's something lost when
you're just doing it on a video.

00:10:19.649 --> 00:10:21.489
It's great stuff, but
it's not the same thing

00:10:21.489 --> 00:10:25.949
as having a teacher explaining
it directly, and having an
interaction with the kids.

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:27.281
Voiceover: Keith, thank you.

00:10:27.281 --> 00:10:27.635
Salman.

00:10:27.635 --> 00:10:29.509
Voiceover: I a hundred
percent agree with Keith.

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:32.101
Actually, that was a
big point of this book,

00:10:32.101 --> 00:10:36.080
is whenever people come up with
something virtual, the assumption is,

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.760
"Oh, this is going to compete
with the physical" - Amazon.com
versus Barnes and Noble's.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.415
Everything that we emphasize
is, what we are doing is a tool

00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:46.246
for students and for teachers.

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:50.408
What it is, it allows class time to
be less based on a passive lecture,

00:10:50.408 --> 00:10:55.523
and more of the things that Keith just
talked about, more of the interaction.

00:10:55.523 --> 00:10:59.365
When my cousins were able to
do the exercises on their own
and the videos on their own,

00:10:59.365 --> 00:11:02.970
when they had time with me, I didn't
have to do any explaining to them,

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.870
or I had to just fill in the gaps
that the videos didn't cover.

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:07.269
So, I a hundred percent agree.

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:08.280
I have young children.

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.019
I do not want them to
learn only from a computer.

00:11:10.019 --> 00:11:12.471
I want that to actually be a very
small fraction of their learning.

00:11:12.471 --> 00:11:16.129
Voiceover: You were talking before
about a possible multi-teacher model

00:11:16.129 --> 00:11:18.044
in the classroom while
they're using the visuals.

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:22.247
Have you costed out what
it would take financially

00:11:22.247 --> 00:11:26.179
to use this as a
nationally-scaleable model?

00:11:26.179 --> 00:11:28.426
Maybe you saw President Obama
in the debate last night,

00:11:28.426 --> 00:11:31.384
talking about that teacher
with the 42-student classroom.

00:11:31.384 --> 00:11:34.024
We're already strapped, in other words.

00:11:34.024 --> 00:11:36.374
Voiceover: Yeah, we're already
strapped and, obviously,

00:11:36.374 --> 00:11:38.510
even an extra penny is
going to cost something.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.066
Technology is getting cheaper every year.

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:43.681
I don't think you even need
one computer per child.

00:11:43.681 --> 00:11:45.510
You could have one computer,
because they're not going

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:46.983
to be spending all day on the computer.

00:11:46.983 --> 00:11:49.363
A computer's now two or
three hundred dollars.

00:11:49.363 --> 00:11:54.215
A new laptop or tablet device
can last four or five years,

00:11:54.215 --> 00:11:55.702
and be shared by four or five students.

00:11:55.702 --> 00:11:59.637
Really, it starts becoming on the order
of ten, twenty dollars a student a year.

00:11:59.637 --> 00:12:03.498
I think it becomes
cost-competitive with textbooks,

00:12:03.498 --> 00:12:07.918
which I really think is where this
could be more of a substitute,

00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:10.138
not for the teacher, but for the textbook.

00:12:10.138 --> 00:12:11.637
Voiceover: Now, you've
got people's attention,

00:12:11.637 --> 00:12:14.138
because everybody wants to
replace those expensive textbooks,

00:12:14.138 --> 00:12:17.359
that also get updated every few years
and you have to keep buying them.

00:12:17.359 --> 00:12:21.365
Dan in Brooklyn, we have time
for one more testimonial,

00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:22.996
and it'll come from Dan.

00:12:22.996 --> 00:12:24.250
Hi, Dan.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.387
Voiceover: Hi, I just want
to say as a neurobiologist

00:12:27.387 --> 00:12:31.639
that I really want to thank you for
saving the brains of so many children.

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:33.827
Really, what people don't realize is

00:12:33.827 --> 00:12:37.305
that the brain proliferates
with connections and songs

00:12:37.305 --> 00:12:42.993
from the age one onward
to about 12, 13 years old.

00:12:42.993 --> 00:12:47.143
Then, it crashes and a lot of brain
cells and brain connections are lost -

00:12:47.143 --> 00:12:48.639
about 30% of them.

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:54.637
What you're doing is making available
to children conceptual operations

00:12:54.637 --> 00:12:58.462
that will keep those
connections vibrant and alive.

00:12:58.462 --> 00:13:01.711
That's the European way of teaching
so that, right after high school,

00:13:01.711 --> 00:13:03.389
they go right to professional school -

00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:07.052
no wasting four years of college that make
up for 12 lost years of public education.

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:09.389
Voiceover: Is that part of your goal,

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:11.636
right on to professional
school from high school?

00:13:11.636 --> 00:13:13.197
Voiceover: That's not the goal.

00:13:13.197 --> 00:13:16.517
It's not NOT the goal either.

00:13:16.517 --> 00:13:20.064
The goal is actually to introduce
more variety into the system.

00:13:20.064 --> 00:13:21.536
In the book, I go into some detail -

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:27.340
this 12 years of primary and secondary,
and you learn physics your senior year.

00:13:27.384 --> 00:13:30.811
This was determined in 1892 by ten men,

00:13:30.811 --> 00:13:33.570
mainly university presidents,
the Committee of Ten.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.374
I think it's time that we re-think
this 200-year-old Prussian model.

00:13:37.374 --> 00:13:40.755
It's time we re-think this 120-year-old
Committee of Ten proposition.

00:13:40.755 --> 00:13:43.636
It doesn't have to be exactly
what the caller is saying,

00:13:43.636 --> 00:13:45.866
but it doesn't have to be
exactly what we're saying now.

00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:47.120
It can be more flexible.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.465
Voiceover: Salman Khan -
he's an inspiration to many.

00:13:49.465 --> 00:13:54.499
His new book is called, "The One World
School House, Education Reimagined."

00:13:54.499 --> 00:13:57.639
By the way, you can access
all the Khan Academy materials

00:13:57.639 --> 00:14:01.037
online at Khan Academy dot org.

00:14:01.037 --> 00:14:02.385
Great to speak with you.

00:14:02.385 --> 00:14:03.047
Thank you for coming in.

00:14:03.047 --> 00:14:04.292
Voiceover: Thanks for having me.

00:14:04.292 --> 00:14:07.000
Voiceover: Right, we're at WNYC.
