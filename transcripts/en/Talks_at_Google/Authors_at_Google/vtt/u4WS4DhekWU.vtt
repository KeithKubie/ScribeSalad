MARY GROVE: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.245
How are you?

00:00:06.245 --> 00:00:06.870
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.578
MARY GROVE: Good.

00:00:07.578 --> 00:00:08.330
Great.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.950
Well, welcome to
today's book talk.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.980
My name is Mary Grove,
and I'm the director

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.530
of Google for Entrepreneurs,
and it is my privilege

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.555
to introduce a phenomenal
entrepreneur and leader, Steve

00:00:17.555 --> 00:00:18.055
Case.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.000
Steve is the co-founder
of America Online,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.450
which handled nearly 50% of US
internet traffic at its peak.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.272
It was also the first
ever internet IPO

00:00:33.272 --> 00:00:36.390
and the top performing
stock of the 1990s.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.830
Steve is now CEO of the venture
capital firm Revolution, which

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.620
he founded in 2005 to invest
in people and ideas that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.260
can change the world.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.290
Steve also champions
this notion of rise

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.900
of the rest, the concept that
innovation is thriving not just

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.940
here in Silicon Valley,
but all over the country

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.860
and really all over the world.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.180
Steve is a member of the
presidential ambassadors

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.990
for global
entrepreneurship, and he

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.310
is the chairman of the
Case Foundation, which

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.040
he and his wife,
Jean, started together

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.870
in 1997 to focus on innovation
and inclusive entrepreneurship.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.330
So, Steve, welcome
back to Google.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.746
STEVE CASE: Good to be back.

00:01:10.746 --> 00:01:14.426
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:16.550
MARY GROVE: It's great to
have you back here again,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.960
and you have been a longtime
partner and friend of Google

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.750
back from the early days of
our first search partnership.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.410
I was telling Steve over
lunch that back in 2004

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.980
when I started at Google we
used AIM as our internal chat.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.910
Now, to Google for
Entrepreneurs we

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.970
work very closely
together with your support

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.887
for entrepreneurship.

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.220
STEVE CASE: I had a great
session this morning at Google

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.636
for Entrepreneurs
for those of you

00:01:39.636 --> 00:01:42.380
who weren't there whether
11 companies from 11

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.920
different cities all
participating in a demo day.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.390
It was great to show the
diversity of talent and ideas

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.989
all across the country.

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:52.030
Thank you for doing that.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.640
MARY GROVE: Why don't you tell
everyone about your commitment

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.630
that you made?

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.980
STEVE CASE: So the idea of these
Google demo days-- and this

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.460
is the third one, right?

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.876
MARY GROVE: This
is the third one.

00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:04.120
STEVE CASE: Is to bring
the different entrepreneurs

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.300
from different cities and
match them up with investors.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.800
And so there are
about 100 investors

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.480
in the room from
obviously this area,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.260
and hopefully all 11
companies will get investment,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.910
but at the end of it, I
challenge the investors

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.840
in the room and said
for any company that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.600
can raise $1 million
in the next 100 days,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.240
I'll personally invest
$100,000 as part of that.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.680
So hopefully all 11 will be
able to use that as a way

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.310
both within their communities
to rally support and also get

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.990
some support from some of the
investors here in California.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.670
MARY GROVE: Thank
you for doing that.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.770
So you wrote a new
book, "The Third Wave,"

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.210
and I want to dig into the
three waves in a moment,

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.020
but before I do so,
I want to rewind

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.310
a bit to your early days.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.610
So you have always been
incredibly entrepreneurial.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.080
As you said in the book, you
started your first business

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.538
with your brother
when you were 10.

00:02:55.538 --> 00:02:58.130
I think it was Case Enterprises
going door to door selling--

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.942
STEVE CASE: Sounds bigger
than it really was.

00:03:00.942 --> 00:03:02.900
MARY GROVE: Selling
greeting cards door to door

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.440
in your native Hawaii,
and in college,

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.850
you started six side businesses.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.940
So tell me about what you
learned from those experiences.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.827
Maybe if there was a favorite.

00:03:12.827 --> 00:03:14.410
STEVE CASE: Well, I
think none of them

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.451
were particularly successful,
but I learned a lot

00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.520
about starting things
and just the curiosity

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.040
that I think entrepreneurs
bring to bear

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.840
and just trying to see new
possibilities, new angles.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.880
And so I learned,
and a lot of it

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.720
was just the
importance of selling

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.940
in terms of at least businesses
that don't work automatically.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.860
You have to get guy
somebody to buy something,

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.900
and so there were a
lot of times where

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.000
I'd be going door to
door selling stuff

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.500
and get the door
slammed in my face.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.062
And that's always instructive,
particularly when you're young.

00:03:45.062 --> 00:03:47.020
Actually it was easier
when I was really young.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.103
I think when I was 10 or
11 and knocking on doors,

00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:51.940
people kind of took
a little pity on me

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.750
or just wanted to be supportive.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.399
So I think my sales
track record was

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:57.690
better when I was really young.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.856
Then I moved into my late
teen years, and they said,

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:01.400
who needs to support this guy?

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.970
But the sales aspect was always
important, but I got lucky.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.480
When I was in college
in 1980, I read a book

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.160
by Alvin Toffler called "The
Third Wave" that some of you

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.399
may remember, but
he was a futurist--

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:16.440
still is, still alive, so
he still is a futurist.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.209
Wrote "Future Shock," as well.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.260
And "The Third Wave" really
outlined his framework

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.830
to think about what we now
think of as the internet,

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.250
but in 1980 it was viewed
as sort of futuristic.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.570
But I was completely
mesmerized by that,

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.382
and that led me on the
path to eventually move

00:04:33.382 --> 00:04:34.340
into the digital world.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.470
MARY GROVE: Helping create
the first wave, really.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.970
STEVE CASE: But
that's why I decided

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:38.970
to finally write a book.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.370
I deliberately called
it "The Third Wave"

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.090
because I wanted to pay
respect for the role he played

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.709
in setting me on my path.

00:04:47.709 --> 00:04:49.250
MARY GROVE: So the
first wave-- and I

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.610
think it's so interesting
for many of us who

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.640
work at Google-- the
internet or being

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.760
connected all the time
everywhere is almost

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.740
an assumption.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.490
And of course, that
wasn't always the case

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.590
just a brief while ago.

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.130
So tell us about
the first wave era

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.670
was about building the internet,
bringing people online.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.630
You say that's roughly from
the mid 80s to the year 2000.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:13.110
So what was the key insight
that led you to start AOL?

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.862
STEVE CASE: Well, some of
it was the Toffler vision,

00:05:16.862 --> 00:05:18.320
but when I graduated
in 1980, there

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.307
were no internet
companies to go to

00:05:21.307 --> 00:05:23.390
and frankly there wasn't
much of a startup culture

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.220
back then, as well.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.886
So I worked for a
couple big companies--

00:05:25.886 --> 00:05:27.450
Procter Gamble and PepsiCo.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.950
One for two years,
one for one year,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.420
but just trying to figure
out how to get into this.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.320
Moved to the DC area in 1983 to
join a company that I thought

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.510
was going to be
the next big thing.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.760
Back then most of you were not
old enough, but a few of you

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.394
will remember that in
1983 very few people had

00:05:44.394 --> 00:05:47.060
personal computers, but a lot of
people had Atari game machines,

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.870
and this was basically a
modem that turned their game

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.577
machine into a two way device.

00:05:52.577 --> 00:05:53.660
Thought it would be great.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.324
Turned out it was a
disaster, and so immediately

00:05:57.324 --> 00:05:58.990
within a month after
joining the company

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.880
they laid off 80% of people.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.460
So I was like, ooh,
welcome to the NFL.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.884
This start up stuff is going
to be a little bit risky,

00:06:05.884 --> 00:06:07.300
but two of the
people I met there,

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.480
and I went off and
started AOL in 1985,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.150
but the insight was we
wanted to get America online.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.510
And at the time we started,
which I know seems crazy,

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:21.640
only 3% of people were online.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.720
And those 3% were
online one hour

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.870
a week through mostly
300 baud modems.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.670
And when they connected, on
average they spent about $10

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.060
per hour to be connected.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.430
So it was the early
days, and it was

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.580
how do we figure out ways to
get more people to buy PCs

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.340
and how do we convince the
PC manufacturers to actually

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.030
build modems into PCs so it
wasn't a peripheral device.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.330
It was a central device.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.550
How do we reengineer a network
so instead of $10 an hour

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:53.260
it was pennies an hour,
and how do we actually

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:55.420
figure out ways to
get more people online

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.630
so if you actually did get
online there were stuff to do

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.350
and people to talk to,
because in the early days

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.490
it was kind of lonely out there.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.460
And so it went from
at the beginning

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.060
of that kind of
consumer internet

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:14.170
era in the mid 80s to 2000ish it
went from essentially a concept

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.420
that nobody knew about
or frankly cared about

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.260
to something that everybody
saw the value in and went

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.940
from nobody connected
to essentially

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.470
everybody connected.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.097
So that really was that
first 15 years or so.

00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:28.180
MARY GROVE: So you became
CEO at a very young age.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.002
I believe it was 32 or so.

00:07:30.002 --> 00:07:32.460
STEVE CASE: Well, it's a little
more complicated than that.

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:36.930
I actually became-- I was
co-founder when I was 26 or 27,

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.470
something like that.

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:44.020
And I became CEO when
I was 30, or 30, or 31,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:46.140
but then we decided
to go public.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.760
And this was 1992--
as I you already

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.100
said, the first internet
company to go public--

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.780
and there was considerable
concern among our board

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.440
and our venture investors
that the public market,

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.840
institutional investors probably
would be pretty skeptical

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.040
about the idea of the
internet, and so it would be

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.901
hard to have a successful IPO.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.150
MARY GROVE: A little age bias.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:08.340
STEVE CASE: I know
that seems crazy,

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:11.480
and also that it
would be harder still

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:15.870
if there was this 30
year old kid as the CEO.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.540
So actually a few
months before we

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.030
went public I was demoted
from CEO to executive vice

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:22.230
president.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:25.270
Kind of ticked me off,
but I sucked it up,

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.500
and then we went public,
and a few months later I

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.070
became CEO again,
which others have not

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.210
had that-- Larry and Sergey
and Mark Zuckerberg, others

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:33.919
recently.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.460
The 20 something CEO is
not such a big concern now,

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:41.049
but in the 90s, a
30 something CEO

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:43.520
was, but in fairness
when we went

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.550
public we had been at it for
seven years-- 1985 to 1992--

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:54.500
and after seven years, we
had 184,000 subscribers.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:58.340
And we were generating
$30 million of revenue.

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.830
So in our IPO we
raised $10 million,

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.290
and the market value
was $70 million.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:07.140
And that was more
common IPOs of the day.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.725
Microsoft, and Apple,
and others basically

00:09:09.725 --> 00:09:12.350
went public when they were worth
a few hundred million dollars.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.410
We were a little
on the light side,

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:16.674
and we'd been at
it for seven years.

00:09:16.674 --> 00:09:18.590
So the institutional
investor is saying, well,

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.410
I get your pitch about
this online thing

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.050
and why people
might be interested,

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.210
but after seven years only
184,000 people have said yes.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.330
So maybe it's just
a niche market.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.600
The good news obviously
is seven years later

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.970
it had gone from 184,000
to like 25 million,

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:38.670
and the market value went
from $70 million to $160

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.780
billion dollars.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.080
So the second seven
years was a little easier

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.782
than the first seven years.

00:09:45.782 --> 00:09:48.240
MARY GROVE: You paved the way
for a lot of those young CEOs

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.320
now, and I'm always interested
in people's track record

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.020
and what do they
do to get there.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.857
So your second job out of
college was at Pizza Hut.

00:09:55.857 --> 00:09:57.190
STEVE CASE: That was a good job.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.550
MARY GROVE: And you had
probably the best title ever.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:59.420
What was your title?

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.330
STEVE CASE: I was director
of new pizza development.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:02.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:03.841
MARY GROVE: Seriously.

00:10:03.841 --> 00:10:05.840
STEVE CASE: You are meeting
the former director,

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:09.460
and what they did was
they paid me money

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.607
to travel around the
country and eat pizza.

00:10:11.607 --> 00:10:12.440
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.920
STEVE CASE: This
was actually my job.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.378
MARY GROVE: No, but you wrote
in the book that-- best title

00:10:16.378 --> 00:10:17.825
ever, first of
all-- but you wrote

00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:20.200
that you learned a lot about
portability and convenience,

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.270
and at the time pizza
delivery, home delivery,

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:25.980
the notion of calzones,
these things were not given.

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:26.730
STEVE CASE: Right.

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:28.390
MARY GROVE: And you've said that
those are two of the attributes

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:30.223
that you later really
took into account when

00:10:30.223 --> 00:10:31.550
you were building AOL.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.996
STEVE CASE: Yeah, my first
job at P&amp;G I learned a bunch.

00:10:33.996 --> 00:10:35.620
Again, I was only
there a couple years,

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.550
but one of the things they did
really quite successfully--

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:39.675
they came up with a new
product, like a new shampoo

00:10:39.675 --> 00:10:40.480
or something.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.070
They'd put all
these free samples

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:44.770
and bundle it with
newspapers or other products

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:48.310
to get people to try it
so that-- as some of you

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.720
might have received a free AOL
disk at some point in time.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.930
That was inspired in part
by that P&amp;G experience.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.280
And some of the Pizza Hut
experience-- the insight there,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.720
which ties in with some of
the work we're doing together

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.150
on the rise of the rest is
that, while innovation obviously

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:07.800
happens within companies,
a lot of innovation

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.730
happens on the periphery.

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:12.110
And P&amp;G was much more
of a centralized kind

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:14.180
of top down kind of
organization at the time.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:15.638
It's shifted since,
but at the time

00:11:15.638 --> 00:11:18.340
a very kind of-- focusing
on inventing stuff

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.090
within the company, and Pizza
Hut was sort of the opposite,

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.454
because it was really
run by the franchisees,

00:11:24.454 --> 00:11:26.120
and the innovation
actually happened out

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.640
on the field in the periphery.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.820
So rather than stay
in the headquarters

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.430
and just try to figure out
in our Pizza Hut tests labs

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.896
what the next big thing was that
was the reason to hit the road

00:11:35.896 --> 00:11:37.520
and find out what's
happening and which

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.990
of those might make sense
for the Pizza Hut system.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.400
MARY GROVE: So fast forward.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.270
AOL had a meteoric rise from, as
you said, valued at $70 million

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:53.190
to then valued at $163
billion in January of 2000.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.180
So let's talk about the
merger with Time Warner,

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:57.990
and you've said that
at the time it really

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:01.080
made sense for both strategic
reasons and financial reasons.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.651
As a CEO, what really pushed
it over the edge for you?

00:12:03.651 --> 00:12:05.150
Because you're doing
extremely well.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:06.500
STEVE CASE: No, it was--
obviously it didn't work,

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:08.124
and I'll talk about
why it didn't work,

00:12:08.124 --> 00:12:11.380
but the logic for it,
the strategic logic

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.830
was pretty sound.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.990
And in part, it was,
as you might imagine,

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.430
the fact that we'd gone from
$70 million to $160 billion

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:20.840
and actually had gone from
I think it was $20 billion

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.960
in two years before the
merger to $160 billion

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.930
two years later, so it
really was pretty rapid.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.090
And we were a
little worried about

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:31.870
whether that was
sustainable, and so merging

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.440
with a company that had
a lot of their businesses

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.570
and their combined company
you get $40 billion of revenue

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.310
and $10 billion of profit.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.610
Our company alone at the time
was about $5 billion of revenue

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:44.310
and $1 billion of profit.

00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:46.694
Because of the
relative valuations,

00:12:46.694 --> 00:12:48.610
our shareholders got a
majority of the company

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.120
even though we were contributing
a minority of the revenue

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.970
and a really small
minority of the profit.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:56.390
So there was that
diversification kind of play,

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.480
but also strategically we knew
we needed a path the broadband.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.986
We were pretty dominant
in narrow band,

00:13:01.986 --> 00:13:03.860
but needed that path of
broadband and merging

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.720
with the company with
the largest cable systems

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.428
would be helpful.

00:13:06.428 --> 00:13:09.260
Merging with a company with
significant media assets

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:13.260
on Warner Music, and
Warner studios, and Turner

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:18.190
Broadcasting, and Time Inc,
and HBO, and go down the list,

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:19.760
we thought would
also be valuable.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.720
And Time Warner needed that
path into the digital future,

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.790
so the idea of it made sense,
but the real lesson there

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.750
was-- I quote in the
book Thomas Edison,

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:32.181
who said over 100 years age,
"vision without execution

00:13:32.181 --> 00:13:32.930
is hallucination."

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:34.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.289
Having a an idea, having
a vision, if you will,

00:13:37.289 --> 00:13:39.580
is important but ultimately
it's about execution, which

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.740
ultimately is about people.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.810
And unfortunately the company
was run as different fiefdoms

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.080
and silos and never
really came together,

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:51.440
so something like digital
music-- the merger

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:54.840
was 16 years ago--
15 or 16 years ago,

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:57.090
and because we had AOL, which
was the leading internet

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:00.152
distribution, Time Warner Cable,
leading cable distribution,

00:14:00.152 --> 00:14:02.610
broadband distribution, and
Warner Music, the leading music

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:06.000
company, how could we not
lead the way in digital music?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.700
Well, we didn't.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.420
Apple did, and then
the reason Apple did

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:11.950
was because they had a
real sharp focus on it,

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:14.240
and the reason AOL
and Time Warner

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:16.920
couldn't was because Warner
Music, and Time Warner Cable,

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.922
and AOL not only weren't
working together,

00:14:18.922 --> 00:14:20.880
they really weren't even
talking to each other.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.570
They really were running
as independent businesses,

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:24.862
so it was a missed opportunity.

00:14:24.862 --> 00:14:26.570
MARY GROVE: I was very
struck in the book

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.010
when you talked
about the merger.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:30.530
It clearly was a marriage of
two very successful, but very

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:35.090
different organizations both in
terms of culture, leadership.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:40.729
What was behind your decision
not to continue as CEO?

00:14:40.729 --> 00:14:43.020
STEVE CASE: Well, that was
sort of pragmatic, because I

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:49.480
actually knew that getting this
merger done would be difficult.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.270
Getting Time Warner
to agree would

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.870
be difficult for a
whole host of reasons,

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:56.690
and it would be
impossible if I had not

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.690
offered in the first call I
made to the CEO of Time Warner

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:00.910
to step aside as CEO.

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:05.750
So I knew that for
all kinds of reasons

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:10.540
that the likelihood of them
deciding to do it was low,

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.310
but the only path would be
to say I'll step aside as CEO

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:17.220
and let you take the lead in
running the combined company.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.554
So it was a very pragmatic
deal related point.

00:15:20.554 --> 00:15:21.970
MARY GROVE: So
hindsight is 20/20,

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:26.860
but back now, if you could do it
all over again, would you still

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.750
do the merger?

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:28.710
STEVE CASE: I'd
still do the merger,

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.085
because I think strategically
there still was that logic.

00:15:31.085 --> 00:15:33.694
I would have been smarter
about some of the execution

00:15:33.694 --> 00:15:35.110
side of things,
smarter about some

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.699
of the people side of things.

00:15:36.699 --> 00:15:38.240
I mentioned in the
book, for example,

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.744
that not long after the
merger I had proposed,

00:15:40.744 --> 00:15:42.160
but didn't really
have the ability

00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.100
to do it because at that point
I wasn't the CEO anymore,

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:46.420
acquiring Google.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.500
At the time, we
owned 5% of Google

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:49.992
because we did the search deal.

00:15:49.992 --> 00:15:51.200
Talked about acquiring Apple.

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:51.820
MARY GROVE: That was a
hugely important deal

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:52.330
in Google's history.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.955
STEVE CASE: And Steve
Jobs went back in

00:15:53.955 --> 00:15:56.780
and they were still struggling.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.640
I think the market value of both
Apple and Google at the time

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:03.010
was probably $1 billion, $2
billion, something like that.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:07.130
And those were things that
probably would have made sense,

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:09.710
and so there are some of those
kind of missed opportunities,

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:14.610
but to me it was more
strategically it made sense.

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.300
I'm disappointed it
didn't work better.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.758
I learned a lot of
lessons from it,

00:16:17.758 --> 00:16:20.414
but I've tried to
reflect in the book,

00:16:20.414 --> 00:16:22.330
but I don't really
question the core decision,

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.280
because the strategic
decision was right.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.230
It was the execution
that was wrong.

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:27.420
MARY GROVE: But I love
the thoughtfulness

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.086
throughout the book
of really opening up

00:16:29.086 --> 00:16:31.760
about these experiences,
and for entrepreneurs,

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.990
what they can learn from
your path that you've paved.

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.430
So this first era was about
first wave-- getting everyone

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:38.680
online, building the internet.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.310
Now we're at the year 2000.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.810
So the second wave
you talk about

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:46.340
is roughly the next 15 years,
so 2000 through to about 2015,

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:49.570
and you call that the era of
apps and this concept of dorm

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:52.190
room entrepreneurship,
so Facebook

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.876
becoming a global platform.

00:16:53.876 --> 00:16:55.750
What's been the highlight
of the second wave,

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.330
or walk us through
how that unfolded?

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:59.330
STEVE CASE: Well, you
guys have been part of it.

00:16:59.330 --> 00:17:00.620
Obviously Google
where they started,

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.100
the very end of
the first wave, has

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.300
been one of the dominant iconic
companies of the second wave.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.030
So it really is the first wave
if you think about it just

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.700
building the internet, building
the core foundation technology,

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:14.160
building the on ramps,
educating people why

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.609
they wanted to get connected.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:17.260
That was really just
that first wave.

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:19.593
The second wave has just been
building apps and services

00:17:19.593 --> 00:17:23.477
on top of there, and that has
dominated the last 15 years.

00:17:23.477 --> 00:17:25.560
Obviously there are all
kinds of different things,

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:28.270
but at center of
gravity was apps.

00:17:28.270 --> 00:17:30.330
The center of gravity in
the first way was PCs.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.229
Center gravity obviously shifted
in the second wave to phones,

00:17:33.229 --> 00:17:35.270
and the first wave was
more about infrastructure.

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:37.620
Second wave was more
about apps and services.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.990
So Google obviously is
an incredible example

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:44.590
of that, and Facebook, and
many other examples, as well.

00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:46.780
And they've had obviously
a profound impact

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.400
on people's lives, global reach.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.192
So it's quite extraordinary
what's happened there.

00:17:52.192 --> 00:17:54.150
MARY GROVE: What types
of second wave companies

00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.025
have you invested in?

00:17:55.025 --> 00:17:57.689
What's one or two that
you're most excited about?

00:17:57.689 --> 00:17:59.230
STEVE CASE: Well,
we've been focusing

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.920
most of our investments on what
we think of as this third wave,

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.060
but over the last decade we've
invested a bunch of companies

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.132
what, in retrospect, were
pioneers in things that

00:18:10.132 --> 00:18:11.590
did pretty well in
the second wave,

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:13.570
but are going to be even more
significant in the third wave.

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:14.880
I'm thinking Apple
10 or 11 years ago,

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:16.130
maybe even 12 years ago.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.000
We invested in
Zipcar, the first kind

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.170
of sharing economy company,
and that was later acquired.

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.600
So that was an example of
something that early on-- we

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:29.740
made some investments in health
care, several companies there.

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:31.900
That scenario I think is
going to really accelerate

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.575
in the third wave.

00:18:33.575 --> 00:18:35.700
MARY GROVE: So let's fast
forward to the third wave

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.350
then, which you've talked about
as the internet of everything.

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:40.875
Describe to us your vision
for what we should expect.

00:18:40.875 --> 00:18:42.500
STEVE CASE: Well,
actually in some ways

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:47.150
Google, or more broadly Alphabet
is a great example of this.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.680
A lot of the businesses that
Alphabet is now focused on

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.920
are things that
really are perceived

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.230
to be-- I think correctly--
the next big opportunities

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.330
in this next wave, whether
it really be about health,

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:02.740
or be about cars, or what
other kinds of things,

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:05.650
but the way I think of
it at a simplistic level

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.070
is the third wave is
really integrating

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:10.360
the internet in more
seamless, and pervasive,

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.730
and sometimes even invisible
ways throughout our lives.

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:16.540
And some of the initiatives
that maybe some of you

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.370
are working on, such
as smart cities,

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:22.440
or how do you re-imagine
education so it is more

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.960
personalized and
adaptive, or how

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.810
do you rethink and
revolutionize health care so you

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.480
can do a better job
of understanding how

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.730
to keep people healthy, how
to manage chronic disease,

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:34.720
how to manage more life
threatening diseases

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.490
that-- as you probably know
that because of a data problem,

00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:43.380
cancer diagnosis is
wrong quite frequently.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.780
MD Anderson says that 25%
of the time when people

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.160
come for a second opinion they
reverse the first opinion,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.100
which just isn't acceptable.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:52.480
There's all kinds of issues now.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.400
I think the third cause
of death is actually

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.430
not the actual
disease, but problems

00:19:57.430 --> 00:20:01.400
that seep into the system
in various kind of ways,

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.600
which basically are mistakes.

00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.567
And so there's all
kinds of opportunities,

00:20:05.567 --> 00:20:07.150
and that's been--
and the food sector.

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:09.590
It's a $5 trillion
dollar industry

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.274
that hasn't changed that much.

00:20:11.274 --> 00:20:13.440
I think there's a lot of
innovation happening there,

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.537
and although at the core
it's about the food,

00:20:15.537 --> 00:20:17.620
there's a lot of things
happening with technology,

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.370
and supply chains,
and using phones

00:20:20.370 --> 00:20:22.670
to order things and
other things that are

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.810
going to really change that.

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:27.820
So the first wave, as I said,
was PCs, second wave, phones.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.930
Third wave is about
sensors, and devices,

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:35.680
and really infiltrating
other parts of our society

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.980
in ways that can create
a lot of benefit,

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.270
but also are going to
create some thornier

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:44.237
challenges, including on public
policy issues around privacy

00:20:44.237 --> 00:20:46.320
and things like that are
going to be even tougher.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.480
How do you make sure--
I'm sure obviously

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:52.490
the folks here that are
working on the car effort

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:54.770
are focused on this,
but how do you make sure

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:57.900
that autonomous vehicles can,
in fact, provide benefits,

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.540
but they're encrypted in a
way that it doesn't create

00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:02.060
significant risk to cities.

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.910
And those kind of
issues were not

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:05.980
as central in the
second wave, but they're

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.230
going to be front and
center in the first wave.

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.710
How to make sure
the food is safe.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.550
How do you make
sure drugs are safe?

00:21:11.550 --> 00:21:13.540
How do you make sure
some of these things

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.460
in the transportation
sector or the energy sector

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:18.140
are benefits to society?

00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:21.510
Are maximized and some of
the risks are minimized?

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:25.270
So the core thesis
of the book is

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.940
that, unlike the
second wave, it's

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.850
going to require
more partnerships.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:33.630
This is less about the app,
less about the software,

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.372
more about how you connect to
other kind of organization,

00:21:36.372 --> 00:21:38.330
whether it be schools,
or hospitals, or cities,

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:39.340
or what have you.

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.400
It's going to require
more engagement on policy

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.736
because many of these
sectors are regulated.

00:21:43.736 --> 00:21:45.110
You might get
frustrated by that,

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:47.320
but the reality is they're
going to be regulated,

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.070
so you just have to kind of
understand that and embrace

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.740
that.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.650
And they're likely going to
require more perseverance.

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:54.774
I think these are going to
be difficult challenges,

00:21:54.774 --> 00:21:56.750
so there'll be fewer of
the overnight successes

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.750
like a Facebook or
Snapchat, which were pretty

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.800
overnight successy, and
more things that are

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.254
going to take 5, 10, 15 years--

00:22:05.254 --> 00:22:06.420
MARY GROVE: In the long run.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:08.450
STEVE CASE: --got a
little bit more of a slog,

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.010
but if you bring
that perspective

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:13.110
around partnerships, and policy,
and perseverance to bear,

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.650
you can change the world
in pretty profound ways.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:17.680
And the reason I
wrote the book was I

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.950
realized that
while-- again, it's

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:21.825
hard to generalize
because a lot of companies

00:22:21.825 --> 00:22:23.350
are doing a lot of
different things,

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:26.190
but in general in
the second wave

00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:28.180
it was more about
the app and software.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.380
Partnerships were
less important.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:33.232
Policy was generally
not that important,

00:22:33.232 --> 00:22:34.940
at least until you
got really successful,

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:37.720
and somebody said, well, what
about privacy with Facebook,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.270
or Google, or what have
you, but in the early days

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.360
it wasn't a big force.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.820
And perseverance was less
critical because things

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.126
tended to happen pretty--

00:22:46.126 --> 00:22:46.820
MARY GROVE: Pretty quickly.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.945
STEVE CASE: Pretty quickly.

00:22:47.945 --> 00:22:52.586
The first wave really was
defined by those three Ps.

00:22:52.586 --> 00:22:53.710
Partnerships were critical.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.440
We had 300 partnerships at AOL.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.560
Policy was critical.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.290
Remember, when we
first started, it

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.150
was actually illegal for
consumers or businesses

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:07.110
to connect to the internet--
illegal until 1991

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.207
when Congress passed
the Telecom Act.

00:23:09.207 --> 00:23:11.540
And also it's worth remembering
that the internet itself

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.980
was invented by the government.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.060
The DARPA funding
really is what created

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:22.070
the internet, and the most
important arguably thing that

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:24.830
happened that unleashed the
internet, which doesn't get

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:27.750
talked about a lot, was
when a judge, Judge Greene,

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.830
broke up Ma Bell,
the phone company,

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.620
into regional Bell
operating companies.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.270
And that created hundreds
of telecom companies instead

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:37.290
of one, which is what
drove down the price,

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.077
drove up the speed,
things like that.

00:23:39.077 --> 00:23:40.910
So there are a lot of
things that government

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:43.900
did in that sector
in the first wave.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:46.450
So those three Ps were very
important in the first wave,

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:48.739
not as important
generally the second wave,

00:23:48.739 --> 00:23:50.530
are going to become
are much more important

00:23:50.530 --> 00:23:51.712
again in the third wave.

00:23:51.712 --> 00:23:53.420
MARY GROVE: So let's
talk about those Ps.

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:54.717
Let's about number two, policy.

00:23:54.717 --> 00:23:56.300
On the regulation
front, you've talked

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:58.470
a lot about how,
in this third wave,

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.700
it's more critical
than ever for companies

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.510
to get ahead of regulation,
to work with policymakers.

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:06.290
At Google, we feel
that every day.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:08.159
So let's talk about Uber.

00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:10.450
Is a Ubter-- and you talk
about this in the book a bit.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:11.790
Is it the exception or the norm?

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:12.460
How they've [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.793
STEVE CASE: Well, it's a hybrid.

00:24:13.793 --> 00:24:16.730
I mean, Uber has been
obviously a tremendous success,

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:21.480
and they should be celebrated
for taking an idea, what,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.580
five, six years ago, and now
having such a global presence,

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:27.260
such a valuable
company, but I think

00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:34.050
if people say that the lesson
of Uber is to ignore the laws,

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:36.530
jump into the market,
try to get traction,

00:24:36.530 --> 00:24:40.750
and then use that traction and
consumer ability to mobilize

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.850
consumers to change
the law, they probably

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:46.260
are going to be in
trouble in the third wave

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.760
for the same reason
that Uber is now

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.968
in trouble in countries like
Germany and South Korea,

00:24:49.968 --> 00:24:50.970
where they're shut down.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:55.340
What happened with Uber is sort
of a unique, which is the laws

00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:57.860
were highly localized.

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.290
So they said they could
fight hundreds of battles.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:00.880
They win some.

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.680
They lose some, and the
basic rules generally

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.860
were perceived by
consumers to be protecting

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.270
the incumbent taxi
companies as opposed

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:14.320
to enabling innovation
that's good for consumers.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.749
That's what drove that.

00:25:15.749 --> 00:25:17.290
There are many
sectors that are going

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:21.390
to be important in the third
wave, like health care.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:26.200
If you think you can basically
ignore the laws around drugs

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:31.000
and just offer something without
going through that process,

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.520
you are wrong, and you will
be put out of business.

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.720
And similarly, things
around food safety

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.235
or other things around drones,
or autonomous vehicles, things

00:25:42.235 --> 00:25:44.110
like that-- there are
going to be regulations

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:46.940
you have to adhere to be
able to be in the market

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:48.040
and generate revenue.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.780
It's not just about
something that you

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:52.540
can fight some skirmishes
around the side.

00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.570
So when I say
that-- because I've

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:58.000
talked to a bunch of
people about these issues

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.610
that in this third
wave it's going

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:05.070
to require partnerships
which are hard, take time,

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:07.620
sometimes frustrating.

00:26:07.620 --> 00:26:09.239
That's kind of a bummer.

00:26:09.239 --> 00:26:11.530
You say it's going to require
more engaging with policy

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:14.680
and dealing with
government and regulators.

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.514
That's kind of a
bummer, and you say

00:26:16.514 --> 00:26:18.180
it's going to require
more perseverance.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.530
It's going to take
longer and be a slog.

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:23.190
That's kind of a bummer, too.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:28.966
And so there are a lot of people
who hear this thesis and say,

00:26:28.966 --> 00:26:31.660
I think I'll stay
on the second wave.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.762
I think I like apps.

00:26:32.762 --> 00:26:34.720
I think I don't really
want to deal with things

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:35.750
that require partners.

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:36.700
I'd rather go alone.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:38.533
I don't really want to
deal with government.

00:26:38.533 --> 00:26:40.130
I don't to deal
with regulations.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:42.690
I'd like they have overnight
successes, thank you very much.

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:44.190
And some will make
that decision,

00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.660
but I think some of
the big opportunities

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.589
are going to-- there
are huge opportunities

00:26:48.589 --> 00:26:50.380
in the third wave, but
are going to require

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:54.380
this different mindset and
a little different playbook.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.880
MARY GROVE: As an
investor, how much

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.560
does regulation impact
your decisions to invest?

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.380
So for example, if you're
looking at a drone company who

00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:03.580
is dealing with FAA
regulations that there's

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.170
such a long lead
time on reform there,

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.607
does that influence
your decision?

00:27:07.607 --> 00:27:08.690
How do you think about it?

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:09.450
STEVE CASE: It influences.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.510
We're not naive about
some of those risks,

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:14.020
and we're not rushing
to things that are going

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.739
to be hard regulatory issues.

00:27:16.739 --> 00:27:18.780
At the same time, we do
believe that's worth some

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.155
of the biggest
opportunities are.

00:27:20.155 --> 00:27:22.440
We do recognize that
a lot of investors

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:24.010
run away from those
things because

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:26.550
of some of the regulatory risk.

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.740
As a result, it creates pretty
interesting opportunities.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.230
So it sort of
depends on the space.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.230
We invested two or three
years ago, for example,

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.640
in a company, Handy,
that in some ways

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.330
is like Uber for cleaning your
homes and apartments, things

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:39.020
like that.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.780
And when we did it-- sort
of a two sided marketplace--

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.740
we knew there were going to
be some policy risks about how

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:48.060
do you deal with these 1099
workers, what kind of benefits

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.410
should they be provided?

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:50.900
But that was a risk
that we thought

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.580
was a reasonable kind of risk
to take, because we thought--

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:54.290
MARY GROVE: How
are they doing now?

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.831
STEVE CASE: They're
doing quite well.

00:27:55.831 --> 00:27:57.060
They're doing quite well.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:59.879
There was a competitor
out here, actually,

00:27:59.879 --> 00:28:01.170
I think Google Ventures backed.

00:28:01.170 --> 00:28:03.562
MARY GROVE: Homejoy.

00:28:03.562 --> 00:28:04.520
STEVE CASE: We crushed.

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:05.775
We crushed.

00:28:05.775 --> 00:28:06.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.060
MARY GROVE: He's
an active investor,

00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.120
a very proud investor.

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:10.870
STEVE CASE: There's
still some work to do,

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:12.480
but Handy's got good traction.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.980
MARY GROVE: I'm going to ask
you quickly about partnerships,

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.230
and as you can tell from our
own work and the partners

00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:19.450
in the room today, we
believe very deeply in that.

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:22.270
So can you give me an
example of, in your mind,

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:25.240
just a super successful
example of a startup

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.940
partnering with a major
incumbent or large

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:28.790
organization?

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:30.374
What's the playbook
for entrepreneurs?

00:28:30.374 --> 00:28:31.873
STEVE CASE: Well,
it's actually what

00:28:31.873 --> 00:28:34.600
Google did with AOL, even though
it happened a bunch of years

00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.100
ago.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.602
When we did this
deal-- and most of you

00:28:37.602 --> 00:28:39.060
obviously weren't
here at the time.

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.734
I don't remember how many
employees Google had.

00:28:41.734 --> 00:28:42.400
MARY GROVE: 200.

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.193
STEVE CASE: 200 or so.

00:28:43.193 --> 00:28:44.526
MARY GROVE: Something like that.

00:28:44.526 --> 00:28:46.390
STEVE CASE: If you talk
to Larry or Sergey--

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.610
I think might even made
before Eric joined.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:52.130
One of the most transformative
deals for Google

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:55.550
was a deal to essentially
have AOL, which at the time

00:28:55.550 --> 00:29:00.150
was pretty dominant, essentially
use Google for search.

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:01.980
And that's why as
part of that deal

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:06.140
AOL essentially acquired 5% of
Google at a pretty low value.

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:10.020
That actually dramatically
accelerated Google's growth,

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:14.600
dramatically accelerated the
algorithm kind of refinement

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.460
that really helped make
Google what Google is today.

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.160
So that's an
example where it was

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.500
sort of a pragmatic
decision on both sides--

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.090
Google saying I want that
additional distribution,

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.110
and we're willing
to share revenues

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:31.260
and willing to give up part
of our company to do it.

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:34.740
On AOL's side, we did believe
that Google technology was

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.870
better technology, and so
we replaced what we had,

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:41.990
and it was kind of a thing that
would benefit both companies.

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:43.730
And that mindset of--
in the third wave

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:45.212
is going to be much
more important.

00:29:45.212 --> 00:29:47.170
How do the start ups
figure out ways to partner

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.220
with some of the larger
incumbents in health care,

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:52.432
or education, or some
of these other sectors?

00:29:52.432 --> 00:29:54.140
And how do the large
companies figure out

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.060
ways to understand what
the entrepreneur is doing?

00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.960
One of the things I really
respect about Mary's work,

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.440
and more broadly, Google's
work, is figuring out ways

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.140
to stay close to the
entrepreneurial world

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.320
and understand what's
happening on the periphery

00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.520
and try to be positioned
as a friend of disruption

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.830
not just a-- when
companies get larger,

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.860
they tend to shift from
being attackers to defenders,

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.240
and less of the art
of the possible,

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:21.510
and more about hedging the
downside, but the really

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:23.320
great companies like
Google, or Apple,

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.600
or Amazon, who, in
the last decade,

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.590
have really figured out a way
to continue to run their core

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:31.300
business effectively while
leaning into the future

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.060
and seizing some of
these new opportunities.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:34.810
MARY GROVE: Great.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.372
Great.

00:30:35.372 --> 00:30:37.205
Now, so along the lines
of entrepreneurship,

00:30:37.205 --> 00:30:39.240
you and I talked a
lot about failure

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:41.520
as a concept-- failing,
failing quickly,

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:44.810
learning from it, something that
separates great entrepreneurs.

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:47.140
So what is your greatest
failure do you consider,

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.432
and what did you learn from it?

00:30:48.432 --> 00:30:49.806
STEVE CASE: Well,
I've had a lot.

00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:51.400
Certainly, as I
talked, the failure

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.630
of the merger with Time
Warner would be one of them.

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.310
The failure early
on to get traction.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.242
It really took us a decade
before we really got going.

00:30:58.242 --> 00:30:59.700
I thought it was
so obvious when we

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:02.200
started that of course
everybody would get online.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.960
It took us a lot of years
to finally break through.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.420
One of the really--
what we thought

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.370
was such a devastating failure,
might kill the company,

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:13.450
was in the late 80s.

00:31:13.450 --> 00:31:15.160
I think it was '89.

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.300
Our strategy in the first
few years in the late 80s

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.341
was to-- because we didn't
have a lot of capital.

00:31:19.341 --> 00:31:22.650
We raised $1 million of venture
capital to get started-- was

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:24.650
we partnered with
PC manufacturers

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.680
to create essentially
white label services.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.030
So we partnered with Commodore.

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.821
Some of you may remember
the Commodore 64--

00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:31.320
to launch a service
called Q-Link.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.410
We partnered with Radio
Shack at the time.

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:35.410
We had a big computer alliance.

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:36.860
Launched something
called PC Link.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.240
We partnered with IBM to launch
something called Promenade.

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.920
We partnered with Apple
to launch something

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:42.378
called Apple Link
Personal Edition.

00:31:42.378 --> 00:31:44.490
It was the first
time, I believe,

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:47.470
Apple ever licensed their
brand name to another company,

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.330
and we basically
created this service.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:52.110
And they were going to
work with us to market it,

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:53.680
but not long after
we launched it

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:56.730
we were at
loggerheads, because we

00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.472
wanted to give away the software
for free to get membership.

00:31:59.472 --> 00:32:01.180
They wanted to sell
software because that

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.290
was their model at the time.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:04.820
We wanted to
distribute it broadly.

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:06.020
They wanted only
to distribute it

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.370
through Apple authorized stores.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.203
There were just a bunch
of different issues.

00:32:09.203 --> 00:32:12.510
So one day they said, we
want out of this deal.

00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:15.139
We don't want to
work with you guys.

00:32:15.139 --> 00:32:16.180
We don't want to partner.

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:17.635
We don't want to
license our name,

00:32:17.635 --> 00:32:20.260
and so they basically said they
wanted to tear up the contract,

00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.860
and they paid us a few million
dollars to go away quietly.

00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:26.740
And we then had
to-- we thought we

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:30.390
might be done because that was
a key growth strategy for us,

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:31.602
so it was pretty scary.

00:32:31.602 --> 00:32:33.810
That led us to say, well,
we can't call it Apple Link

00:32:33.810 --> 00:32:34.260
anymore.

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:35.090
What do we call it?

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.760
Which led to essentially
renaming it America Online,

00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:40.280
and then that plus some
other things we did

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.082
really is what
accelerated our growth.

00:32:42.082 --> 00:32:43.540
So that was an
example of something

00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:47.550
that was a failed partnership
that really could have been

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.650
game over that ended up
opening some new doors that we

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.490
were able to pursue.

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:53.800
MARY GROVE: Turn it around.

00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.160
So I'm going to ask you one
last question of my own.

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.576
Then I'd like to open it up
to the audience for questions,

00:32:57.576 --> 00:32:59.680
so please get ready.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.189
I want to talk
about job creation,

00:33:01.189 --> 00:33:03.480
and throughout the book you
had some really interesting

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.010
statistics around how
entrepreneurs really are

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:07.900
the backbone of job creation.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.460
I know, Steve, that you did
a lot of work leading up

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.740
to the JOBS Act.

00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:13.330
So talk to us about
what do you think

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:14.910
the major sources
of job creation

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:16.362
will be in the third wave.

00:33:16.362 --> 00:33:18.570
STEVE CASE: Well, I think
it's an important question.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.810
I think the key, if
you look at the data--

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.330
and an organization called the
[? Copland ?] Foundation does

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.990
a lot of research on
this-- is the big job

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:29.290
creation comes from young
high growth startups.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:32.000
It doesn't come from small
businesses like main street

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:32.580
restaurants.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.586
In aggregate, they
account for a lot of jobs,

00:33:34.586 --> 00:33:36.210
but they don't create
a lot of net jobs

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:39.180
because one restaurant might
go under, a new one might open.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.170
In aggregate, it
doesn't create jobs.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.670
And large companies, the Fortune
500 companies, in aggregate

00:33:43.670 --> 00:33:45.086
don't create a lot
of jobs either.

00:33:45.086 --> 00:33:47.630
It's these young-- what
some call gazelle companies.

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:51.610
So it is finding the Google's
that are a few people or maybe

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:53.110
a few dozen people
that might end up

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:57.190
being hundreds, or thousands,
or tens of thousands of people.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:34:00.350
And so that's the key
thing to focus on.

00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:02.560
And one of the
key focuses is one

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.140
of the things we work with
Google for Entrepreneurs on

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:07.230
is this concept of
the rise of the rest,

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.230
that we-- I'm sitting
in Silicon Valley.

00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:10.610
I'm proud of Silicon Valley.

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:12.840
I think Silicon Valley
will continue to be great,

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:16.310
and lot of great companies
will start here and scale here,

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:18.340
but there are also now
great entrepreneurs all

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:20.487
over the country, indeed
all over the world.

00:34:20.487 --> 00:34:22.070
And in this third
wave, I think you'll

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:24.940
see both the regionalization
and the globalization

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:28.139
of entrepreneurship, and that's
critically important if we're

00:34:28.139 --> 00:34:30.810
going to create jobs
all across the country

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:34.179
and create opportunity
and even prosperity all

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:35.360
across the country.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.489
A lot of people do feel
frustrated and left

00:34:37.489 --> 00:34:40.139
out-- a lot of cities
that feel left behind,

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:42.690
and there's a way to
bring them in to being

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.830
a more significant
force in the third wave

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:48.199
than they were generally
in the second wave.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.120
So that's a big
focus of our efforts

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.560
both at Revolution and
at the Case Foundation.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.560
Obviously it's a key focus
for Google for Entrepreneurs,

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.320
as well, which is not to
say that we're predicting

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.180
the decline of Silicon Valley.

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:02.990
We are predicting the
rise of these other places

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:05.540
around the country,
indeed, around the world.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.070
And the surprising
statistic there-- again, I

00:35:09.070 --> 00:35:12.317
say this knowing that I'm
sitting at Google in Silicon

00:35:12.317 --> 00:35:13.900
Valley and sort of
like, well, how can

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:16.767
you possibly be talking
about the rise of anything

00:35:16.767 --> 00:35:18.850
other than Silicon Valley
because we're so awesome

00:35:18.850 --> 00:35:20.760
and do everything so perfectly?

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:26.450
But last year 75% of
venture capital-- 75%--

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:29.690
went to three states--
California, New York,

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:34.960
and Massachusetts-- 75%--
but that does not reflect

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.460
the distribution of great
entrepreneurs with great ideas.

00:35:37.460 --> 00:35:39.600
It's really more of
a historical anomaly,

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.900
probably because Silicon
Valley has done so well,

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:42.480
probably could most venture
capital is based here.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.855
It's more convenient to get
in a car than get on a plane,

00:35:44.855 --> 00:35:48.080
but that's going to start
changing in the third wave.

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.117
And rest will start
rising in this third wave.

00:35:51.117 --> 00:35:52.700
So you want to stay
in Silicon Valley?

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:53.200
Great.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.759
It will continue to be great,
but if you grew up in Detroit,

00:35:55.759 --> 00:35:57.800
and want to be part of
the resurgence of Detroit,

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.424
or feel like there
is great opportunity

00:35:59.424 --> 00:36:02.580
to be in Nashville or Madison
because of what they're doing,

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:05.504
or Baltimore because of what
they're doing with health IT,

00:36:05.504 --> 00:36:07.420
I think there will be
more of that opportunity

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.300
in this third wave than
there was in the second wave.

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.260
Just a few examples
just to highlight this,

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:15.325
because people when I first
talk about this go really?

00:36:15.325 --> 00:36:18.934
What, are there real companies
outside of California,

00:36:18.934 --> 00:36:20.100
New York, and Massachusetts?

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:20.930
MARY GROVE: How
many cities have you

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:22.620
been to on the rise of
the rest [INAUDIBLE] now?

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.661
STEVE CASE: On these bus
tours, we've been to 19,

00:36:24.661 --> 00:36:26.610
and we started one
with Mary in Detroit,

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:29.110
which is a great story, because
75 years ago Detroit kind of

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:30.262
was Silicon Valley.

00:36:30.262 --> 00:36:32.220
It was actually the
hottest city in the country

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.730
when the car was the hot
technology of the day.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:36.030
Kind of lost its way.

00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:39.220
Its fighting its way back,
and so that was a great place

00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:39.740
to start.

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:41.614
So we've been to a bunch
of different cities,

00:36:41.614 --> 00:36:44.140
but here is just a few examples.

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:49.450
Hottest health IT company,
probably Epic systems,

00:36:49.450 --> 00:36:51.840
which is Madison,
Wisconsin-- 10,000 employees.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.270
Basically dominate the
electronic medical records

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:56.120
business for hospitals.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.940
One of the hottest VR companies
backed by over $1 billion

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:05.012
of venture capital, including
from Google, Magic Leap.

00:37:05.012 --> 00:37:06.136
Do you know where they are?

00:37:06.136 --> 00:37:07.029
AUDIENCE: Florida.

00:37:07.029 --> 00:37:08.570
STEVE CASE: Fort
Lauderdale, Florida.

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:10.150
They're not in Palo Alto.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:11.067
They're not in Boston.

00:37:11.067 --> 00:37:12.274
They're not in New York City.

00:37:12.274 --> 00:37:14.030
They're in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:17.560
Hottest company focused on
initially with athletic wear,

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.300
but then also focused
on health tech,

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:21.590
a lot of things around
wearables and wellness.

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:24.420
Under Armour, worth $25
billion or something.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:26.160
They're in Baltimore, Maryland.

00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.340
There is now a half a dozen
multibillion dollar SaaS

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:34.010
companies on one
street in Provo, Utah.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.400
Salesforce bought a
company for $3 billion

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.700
called ExactTarget that was
in Indianapolis, Indiana.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.880
So there are plenty
of examples of what's

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.460
happening in different
parts of the country,

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:48.150
and again, we need to
continue to support ecosystems

00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:49.820
in this area and
other areas, but we

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.300
need to figure out
ways to lift up

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.020
these other places so that there
can be more job creation there.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:58.060
The part of the Detroit story
I didn't tell you was it

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.980
was Silicon Valley 75 years ago.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:03.990
It lost 60% of its population
in the last half century

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.480
and then went
bankrupt because it

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.614
lost that job creation engine,
lost its entrepreneurial mojo.

00:38:09.614 --> 00:38:12.030
There are lots of parts of the
country that are suffering.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.580
That's part of the
reason why this election

00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.950
season has been kind of noisy.

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:19.760
There are a lot of people
feeling frustrated and left

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.070
out, and we need
to understand that,

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.300
and we need to make sure
entrepreneurs anywhere have

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:28.780
a shot, and, oh, by the
way, entrepreneurs that

00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.650
are more diverse have a shot.

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:32.260
It's not just a
diversity of place,

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.270
but a diversity of background.

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:37.970
Last year 90% of venture
capital went to men.

00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:42.370
99%-- less than 1% went
to people of color.

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.339
Doesn't seem smart.

00:38:43.339 --> 00:38:44.130
Doesn't seem right.

00:38:44.130 --> 00:38:46.636
So how do you make sure that
you level the playing field

00:38:46.636 --> 00:38:48.510
and create-- just as
the internet essentially

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.860
democratized access
to information,

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.250
in this third wave, we're
democratizing access

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:55.589
to opportunity and
entrepreneurship.

00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:57.880
MARY GROVE: Well, reading
your book makes me incredibly

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.820
optimistic about the future.

00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:03.690
I want to open it up for
questions from the audience.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:05.880
AUDIENCE: How
important do you think

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:11.750
entrepreneurship is to education
or academia in general?

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:15.600
And do you think
it is an accident

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.890
that 75% of the VC capital
went to states where

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:22.740
we have leading
universities that

00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:29.780
perhaps have a longer tradition
in sponsoring entrepreneurship?

00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:34.150
And again, what
are your thoughts

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.550
about the relationship
between universities

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:38.890
and entrepreneurship?

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.348
STEVE CASE: I think
it's important,

00:39:40.348 --> 00:39:42.400
and there's no question
that this region benefits

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.080
from Stanford, and Caltech,
and other things that are here.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:50.320
No question Boston benefits from
MIT, and Harvard, and so forth.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.705
No question about that,
but it's also true

00:39:52.705 --> 00:39:54.080
that there are
great universities

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.690
in the rest of the country.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:58.570
Arguably the best university
in the country-- probably

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:01.500
in the world-- around
robotics is Carnegie Mellon

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:02.350
in Pittsburgh.

00:40:02.350 --> 00:40:04.675
There's a reason Uber put
its driverless car operation

00:40:04.675 --> 00:40:08.430
in Pittsburgh, not here--
because of Pittsburgh's history

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:09.270
of making stuff.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:11.520
Again, it kind of led the
whole Industrial Revolution

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:14.360
as the steel capital and
also their expertise,

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.110
particularly coming
out of Carnegie Mellon

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:21.230
around engineering, and
particularly around robotics,

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:22.496
and things like that.

00:40:22.496 --> 00:40:23.870
And if you go
around the country,

00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:25.411
there are different
universities that

00:40:25.411 --> 00:40:28.800
actually do have excellence
in a lot of different areas,

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.610
even though what was originally
called the Mosaic browser,

00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:36.250
for example, was-- I
think it was in Illinois.

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:39.800
That was not here,
not in Boston.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.860
So I think it's a misnomer that
you cannot build a significant

00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:48.090
ecosystem without-- anchored
by a research university,

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.660
but it does certainly help,
but there are also places all

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:53.522
around the country that have
pretty strong universities

00:40:53.522 --> 00:40:55.730
doing some pretty interesting
things in some of these

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:56.060
sectors.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.720
The last point I make in
this third wave sector,

00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.120
if you look at
things like health

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:02.970
care, and transportation,
food, and so forth, 75%

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.502
of the Fortune 500 companies
that lead those sectors

00:41:05.502 --> 00:41:07.960
are actually in the middle of
country and not on the coast.

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:10.250
So if partnerships
become more important,

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:14.580
I'll bet you there are a lot of
ag tech companies in St. Louis.

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.110
Why?

00:41:15.110 --> 00:41:17.000
Monsanto is in St. Louis.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.995
Tens of thousands of
engineers understand farming.

00:41:19.995 --> 00:41:21.940
I'll bet there are a
couple hundred ag tech

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:24.590
startups in that St.
Louis area a decade ago.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.540
Louisville, as well,
has expertise there.

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.470
In health IT, I
mentioned some of them.

00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:31.730
Baltimore, because of Johns
Hopkins, really rocking.

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.080
A lot of things happening
in places like Nashville

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.080
because there are a lot
of health care companies

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:36.580
based there.

00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:39.140
So there actually
are a lot of activity

00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.640
in each of these
sectors, and some

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.390
of the best-- M.D. Anderson
in Texas is probably

00:41:43.390 --> 00:41:46.286
the leader in cancer
research, for example.

00:41:46.286 --> 00:41:47.660
There's a lot of
things happening

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.380
a lot of different places, not
just here in Boston and New

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.900
York, and that will be more
evident in this third wave--

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:53.150
AUDIENCE: That's kind of point.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.200
STEVE CASE: --and more
capital to flow there.

00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:54.700
What's that?

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.117
AUDIENCE: It was
kind of my point.

00:41:56.117 --> 00:41:58.616
AUDIENCE: What advice would you
have for those of us working

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:01.270
on the rise of the rest
outside of the United States,

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:03.810
especially in areas that don't
have these kinds of staples

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.690
of histories, of other companies
or universities kind of holding

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:08.960
things together?

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:09.750
STEVE CASE: That's
a great question,

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.600
and obviously Google is
doing some work there.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.640
We've done some, as well.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.598
Our focus has mostly been
in the United States,

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:17.060
but we did help the Case
foundation launch a venture

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:20.790
capital fund in the West Bank
five or six years ago backing

00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:22.950
Google, and Cisco, and
others with a sense

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.745
that maybe if you-- there
were startups in Ramallah,

00:42:25.745 --> 00:42:28.120
there would be more of a sense
there's opportunity there.

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.460
And we're hoping
that might be a way

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.260
to provide a more-- create
a more peaceful region.

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.590
Done a lot of things in
Africa over this past summer.

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.350
A lot interesting things
happening in Kenya, Nigeria,

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:43.850
Ghana, and developing
some interesting momentum

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:47.952
around some of those particular
challenges in the some

00:42:47.952 --> 00:42:48.660
of those regions.

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.930
Huge infrastructure
challenges and [INAUDIBLE],

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:53.520
but also really innovative
things around energy,

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.340
particularly solar in
rural villages in Africa,

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.540
understanding a problem
that we wouldn't

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.910
appreciate sitting here or
most parts of the country.

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:04.000
Recently spent
some time in Cuba.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.750
I think that's going
to surprise people

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.080
as the rules get
relaxed to allow

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:11.240
more business to be conducted.

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.410
I think it's going to be rise
of a very start up nation,

00:43:14.410 --> 00:43:17.910
but the playbook is not that
dissimilar to the playbook

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:19.830
that's being run within
the United States,

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:22.380
because even though it may
feel like from other parts

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:25.560
of the world like somehow the
United States has it right

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.430
as this innovative
entrepreneurial nation,

00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:29.850
the reality is it's
not evenly dispersed,

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:32.950
and that places like Detroit,
and Nashville, and New Orleans,

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:36.320
and so forth are really
fighting to build more network

00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:37.820
density within their
community, more

00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.570
collaboration within
their community,

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:41.350
try to win this
battle for talent,

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:42.600
particularly boomerang talent.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.475
How do you get people
who grew up there, went

00:43:44.475 --> 00:43:47.620
to school there to feel like
it's time to come back there?

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:50.180
How do you get more attention
around the companies,

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.020
drive more capital?

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:53.140
Which is why the Google
demo day and things

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.780
like that are so important.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:43:57.900
So actually it's not that
dissimilar to the challenges

00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.260
in most parts of this country.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.010
It's how do you just create
a sense of possibility

00:44:02.010 --> 00:44:05.180
and momentum and get
that network effect

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.900
work in your favor.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.400
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering if you had

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.930
any thoughts around the types
of leader or entrepreneur

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.590
that might come
through the third wave?

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.840
Is it going to be distinct
from the types leader

00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:17.830
and entrepreneur that's been
successful first, second wave?

00:44:17.830 --> 00:44:19.240
Types of skills, et cetera?

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.810
Is it going to be
marked, different?

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:22.810
STEVE CASE: It might be.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:23.310
It might be.

00:44:23.310 --> 00:44:25.200
There are things-- I
think time will tell.

00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:30.900
I would not be surprised if
the founding CEOs of not all,

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:34.320
but many of the third wave
companies were a little older

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.120
and didn't have a little
more domain expertise,

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.290
because my guess
is, if partnerships

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:42.794
are more important, having
some credibility in that field,

00:44:42.794 --> 00:44:44.210
whether it be
health or education,

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:45.550
is probably going
to be important.

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:48.120
Probably going to be hard to
get people to take you seriously

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:51.080
at Stanford University,
or Cleveland Clinic,

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:54.815
or what have you if you
don't have some-- either you

00:44:54.815 --> 00:44:57.450
or somebody on your team
has some of that expertise.

00:44:57.450 --> 00:44:59.570
The policy regulatory
things are sticky,

00:44:59.570 --> 00:45:01.500
and they're
complicated and require

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.310
an understanding of that.

00:45:03.310 --> 00:45:04.950
So having some of
that perspective

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:06.610
may be important, as well.

00:45:06.610 --> 00:45:09.260
So I think there will probably
be a few less of the 20

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:11.510
something dorm room start
ups, and there will probably

00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:15.670
be more diverse
teams that really

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:18.480
have a broader set of skills.

00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:20.720
I'm sure there will be some
exceptions to the rule,

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.644
but I think the engineering
skills of course

00:45:23.644 --> 00:45:25.810
will be important, because
at the core a lot of this

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:27.370
is about technology.

00:45:27.370 --> 00:45:30.170
Some of the people skills will
probably become more important

00:45:30.170 --> 00:45:31.970
because those probably
are pretty essential

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:35.747
in terms of forming partnerships
and engaging on policy.

00:45:35.747 --> 00:45:36.580
AUDIENCE: Hi, Steve.

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.132
I have a question
around capital.

00:45:38.132 --> 00:45:40.590
So in a lot of these markets,
you have great entrepreneurs,

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:42.110
you have great
ideas, but we often

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:45.050
hear that they don't have the
same access to capital, as you

00:45:45.050 --> 00:45:48.452
mentioned around 75%,
but it doesn't mean

00:45:48.452 --> 00:45:49.660
these towns don't have money?

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:49.950
STEVE CASE: Right.

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:50.460
AUDIENCE: Right,
and it doesn't mean

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:53.470
that they don't have investors
investing in other things.

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:54.920
What's your thought
around how do

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:58.050
we help direct investment
towards these entrepreneurs,

00:45:58.050 --> 00:46:01.300
specifically in this third wave
of the type of entrepreneurs

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.882
that will created in places
like Detroit, Nashville,

00:46:03.882 --> 00:46:04.781
and other places?

00:46:04.781 --> 00:46:07.030
STEVE CASE: Well, I think
there's several parts to it,

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:12.140
and the first part is
creating a sense of momentum

00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.920
within the city to get money
in the city of the sidelines.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:17.730
Most of these rise
of rest cities

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.660
there's actually a lot of
money that could be invested,

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:22.892
but they're not really
paying attention

00:46:22.892 --> 00:46:24.350
to what's happening
in the startup,

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.010
and they don't really
understand the importance of it,

00:46:26.010 --> 00:46:28.774
and part of the argument I
make when I do these visits is,

00:46:28.774 --> 00:46:31.190
if you want to have a vibrant
community 25 years from now,

00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:33.190
invest in your startups
today, because there are going

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.590
to be-- some of
them are going to be

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:35.820
the job creators of tomorrow.

00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.620
And if you're not
investing them today,

00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:39.850
you're not going to look
too good 25 years now.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:42.880
So it's either good
investment opportunities,

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.950
and that should
be a driver there.

00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:46.410
Some of these
successes I mentioned

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:48.500
like Epic and Under Armour--
people who were early investors

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.230
made a lot of
money, but also it's

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:52.580
a way to strengthen
your community.

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.350
So mobilizing the local
money, I think, is important,

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:57.990
because obviously
national investors

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:00.216
are looking for that
local signal of nobody

00:47:00.216 --> 00:47:01.840
in Des Moines investing
in the company.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.710
Why should I in San Francisco,
or New York, or DC, or wherever

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:05.570
invest in it?

00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:06.344
So that's one.

00:47:06.344 --> 00:47:07.510
Crowdfunding is another one.

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:09.820
One of the reasons I was
a pretty strong advocate

00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.237
for this JOBS Act that passed
a few years ago jumpstarting

00:47:12.237 --> 00:47:14.361
our business startups,
because I think crowdfunding

00:47:14.361 --> 00:47:16.736
can be a game changer and it
can level the playing field,

00:47:16.736 --> 00:47:18.402
because a lot of
people don't have money

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:20.000
and don't know people
who have money.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.920
And the project sites
like Kickstarter and Ugogo

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.450
have demonstrated that
it's more about the idea

00:47:25.450 --> 00:47:28.220
and less about what you look
like and who do you know.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.100
And so as that shifts-- and it's
going to take a number of years

00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:32.980
to also allow equity
and debt crowd funding--

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:35.230
I think that's going to open
up a lot of opportunities

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:36.980
for a lot of people
in a lot of places

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.330
that otherwise wouldn't have it.

00:47:39.330 --> 00:47:41.870
And the third is to, like we're
doing today with the Google

00:47:41.870 --> 00:47:44.717
demo day, educate investors
in places like California,

00:47:44.717 --> 00:47:47.050
and New York, and Massachusetts,
where most of the money

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:49.299
is, that there actually are
great opportunities there,

00:47:49.299 --> 00:47:52.180
and, oh by the way, because
there's less investors paying

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.240
attention, the valuation of that
company in Des Moines or New

00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:57.920
Orleans is less than if that
same company was in Palo Alto

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.330
or Manhattan, yet if
it's successful and goes

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:03.927
public or gets acquired,
it gets acquired at retail,

00:48:03.927 --> 00:48:06.260
but you can invest in rise
the rest cities at wholesale.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.680
So essentially there's
an arbitrage opportunity,

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.260
so it gets more investors
to pay attention

00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:12.530
and kind of get on planes.

00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:15.370
So it's some mix of
mobilizing local support,

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:19.710
using crowdfunding as a
platform to-- use the internet

00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:22.490
to raise capital for more
people with more ideas and more

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:26.530
places, and then take some
time, but try to create

00:48:26.530 --> 00:48:28.590
more momentum around
what's happening

00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:29.892
in the rest of the country.

00:48:29.892 --> 00:48:32.350
My guess is 10 years from now
all the leading venture firms

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:33.560
will have regional strategies.

00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.935
They'll call it
different things.

00:48:34.935 --> 00:48:37.840
They'll organize it
differently, but the days

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.810
of their basically
saying-- and some

00:48:39.810 --> 00:48:42.080
still do-- that I'm only
going to invest in companies

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:45.660
I can drive to will be
viewed as a relic of history

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:49.099
and I even result in a lot
of missed opportunities.

00:48:49.099 --> 00:48:51.140
Even though I love Silicon
Valley and still think

00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.580
Silicon Valley will be great.

00:48:52.580 --> 00:48:53.430
I want to make that clear.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.971
MARY GROVE: And I
would like to close

00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:56.430
with just a quick,
rapid fire fill

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:57.710
in the blank for you, Steve.

00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:59.910
So I'm going to say a
phrase or statement.

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:00.390
I'm going to ask you
to fill in the blank.

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:02.140
STEVE CASE: This is
like a Rorschach test.

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.050
I hate that.

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:05.900
MARY GROVE: My first AOL Instant
Messenger screen name was?

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:06.650
STEVE CASE: Steve.

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:07.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:08.469
MARY GROVE: Steve.

00:49:08.469 --> 00:49:10.010
STEVE CASE: Hey, it
pays to be early.

00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:11.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:13.960
MARY GROVE: One startup
you should all go check out

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.632
right now is?

00:49:15.632 --> 00:49:17.090
STEVE CASE: That's
a good question.

00:49:17.090 --> 00:49:18.064
AUDIENCE: Mati.

00:49:18.064 --> 00:49:19.525
STEVE CASE: What's that?

00:49:19.525 --> 00:49:20.282
MARY GROVE: Mati.

00:49:20.282 --> 00:49:20.990
STEVE CASE: Mati.

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:23.160
Oh, Mati was a company
that won last year

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:26.210
Google for Entrepreneurs
in North Carolina.

00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:28.410
And if you want to drink
it, it's right back there.

00:49:28.410 --> 00:49:28.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:31.300
No, I-- that had to
be hard, because we're

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.262
championing dozens of
cities and really thousands

00:49:34.262 --> 00:49:34.970
of entrepreneurs.

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:36.860
It would be like picking
your favorite child,

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:42.590
so I would say my favorite is
actually just understanding

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:45.260
what's happening in this third
wave and wildly different

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:48.347
understanding why it will
likely happen in places,

00:49:48.347 --> 00:49:49.930
and pay attention
to what's happening,

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:53.070
and try to be supportive of
these rise of the rest cities.

00:49:53.070 --> 00:49:55.300
MARY GROVE: The best pizza
I developed as director

00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:57.857
of new pizza development was?

00:49:57.857 --> 00:50:00.190
STEVE CASE: I was only there
about a year, but the key--

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:02.060
MARY GROVE: You had to have
had some pizza in that year.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.660
STEVE CASE: We didn't really--
we tried a bunch of things.

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:05.450
I'm not sure any of them
actually got much traction,

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:07.033
but as you mentioned
earlier, delivery

00:50:07.033 --> 00:50:10.160
was one of the things that was--
at that time, very few places

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:13.119
delivered, and that was a big
focus that then obviously did

00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:13.660
get traction.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:14.995
Now everybody delivers.

00:50:14.995 --> 00:50:16.120
MARY GROVE: Final question.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:19.179
My advice for all
of you as Googlers?

00:50:19.179 --> 00:50:21.220
STEVE CASE: I think you're
doing remarkably well.

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:23.360
So let's start with that point.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:26.070
I think trying to figure
out how to maintain

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:28.730
this culture of being an
attacker, as I said before,

00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:29.730
is critically important.

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:31.990
I think actually the
structure and alphabet

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:35.870
seems logical to me to kind of
create that kind of dynamic.

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:37.424
The challenge
there-- a little bit

00:50:37.424 --> 00:50:39.507
like I was saying with the
Time Warner situation--

00:50:39.507 --> 00:50:42.180
is make sure as things become
more separate that you don't

00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:45.395
have the ability still to drive
some synergy and collaboration

00:50:45.395 --> 00:50:46.270
where it makes sense.

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:48.728
In some of these things, it's
not going to be as necessary,

00:50:48.728 --> 00:50:51.720
but where it makes sense, how
do you continue to drive that.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.910
And how do you
recognize that things

00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:57.290
are going to continue
to change and not

00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:59.810
have this mentality,
particularly in your group,

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.030
or you'll get
cocky or complacent

00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:04.740
and continue to
kind of push ahead.

00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:09.170
And pay it forward a little bit.

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:11.450
This is a company that
has benefited greatly

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:13.864
from the support
of a lot of people.

00:51:13.864 --> 00:51:15.280
In whatever sector
you care about,

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:18.045
whatever place you care about,
how do you be helpful, as well?

00:51:18.045 --> 00:51:19.670
And maybe that's
even-- if you're still

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:20.860
going to say Google
and still going

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:22.750
to be living in this
area, maybe there's

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:25.400
a way through crowdfunding
or visiting once

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.480
a year to the place you grew up
or the place you went to school

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.890
and be part of helping other
entrepreneurs in other places

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:35.790
and part of this kind of
rise of the rest movement.

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:38.440
It's not just about what
you're doing directly.

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.480
It's about the impact
you can have broadly,

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.020
and because of the
success of Google

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:46.030
and the respect of Google,
you, as an ambassador,

00:51:46.030 --> 00:51:48.520
I think could really
be transformative.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.390
So I just encourage you to
think about that as a way

00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:55.420
to have impact in the world
beyond what you're doing day

00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.650
to day, because that
ultimately will lift up

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:00.100
more entrepreneurs
in more places,

00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:05.610
and that ultimately will result
in a fairer and more prosperous

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:06.640
world.

00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.360
MARY GROVE: Steve Case, thank
you so much for your time.

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:08.960
STEVE CASE: Thank
you all for coming.

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.418
MARY GROVE: And
I'll see you later.

00:52:10.418 --> 00:52:11.110
[APPLAUSE]
