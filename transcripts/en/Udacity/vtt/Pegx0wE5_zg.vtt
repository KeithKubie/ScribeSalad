All right. You're all done. Let's go

00:00:04.075 --> 00:00:06.450
over the solution to bulkInserts with the ContentProvider.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.710
While we cannot insert a vector directly, we can easily convert a vector into

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.097
an array. Once we've done this, the

00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:18.450
the bulkInsert method will insert very efficiently. Now,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.100
our backend will update efficiently. But we

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.620
really need a way to update the front

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.770
end without introducing framerate jitter. Fortunately, Android

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.040
offers a pattern for that known as Loaders.
