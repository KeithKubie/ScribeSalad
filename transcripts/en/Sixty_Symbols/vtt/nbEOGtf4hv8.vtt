00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:01.720
We're going to...

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.820
To see the unveiling of the pole

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.420
of the Pole Marker.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.040
It's a ceremony, so I dressed up

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.600
... and, uh...

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.320
It's a South Pole tradition.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.360
Once a year.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.940
Unveiling of the Marker

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.540
that was designed the previous year

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.380
by the Winterovers.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.840
Let's go!

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.780
The story is, this is January 1st

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.480
... and, uh...

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.280
every year, we have to mark

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.460
the new location of the axis of rotation

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.120
because we're on this large sheet of ice

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.060
that moves by about 10 meters a year.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.420
So, that's what we're doing today.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.360
So this is the old marker.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.200
It's old and dirty and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.360
- It is time for a change.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.860
Time for a change. Enough of this one.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240
And I guess the new one

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.900
is around here,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.640
about to be unveiled.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.880
Ready?

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.860
Whoaaaa!

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.840
Nice.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.240
Is it Jupiter?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.000
Yeah, it's like, it looks like Jupiter, 'cause of the bands

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.500
but

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:51.580
Saturn rings...

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.540
I don't really understand either.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.960
But maybe it's not to be understood.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.840
It's nice.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.200
Actually, it's Saturn but it looks like Jupiter.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.820
Yeah, 'cause there's bands,

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.340
so I'm not quite sure.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.440
- Wait, is it supposed to be Saturn though?

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.560
So as of today

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.000
the Earth is actually turning around this point.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.220
Hey everyone!

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.520
... Uh, what was I gonna say?

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.500
Yeah, I look a little tired because

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.020
I just came back from work, and it's 3 AM.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.960
Can't you see, the sun is over there

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.200
that means it's 3 AM.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.540
I just came here before going to sleep

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.520
to... to show you. This is the Ceremonial Pole right here.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:53.540
This is the place that doesn't actually change where we have this nice aluminized, or metalized, globe

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.860
and then you see the flags of the countries

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.840
who I think have signed the Antarctic Treaty, I'm not quite sure.
