00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.530
When I was in high school, everyone was popping
their collar.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:05.950
But once you get to university, everyone's
popping PILLS!

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.280
Kids these days, can you believe it?

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.330
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.199
True facts: it wasn't until AFTER I graduated
college that I realized like 90% of my friends

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.430
had been using study drugs on the DL while
we were in school.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.220
Okay, maybe 90% is an exaggeration, but it
was a lot of people!

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.220
People I trusted!

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.390
People I studied with!

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.390
I felt...so naive....

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.810
Researchers put the actual number of students
who use study drugs nationwide at about 30%,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.900
around 1 in 3.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.620
By study drugs I mean Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse
-- all stimulants that are approved medically

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.470
to treat ADHD.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.600
Adderall is by far the most abused.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.120
Scientists actually tracked "adderall" mentions
on Twitter last year -- and there were over

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.940
200,000 tweets which peaked during exam periods.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.020
Unsurprisingly, many of them referenced studying.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.140
'Cuz I meannn...people don't take adderall
to party on the weekends.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.970
They're dubbed "study drugs" because people
take them to do better in school.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.110
Students in fiercely competitive environments
feel like they need a cutting edge to help

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.540
them make it to the top.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.850
It's no shocker that the highest concentration
of tweets about Adderall overlapped with regions

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.100
that host some of the nation's toughest schools.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.920
The drugs improve memory and concentration
-- so well that some people can easily study

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.940
10 hours straight while they're on it.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.170
It can also cause a euphoric feeling of confidence,
thanks to the flood of dopamine.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.320
Adderall is classified as an amphetamine,
Schedule II in the US.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.390
Like all drugs that stimulate the brain's
reward centers, Adderall is HIGHLY addictive.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.240
This is where it takes a dark turn, I think.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.061
Students take it, looking for a little boost,
and then they take it again, and again, and

00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:40.330
it's a little too easy to get to that place
where you rely on it to do well.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.030
Using it a lot skews perspective -- it makes
it feel like you can never be as productive

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.220
without it, and quitting abruptly can cause
depression.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.710
A number of the tweets tracked in the twitter
study mentioned disturbed sleep, nervousness,

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.780
appetite changes, and irritability.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.490
Still, a study in 2008 at the University of
Kentucky found that 81% of college students

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.140
believe that taking study drugs without a
prescription "isn't dangerous at all".

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.960
Aside from these risks, I have another point
of contention: taking study drugs is cheating.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.119
When 1 in 3 students are on drugs that give
them superhuman study powers, it puts good

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.380
students (who AREN'T on performance enhancers)
lower on the curve than they would be otherwise.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.670
It's like competing against athletes on steroids,
except there's very little chance of those

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.190
students getting caught, and nobody's testing
for it.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.450
Soooo....that's cool.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.120
I do have another video with scientifically
backed tips to help you ace your finals this

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.560
season--check it out if you're interested.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.180
And I'd like to know: what do YOU think should
be done, if anything, about widespread Adderall

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.260
abuse in schools?

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.870
Let me know down below and I'll catch you
next time with more DNews!
