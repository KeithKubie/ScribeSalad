00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.580
 "Hold on a second, hold on!" 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.120
 "You haven't heard anything yet!" 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.760
 "Hold on a second, I'll tell you!" 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.720
 "You haven't heard anything yet!" 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.800
 This moment at "The Jazz Singer" in 1928 led to great applause in cinemas. 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.860
 The first moment of dialogue started a boom in the film industry. 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.580
 Improved sales from 1928 to 1929 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.000
 despite the start of the Great Depression. 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.720
 Warner Bros. profits increased from $ 2 million to $ 14 million a year 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.660
 when these talkies got to millions of people. 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.700
 For the first few years, however, they contained mostly musicals. 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.240
 Speaking added a layer of reality that was missing in the movies 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.400
 and enabled greater character and plot development. 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.640
 Innovations in the radio and television industry have paved the way for films more focused on dialogue. 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.040
 The film "12 Angry Men" has a dialogue written so well that you can enjoy the whole movie with your eyes closed. 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.760
 "Talk and talk and talk, even if it's an open and closed case like this one. 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.640
 I mean, have you ever heard so much bullshit about anything? " 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.400
 - "I think they're entitled to it." 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.480
 It has the intensity and pace that a silent film could not achieve. 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.320
 I want to talk about dialogue and see how dialogue can improve the story while seeing its limitations. 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.080
 Probably the biggest and immediate advantage of dialogue is its so damned effect. 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.840
 - "How are you, Captain Whitney?" 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.100
 - "Okay, thank you Mrs. Mallory." 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.820
 - "What are you doing in Arizona?" 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.900
 - "I'll join Richard in Longsbury. He's there with his troops." 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.700
 - "She is much closer to Mrs. Mallory. He was transferred to Dry Forku." 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.080
 - "That's another stagecoach stop! You'll be with your husband in a few hours." 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.060
 From a ten-second dialogue we know who Lucy is, 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.720
 where is it, where will it go, why is there, what does her husband do, where is her husband, 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.640
 where is the next stagecoach stop and how long it will take for the couple to be together again. 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.400
 The dialogue is quick and simple. 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.060
 But the interpretation of the dialogue can bore the viewer. 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.460
 Like when we have to listen to the main villain monologue who explains the diabolical plan through the computer. 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.120
 I think voice-over is a lazy substitute for a strong and effective dialogue. 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.080
 Although sometimes there is no other way to do it. 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.400
 There is a good and bad option how to interpret the dialogue. 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.840
 Let's say that the characters' parents die. 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.080
 It should tell us this: 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.020
 - "O, what would Mom and Dad say?" 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.120
 - "I don't know," 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.820
 "they are no longer with us," 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.840
 "they died when I was 3 years old, remember?" 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.220
 Or like this: 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.380
 - "Leave Billy." 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.500
 - "Mom would let me." 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.180
 Interpretation should be descriptive and not entirely simple. 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.900
 There's a difference between saying something and revealing something. 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.960
 I call it the "Dead Parents Test" for dialogue 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.440
 because many movies have a problem telling us that parents will never be here again. 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.960
 - "My mother's name was Susan" She was killed in a car accident with my father and they're both dead, " 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.080
 "stop trying to bring them back!" 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.780
 The dialogue should reveal that the character is no longer part of the frame than to shout. 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.420
 It doesn't always have to be through dialogue. 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.620
 And it can even be funny: 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.560
 - "And for every Valentine's day, he inexplicably sends me a cactus." 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.180
 "And I do, 'Thanks to the pile of ugly coyotes," 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.900
 "These cactuses are worse than your abandonment." 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.360
 But it will tell us something instead of telling us. 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.300
 It goes through the "Test of Dead Parents" unless it's completely dry. 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.660
 Because, frankly, it's just lazy. 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.100
 - "And with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned," 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.760
 "forgive me," but " 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.180
 "Looks like there's not enough for everyone on board." 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.160
 I think the same idea applies to the dialogue that examines the main idea of ​​the film. 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.300
 "Interstellar" is a stunning movie, but this dialogue is conceived and set very hard. 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.020
 - "Love is the only thing beyond the dimensions of time and space." 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.120
 "We should trust her," 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.200
 "even if we can't understand her yet." 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.120
 Perhaps it is better to have a theme hidden in a more ordinary dialogue. 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.480
 - "And miss the Academy!" 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.680
 "If I want to fly, I'll find a way to fly." 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.220
 Or reveal the topic 'visually. 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.000
 The dialogue always serves a story or a comedy purpose, no matter how random it looks. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.020
 In the movie "Pulp Fiction" the dialogue looks insignificant 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.280
 but it sets the main points of the plot and conflict. 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.160
 Vincent and Jules have a ten-minute conversation about whether or not cheating is 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.580
 when a man makes a woman a foot massage 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.880
 - "Look, I made a million women a million foot massages and they all meant something." 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.240
 "We look like nothing happens, but happening" 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.880
 "that's why it's so popular." 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.460
 "There's something exciting about not talking about," 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:15.160
 "but you know it and she too," 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.080
 "and Marsellus knew that too." 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.500
 "and Antwan was supposed to fucking know better." 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.980
 This conversation - very informal to the surface 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.760
 it strengthens the fact that Marsellus Wallac is not to be fooled. 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.600
 When Vincent spent his night with Mrs. Wallace, an earlier interview reminds us that there is a lot at stake. 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.140
 And Vincent may or may not cross his boundaries. 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.160
 - "So you go there, say good night," 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.500
 "I had a very nice evening," 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.060
 "you go out the door, get in the car," 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.600
 "You go home, you make it and that's all you do." 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.920
 Tarantino uses a dialogue to point to character errors. 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.960
 Jules and Vincent get a big cup of coffee and praise him to be decent to Jimmy. 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.140
 But that only makes Jimmy angry because Jules and Vincent don't focus on the problem they've done. 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.300
 - "Do you know what's bothering me now?" 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.340
 "It's not my coffee in my kitchen." 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.560
 "It's a dead nigger in my garage." 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.280
 Their thankful, courteous and charming dialogue failed them 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.060
 but Winston Wolf, he knows a good way to react because he's Wolf. 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.880
 Tarantino's dialogues are masterfully layered. 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.920
 He seems to be talking about nothing, but in fact the dialogue outlines the main conflicts 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.220
 in the rest of the film. 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.480
 - "You shot me in a dream, you should wake up and apologize!" 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.720
 Do not listen to those who say that dialogue is bad and visual expression is better for the film. 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.740
 It's not true. 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.940
 The dialogue is wonderful, revealing and hilarious. 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.020
 It's just good to know when to use it. 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.800
 - "Yeah!" 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.560
 - "I'm a walrus!" 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.100
 - "It's out--" 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.640
 "Shut up, Donna!" 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:41.780
 "VI Lenin. Vladamir Ilyich Ulyanov!" 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.240
 - "What the fuck is he talking about?" 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.320
 If you liked this topic, you should have a look at the Channel Criswell's video. 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.500
 He only talks about the same subject in more depth than I do. 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.320
 Also a big thank you to all who supported me on the Patreon site and follow me on my crazy Twitter
