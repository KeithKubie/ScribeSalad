00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.130
Without a protective coating of feathers,
fur or scales, pretty much any animal with

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.070
exposed skin can get a sunburn; luckily, most
animals have adapted methods of avoiding the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.180
sun and mitigating the damage.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.570
Farmers have long known that naked animals,
like freshly shorn sheep and domesticated

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.400
pigs (who’ve had their thick coating of
back hair bred out of them), can get a sunburn.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.570
In fact, although uncommon, even light-furred
and hairless dogs and cats have been known

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.610
to burn.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.620
Likewise, naturalists have observed burns
from ultraviolet radiation on elephants and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.360
rhinoceroses, and in fact, even whales, fish,
amphibians and dolphins occasionally get a

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.790
burn from the sun.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.920
In research published in the Proceedings of
the Royal Society in 2010, scientists reported

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.550
that certain whale species, notably the relatively
light-skinned blue whale, not only would suffer

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.000
from sunburn, but that the rate of sunburn
in the marine mammals was increasing over

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
time.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.930
The researchers theorized that ozone layer
loss and thinning cloud cover could potentially

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.600
be to blame for the increase.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.760
Those same scientists also found that, even
though sperm whales spend significantly more

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.180
time on the surface in between dives (7 to
10 minutes) when compared with blue whales

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.710
(about 2 minutes), the darker sperm whales
were far less likely to suffer from sunburn.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.680
Further research also revealed that the sperm
whales’ skin has a protective protein that

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.830
inhibits UV cellular damage.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.259
Notably, although the blue whales’ incidences
of sunburns were increasing, the scientists

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.680
did find evidence that the species is able
to tan, so sun exposure did not always result

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.840
in such damage.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.930
Likewise, many land animals have also adapted
methods of protection from the sun.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.790
For example, pigs and rhinoceroses wallow
in mud, as do elephants who are also known

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.380
to seek out shade, toss dirt and sand on their
backs and create protective shadows for their

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.380
little ones.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.920
Hippos secrete an oily, pinkish-red liquid,
particularly around their ears and faces (the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.460
only parts typically above the water’s surface
for any length of time) that absorbs ultraviolet

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.460
light and also is, apparently, naturally antibiotic.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.119
As for snakes and other reptiles that at times
bask in the sun, their inner epidermis is

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.910
protected from UV rays via their scales, which
also function to help retain moisture underneath,

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.910
among other things.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.320
For these animals, they would typically die
from overheating before any threat of sunburn

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.690
became a problem.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.370
A review published in JAMA Dermatology in
January of 2014 showed that exposure to the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.050
UV wavelengths associated with indoor tanning
beds account for nearly twice as many skin

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.900
cancer diagnosis as smoking does lung cancer
in the United States- about 400,000 annually

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.840
for tanning beds, compared to 200,000 from
smoking.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.269
Further, even just one tanning bed session
increases your risk of getting melanoma- the

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.750
deadliest form of skin cancer- by 75%.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.280
This is why the American Medical Association,
the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.440
Academy of Dermatology, the Skin Cancer Foundation,
and the World Health Organization have all

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:24.470
called on every state to ban children under
18 from using tanning salons.
