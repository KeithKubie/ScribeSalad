I think I think chefs and restaurateurs

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
I think I think chefs and restaurateurs
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.350
I think I think chefs and restaurateurs
are constantly fiddling with and

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
are constantly fiddling with and
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.660
are constantly fiddling with and
tweaking the degrees of formality and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670
tweaking the degrees of formality and
 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.950
tweaking the degrees of formality and
informality that they put in their

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
informality that they put in their
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.330
informality that they put in their
restaurants and one of the things that's

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
restaurants and one of the things that's
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.030
restaurants and one of the things that's
really interesting to watch now is is

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040
really interesting to watch now is is
 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.310
really interesting to watch now is is
the ways in which different chefs and

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
the ways in which different chefs and
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.290
the ways in which different chefs and
restaurateurs both in terms of settings

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300
restaurateurs both in terms of settings
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.390
restaurateurs both in terms of settings
and in terms of what they put on the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
and in terms of what they put on the
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.510
and in terms of what they put on the
plate try to find some sort of perfect

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
plate try to find some sort of perfect
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.080
plate try to find some sort of perfect
sweet spot between formality and

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
sweet spot between formality and
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.750

see a lot of restaurants in Manhattan

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390
see a lot of restaurants in Manhattan
 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.500
see a lot of restaurants in Manhattan
still have a page of their menu which

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510
still have a page of their menu which
 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.449

local seasonal cuisine emphasis so it's

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739
local seasonal cuisine emphasis so it's
 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.800
local seasonal cuisine emphasis so it's
a difficult ideal to achieve and I think

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810
a difficult ideal to achieve and I think
 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.509
a difficult ideal to achieve and I think
what everyone's trying to do is get as

what everyone's trying to do is get as
 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.640
what everyone's trying to do is get as
close to it as they can without asking

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:53.069
 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:55.220
well that's something that predates the

well that's something that predates the
 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.959
well that's something that predates the
recession and that's something that is

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:56.969
recession and that's something that is
 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:58.789
recession and that's something that is
about things that are larger than just

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799
about things that are larger than just
 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.800
