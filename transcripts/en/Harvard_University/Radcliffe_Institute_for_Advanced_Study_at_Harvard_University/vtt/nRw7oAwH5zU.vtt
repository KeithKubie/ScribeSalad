00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.240
Thank you, so much,
for the introduction.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.740
This is going to
be a joint talk,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.450
but I'm the one who will
set things in motion.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.950
So as mathematicians, we
like to express things

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.680
as simply as possible, and
I'm going to jump directly

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.270
into the problem.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.010
So this is a polygonal chain.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.720
Trivial, right?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.860
So a bunch of points
connected by straight lines--

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.870
they can live in 2-D, in
3-D, in arbitrary dimension,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.640
if you are adventurous.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.550
But for the time being, all the
illustrations that I will make

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.200
will be in 2-D.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.810
OK, so what is special about it?

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.270
We view it as a bar-and-joint
framework or linkage.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.740
We want the length of the
distances between the points

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.840
that have been marked there with
an H to retain their lengths.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.220
We mark the lengths, and
we don't want to change it.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.460
However, we've
allowed the joints.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.700
The joints allow rotation,
very much like our arms

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.950
can rotate about our joints.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.930
So this is a bar-and-joint
polygonal chain.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.250
So in case you think
it's too abstract,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.760
here's a little demo that
I picked up from the web.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.060
This is a robot arm from
the Canadarm from the Space

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.960
Station.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.190
It's a robot arm, rigid
links with rotatable joints,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.870
and it's performing very
important tasks up there.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.950
So that's why we refer
to this polygonal chain

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.200
sometimes as robot arms.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.190
Now, here's a robot
again, very small clip,

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.680
just to whet your appetite.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.640
This doesn't look like a
serial linkage, just a polygon.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.580
It looks like a
branch structure,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.530
but the arms, the
legs themselves

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.300
are these polygonal linkages.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.449
So we are also interested
in closed polygonal chains.

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:11.900
And at this point,
you will think, why?

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.990
Well, here's an example.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.190
This is a robot that carries
a tray, and the arms, together

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.920
with the torso
and the tray, form

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.525
a closed polygonal linkage.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.830
So what do we want
to do with this?

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.430
Let's say you get your
tray, you pick it up,

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.140
and you want to
move it somewhere.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.100
You have to reconfigure
your polygon

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.740
from one initial
position to a final one.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.480
So this is the polygonal
chain reconfiguration problem.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.210
We have to design some
motion, so let me demonstrate

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.010
one possible reconfiguration.

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.470
Yes, how it would look like.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.940
Remember, we allow
rotations, but we want

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.130
to maintain the edge length.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.830
So maybe it looks like this.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.160
You start moving a little bit.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.230
Now, these are lines.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.840
OK, maybe that's what I wanted.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.170
So another one, maybe.

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.950
Yeah, but you notice that
several move at the same time.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.600
And finally, I'm
where I plan to be.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.680
What I'm trying to argue
throughout our talk,

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.170
what we are trying to
argue throughout our talk,

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.080
is that there is a
hidden structure.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.360
And in fact, we want to
discover this structure.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.040
We may not know apriori.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.420
In fact, it's not visible.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.450
So I will demonstrate
it to you, and then I'll

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.130
tell you how we model
it mathematically.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.590
Although it's not
visible, it is what

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.120
can guide motion, what can
help us design trajectories

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.380
and further on to applications.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.500
So on the left, we have
the polygon in motion.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.900
On the right, I'm going
to add extra structure.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.240
Remember, the structure
is invisible to you,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.190
but I'm adding it.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.560
So here is what I'm doing first.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.280
I'm using extra bars.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.610
They are those added red.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:11.240
And as I add them, I eliminate
the freedom to move, yes?

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.670
So it is as if my arms--

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.579
all of a sudden, I'm
hitting something here.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.620
So I turn a join that was
very flexible into a part that

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.080
is rigid.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.650
OK, so I'm arguing,
and then I'll

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.840
explain in more detail later,
that the structure on the right

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.190
is rigid--

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.980
completely rigid.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.500
It doesn't move at all.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.380
So what I'm going to do instead,
I'm going to remove one edge,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.920
and it's going to be selected
in a particular way--

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.410
namely, on the exterior.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.030
In mathematical language, on
the convex hull of the planar

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.080
linkage.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.220
I'm going to remove it.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.240
I still left it there
with a dot to suggest

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.980
maybe something
like a rubber band,

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.550
because I will
allow that to flex.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.661
I'll allow that to move.

00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:06.870
But the rest, the
red bars, are going

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:10.771
to keep the structure
partially rigid,

00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:12.270
if you want to
describe it that way.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.070
So now, with this, I
have the freedom to move,

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:17.840
and the two things move.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.310
And although on the left you
don't see it, on the right,

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.070
you see that it's guided.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:24.650
It's moving in such a
way that the red bars

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:26.340
retain their lengths.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.600
So now I got again get to
something that is fully--

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.850
it's close to my target,
so I'm going to freeze.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.930
I'm going to lock that joint.

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.240
I'm not going to
move it from now on.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.900
And now, if again you
do a little calculation,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.830
you will realize that this
one is completely rigid again.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.330
So we have to drop another
bar from the convex hull,

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.240
get another structure
that moves and moves

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.430
along a very
well-determined trajectory,

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.920
until it reaches the goal.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.070
And again, I locked that joint.

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.390
I drop another one, and then
I conduct the final motion,

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.350
and I'm done.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.330
That's my final structure.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.000
That's the goal.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.610
That's where I wanted to get.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.930
OK?

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.240
So now, this hidden
structure can

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.970
be explained in terms of
an area of mathematics

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.610
called rigidity theory.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.260
So let me give you
a brief introduction

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.990
to rigidity theory.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.900
So this object living
in the plane is rigid.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.260
It means that it can
do things like this.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.110
You can rotate, translate
it in the plane,

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.850
but it doesn't change the shape.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.890
The shape remains the same.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.594
And in fact, any
collection of triangles

00:06:47.594 --> 00:06:48.635
would have this property.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:54.170
Well, when you built a
structure from bars and joints

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.390
as big as this
one, you definitely

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.920
want it to be
rigid, not flexible.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.450
OK, so on the other hand,
from bars and joint,

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.840
we can also build
purposefully structures

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.850
that are flexible mechanisms.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:13.640
So this is the simplest one.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.830
It has one degree of
freedom in the sense

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:19.760
that by rotating that
joint about the other one,

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:21.550
there is only one
way to rotate, yes?

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.800
So there is only one
force or only one motor

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:28.280
that will activate the
joint in the robot arm.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.340
So we call it a one degree
of freedom structure.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.020
But the one degree
of freedom structures

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.070
can be more intricate.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.970
So for instance, this is
the next, the simplest one,

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.040
the next one that
you can think of,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.620
and it is a closed
loop a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:46.130
And I'm telling you that this
one has one degree of freedom

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:47.240
[INAUDIBLE].

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.710
OK, so it moves roughly like
this, and at some point,

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.650
it may even cross itself, yeah?

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.730
Can go back.

00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:58.970
So it has one degree of
freedom, and these pieces

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.970
with one degree of freedom
are very useful because they

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.590
move only in one way.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.680
Otherwise, if I have too
much freedom to move,

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.080
it's hard to design the motion.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.020
Maybe you design it one step
at a time, one joint at a time.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:18.510
It's easier when it can go
only along a single trajectory.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:22.580
So our goal is to understand
those single trajectories,

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:26.450
those trajectories that can be
described by placing extra bars

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.420
and getting these one degree
of freedom structures.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.640
So now, these structures
are very famous.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.390
I'm showing you here
a very famous one,

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:37.490
the so-called
Peaucellier Linkage

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:42.900
discovered in 1864 at the peak
of the Industrial Revolution.

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:45.110
It's the one that
converts circular motion

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.640
to linear motion.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.900
It was a famous open problem.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.780
So on the right, I'm
showing it to you

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.500
because it's the same
linkage, but it's clear

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.390
that it's planar, at
least in the plane.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:59.090
And as it moves, you see
that some of those links

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.090
actually overlap.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:04.730
So it's possible that these
linkages are more complex

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.000
than just polygonal chains, than
just closed polygonal chains.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.310
They may have many links,
and in particular, they

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:14.859
may even cross.

00:09:14.859 --> 00:09:15.650
Here's another one.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.220
This time, it's in 3-D. And
in fact, I have it here.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.680
This is the Hoberman Sphere.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.900
It's a bar-and-joint linkage.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.090
And again, it moves with
one degree of freedom.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:30.020
You just pull in any
direction, and it expands.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.980
It stops at some point,
and you move it back.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:38.920
So what I want to do now is to
analyze the hidden structure

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.640
in this reconfiguration motion.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:47.900
As I said, the polygon has
too many degrees of freedom.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.810
But as we add bar, we restrict
those degrees of freedom, yeah?

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:56.250
So we put people behind bars
to restrict their freedom.

00:09:56.250 --> 00:10:00.650
Sorry for making the pun,
but I wanted to retain that.

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:04.580
More bars you add,
less freedom you have.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.690
So if I add enough of
them, I can no longer move.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.640
I'm completely rigid.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.440
This particular one, yeah?

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.800
So this particular one is rigid,
but it's rigid in such a way

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.980
that if you remove any
bar, it becomes flexible.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.440
It's called minimally rigid.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.020
So if I remove one bar from
this minimally rigid structure,

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.140
I get something that is
one degree of freedom.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:33.140
But I'm going to
remove a special one.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.450
This one's from the
convex hull, yeah?

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.460
And I get this one
degree of freedom

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.770
a la Paucellier Linkage.

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:44.030
And then, well, it's
like I rotated the crank,

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:46.640
and then this one
keeps moving, yes?

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:50.040
So you already have seen
this, until an event happens.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:55.250
So the motion now is decide
what one degree of freedom

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.240
structure you want.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:01.250
Move it as long
as it's possible.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:06.350
I could continue, but I have
a hidden reason to stop there.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:09.050
And then, reconfigure.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.490
So drop another bar, yeah?

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:15.980
So freeze, drop another bar, and
continue until the bars align

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.140
with joint, lock, and continue.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.930
So in order to explain, right?

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.720
So until the whole
chain is convex--

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.460
in order to explain what
is going on, first of all,

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.730
what do you think with
this kind of motions?

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.860
Are we actually
avoiding collisions?

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:36.800
Could it be possible that
something is so intricate-- not

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.050
in this particular case, but
something is so intricate

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:44.030
that as I move stuff, maybe
I will produce collisions,

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:46.770
very much like in the
Paucellier Linkage?

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:51.470
And so I don't expect you
to give me the answer,

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.610
but remind you that it is
possible to get collisions.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.640
But in this case,
the answer is clear.

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.710
There are no collisions.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.430
And the reason why now has to
be explained mathematically,

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:06.140
and in order to do
the explanation,

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.510
I need to introduce
the concept, yeah?

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.220
So one was the one
degree of freedom motion

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.690
that you have seen.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:19.460
The other is the concept of
what an expansive motion means.

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.220
So let me start with
that little definition.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.420
So expansive motion--

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:30.010
OK, expansive means when--

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:31.600
it's very much
like this one, yes?

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.990
If I choose two
points in this motion,

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:37.330
these points move
away from each other,

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:40.410
but not only these two points
move away from each other.

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:45.850
Any other pair of points moves
away from each other, yeah?

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.120
So an expansive
motion would be one

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:52.069
where all the points that
I'm keeping an eye on--

00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:53.360
they move away from each other.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.790
It's like an expanding
universe, yeah?

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.040
So let's say we may
start with three points,

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.802
and we just move them
away from each other.

00:13:01.802 --> 00:13:03.760
If there are no constraints
between the points,

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.500
I can do that easily.

00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.900
But if there are constraints,
like if I have a framework,

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.580
then let's see
what happens, yeah?

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.050
So let's keep an eye on the
evolution of the length.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:19.930
So this one started 6.87.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.060
The other is 2.4.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.640
And I'm going to
increase this big one,

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.190
and you'll notice that
the other one also

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.890
increases simultaneously, yeah?

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:35.710
So they increase, increase until
this one, the big one, yeah?

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:38.500
So reach its maximum--

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.270
of course, beyond the maximum,
it can no longer expand,

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:45.090
so it would start decreasing,
although the other one

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.750
increases.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:53.320
So it's like all of us.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.810
We have an expansive
period in our life,

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.950
and then at some points along
some dimension, we increase.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.170
Along others, we decrease.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.810
So mechanisms have
one degree of freedom,

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:09.400
but their trajectories,
their full trajectory,

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.450
is split into intervals.

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:15.100
And it's only on one interval
that you can fully increase

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:17.750
in all possible directions.

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:20.990
So that is what happened
with this structure, yeah?

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:26.410
So if I start in this
shape, I'm expanding.

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.940
I'm young and expanding.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.540
And then I reach the maximum.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:32.560
OK.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.980
I got the fellowship at
Harvard or something, yes?

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.440
I hope I will
continue, but you know,

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.510
it's maximum on some dimension.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:44.290
Good.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:49.570
So these are the definitions,
but I give you some very simple

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.000
examples, but the
reality is that we fully

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.750
understand these structures.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.350
So let me tell you quickly
about the structure of 2-D

00:14:56.350 --> 00:15:01.200
expansive motion, and I need
to introduce one more concept

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.440
to the triangle.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.990
So we see here a triangle.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:07.540
Everybody knows
what a triangle is.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:10.180
We have seen this little object.

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.389
It's a pseudo-triangle.

00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:13.180
These also are
pseudo-triangles, and here's

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:15.840
how you can recognize one.

00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.321
You recognize it because it has
only three points on the convex

00:15:19.321 --> 00:15:19.820
hull.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.010
So there is sort a hidden
triangle behind the scenes.

00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:27.430
And where it is not
on the convex hull,

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:31.160
it bends inwards in
a concave fashion.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.000
So these are
pseudo-triangles, yeah?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.540
So all of these
on the background

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.980
of their supporting triangle--

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.300
and when I put them together, I
obtain a pseudo-triangulation.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.220
So here's what it means.

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.880
And this is a game
that you can play.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:47.713
And I challenge you.

00:15:47.713 --> 00:15:48.280
Go home.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:53.650
Take your friends,
children, whatever, spouses.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:57.700
Draw a bunch of points in the
plane randomly, like here.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.440
OK, so I draw them.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.310
And then, your task
is to obtain a tiling

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:05.860
of the convex hull
of these points

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.840
into pseudo-triangles, yeah?

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:12.580
So you see here, each of these
pieces, if I would cut along

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.900
these bars, I would get pieces
that are pseudo-triangles.

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.790
So let me color them so that
you will see them, yeah?

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:21.620
So the challenge
is how to do that.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:24.950
Maybe it sounds trivial,
but let me show you very,

00:16:24.950 --> 00:16:28.090
very quickly how you
can play this game.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.620
Basically, you
play it at random.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.560
Just throw it
anything, randomly.

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.230
However, you have to
respect some rules.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:40.510
So for instance, I don't
allow you to do this.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.170
Why that?

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:45.610
So the first rule is I want
you to keep enough space

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:48.100
around each vertex.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.740
Around each vertex, you
should have an angle larger

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.290
than 180 degrees.

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:56.620
When I added this edge,
I violated that rule

00:16:56.620 --> 00:17:01.426
because now I have angles
that are all smaller than 180.

00:17:01.426 --> 00:17:02.800
So I'm not going
to add this one.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.380
That's the first thing
that you have to avoid.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.349
The other is don't
produce crossings.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:12.040
And if you avoid these two
rules, then at some point,

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.960
there will be
nothing you can do.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.710
You try this.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.000
You try that.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.380
Everything will violate.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:20.079
And if you look carefully,
all of these faces

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:23.530
are pseudo-triangles, OK?

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:27.849
So now, this is the structure
in an expansive motion

00:17:27.849 --> 00:17:32.140
that we want to start
describing in our project.

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.420
We discovered this years ago.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.340
So here's theory number one.

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.100
First of all, a
pseudo-triangulation

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.290
is always minimally rigid.

00:17:41.290 --> 00:17:43.330
First of all, it's rigid,
and removing any edge,

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:45.100
it becomes flexible.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:49.750
And when you remove an edge
from the convex hull-- and also,

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.290
the mystery is clarified now.

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.930
So when you remove
from the convex hull,

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:58.750
then it becomes a one
degree of freedom mechanism

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:02.980
and always, always
moves expansively, yeah?

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:06.550
So it's not just
those little linkages

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.450
that I have shown
you, but all of them.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.210
And you can build them tonight.

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:14.950
Random points-- your
children can build quickly.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.030
OK.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:21.280
So once again, this is
my expansive structure,

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.540
and I move it.

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:25.990
And I want to notice
that usually, I

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:27.850
have to stop when
something aligns

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:31.300
because beyond that point,
it starts shrinking.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:34.340
So this one is an expansive
mechanism, but remember,

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.400
it's only for a given interval.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.130
OK, so that's a structure.

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:44.620
Now, the beauty of this is
that this is essentially all.

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:47.920
You don't have to look further.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.360
A one degree of
freedom mechanism

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:53.590
is essentially any
one degree of freedom

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:55.780
expansive mechanism
is essentially

00:18:55.780 --> 00:19:00.980
a pseudo-triangulation with a
convex hull edge removed, yeah?

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:04.790
So it's a characterization.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:10.340
And not only that,
if now you want

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:14.520
to do any motion that
it's expansive, in fact,

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.870
it's a complex combination
of such structures.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.730
So if you understand
the structure,

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.660
you can describe any
possibility in what

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.670
is called mathematical
or convex combination

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.750
of the original ones.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.570
So we have a full
characterization.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:34.640
And I would be really happy if
I could extend this to dimension

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.040
three to have a
theorem that does

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.680
the same thing in the
dimension [INAUDIBLE] higher.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.430
Unfortunately, that is not such
a thing for various reasons

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:45.470
that have to do with
famous open problems

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.560
in mathematics that have
been open for over 150 years.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:54.120
But since we are here,
putting everything together,

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:58.010
the problem with I started with
is that every planar polygonal

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:01.640
chain can be convexified
in a finite number of steps

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:05.030
using this expansive
pseudo-triangulation mechanism.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:11.260
So that's the first structure in
motion that we plan to present.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:13.790
So it can be applied not
just to simple structures.

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:17.055
It can be applied
to complex, convex--

00:20:17.055 --> 00:20:21.610
sorry, complex, very convoluted
polygons like this, to large,

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:23.130
very large.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.090
And we would like
to do it in 3-D,

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.450
but I let you know
what we can do in 3-D.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:33.340
So first of all, remember that
this Canadarm on the Space

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.010
Shuttle is short.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.430
It just has a few linkages.

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:39.140
We don't need a complicated
algorithm to handle it.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:39.820
It's not closed.

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.820
It's open, but it is in 3-D.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:49.930
We'd love to understand how
to move this in 3-D. However,

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:56.650
for the 21st century, things
that seemed completely

00:20:56.650 --> 00:21:02.680
irrelevant, for instance,
for the engineers of the 19th

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.480
century--

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.650
you don't need too
many bars in order

00:21:05.650 --> 00:21:08.780
to build interesting mechanisms.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:14.940
But I remind you of
something that Kepler

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.640
said in a famous writing.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.740
"Where there is method,
that is geometry."

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:21.200
So we are going
to look at matter,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.690
and these are nature's robots.

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:27.410
This is a video that I picked
up last night from the internet.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:31.650
And what you see here are what
are called molecular markers.

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:36.200
These are proteins that perform
their functions in my cells,

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:40.550
in your cells, in millions and
trillions of cells as we speak.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.180
And they are made of--

00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:47.300
they're like little mechanisms
at this time with tens

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.060
and hundreds and thousands
of these linkages,

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.300
and even hundreds of
thousands of such links.

00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:56.940
And we like to
understand how they work.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:01.580
So this is an artist's
rendering of what

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:04.500
happens in the cell
with dynein and kinase,

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.390
two of these molecular
motors transporting cargo

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:11.300
along the microtubules
in the cell.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:14.345
Now, these molecules
are made of proteins,

00:22:14.345 --> 00:22:17.360
and the connection with the
chains that we will be talking

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.670
about is that the
backbone of a protein,

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:25.690
which looks like this big blob,
is, in fact, a polygonal chain

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:30.910
living in 3-D. So this is one
of the motivating problems

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:32.680
for the project
and for everything

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.580
that we conduct from there on.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:36.880
So again, let's see,
how large could they be?

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:38.470
How many could they be?

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.510
So I did a quick
search yesterday,

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:44.590
and the Protein Databank
is the data bank where I--

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.870
the software that we have
designed in my group.

00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:52.720
We get the structures, and
there were 145,000 structures.

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:56.870
Last year about this time,
there were about 130,000.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:00.700
So it grows with over
15 structures per year,

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.380
and accelerating.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.050
Just to give you a very,
very quick idea about what

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.720
is going on, this started
about 40 years ago

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.490
with structures that--

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.810
each one of them was worth a
Nobel Prize, like myoglobin.

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:17.530
And these by today's
standards are small proteins.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.970
They were considered
huge by those standards.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.610
Nowadays, the largest one
in the Protein Databank

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.860
is their atomic-level structure
of the HIV-1 virus capsid.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.130
This has about a
2.5 million atoms.

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:35.500
And this is another virus.

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.390
Each time I get the
flu, I'm thinking

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.360
about how beautiful they look
in these computer-generated

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.810
images.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:45.330
They are very
symmetric, so we have

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:50.860
to put some symmetry,
some mathematical theory

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.400
to put it to work so that maybe
we can analyze them faster,

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:56.830
because for the
following reason.

00:23:56.830 --> 00:24:00.330
So what you see here
is a generated image.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.175
But while the experimental
is [INAUDIBLE],,

00:24:03.175 --> 00:24:06.470
it's more something like this.

00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:10.000
So this is a cryo-EM
image of a virus,

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.710
and you see it in two states.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.360
It's obvious that it flexes.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.360
It's obvious that
there is motion there.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:21.480
So this is as it
enters your body,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:27.230
and this is where it releases
the dangerous nucleic acid

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.080
inside to infect your cell.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.770
So we'd like to understand
how this happens, and here's

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:35.130
an engineer's view of this.

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:39.160
Parts of the structure
seem to be moving rigidly,

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.240
and others seem to
allow freedom to rotate.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.900
So very much like our
linkages, except that now there

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.270
seems to be collective
motion, pieces,

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.270
collections of atoms
that move simultaneously.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.130
So that's what we want
to understand next--

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.110
collective motion.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:59.560
So actually, we have seen
it, but it was hidden.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.780
So let me show it again, yeah?

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.240
So let's get this
mechanism that moves.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:08.280
Can you track some points that
seem to be rigidly attached

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.170
to each other?

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:13.660
And not everything is moving.

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.780
Not all the points are
moving away from each other.

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.440
Those that stay rigidly
attached to each other form

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.940
what are called
rigid components,

00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.620
and I highlighted them here.

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.140
And now I'm doing
the same motion

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.180
with and without
the colors, and you

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:30.740
can see that the colored
pieces move together.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.220
That's a collective motion.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.460
So here's what we have done.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:39.520
So a couple of years ago, this
started as a collaboration

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.060
with a biophysicist, and
we have this software

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.000
that is called KINARI--

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.930
Kinematics and Rigidity
Analysis for Proteins.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:52.990
And what it does, it
takes a protein structure

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:58.780
from the Protein Databank and
does a coloring of the pieces

00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:03.400
that if the protein will
move and it moves, then those

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.130
will tend to stick together.

00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:08.740
So it's very precious
information about the stability

00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.950
and about the overall
behavior of the structure.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.150
So let me give you,
quickly, two applications.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:21.730
So this can be used to
predict, for instance,

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:23.950
the effect of binding a ligand.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:26.890
This is a protein--

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.630
HIV protease.

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.300
And it's here
without the ligand,

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.820
without the extra
molecule that is designed

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:36.130
to fit in that little cavity.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.610
And here is with
that ligand, and we

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:44.530
can infer the effect of the
ligand on the protein rigidity,

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.470
and maybe this gives us
some functional information

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.860
about the role of the
protein in the organism.

00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:54.700
In particular, if we do this,
we notice that these two flaps

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.600
here, which the biologists know
they have a functional role.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.510
They have a functional
in the spread,

00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:03.595
in the division of the--

00:27:03.595 --> 00:27:07.100
in the multiplication
of the HIV virus.

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:12.190
And when that little drug
is injected in the organism

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:15.839
and binds there, it's rigid,
and those flaps cannot perform

00:27:15.839 --> 00:27:17.380
their function,
which is-- basically,

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.570
they act like scissors, OK?

00:27:19.570 --> 00:27:22.450
So we infer functional
information from this.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:26.890
This is work done by a group
demonstrated in about 2002.

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.070
Our goal is to be able
to provide a tool where

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:33.140
this can be used
on a larger scale,

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:35.080
not just on a few proteins.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.610
So we infer.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:38.620
We hope that with
this kind of analysis,

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:42.340
we can infer function from
structure on this large data

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.090
set of proteins.

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:45.430
So here is another one.

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.740
Everybody has heard
about mutations.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:51.370
So what you see here
is the same protein,

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:54.490
but a little mutation has
happened so that certain bonds

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:55.550
cannot form.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.900
And you can see that
large, rigid cluster split

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.620
into two, which tell us that
this one actually is more

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.120
flexible than the original one.

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:09.870
So probably, its function
might have been affected, OK?

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.914
So these proteins,
the majority of them,

00:28:12.914 --> 00:28:14.580
have been solved with
a technique called

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:18.120
x-ray crystallography,
meaning that they are not

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.120
just one, single structure
that we are looking at.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:21.990
They are many.

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:24.960
So the problem becomes large.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.870
So how can we algorithmically
handle such challenges?

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:32.910
So we want to understand the
structure in periodic motion.

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.640
And at this point, Ciprian
will take over and tell you

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.306
about that.

00:28:37.306 --> 00:28:40.792
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:47.764 --> 00:28:56.920
- Our periodic structures
are widespread in nature,

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:01.650
in man-made materials.

00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:06.600
And we see here, by
now a famous structure,

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:17.726
of course ideally drawn, but
this is one sheet of graphene.

00:29:17.726 --> 00:29:21.590
So it's an illustration
in dimension 2

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.150
of a periodic structure.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:33.860
Here, I make it stand
next to a drawing which

00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:36.750
suggests three dimensions.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:42.890
So let's look first at a planar
one on the left, where you'll

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:46.970
notice the color
code of the vertices

00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:55.890
because they will assist to
visualize the periodicity.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:30:00.830
So if we translate this
structure, imagined

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:08.140
extending indefinitely, then we
can superimpose it over itself.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.800
So periodicity,
briefly, is expressing

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:17.660
this translational
symmetry of the structure.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:25.970
And if we watch, say, a red
vertex by this translation,

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:30.280
which necessarily takes hexagons
to hexagons and triangles

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:37.400
to triangles, these symmetries
will always take a red vertex

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:42.140
to a red vertex, a
blue one to a blue one,

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:43.640
green one to a green one.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:48.015
And all these
collection of vertices,

00:30:48.015 --> 00:30:53.390
which we call orbits
and periodicity,

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:58.620
express the symmetry of
the periodic structure.

00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:04.940
On the right, we have the
diagram of a crystal structure,

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:09.110
actually, which is
important for artists,

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:16.280
because this crystal structure
is involved in making pigment

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:21.920
for the color called
oftentimes Prussian blue,

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:28.880
and the famous wave of Hokusai
uses that kind of blue.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:38.450
Another source of
periodic structures

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:43.460
comes from sphere packings.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:46.070
So sphere packings
have been imagined

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:56.750
since the time of Kepler,
and the dates here

00:31:56.750 --> 00:32:00.740
is a summary of the
famous conjecture

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:08.950
he made that the best, the
densest stacking of spheres

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:15.400
of the same radius is
this kind of stacking.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.740
And Gauss showed that as long
as you assume periodicity,

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.750
that's indeed the case.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:27.890
But what if we don't assume
periodicity and just allow

00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:34.610
the stacking to be disordered?

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:38.430
And [? Hale's ?]
recent contributions

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:42.070
were to show that even in
the absence of assuming

00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:47.530
periodicity, this is
the densest packing.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:52.900
On the right, we see
what a mathematician

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.730
would do with the structure.

00:32:55.730 --> 00:33:01.210
You'll take into account
the contact graph.

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:07.380
So each sphere is considered
as a node or vertex.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:11.880
If two spheres are in contact,
you put the bar between them,

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:19.850
and this gives you a
contact periodic framework.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:26.120
And you look at its
generators of periodicity.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:29.930
So those three red
arrows indicate

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:35.420
that if you translate
with those vectors,

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:40.190
the structure will go
over itself exactly--

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:43.100
of course, imagining
it infinite.

00:33:46.446 --> 00:33:49.780
So here's a simple
example, which

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:54.010
goes back to the
quadrilateral used earlier

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:57.420
in Illeana's presentation.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:04.330
So we start with a
humble quadrilateral.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:08.770
And we are going to adopt
the two diagonals, which are

00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:16.510
the red arrows, as our periods.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:22.090
So I'm going to take
this humble quadrilateral

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:29.650
and translate it by that
vector, then by this vector,

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:36.370
and begin to generate
its infinite array, which

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:39.909
you see progressing over here.

00:34:39.909 --> 00:34:43.690
I have put these two at
the adequate distance

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:51.550
so that you see that
completed to a larger piece.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:55.750
But we want to imagine
for mathematical purposes

00:34:55.750 --> 00:35:02.650
the actually infinite
periodic structure.

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:08.500
So you see that surreptitiously,
there's a doppelganger here.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:16.330
And if we call it that,
we'll see the pattern.

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:21.490
So this is called the
double arrowhead framework

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:27.560
because of how I started
with a single quadrilateral.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:39.310
The periodicity construction
creates that sibling

00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:42.820
of the image of
the quadrilateral,

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:47.860
and that's the
expression of a theorem

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:50.290
that in dimension two,
if you have just two

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:54.670
orbits of vertices,
there's always

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:58.360
this addition of symmetry.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:06.870
So it's not by accident that the
two are essentially congruent.

00:36:06.870 --> 00:36:13.790
So how is such a
structure moving?

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:18.850
Well, now that we have seen
that a single quadrilateral does

00:36:18.850 --> 00:36:22.880
have a one degree of freedom,
we just say to ourselves,

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.530
well, I can repeat
the same procedure.

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:33.520
I take the diagonals as
periods and do the thing,

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:39.500
and indeed, we will see that
it moves because of that.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:50.150
And here we go, and it seems
to expand both vertically

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:52.650
and horizontally.

00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:58.440
And we look with more
intensity, and it does so.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:06.150
It even goes out of the
space of the screen.

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:12.220
But by now, I'm reaching as
in Illeana's illustrations.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:16.500
I'm reaching a point
where two edges align,

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:22.920
and my quadrilateral has
now the shape of a triangle.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.880
And beyond this point,
I become convex.

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:30.990
And you will see now that
[INAUDIBLE] vertically, I

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:37.260
increase the structure on
the horizontal direction.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:41.100
I'm now retreating.

00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:41.600
You see?

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.480
It comes back.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:51.110
And [INAUDIBLE] I go
beyond, and it retreats.

00:37:51.110 --> 00:37:54.080
So this is leading
us to a notion

00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:02.420
which became very important
in modern materials science--

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:05.690
the notion of auxetic behavior.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:09.230
And this diagram
will communicate

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:13.820
in the most direct terms
what this behavior means.

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:19.250
So on the left, if we have
a conventional material

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:23.840
with some elasticity--
and I invite

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:32.030
you to imagine a bar of rubber.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:39.230
If you pull it, as
the arrows indicate--

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:42.860
so if you want to stretch
it, it will stretch.

00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:47.111
And laterally, it will shrink.

00:38:47.111 --> 00:38:51.440
But this is the most
typical behavior

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:58.040
of the vast majority
of natural materials,

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:07.850
but in some instances, this
less intuitive type of behavior

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:09.670
was observed--

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:16.370
that you may pull and
stretch the material--

00:39:16.370 --> 00:39:18.260
say, vertically,
in this diagram.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:23.540
But at the same time,
laterally, instead of shrinking,

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:28.440
this type of material
expands as well.

00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:34.670
So this is the short, intuitive
definition of auxetic behavior.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:41.910
It involves lateral
widening upon stretching.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:53.890
And we have now the challenge,
if we go back to this view

00:39:53.890 --> 00:40:03.720
here, now, I indeed
increase in both directions.

00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:09.080
By the way, the word "auxetic"
comes from the Greek word which

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.140
means tendency to increase.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:18.920
So we can take with a less
precise definition than before

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:23.960
that auxeticity is
a form of growth,

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:29.480
but it cannot be excessive in
one direction and too modest

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.560
in another.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:36.650
It is a rather balanced
form of growth.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:46.250
But growth cannot be indefinite,
at least at the bounded rate.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:53.390
So its auxetic behavior
will occur for some time

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:55.610
and then stop.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:41:04.460
And in the spirit of our
search for hidden structure,

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:12.080
we asked ourselves, well, what
is the necessary geometrical

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.090
underpinning of this behavior?

00:41:15.090 --> 00:41:21.930
And we'll show the answer
for the structure at hand.

00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:31.380
So the answer is that ellipse
is responsible-- the existence

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:37.710
of that ellipse is responsible
for the auxetic behavior.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:42.690
I'll keep it for the time
a little mysterious how

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:47.940
it comes about,
because you see, if we

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:51.930
have just the quadrilateral,
the ellipse is not there.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:58.390
So this is a feature
of the periodicity.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:01.800
But there are many conics that
you can [INAUDIBLE] around,

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:07.200
because in geometry,
we learn that if we

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.460
have five points
in the plane, there

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:14.110
is always a conic through them.

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:19.680
This can be an ellipse,
a parabola, a hyperbola,

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:26.000
or it can be degenerate,
two lines, or a double line.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:37.240
And that was known at
the time of Apollonius,

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:41.650
and of course, that was
influential for Kepler later on

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:50.770
to explain the planetary motion.

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:55.120
And here we have an ellipse now.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.740
What I want you to
observe is that we

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.960
are at one type
of vertex, and we

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:06.160
look at all the edges
emanating from it.

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.140
I have these four edges.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:13.480
So with the origin and the
extreme of these four edges,

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.670
I have my five points.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:23.740
And I trace the conic
and the ellipse,

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:27.910
and that explains
the auxeticity.

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:31.930
If I move and come
to this iteration,

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:35.350
I watch the same five points.

00:43:35.350 --> 00:43:39.170
I draw the conic,
and it's a hyperbola.

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.130
So something has
changed in-between,

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:47.320
and indeed, the auxetic
behavior must have stopped

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:50.710
before getting to a hyperbola.

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:55.890
So this humble conic
is the key indicator,

00:43:55.890 --> 00:44:01.060
and we want to watch
now this transition.

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.390
I am auxetic.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:06.956
I'm expanding both
vertically and horizontally

00:44:06.956 --> 00:44:12.530
until this is now a
very elongated ellipse.

00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:17.100
And now, the ellipse has
degenerated into two lines,

00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:22.224
and this is the transition
to the hyperbola.

00:44:22.224 --> 00:44:27.340
So now, although I'm still
increasing in one direction

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.500
laterally, I'm receding.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:34.840
So this is not auxetic anymore.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:42.040
So we see that the finite
situation, the pseudo-triangles

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:45.460
for finite linkages,
reappear here

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:49.270
because both the
initial quadrilateral

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:56.280
and its doppelganger are in
the auxetic configuration

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.680
pseudo-triangles.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.070
But now, if we have
a tiling like that

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:07.520
with a periodicity
and pseudo-triangles,

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.110
then we actually always
have one degree of freedom.

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:16.000
And as long as the
pseudo-triangles remain,

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.630
the pseudo-triangles
will expand.

00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:22.720
When some alignment
occurs and we

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:33.160
lose that pseudo-triangle
property, things may change.

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.060
Now, to approach
our conclusion, I

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:41.350
would say that the
theory is not restricted

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:43.570
to dimension two,
which was chosen

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:47.830
for the simplicity
of the illustrations.

00:45:47.830 --> 00:45:52.090
It's actually valid in
arbitrary dimension.

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:59.980
And the fact that we could find
this hidden structure related

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:06.400
to conics, or in [INAUDIBLE]
dimension, ellipsoids--

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:12.250
is that we approach the
matter with a purely geometric

00:46:12.250 --> 00:46:17.270
definition of auxeticity.

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:19.300
So this is the definition.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:24.790
I admit, it has a
more technical flavor,

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:28.130
but in essence, it
says the following.

00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:30.430
I have a periodic structure.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:34.480
Well, what is most important
for a periodic structure?

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.520
Its periodicity.

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:41.410
How can I express
it in finite terms?

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:45.450
I take just the
generating translations.

00:46:45.450 --> 00:46:49.960
So that's a bundle of
vectors, exactly as many

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:51.920
as the dimension.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:54.610
Now I codify them
in a matrix, which

00:46:54.610 --> 00:47:00.460
is called a gram matrix,
from a Danish mathematician

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.060
of the 19th century
by the name of Gram.

00:47:04.060 --> 00:47:12.900
So that makes the idea that
the Gram matrix is just telling

00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:16.660
me what happens to the periods.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:21.150
And as a single entity,
it traces a curve

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:26.040
in the space of
symmetric matrices.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:31.140
But this space is not
like any space of matrices

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:33.870
because of symmetry.

00:47:33.870 --> 00:47:39.480
We have there a notion
of positive definiteness.

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.630
So in short, the space
of symmetric matrices

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:46.330
is not bland.

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:47.780
It has more structure.

00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:53.670
It has this cone of positive
semi-definite matrices.

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:57.640
And this is immediately
inviting the analogy

00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:02.130
with a Minkowski space
in special relativity,

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:07.110
where we have a cone of light.

00:48:07.110 --> 00:48:12.740
And this matching is literal
if we are in dimension two

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:18.380
because two-by-two matrices
make a Minkowski space.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:21.070
But in higher
dimension, this cone,

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:26.040
which is depicted here
like a Minkowski cone,

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:31.080
is actually more complicated
because higher dimensional,

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:35.120
semi-definite cones have
a more complex structure.

00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:42.740
But it is very well
studied mathematically,

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:47.370
and it's implicated in many
branches of mathematics.

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:54.440
So it's not an
exotic object at all.

00:48:54.440 --> 00:49:04.870
So this says we can
engage auxeticity

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.360
in arbitrary dimension.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:10.720
We are not tied
to the dimensions

00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:14.560
of experience two and three.

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:21.160
For materials, we can
fancy auxetic behavior

00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:25.600
in arbitrary dimension
because the geometry

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.760
works just the same.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:36.590
So here, I want to summarize
with another drawing what

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:39.170
the result is.

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:44.480
So I need the
initial illustration.

00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:47.780
If you'll recall, I
had an illustration

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:52.250
with red, green,
and blue vertices.

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:54.400
That is the pattern here.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:59.470
It's, by the way, usually
called a [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:05.630
periodic structure because
of a Japanese pattern

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:09.930
of weaving or basket-making.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:16.940
And here, I retained
only the essentials.

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:21.830
So you see some of the red
vertices, some of the green,

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:25.730
some of the blue.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:29.480
And the key to understanding
the structure--

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:35.570
you choose one vertex
in one color or width,

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:40.610
and you look at another
or, say, the green.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:45.410
So I have this point
connected to two green points.

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:47.590
They are just three points.

00:50:47.590 --> 00:50:54.630
Now, through three points, I
have a two-dimensional family

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.310
of conics--

00:50:56.310 --> 00:50:58.770
in particular, ellipses.

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:03.260
So that this is
not telling me what

00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.820
ellipse should I draw there.

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:12.240
But I know that if
auxetic, I need an ellipse.

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.680
If I move now to a green, I
will need an ellipse through

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.605
the green, and it's--

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:24.130
no.

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:28.250
So if I move to a green vertex,
I need an ellipse through this,

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:32.770
and it's connected blues.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:38.170
And if I move to a blue,
I need an ellipse so

00:51:38.170 --> 00:51:41.230
its connected reds.

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:42.580
So I will need three ellipses.

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:50.030
They must be now--

00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:52.460
ready for a mathematical term?

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:53.660
Homothetic.

00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:56.570
They must be
homothetic ellipses.

00:51:56.570 --> 00:52:02.630
This frightful word means
something very simple.

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:08.330
I can only take an
ellipse, and I'm allowed

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:12.760
to translate it and rescale it.

00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:20.490
That's homothety--
translation and dilation.

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:21.100
That's it.

00:52:21.100 --> 00:52:23.790
Now it's not frightening at all.

00:52:23.790 --> 00:52:31.620
In particular, you will have the
same orientation of the axis.

00:52:31.620 --> 00:52:36.450
Well, my three ellipses
are conditioned

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:45.940
by being in this
brotherhood or sisterhood

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:48.940
of being in a homothetic family.

00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:55.990
And moreover, this
detail of the diagram

00:52:55.990 --> 00:53:00.610
says that if I go from
my vertex of origin

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:06.700
to the center of the ellipse in
the three homothetic ellipses,

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:11.880
I satisfy a cycle condition.

00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.390
Those vectors add up to zero.

00:53:15.390 --> 00:53:20.610
So these conditions,
in fact, are precisely

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:25.720
those imposing the
unique solution.

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:35.790
So with this explanation,
you see that ellipses there

00:53:35.790 --> 00:53:40.480
are uniquely
determined, in fact,

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:46.840
but they would be totally
invisible, totally hidden,

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:54.370
if you don't have this
disclosing theory behind.

00:53:54.370 --> 00:54:00.070
And you'll have a
slide with formula.

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:03.380
Here it is.

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:10.670
But generally, if you
distill the matter,

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:15.730
it can be expressed
in these two lines.

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:16.970
So what do we know?

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:21.130
We know that the bars must
preserve their length.

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:25.810
There's the question expressing
it, but in lattice coordinates.

00:54:25.810 --> 00:54:28.880
So since periodicity
is so important,

00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:32.430
it gives me a
system of reference,

00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:35.850
and I use coordinates in
that system of reference,

00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:42.670
not necessarily the fixed
Cartesian background.

00:54:42.670 --> 00:54:49.810
But I can differentiate in
any system of coordinates,

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:53.180
and that's the
infinitesimal equation.

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:58.510
Now, our geometric
definition of auxeticity

00:54:58.510 --> 00:55:03.390
says that this
tangent, this omega

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:10.620
is that Gram matrix I tried to
make friendly a little earlier.

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:15.900
So this says the tangent to the
trajectory of the Gram matrix

00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.640
is positive definite.

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.920
And then, to a
geometer, that equation

00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:27.240
immediately says,
oh, we have a bundle

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:31.703
of homothetic ellipsoids.

00:55:31.703 --> 00:55:41.050
So that's a geometrical
explanation of auxetic motions,

00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:52.170
and I will conclude with a
little animation of motion

00:55:52.170 --> 00:55:58.680
in this very common
crystal, quartz.

00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:04.350
It's silicon dioxide,
and in this diagram,

00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:08.190
what we see is just
the tetrahedra formed

00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:12.130
by oxygen atoms.

00:56:12.130 --> 00:56:18.000
So the [INAUDIBLE] is roughly
at the center of the tetrahedra.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.410
But for the purpose of
motion, the chief element

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:28.210
is that these tetrahedra are,
for a good approximation,

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:29.470
remaining rigid.

00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:36.130
So we have a
bar-and-joint structure,

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:45.400
and there is a flotilla
of ellipsoids, which

00:56:45.400 --> 00:56:48.550
will explain the motion we see.

00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:53.170
But it's quite
numerous, so it would

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:57.730
be difficult to portray
all these zeppelins

00:56:57.730 --> 00:57:10.760
in the diagram, so the motion
is now contracting now,

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.712
genuine auxetic.

00:57:12.712 --> 00:57:18.960
And this is something
that happens

00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:23.730
in the so-called alpha to beta
phase transition in quartz.

00:57:23.730 --> 00:57:35.420
If you heat quartz, it goes
from a less symmetric structure

00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:41.400
to a higher symmetry at a
certain high temperature.

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:50.780
And this is the back
and forth of the story

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.280
of quartz and that transition.

00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:53.860
Thank you.

00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:55.060
