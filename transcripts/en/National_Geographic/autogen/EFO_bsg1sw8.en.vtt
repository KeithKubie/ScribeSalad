00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.970
- [Narrator] Like fireflies
on a still summer night,

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.003
they gently dot and illuminate
the infinite velveteen sky.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.083
Stars.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.200
Be they millions or billions of years old,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.072
are all born in nebuli, clouds of dust

00:00:20.072 --> 00:00:22.483
and mostly hydrogen gas.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.330
Within these stellar nurseries,

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.875
stars begin life as protostars

00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:30.400
or hot cores formed by the collection

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.673
and collapse of dust and gas.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.800
As the protostars become hotter,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.048
hydrogen nuclei inside of
the cores begin to fuse

00:00:39.048 --> 00:00:41.270
and create helium.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.060
It is this chemical reaction,
thermonuclear fusion

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.670
that generates a star's heat and energy

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.443
and causes it to shine.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.260
Stars are categorized

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.410
by a number of characteristics.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.491
One of these classifications
is by surface temperature

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:59.930
called spectral classes.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.840
These seven major groups range

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.270
from the coolest stars
which are designated

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.030
as M and up to the hottest stars

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.823
which are designated as O.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.840
Stars are also classified by the amount

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.570
of light they emit or luminosity.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.710
Called luminosity classes,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.530
these nine major groups range

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.608
from the small, less bright white dwarfs

00:01:21.608 --> 00:01:25.213
to the large and extremely
bright hypergiants.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.280
But no matter their luminosity
or surface temperature,

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.330
all stars eventually burn
through their hydrogen fuel

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.779
and die out.

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:37.420
Less massive stars

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.570
such as our sun release their
stellar material into space

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.020
leaving behind a white dwarf surrounded

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.653
by a planetary nebula.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.580
More massive stars instead blast matter

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.340
into space in a bright supernova

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.620
leaving behind an extremely dense body

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.333
called a neutron star.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.043
But the most massive stars,

00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:03.320
stars that are at least
three times our sun's mass

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.830
collapse into themselves

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.133
and create a bottomless well
of gravity, a black hole.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.380
But from the remnants of stars,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.560
heavier elements are
cast into the universe

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.330
and it is this star dust

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.853
that form the seedlings of life itself.

00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:27.872
