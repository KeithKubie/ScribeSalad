00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.980
In the human population for the ABO gene,

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.570
at position 258, if you have a deletion

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.820
right there, then you actually have blood type

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.960
O. And the reason you have blood type O

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.630
is because you end up with a, a

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.020
deletion that causes a premature stop codon, because

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.500
we end up with this huge frame shift

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.380
in the letters. For the rest of the sequence.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.750
Remember this happened very early right, in the coding region. We're

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.259
only at position 250 to 270. We go all the way

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.810
out to like a thousand in this gene. So at this

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.260
very early position, we've got a stop code on, so we're

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.160
going to end up with a much shorter protein overall. So take

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.850
a minute and think. What do you think is the result

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.050
of the protein's overall function. If you have a much shorter

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.850
version of the protein. Think about it for a second and

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.850
then put your answer in this text box here.
