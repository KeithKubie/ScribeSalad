00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:10.569
experience remember the base module is
 

00:13:10.569 --> 00:13:12.809
experience remember the base module is
always loaded and so the details feature

00:13:12.809 --> 00:13:12.819
always loaded and so the details feature
 

00:13:12.819 --> 00:13:14.610
always loaded and so the details feature
module only needs to have the additional

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:14.620
module only needs to have the additional
 

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:19.170

so now let's just set up URL and three

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600
so now let's just set up URL and three
 

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.019
so now let's just set up URL and three
points for our app this is done by

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:37.029
points for our app this is done by
 

00:14:37.029 --> 00:14:40.639
points for our app this is done by
adding intent filters to your manifest

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:40.649
adding intent filters to your manifest
 

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:43.110
adding intent filters to your manifest
to help us with the process we're going

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120
to help us with the process we're going
 

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.509
to help us with the process we're going
to use the Android app links assistant

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:45.519
to use the Android app links assistant
 

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:51.210
to use the Android app links assistant
to and there it opens has a panel on the

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:51.220
to and there it opens has a panel on the
 

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:52.530
to and there it opens has a panel on the
right and will guide us through the

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:52.540
right and will guide us through the
 

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.799
right and will guide us through the
process of creating our entry points the

00:14:55.799 --> 00:14:55.809
process of creating our entry points the
 

00:14:55.809 --> 00:14:58.619
process of creating our entry points the
first thing we want to do is map some

00:14:58.619 --> 00:14:58.629
first thing we want to do is map some
 

00:14:58.629 --> 00:15:02.669
first thing we want to do is map some
URLs to our activities so let's set up

00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:02.679
URLs to our activities so let's set up
 

00:15:02.679 --> 00:15:05.480
URLs to our activities so let's set up
some mappings

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:05.490
some mappings
 

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:08.600
some mappings
so I'm going to use Banjara opcom as my

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:08.610
so I'm going to use Banjara opcom as my
 

00:15:08.610 --> 00:15:13.369
so I'm going to use Banjara opcom as my
host and then set up main part for my

00:15:13.369 --> 00:15:13.379
host and then set up main part for my
 

00:15:13.379 --> 00:15:17.230
host and then set up main part for my
attractions list activity

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240
 

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:26.150
I'll repeat the step for HTTP all right

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:26.160
I'll repeat the step for HTTP all right
 

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.369
I'll repeat the step for HTTP all right
now that we have the main part set up we

00:15:28.369 --> 00:15:28.379
now that we have the main part set up we
 

00:15:28.379 --> 00:15:30.590
now that we have the main part set up we
also will now set up the part for our

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600
also will now set up the part for our
 

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:36.249
also will now set up the part for our
details activity again the same host and

00:15:36.249 --> 00:15:36.259
details activity again the same host and
 

00:15:36.259 --> 00:15:39.799
details activity again the same host and
use details and choose details activity

00:15:39.799 --> 00:15:39.809
use details and choose details activity
 

00:15:39.809 --> 00:15:43.369
use details and choose details activity
from the drop down box and then again

00:15:43.369 --> 00:15:43.379
from the drop down box and then again
 

00:15:43.379 --> 00:15:52.780
from the drop down box and then again
repeat the same step for HTTP

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:52.790
 

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.240
and there we have our mapping set now

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:55.250
and there we have our mapping set now
 

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.370
and there we have our mapping set now
there's a preview window here which

00:15:57.370 --> 00:15:57.380
there's a preview window here which
 

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:59.110
there's a preview window here which
shows you your manifest and the changes

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120
shows you your manifest and the changes
 

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.420
shows you your manifest and the changes
that we just did using the mapping

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:01.430
that we just did using the mapping
 

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:05.830
that we just did using the mapping
editor alright so the next step is then

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:05.840
editor alright so the next step is then
 

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.110
editor alright so the next step is then
to add logic to handle our intent this

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120
to add logic to handle our intent this
 

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:09.520
to add logic to handle our intent this
is already done because we're using

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:09.530
is already done because we're using
 

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:14.500
is already done because we're using
existing code the next step is to create

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:14.510
existing code the next step is to create
 

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.900
existing code the next step is to create
a digital access link file and then

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:16.910
a digital access link file and then
 

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.760
a digital access link file and then
associate our website with our app

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:18.770
associate our website with our app
 

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:21.190

ok so we're done with step 1 and we now

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:14.750
ok so we're done with step 1 and we now
 

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:17.350
ok so we're done with step 1 and we now
have few experiences with another app

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360
have few experiences with another app

discoverable through your logs let's

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:19.820
discoverable through your logs let's
 

00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:22.569
discoverable through your logs let's
move on to step 2 we'll now take our

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:22.579
move on to step 2 we'll now take our
 

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.329
move on to step 2 we'll now take our
existing application module and then put

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:25.339
existing application module and then put
 

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.699
existing application module and then put
it in a base feature module we'd have to

00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:27.709
it in a base feature module we'd have to
 

00:17:27.709 --> 00:17:30.630
it in a base feature module we'd have to
rename our application to be a feature

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640
rename our application to be a feature
 

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.280
rename our application to be a feature
will also change the Gradle file should

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:33.290
will also change the Gradle file should
 

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:35.830
will also change the Gradle file should
not be com Android from that Android

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840
not be com Android from that Android
 

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.510
not be com Android from that Android
application and make it Condor Android

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520
application and make it Condor Android
 

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.210
application and make it Condor Android
feature now since all the code will be

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:40.220
feature now since all the code will be
 

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.800
feature now since all the code will be
within the feature module we can now

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:41.810
within the feature module we can now
 

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:44.380
within the feature module we can now
introduce an application module and an

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:44.390
introduce an application module and an
 

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.720
introduce an application module and an
infinite module to build off the same

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:46.730
infinite module to build off the same
 

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:48.910
infinite module to build off the same
feature module each of them don't need

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:48.920
feature module each of them don't need
 

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.620
feature module each of them don't need
any cost because they'll be building off

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:50.630
any cost because they'll be building off
 

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:54.660
any cost because they'll be building off
the existing module let's try that sure

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:54.670
the existing module let's try that sure
 

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:56.820
the existing module let's try that sure
since you can see on the left side my

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:56.830
since you can see on the left side my

the Banjara - pace and this is an

00:18:01.410 --> 00:18:01.420
the Banjara - pace and this is an
 

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.710
the Banjara - pace and this is an
application module so what we are not

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720
application module so what we are not
 

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.540
application module so what we are not
trying to do is convert this into a

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:06.550
trying to do is convert this into a
 

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.250
trying to do is convert this into a
feature module so all our code and

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:08.260
feature module so all our code and
 

00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:10.410
feature module so all our code and
resources are in this feature and then

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:10.420
resources are in this feature and then
 

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.630
resources are in this feature and then
create two new top-level modules

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640
create two new top-level modules
 

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.030
create two new top-level modules
an application module and an instant add

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:15.040
an application module and an instant add
 

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.920
an application module and an instant add
module and then we'll include the

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:16.930
module and then we'll include the
 

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:19.350
module and then we'll include the
feature as a dependency from those

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360
feature as a dependency from those
 

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.760
feature as a dependency from those
modules so I have my bill Gradle file

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:57.250
 

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.730
all right now that we have our base

00:18:59.730 --> 00:18:59.740
all right now that we have our base
 

00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.130
all right now that we have our base
module we'll create let's first create

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:02.140
module we'll create let's first create
 

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.590
module we'll create let's first create
the application module so I'll select

00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600
the application module so I'll select
 

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:13.260
the application module so I'll select
new module choose phone and tablet and

00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:13.270
new module choose phone and tablet and
 

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:21.020
new module choose phone and tablet and
let's call this Banjara app

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:21.030
 

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:22.880
just going to choose a package name

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:22.890
just going to choose a package name
 

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.910
just going to choose a package name
that's consistent with my other modules

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:27.920
 

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.540
and I'll select add no activity because

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:32.550
and I'll select add no activity because
 

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:34.850
and I'll select add no activity because
for now all our activities and all our

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860
for now all our activities and all our
 

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:45.360
for now all our activities and all our
code is in the feature module

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:45.370
 

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:52.050
alright the module is now created I'll

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:52.060
alright the module is now created I'll
 

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:54.110
alright the module is now created I'll
remove the test sources and resources

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.120
remove the test sources and resources
 

00:19:54.120 --> 00:20:02.070
remove the test sources and resources
for now

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080
 

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.710
and then in my application manifest file

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720
and then in my application manifest file
 

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.110
and then in my application manifest file
I'll remove the application tag because

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120
I'll remove the application tag because
 

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.669
I'll remove the application tag because
this is going to get merged from our

00:20:08.669 --> 00:20:08.679
this is going to get merged from our
 

00:20:08.679 --> 00:20:16.029
this is going to get merged from our
future module

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:16.039
 

00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:17.990
all right

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000
all right
 

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.810
all right
so now let's look at the Gradle file for

00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820
so now let's look at the Gradle file for
 

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.390
so now let's look at the Gradle file for
our newly created application volume the

00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400
our newly created application volume the
 

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.670
our newly created application volume the
first thing I will do is use the same

00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:25.680
first thing I will do is use the same
 

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.640
first thing I will do is use the same
compiled SDK and built origin that I'm

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:28.650
compiled SDK and built origin that I'm
 

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:36.810
compiled SDK and built origin that I'm
using in my future module

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:36.820
 

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:40.249
then remove the test dependencies and

00:20:40.249 --> 00:20:40.259
then remove the test dependencies and
 

00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:43.350
then remove the test dependencies and
now we want to include our future module

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360
now we want to include our future module
 

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:55.700
now we want to include our future module
in our application module

00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:55.710
 

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:57.740
so right now we have the feature model

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:57.750
so right now we have the feature model
 

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.750
so right now we have the feature model
included there's one final thing we need

00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760
included there's one final thing we need
 

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:02.390
included there's one final thing we need
to do so let's head over to our base

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400
to do so let's head over to our base
 

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.250
to do so let's head over to our base
bill Gradle file again now the base and

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:07.260
bill Gradle file again now the base and
 

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.290
bill Gradle file again now the base and
the base module is a very important

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:09.300
the base module is a very important
 

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.330
the base module is a very important
module the Gradle build tools look into

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:11.340
module the Gradle build tools look into
 

00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:13.280
module the Gradle build tools look into
the base module to figure out all the

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:13.290
the base module to figure out all the
 

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.170
the base module to figure out all the
features and the application in your

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:15.180
features and the application in your
 

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.090
features and the application in your
project so we need to make our base

00:21:17.090 --> 00:21:17.100
project so we need to make our base
 

00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.100
project so we need to make our base
module aware of our application module

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:19.110
module aware of our application module
 

00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:21.020
module aware of our application module
this will help with the manifest merging

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:21.030
this will help with the manifest merging
 

00:21:21.030 --> 00:21:22.640
this will help with the manifest merging
process and we'll pull up the

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:22.650
process and we'll pull up the
 

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:25.840
process and we'll pull up the
application ID to package the instead of

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:25.850
application ID to package the instead of
 

00:21:25.850 --> 00:21:28.730
application ID to package the instead of
so this is done by using the application

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740
so this is done by using the application
 

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:43.600
so this is done by using the application
configuration

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:43.610
 

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:50.230
all right this is think now

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240
 

00:21:50.240 --> 00:22:03.950
let's try to compile

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960
 

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.850
I already have an emulator running and

00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:06.860
I already have an emulator running and
 

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:17.900
I already have an emulator running and
let's see we got a little error here

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:17.910
 

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:40.710
I'll clean the project

00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720
 

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:43.590
all right the build is not successful so

00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600
all right the build is not successful so
 

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.060
all right the build is not successful so
I have a emulator here running n so

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.070
I have a emulator here running n so
 

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:50.460
I have a emulator here running n so
let's try to run our app which is now

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:50.470
let's try to run our app which is now
 

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.580
let's try to run our app which is now
using a feature module which produces a

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:53.590
using a feature module which produces a
 

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:56.580
using a feature module which produces a
feature apk of new produces of library

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:56.590
feature apk of new produces of library
 

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:02.490
feature apk of new produces of library
file for our app so I'll select the app

00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:02.500
file for our app so I'll select the app
 

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:20.799
file for our app so I'll select the app
configuration and then one

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:20.809
 

00:23:20.809 --> 00:23:23.529
there our app is now running it uses

00:23:23.529 --> 00:23:23.539
there our app is now running it uses
 

00:23:23.539 --> 00:23:25.259
there our app is now running it uses
runtime permissions for location and

00:23:25.259 --> 00:23:25.269
runtime permissions for location and
 

00:23:25.269 --> 00:23:28.749
runtime permissions for location and
this is our list activity for a list of

00:23:28.749 --> 00:23:28.759
this is our list activity for a list of
 

00:23:28.759 --> 00:23:33.430
this is our list activity for a list of
attractions or bring up one of the

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440
attractions or bring up one of the
 

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.840
attractions or bring up one of the
details for one of the attractions here

00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:36.850
details for one of the attractions here
 

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.730
details for one of the attractions here
right so now this is an installed app

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:39.740
right so now this is an installed app
 

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:41.440
right so now this is an installed app
because we use convert and by dot

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:41.450
because we use convert and by dot
 

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:45.930
because we use convert and by dot
application so I'll uninstall this app

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:45.940
application so I'll uninstall this app
 

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:55.710
application so I'll uninstall this app
and will now build an incident

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720
 

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.320
so to do that I will create a new module

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:58.330
so to do that I will create a new module
 

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:05.669
so to do that I will create a new module
and choose Internet let's call this

00:24:05.669 --> 00:24:05.679
and choose Internet let's call this
 

00:24:05.679 --> 00:24:14.560
and choose Internet let's call this
Banjara - Internet

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:14.570
 

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.020
the body was created as you can see on

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:17.030
the body was created as you can see on
 

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:19.240
the body was created as you can see on
the left from the project structure this

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:19.250
the left from the project structure this
 

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.370
the left from the project structure this
is a very lightweight module there is no

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:21.380
is a very lightweight module there is no
 

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.110
is a very lightweight module there is no
source there are there is not there are

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120
source there are there is not there are
 

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.910
source there are there is not there are
no resources it just has a build up data

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:24.920
no resources it just has a build up data
 

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.070
no resources it just has a build up data
file and it's going to build just a

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:27.080
file and it's going to build just a
 

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:32.070
file and it's going to build just a
container zip for our feature etiquette

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080
 

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.260
so using the same compiled and build

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:35.270
so using the same compiled and build
 

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:39.580
so using the same compiled and build
tools as version and now just as we did

00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:39.590
tools as version and now just as we did
 

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.070
tools as version and now just as we did
for our application module I will

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080
for our application module I will
 

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:43.510
for our application module I will
include the feature module as a

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520
include the feature module as a
 

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:57.890
include the feature module as a
dependency

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:57.900
 

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:01.910
right now let's try to build our instant

00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:01.920
right now let's try to build our instant
 

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:15.549
right now let's try to build our instant
app

00:25:15.549 --> 00:25:15.559
 

00:25:15.559 --> 00:25:17.619
all right the compliation is successful

00:25:17.619 --> 00:25:17.629
all right the compliation is successful
 

00:25:17.629 --> 00:25:20.470
all right the compliation is successful
now before we run this app let's take a

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480
now before we run this app let's take a
 

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.119
now before we run this app let's take a
look at our run configuration for the

00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:22.129
look at our run configuration for the
 

00:25:22.129 --> 00:25:29.830
look at our run configuration for the
instant app I have it here as you can

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840
instant app I have it here as you can
 

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.230
instant app I have it here as you can
see in the launch options here instead

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240
see in the launch options here instead
 

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.389
see in the launch options here instead
of using an activity this is now using a

00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:34.399
of using an activity this is now using a
 

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:38.980
of using an activity this is now using a
URL so let's switch it to the main which

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:38.990
URL so let's switch it to the main which
 

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:46.029
URL so let's switch it to the main which
maps to our list of attractions apply ok

00:25:46.029 --> 00:25:46.039
maps to our list of attractions apply ok
 

00:25:46.039 --> 00:25:48.700
maps to our list of attractions apply ok
and now in the let's run our first

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:48.710
and now in the let's run our first
 

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:59.700
and now in the let's run our first
incident

00:25:59.700 --> 00:25:59.710
 

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.580
so this may take some time for the first

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:02.590
so this may take some time for the first
 

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.500
so this may take some time for the first
time when you try to run this because

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:04.510
time when you try to run this because
 

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:06.270
time when you try to run this because
it's not setting up our device or

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:06.280
it's not setting up our device or
 

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.640
it's not setting up our device or
setting up our emulator for running in

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:08.650
setting up our emulator for running in
 

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:13.500
setting up our emulator for running in
synapse now in sign app is running it

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:13.510
synapse now in sign app is running it
 

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.120
synapse now in sign app is running it
uses the same runtime permission model

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:15.130
uses the same runtime permission model
 

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.920
uses the same runtime permission model
we didn't make any changes to the code

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:16.930
we didn't make any changes to the code
 

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:20.400
we didn't make any changes to the code
yet we have a list of attractions and

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:20.410
yet we have a list of attractions and
 

00:26:20.410 --> 00:26:24.360
yet we have a list of attractions and
then I bring up an attraction from the

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:24.370
then I bring up an attraction from the
 

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:28.260
then I bring up an attraction from the
details activity so before I give it

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:28.270
details activity so before I give it
 

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:35.790
details activity so before I give it
back to write thank you

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:35.800
 

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.560
before I hand it over back to shobhna

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:37.570
before I hand it over back to shobhna
 

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:39.390
before I hand it over back to shobhna
let's quickly look at our build artifact

00:26:39.390 --> 00:26:39.400
let's quickly look at our build artifact
 

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.770
let's quickly look at our build artifact
from the instant app project so here as

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:43.780
from the instant app project so here as
 

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:46.200
from the instant app project so here as
you can see this is a zip file I'm going

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:46.210
you can see this is a zip file I'm going
 

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:48.360
you can see this is a zip file I'm going
to use the apk analyzer to inspect the

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:48.370
to use the apk analyzer to inspect the
 

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:51.480
to use the apk analyzer to inspect the
zip file and the zip file you can see I

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:51.490
zip file and the zip file you can see I
 

00:26:51.490 --> 00:26:55.760
zip file and the zip file you can see I
have one feature apk it's our base apk I

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:55.770
have one feature apk it's our base apk I
 

00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.500
have one feature apk it's our base apk I
can look down and then drill down and

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:58.510
can look down and then drill down and
 

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:00.690
can look down and then drill down and
look at my resource usage using the apk

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:00.700
look at my resource usage using the apk
 

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:05.190
look at my resource usage using the apk
analyzer right like the issue great so

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200
analyzer right like the issue great so
 

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.250
analyzer right like the issue great so
we have our first functional infinite

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260
we have our first functional infinite
 

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:11.940
we have our first functional infinite
ten-minute so now let's move on to step

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:11.950
ten-minute so now let's move on to step
 

00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:15.360
ten-minute so now let's move on to step
3 we're going to extract out the details

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:15.370
3 we're going to extract out the details
 

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:18.200
3 we're going to extract out the details
experience into its own feature module

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:18.210
experience into its own feature module
 

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:20.790
experience into its own feature module
we're doing this by introducing a new

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:20.800
we're doing this by introducing a new
 

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.770
we're doing this by introducing a new
feature module and just refactoring code

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:22.780
feature module and just refactoring code
 

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.440
feature module and just refactoring code
our existing base module into that

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:25.450
our existing base module into that
 

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:27.450
our existing base module into that
feature module well then have to update

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:27.460
feature module well then have to update
 

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.520
feature module well then have to update
the application module and the internal

00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:29.530
the application module and the internal
 

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.530
the application module and the internal
modules will now go from to feature

00:27:31.530 --> 00:27:31.540
modules will now go from to feature
 

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:34.860
modules will now go from to feature
module so and it'll can show us how to

00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:34.870
module so and it'll can show us how to
 

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:43.419
module so and it'll can show us how to
do that

00:27:43.419 --> 00:27:43.429
 

00:27:43.429 --> 00:27:45.519
okay let's review our project structure

00:27:45.519 --> 00:27:45.529
okay let's review our project structure
 

00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:47.769
okay let's review our project structure
right now we have three modules which is

00:27:47.769 --> 00:27:47.779
right now we have three modules which is
 

00:27:47.779 --> 00:27:49.930
right now we have three modules which is
one is a feature module Banjara base and

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:49.940
one is a feature module Banjara base and
 

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:52.060
one is a feature module Banjara base and
then one application module and an

00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:52.070
then one application module and an
 

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:54.129
then one application module and an
internet module to wrap the feature

00:27:54.129 --> 00:27:54.139
internet module to wrap the feature
 

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:56.859
internet module to wrap the feature
module so let's create a new feature

00:27:56.859 --> 00:27:56.869
module so let's create a new feature
 

00:27:56.869 --> 00:28:00.219
module so let's create a new feature
module and refactor some code from our

00:28:00.219 --> 00:28:00.229
module and refactor some code from our
 

00:28:00.229 --> 00:28:05.349
module and refactor some code from our
base module so now use the new feature

00:28:05.349 --> 00:28:05.359
base module so now use the new feature
 

00:28:05.359 --> 00:28:10.329
base module so now use the new feature
module template and call this Banjara

00:28:10.329 --> 00:28:10.339
module template and call this Banjara
 

00:28:10.339 --> 00:28:17.380
module template and call this Banjara
details

00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:17.390
 

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.539
following the same project structure and

00:28:19.539 --> 00:28:19.549
following the same project structure and
 

00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:21.130
following the same project structure and
the package naming scheme

00:28:21.130 --> 00:28:21.140
the package naming scheme
 

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.000
the package naming scheme
now remember future modules are built

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.010
now remember future modules are built
 

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:27.039
now remember future modules are built
just like libraries so they need to have

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:27.049
just like libraries so they need to have
 

00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:29.380
just like libraries so they need to have
a different package name cannot be the

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:29.390
a different package name cannot be the
 

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:36.640
a different package name cannot be the
same as your application type again no

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:36.650
same as your application type again no
 

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.799
same as your application type again no
activity to add the refactor existing

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:38.809
activity to add the refactor existing
 

00:28:38.809 --> 00:28:47.670
activity to add the refactor existing
activities

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:47.680
 

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:49.680
all right our details module is now

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:49.690
all right our details module is now
 

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:53.300
all right our details module is now
ready let's look at the bill Gradle file

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:53.310
ready let's look at the bill Gradle file
 

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:56.130
ready let's look at the bill Gradle file
so it automatically applied the plug-in

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:56.140
so it automatically applied the plug-in
 

00:28:56.140 --> 00:29:00.240
so it automatically applied the plug-in
convert and write that feature let's

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:00.250
convert and write that feature let's
 

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:16.440
convert and write that feature let's
switch to the build tools alright

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:16.450
 

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:19.169
now when we created this module Android

00:29:19.169 --> 00:29:19.179
now when we created this module Android
 

00:29:19.179 --> 00:29:22.440
now when we created this module Android
studio automatically added a dependency

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:22.450
studio automatically added a dependency
 

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.639
studio automatically added a dependency
to save a dependencies to Banjara base

00:29:25.639 --> 00:29:25.649
to save a dependencies to Banjara base
 

00:29:25.649 --> 00:29:27.840
to save a dependencies to Banjara base
remember what we said about Mario's

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:27.850
remember what we said about Mario's
 

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:30.419
remember what we said about Mario's
there the base module is all the feature

00:29:30.419 --> 00:29:30.429
there the base module is all the feature
 

00:29:30.429 --> 00:29:32.220
there the base module is all the feature
modules are organized around a single

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:32.230
modules are organized around a single
 

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.409
modules are organized around a single
base module and they need to extend the

00:29:34.409 --> 00:29:34.419
base module and they need to extend the
 

00:29:34.419 --> 00:29:36.840
base module and they need to extend the
base module so because you already have

00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:36.850
base module so because you already have
 

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:39.029
base module so because you already have
a base module studio automatically

00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039
a base module studio automatically
 

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:40.859
a base module studio automatically
applied the dependency to our base

00:29:40.859 --> 00:29:40.869
applied the dependency to our base
 

00:29:40.869 --> 00:29:46.700
applied the dependency to our base
module and let's take a look at our

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:46.710
module and let's take a look at our
 

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:49.229
module and let's take a look at our
Gradle file for our base module

00:29:49.229 --> 00:29:49.239
Gradle file for our base module
 

00:29:49.239 --> 00:29:50.999
Gradle file for our base module
now you remember we added the

00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:51.009
now you remember we added the
 

00:29:51.009 --> 00:29:52.889
now you remember we added the
application configuration here to tell

00:29:52.889 --> 00:29:52.899
application configuration here to tell
 

00:29:52.899 --> 00:29:55.680
application configuration here to tell
our base module about our app so it

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:55.690
our base module about our app so it
 

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.789
our base module about our app so it
needs to pull down the package ID when

00:29:59.789 --> 00:29:59.799
needs to pull down the package ID when
 

00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:01.409
needs to pull down the package ID when
we created the new details module

00:30:01.409 --> 00:30:01.419
we created the new details module
 

00:30:01.419 --> 00:30:03.749
we created the new details module
Android studio also added a feature

00:30:03.749 --> 00:30:03.759
Android studio also added a feature
 

00:30:03.759 --> 00:30:05.879
Android studio also added a feature
configuration which tells our base

00:30:05.879 --> 00:30:05.889
configuration which tells our base
 

00:30:05.889 --> 00:30:08.070
configuration which tells our base
module about the other feature modules

00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080
module about the other feature modules
 

00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.930
module about the other feature modules
in our project structure this is very

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:09.940
in our project structure this is very
 

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.029
in our project structure this is very
important for manifest merging and the

00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039
important for manifest merging and the
 

00:30:12.039 --> 00:30:18.010
important for manifest merging and the
build process

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:18.020
 

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:21.310
right so now we have two feature modules

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320
right so now we have two feature modules
 

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.410
right so now we have two feature modules
created but we need to go back to our

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:23.420
created but we need to go back to our
 

00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:25.660
created but we need to go back to our
application and instant app and include

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:25.670
application and instant app and include
 

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:35.390
application and instant app and include
the new details module in the bill

00:30:35.390 --> 00:30:35.400
 

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.660
I'm in my application right now I'll add

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:38.670
I'm in my application right now I'll add
 

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:43.850
I'm in my application right now I'll add
the details Mario here and then the same

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860
the details Mario here and then the same
 

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:57.450
the details Mario here and then the same
for my insta nap

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:57.460
 

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:00.240
alright now that all the dependencies

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:00.250
alright now that all the dependencies
 

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:02.070
alright now that all the dependencies
have been set up let's actually refactor

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080
have been set up let's actually refactor
 

00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:14.420
have been set up let's actually refactor
some code into the details module

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:14.430
 

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:17.210
so before we begin I'll create a package

00:31:17.210 --> 00:31:17.220
so before we begin I'll create a package
 

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:31.310
so before we begin I'll create a package
where I need to place the new classes

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320
 

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.620
I'll use the package name UI this is

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:33.630
I'll use the package name UI this is
 

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:39.370
I'll use the package name UI this is
where our classes are in the base module

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:39.380
 

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.920
okay I'm going to remove the patch

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:42.930
okay I'm going to remove the patch
 

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:50.570
okay I'm going to remove the patch
sources again

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:50.580
 

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:54.230
alright now let's actually go and get

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:54.240
alright now let's actually go and get
 

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.990
alright now let's actually go and get
our classes that we need to refactor so

00:31:56.990 --> 00:31:57.000
our classes that we need to refactor so
 

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.910
our classes that we need to refactor so
we'll move the details activity and the

00:31:58.910 --> 00:31:58.920
we'll move the details activity and the
 

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:13.980
we'll move the details activity and the
details fragment into the new module

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:13.990
 

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:16.080
all right the new classes the details

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:16.090
all right the new classes the details
 

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:20.549
all right the new classes the details
classes are now on our details module we

00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559
classes are now on our details module we
 

00:32:20.559 --> 00:32:22.049
classes are now on our details module we
also need to move the activity

00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:22.059

the base module where the classes were
 

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:28.230
the base module where the classes were
previously and bring that the activity

00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240
previously and bring that the activity
 

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.910
previously and bring that the activity
was previously and then bring that

created a base feature module to the
existing code and we extracted features

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:08.740
existing code and we extracted features
 

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.650

application we've heard from many of our
 

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:34.410
application we've heard from many of our
partners as to how long it took and we

00:35:34.410 --> 00:35:34.420
partners as to how long it took and we
 

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.080
partners as to how long it took and we
found that it's typical to take 4 to 6

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:37.090
found that it's typical to take 4 to 6

weeks to build your internet you'll

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.090
weeks to build your internet you'll
 

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:42.600
weeks to build your internet you'll
spend the first part of that thinking

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:42.610
spend the first part of that thinking
 

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.460
spend the first part of that thinking
through the product experience that you

00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:44.470
through the product experience that you
 

00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:47.450
through the product experience that you
want to build in your internet then

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:47.460
want to build in your internet then
 

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.890
want to build in your internet then
identify the target project structure

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:49.900

that's perfect for your application and
then there's a refactoring effort to put

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:55.270
then there's a refactoring effort to put
 

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:57.570
then there's a refactoring effort to put
code inside your base feature module as

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:57.580
code inside your base feature module as
