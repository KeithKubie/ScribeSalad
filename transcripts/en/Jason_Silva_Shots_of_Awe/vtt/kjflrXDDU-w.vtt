JASON SILVA: So I've been
thinking a lot lately

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.156
of the Quantified
Self Revolution.

00:00:21.156 --> 00:00:22.280
You've heard the buzz term.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.500
And it's this idea that
as we extend computation

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.130
into everything, as we extend
sensors into everything,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.950
we're increasingly extending
those sensors into ourselves.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.450
Creating a data-rich,
always-on stream of information

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.100
about our biological
functionings,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.430
all the metrics that
we use to measure

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.310
how this system of
biology is operating

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.310
are now getting
fed into a machine.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.410
And we're pooling the data
from millions of people,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.740
eventually finding
patterns in the data,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.470
learning how to optimize
the way the data is managed,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.280
feeding that information
back into ourselves,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.150
transforming what it means
to be a human being running

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.300
in a optimum capacity.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.500
And this just excites
me a lot, because it's

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.840
this idea that just like we can
soup up our cars to get more

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.850
performance out of
them, imagine how

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.500
these insights into
ourselves might transform

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.460
the possibilities.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.040
We can sort of play around
with our biochemical matrix.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.270
We can literally
rev ourselves up

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.484
to ways we could have
never conceived before.

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:27.780
This could be the
beginning of human 2.0.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.370
Right?

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:50.920
