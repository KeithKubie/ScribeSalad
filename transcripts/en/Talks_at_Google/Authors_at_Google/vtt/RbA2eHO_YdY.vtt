00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:03.810
DAVE MARX: Carmine's a
highly-regarded author

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.190
in the business world, who
recently published his eighth

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.647
book, "The
Storyteller's Secret--

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:10.230
From TED Speakers
to Business Legends,

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.650
Why Some Ideas Stick
and Others Don't."

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.427
Carmine's currently an author,
columnist, and public speaker,

00:00:15.427 --> 00:00:17.760
and has formally worked as a
journalist and news anchor.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.822
But I think, above all,
Carmine is a storyteller.

00:00:20.822 --> 00:00:22.530
His previous books
had been massive hits.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.350
His book, "The Innovation
Secrets of Steve Jobs,"

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.460
also became an
international bestseller,

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.310
and has been awarded
the Axiom Award

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.119
for being one of the top three
best business books in 2011.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.047
And just today, Amazon Editor
shows most recent book,

00:00:35.047 --> 00:00:37.380
"The Storyteller's Secret,"
as one of the best new books

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.641
in business and leadership.

00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:39.890
It's available everywhere now.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.860
And we've been lucky enough
to have some subsidized copies

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.080
through Google Talks that
will be available for sale

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.580
in the back.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.330
And I'm sure Carmine
would be happy to sign

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.120
your copy for you, if you're
willing to stick around

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.619
for a couple minutes
after the talk.

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.890
So with that, I'd like to
introduce the man himself,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.710
Carmine Gallo.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.251
CARMINE GALLO: All right.

00:00:57.526 --> 00:00:58.400
All right, thank you.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.490
Good morning.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.130
I am really passionate
about this topic.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.170
And I'm passionate about
it because I really

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.900
think that this is a topic that
will help you in your careers,

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.610
help you in your business, make
you more valuable than you've

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.670
ever imagined.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.760
And it'll also help you sell
your ideas more effectively.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.660
So since we're talking
about storytelling,

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.530
why don't we begin with a story?

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.050
Now, stop me if you've
heard this before.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.100
Two Stanford graduate
students think

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.180
they've come up with an
idea to change the world.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.670
So they had over to Sequoia
Capital, to ask for money.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.020
Michael Moritz, one of the
investors, the main investor

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.770
at Sequoia Capital, has been
watching an endless stream

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.440
of really bad PowerPoints.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.120
And Sergey and Larry
do something different.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.100
First, they have a working
demo, which was really unusual

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.840
at that time.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.790
It actually worked.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.060
What a concept.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.140
But they also did
something very interesting.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.920
They were able to summarize
their entire vision

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.240
in one short sentence
of under 10 words.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.350
And Michael Moritz
never forgot that.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.610
And that sentence
is "We organize

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.890
the world's information
and make it accessible."

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.690
I spoke to Michael
Moritz last year.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.710
And he said, Carmine,
tell your clients,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.200
tell your groups that great
leaders can do two things.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.570
One, they have a
vision for the future.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.130
But they can communicate
it especially well.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.150
And so now, even
today, if you walk

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.630
into Sequoia Capital's
offices, they're

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.900
asking you for the one line.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.060
And one investor told me, if
you cannot summarize your idea

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.940
in one sentence,
we're not interested.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.600
Go back to the drawing board.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.260
Because there's
power in simplicity.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.010
And there's power in
articulating your ideas simply

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.050
and concisely.

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.860
When it comes to
storytelling, especially, we

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.840
kind of know how this works.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.340
Kevin Spacey said, "Story is
everything and good content

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.380
making--" whether that's in
business, marketing, or movies,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.820
"--is not a crap shoot.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.120
We know how this works."

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.700
There is a formula to this.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.340
We know how persuasion works.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.360
We know why you
remember certain things

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.550
and why you forget others.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.190
There's a formula to this.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.400
In the music industry, for
example, 90% of music revenues

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.235
come from 10% of the songs.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.020
And this is a true statistic.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.090
It's actually in a new book
called "The Song Machine."

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.380
What's amazing about
this is that the 10%

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.940
are written by a
handful of people.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.640
One guy in particular,
is Max Martin,

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.210
who made it big with Britney
Spears, Backstreet Boys.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.290
And today, he write songs for
pretty much all the other big

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.540
pop artists out there-- most
of the songs that you hear,

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.870
the songs that you like,
the ones that are memorable.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.250
Because there's a formula to it.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.140
He knows what works.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.810
He uses something
called track and hook.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.340
So how many of you
have had a Taylor Swift

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.560
song stuck in your head
over the last year?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.820
It's got three words.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.579
What would it be?

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.089
What is it?

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.620
What is the three-word song?

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:21.414
What is it?

00:04:21.414 --> 00:04:22.455
AUDIENCE: "Shake it Off."

00:04:22.455 --> 00:04:23.160
CARMINE GALLO: "Shake
it Off." "Shake it Off."

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.360
Thank you, Max Martin,
who wrote that.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.010
He knows how these things work.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.930
We know how this works
in communication too.

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.340
So in the 20th Century,
give me one or two

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.810
of the most famous speeches
of the 20th Century.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.783
Name one.

00:04:38.783 --> 00:04:40.246
AUDIENCE: I Had a Dream.

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:42.620
CARMINE GALLO: How did I know
you were going to say that?

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.000
How did I know?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.120
I Have a Dream speech.

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.340
And what is the most
memorable part of the I

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.340
Have a Dream speech?

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.480
I have a dream.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.910
That's called anaphora.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.970
That's a rhetorical
device that makes

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.890
something pleasing to the ear.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.540
We know how this works.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.290
What's the most famous
line from John Kennedy's

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.510
inaugural speech?

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.930
AUDIENCE: Ask not what your--

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.610
CARMINE GALLO: --country
can do for you.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:07.560
What's the rest of it?

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.510
AUDIENCE: But what you
can do for your country.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.676
CARMINE GALLO: But what you
can do for your country.

00:05:10.676 --> 00:05:12.140
We know how this works.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.710
There is a reason why
you remember that.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.840
It's the same reason why certain
songs are stuck in your head.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.440
How many of you,
over the last year,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.860
have had Omi's "Cheerleader"
song stuck in your head?

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.510
Dave, you said, "Cheerleader?"

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.550
What's the chorus
of "Cheerleader?"

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.400
"Oh, I think that I found
myself a cheerleader.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.870
She is always right
there when I need her."

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.520
Max Martin would say, that
chorus has to be balanced,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.880
the same number of words
and the same number

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.530
of syllables on each one,
on each side of the chorus.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.487
In other words, we know
how this stuff works.

00:05:50.487 --> 00:05:51.820
I won't give you any more songs.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.653
I don't want them stuck
in your head all day

00:05:53.653 --> 00:05:55.040
when you're at work.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.290
You're going to find yourself
singing that cheerleader

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.330
song today.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.590
And if you start
Autotuning yourself,

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.210
then you know you've
completely lost it.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.840
But we know how this works.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.470
We know how it works
in persuasion too.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.320
Great songwriters
know how it works.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.560
And we know how it works when
you're communicating ideas.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:17.390
Adam Braun is the founder
of a wonderful startup,

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.610
but a great nonprofit
called Pencils of Promise.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.040
Every 90 hours now,
Pencils of Promise

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.940
builds a new classroom in
impoverished or underprivileged

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.419
communities around the world.

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.460
And he told me something
really interesting once.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.605
Because he's always
out there fund raising.

00:06:34.605 --> 00:06:36.230
And he said, Carmine,
it's interesting.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:40.360
Because when I'm speaking to
a group of financial types,

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.400
I'm trying to raise
funds, they all

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.540
want to know about how
efficiently the nonprofit is

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:47.040
run.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.165
They want to know the data.

00:06:48.165 --> 00:06:49.720
They want to know the finances.

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.200
But that's not
what they remember.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.910
They always seem to remember
a two-minute sequence

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:57.300
from my presentation,
where I show

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.680
a video of the first
Pencils of Promise students.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.254
Little girls that
he met in Laos who

00:07:03.254 --> 00:07:04.920
had never been in a
classroom, had never

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.680
had a classroom before.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.130
He shot a video a 30-second
video on a smartphone, inserts

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.540
into his presentation.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.560
He says, it's always a hit.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.844
Here's the 30-second
video he shows.

00:07:16.844 --> 00:07:17.510
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:18.970
[SPEAKING THAI]

00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:37.890
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:38.740
And that's it.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:41.970
And then he shows
this slide, which

00:07:41.970 --> 00:07:45.820
is the same girls in their
first Pencils of Promise school.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.630
And he said, Carmine,
facts and figures and data

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:51.200
never get me a standing ovation.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.480
But this always does.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:54.090
And this is what's memorable.

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:54.990
Why?

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.180
We know why this works.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:59.810
Because we are wired for story.

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:03.730
Ideas that catch on
are wrapped in story.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:05.220
Stories inform.

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.020
They illuminate.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.050
They inspire.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.330
And it's not just me.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:12.160
Because certainly, in business,
most executive leaders

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.250
and successful business
leaders believe the same thing.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.235
That's the reason
why I wrote the book.

00:08:17.235 --> 00:08:19.800
It's because they
kept telling me this.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.260
Vinod Khosla, the
billionaire investor,

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:24.740
said, "It's not enough to
have facts on your side.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.140
You have to do storytelling."

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.920
Ben Horowitz-- "Storytelling
is the most underrated skill."

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.320
Let's go to "Shark Tank."

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.120
Barbara Corcoran--
"Storytelling is everything.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.240
Show me an MBA and your
sales numbers, that's fine.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.460
But tell me a great
story and we'll talk."

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.480
So here's the best part.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.997
Storytelling is
already in our DNA.

00:08:46.997 --> 00:08:48.330
You already know how to do this.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:49.890
We're all storytellers.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.600
Storytelling around a campfire
has been around 400,000 years.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.330
It was a major development when
people began to tell stories.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:01.540
Firelight extended the day.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.890
Anthropologists have
been studying this.

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.620
When firelight extended the day,
people started telling stories.

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:08.790
It ignited their imaginations.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.140
It warned them of threats.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:14.360
It was a major milestone
in human development.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.380
We've been doing
this for centuries.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.990
We know how to do it.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:19.740
And people still do it today.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:24.390
Richard Branson gathers
his team around a campfire

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:29.160
at his home on Necker Island for
the purpose of sharing stories.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.680
Storytelling, he says, can
be used to drive change.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.670
In fact, about two weeks
ago, Richard Branson

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:37.610
wrote a blog piece
where he said,

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:41.870
if you want to be a
successful entrepreneur,

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.940
you need to be able
to tell stories well.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.230
He said, you can
have a great idea.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:51.440
But if you can't communicate
it well, it doesn't matter.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.120
So we know how this works.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.140
Today, for the next
20 minutes or so,

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:59.310
I want to give you three
keys to winning the hearts

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.200
and minds of your audiences.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.170
And that can be almost
anything, whether you're

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.770
pitching a new idea,
whether you're delivering

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.380
a presentation, what have you.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.880
We're going to talk about
the storyteller-- yourself--

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.130
the story that you
deliver, and then

00:10:13.130 --> 00:10:15.170
how you deliver that story.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.900
So let's talk about
the storyteller.

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.850
It's really important
to see yourself

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:23.850
as the chief storytelling
officer for your brand.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.330
Great storytellers are not born.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:28.090
They're made.

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.610
People work at it.

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:33.240
You cannot inspire other people
until you're inspired yourself.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.010
If you don't believe in your
story, nobody else will.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.090
And it's important, if
you've faced adversity,

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:42.560
or if you've faced
struggle in your life.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.470
Or if you've had to
overcome a business

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.290
challenge or a failure.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:49.790
It's really important
to share that story.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:54.080
Because we are hard wired
to find meaning in struggle.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.740
And that's why we like
to hear stories of people

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.420
who have overcome struggle.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.620
Howard Schultz, for
example, at Starbucks,

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:06.160
he often tells the
story of growing up

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.020
in a Brooklyn housing
project, watching

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:11.980
as his family struggled when his
father was injured on the job.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.480
Some of you may have
heard that story before.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.800
They had no health insurance.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.840
They found it difficult
to make ends meet.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.580
Howard Schultz said,
"The more uninspiring

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:27.560
your origins, the more likely
you are to use your imagination

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.750
and invent worlds where
everything seems possible."

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:35.100
And that's why he repeats
that story constantly,

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.060
and it reinforces
Starbucks' initiatives.

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.620
For example, it
explains the why.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.560
Why does Starbucks offer
full-time health benefits

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.760
for part-time workers?

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:49.350
The story explains
and underpins the why.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:54.950
Now, I live in wine country
in the Livermore Valley.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.780
So anybody who's
really into wine

00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:04.400
knows that the best grapes come
from very steep hillsides made

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.850
of limestone soil.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:11.140
The grapes that are stressed
are said to have more character.

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:12.890
And that's why it's
important to share

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:16.780
those stories of adversity
or struggle, triumph

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.240
over adversity.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.590
Because we are
hardwired, in nature,

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:25.080
to find meaning
in that struggle.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.420
And of course, all of you are
very familiar with this here

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.100
at Google.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.930
It's important to
dream in moonshots,

00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:35.200
and to speak in
moonshot thinking.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:40.370
That's another way of inspiring
people to dream bigger.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.250
We love rags-to-riches stories.

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:46.310
We're actually wired to
love rags-to-riches stories.

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:48.520
Which is why almost
every commercial movie

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.550
needs to have a happy ending.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:53.540
We actually need to
have a happy ending.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.700
So the stories that
work best are often

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.320
those stories where you have
faced an intense struggle

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.140
in your life.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:01.764
And then you've come
out the other end,

00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:03.110
and you're better for it.

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:06.960
Or the world is transformed
and you've learned something.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.525
In the book, I have a story
about a guy named Mark, who

00:13:09.525 --> 00:13:12.820
left England in the early '80s.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.620
And he landed in Los Angeles.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.690
His first job was a nanny.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.320
His first
entrepreneurial venture

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.310
was selling T-shirts
on Venice Beach.

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.710
He hung T-shirts on a fence
and sold them for $18.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.020
He bought them for $2.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.180
So he made a pretty good profit.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.510
Today, Mark Burnett is one
of television's most popular

00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.540
producers.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.160
But here's what he told
me, when I interviewed him.

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:41.850
"My best skills have always
been storytelling and pitching

00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:43.875
ideas."

00:13:43.875 --> 00:13:46.420
Now, this is what
applies to you today.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.980
"All success begins with the
ability to sell something,

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.220
whether it's a
shirt or an idea."

00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.430
So embrace the back story.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:00.450
Believe in your story,
or nobody else will.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.740
Now, when it comes time to
actually crafting and creating

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.750
that story, there are
some techniques that work.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.940
I believe that storytelling,
especially in your career,

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.780
is your competitive advantage.

00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.030
Whether you're pitching an
idea, building a company,

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.130
growing a career, trying
to motivate a team,

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.240
or just delivering a
mission-critical presentation,

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:22.860
storytelling is your advantage.

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.630
It's what's going
to set you apart.

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.100
The good news is that
in the last 10 years,

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.870
we've learned more about
why certain stories work,

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.490
than we've known since
humans began painting

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:35.650
pictures on cave walls.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:39.250
A remarkable thing happens
to your brain on stories.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.730
They're studying this
at Princeton University.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:46.390
When somebody tells you
a story, the same regions

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:50.680
of your brain and your speaker's
brain literally light up.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.090
It's called neuro coupling.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:55.440
You are literally in sync.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.380
Paul Zak, in Orange County,
is also studying this.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.680
He's doing this in the lab.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.890
He found that "A
compelling story

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.620
with an emotional
trigger--" that's the key.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:07.840
What's the emotional trigger?

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.310
We'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:11.340
But a compelling story
with an emotional trigger

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:15.500
alters our brain chemistry,
making us more trusting,

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.330
understanding,
and open to ideas.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:25.210
We know that when the
brain hears a story,

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:29.730
there is a rush of chemicals--
cortisol, dopamine, oxytocin,

00:15:29.730 --> 00:15:30.980
which is the love chemical.

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.710
It's the chemical that creates
empathy between two people.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.470
That's what happens
when you hear a story.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.840
So now, how are we going
to incorporate story

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.890
in our presentations?

00:15:41.890 --> 00:15:42.950
How do we do that?

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.500
Well, one good
training ground is TED.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.060
So how many of you
watch TED Talks?

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.390
I'm sure a lot of
you enjoy TED Talks.

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:53.430
I wrote a book called
"Talk Like TED."

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:55.140
And it became a
very popular book

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.170
in the field of public
speaking and communication.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.360
The one chapter that
people really seem to like

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.690
was on storytelling.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.360
But it was only a
few pages, which

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.910
is why I expanded it
into a whole book that

00:16:06.910 --> 00:16:09.930
looks at storytelling not
only in business, but also

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.980
in all types of different
presentations that you have.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.750
I firmly believe that the ideas
that do catch on in any venue

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.390
are those that are wrapped
in a compelling story.

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.070
So I do like to
watch the TED Talks.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.390
Because as Charlie
Rose once said,

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.670
the reason why TED is special
is because the presentations

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:30.270
are wrapped in story.

00:16:30.270 --> 00:16:32.600
Very few people do it
better than Bryan Stevenson.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.360
Bryan Stevenson is a
human rights attorney.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.040
Some of you may have read
his book, "Just Mercy."

00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:40.020
He believes that
there are many people

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:43.980
on death row, especially, who
are incarcerated unjustly.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.480
That's a very compelling book.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.970
And he's a great speaker.

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.990
He thinks about story.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:50.710
I interviewed him
after his TED Talk.

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:56.300
He said, Carmine, narrative is
hugely important in persuasion.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.670
So when he's trying
to get people

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:01.400
to his side, when he's
trying to win people over,

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.180
he tells a lot of stories.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:07.290
They're very short stories that
reinforce his central theme.

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:09.621
And they're typically
personal stories.

00:17:09.621 --> 00:17:11.329
You don't have to
always do the personal.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:12.760
It could be a case study.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.819
But for him, he
finds that when he

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:17.650
connects with people personally,
it makes a difference.

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:21.130
I want to show you a video clip
from a now-famous TED Talk.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.270
He received the longest standing
ovation of any TED speaker

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:26.599
in TED history after this talk.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:31.180
Bryan Stevenson was talking
about the loss of identity

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:33.950
for many people in
underprivileged communities.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.875
And he talked about
his grandmother.

00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:37.540
He told a story
about his grandmother

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.260
who, when he was 11 years
old, pulled him aside

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.200
and had him make a promise
to her that he would never

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.620
drink alcohol in his life.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:48.337
He said, I was
only 11 years old.

00:17:48.337 --> 00:17:48.920
What the heck?

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.720
I agreed.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.244
Here's how he
picked up the story.

00:17:51.244 --> 00:17:51.910
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:53.530
-I grew up in the country,
in the rural south.

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.691
And I have a brother
a year older than me

00:17:54.691 --> 00:17:56.060
and a sister a year younger.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:59.420
When I was about 14 or 15,
one day, my brother came home.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.160
And he had this
six pack of beer.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.970
I don't know where he got it.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.511
And he grabbed me and my sister
and we went out in the woods.

00:18:04.511 --> 00:18:05.920
And we were just
out there, doing

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.290
the stuff we basically did.

00:18:07.290 --> 00:18:09.790
And he had a sip of this beer
and he gave some to my sister.

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:10.630
And she had some.

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:12.699
And they offered it to me.

00:18:12.699 --> 00:18:13.490
I said, no, no, no.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.960
That's OK.

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.510
Y'all go ahead.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.200
I'm not going to have any beer.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.170
And my brother said, come
on, we're doing this today.

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:18.210
You always do what we do.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:18.620
I had some.

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:19.210
Your sister had some.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:19.900
Have some beer.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.885
I said, no, I don't
feel right about that.

00:18:21.885 --> 00:18:22.510
Y'all go ahead.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:23.020
Y'all go ahead.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:24.350
And then my brother
started staring at me.

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:25.880
He said, what's wrong with you?

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.699
Have some beer.

00:18:26.699 --> 00:18:27.990
Then he looked at me real hard.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.320
He said, oh, I hope
you're not still

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.690
hung up on that conversation
Mama had with you.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:34.602
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:35.792 --> 00:18:37.500
I said, well, what
are you talking about?

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:39.020
He says, well, Mama
tells all the grandkids

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:39.935
that they're special.

00:18:39.935 --> 00:18:41.761
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:44.880
I was devastated.

00:18:47.601 --> 00:18:49.267
And I'm going to admit
something to you.

00:18:49.267 --> 00:18:50.910
I'm going to tell you
something I probably shouldn't.

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.990
I know this might be
broadcast broadly.

00:18:52.990 --> 00:18:55.430
But I'm 52 years old.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.322
And I'm going to admit
to you that I've never

00:18:57.322 --> 00:18:59.470
had a drop of alcohol.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.242
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:02.571 --> 00:19:04.900
I don't say that because
I think that's virtuous.

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.147
I say that because there
is power in identity.

00:19:08.147 --> 00:19:08.980
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.270
That's quite remarkable.

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:13.950
And did you see how comfortable
he was in telling that story?

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.122
And I asked him, do you tell
that story all the time?

00:19:17.122 --> 00:19:19.080
He said, oh yeah, in
almost every presentation.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.980
And I asked him why.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:23.520
He said, because everybody
has a grandmother.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.910
I have to get people to like me.

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:28.530
It's a very good way
of creating empathy.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:29.530
Now watch this.

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:32.766
I created a data set here.

00:19:32.766 --> 00:19:34.140
Doesn't this look
like the tables

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.850
that you use in your
own presentations?

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.380
No?

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:37.300
Not exactly?

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:38.800
OK.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:42.850
If we use Aristotle's
Components of Persuasion,

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:46.850
and you take Bryan Stevenson's
text of his TED Talk,

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:50.490
65% falls under what
Aristotle would have called

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:53.800
Pathos, emotion, storytelling.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:59.450
25% data to support
the stories, and 10%

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:03.690
establishing credibility
for who Bryan Stevenson is.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.430
I love this template.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:09.160
If you have a
presentation-- story, data.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.490
Story, data.

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:11.770
Story, data.

00:20:11.770 --> 00:20:14.590
He told three stories
and three data points.

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.590
Beautiful, very simple.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.130
Only 25% data, whereas in
most business presentations

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:23.330
isn't it completely
the other way around?

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:25.310
It's 90% data.

00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.360
Sheryl Sandberg is learning this
too, over at Facebook, the COO.

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.740
How many of you are
familiar with the movement

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.310
that she started?

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:34.870
"Lean In," right?

00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:38.720
I argue that you never would
have heard of "Lean In"

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.060
if it had not been for a story.

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.800
She gave a TED Talk on
women in the workplace.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.340
That TED Talk went viral,
launched a bestselling book,

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.240
triggered a movement.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.770
Never would have gone viral if
it had not been for a story.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.630
And she acknowledged it later.

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.580
She said, that she was
prepared to give a presentation

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.230
chock full of data and no
emotion, no personal stories.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.379
A friend of hers pulled
her aside and said, Sheryl,

00:21:07.379 --> 00:21:08.920
you seem a little
out of sorts today.

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.960
What's going on?

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.540
And she complained about having
to fly there with her daughter

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.670
still in California,
and her own issues

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:18.600
with being a working mother.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.910
And her friend was patent,
said, you really got

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.480
to start sharing those stories.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.340
That's how you
connect with people.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.030
Sheryl Sandberg acknowledged
that she was very uncomfortable

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:30.020
with this.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.524
But here is how she began
her now famous TED Talk.

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:33.440
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.330
-Now, at the outset, I want to
be very clear that this speech

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:37.805
comes with no judgments.

00:21:37.805 --> 00:21:39.220
I don't have the right answer.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:41.810
I don't even have it for myself.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:45.200
I left San Francisco,
where I live, on Monday.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.389
And I was getting on the
plane for this conference.

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:49.555
And my daughter, who's
three, when I dropped her off

00:21:49.555 --> 00:21:51.971
at preschool, did that whole,
hugging the leg crying mommy

00:21:51.971 --> 00:21:54.180
don't get on the plane thing.

00:21:54.180 --> 00:21:55.750
This is hard.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.110
I feel guilty sometimes.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:59.630
I know no women,
whether they're at home

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.580
or whether they're in
the workforce, that

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.270
don't feel that sometimes.

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:05.950
So I'm not saying that
staying in the workforce

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:08.260
is the right thing for everyone.

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.550
My talk today is about what
the messages are if you do

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:13.300
want to stay in the workforce.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.340
And I think there are three.

00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:17.670
One-- sit at the table.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:18.667
Two--

00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:19.500
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:21.290
She's became a real storyteller.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:23.390
In her book too, if
you've read "Lean In,"

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:25.040
it's full of stories.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.480
But she acknowledged she
wasn't going to do originally.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.000
So look, if you want to learn
how to tell a better story,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.010
there is a formula.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:32.920
Let's go back to the formula.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.910
Let's go to Hollywood.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:37.480
Hollywood knows how to tell
transformative stories.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.300
All commercially successful
Hollywood movies--

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.180
every single one-- has a
three-part storytelling

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.090
structure.

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:46.960
And I'm sure you've seen this.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.330
A lot of great books
certainly have this too.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.520
So the three-part
structure of all hit movies

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.040
begins with the setup.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.380
Oh, let's pick an
Academy Award nominee.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.180
I haven't seen "The Revenant."
so I can't speak to that.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.180
How about "The Martian?"

00:22:59.180 --> 00:23:01.040
How many of you have
seen "The Martian?"

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:01.840
OK, a few of you.

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:02.584
We're go with it.

00:23:02.584 --> 00:23:03.750
Dave, you saw "The Martian?"

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:04.458
We'll go with it.

00:23:04.458 --> 00:23:06.360
So the setup is
the hero's world.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.800
So here we have Matt
Damon, as a botanist.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.810
He just happens to be on Mars.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.520
But you have to you
get to know the team.

00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.854
And the team's working with him.

00:23:13.854 --> 00:23:15.603
And the team, they
really love each other,

00:23:15.603 --> 00:23:17.090
and they get along
with each other.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:20.860
But then something has
to happen-- the conflict.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.282
On Mars, it's the sandstorm.

00:23:23.282 --> 00:23:24.740
If you ever watched
"Titanic," it's

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.440
the Titanic hitting the iceberg.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.070
I mean, these are very
clear delineations

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.900
between Act One and Act Two.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.010
So now the hero's
world, literally,

00:23:33.010 --> 00:23:34.600
is turned upside down.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.100
And then, of course,
the resolution.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.930
How are we going
to save Matt Damon?

00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:39.990
And Matt Damon actually
transforms too.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.510
He becomes a better person
by the end of the movie.

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:48.000
Great presentations
follow the same structure.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.910
Because this is the
way people are sort of

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.860
wired to think in story.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.030
So in 1984, Steve
Jobs introduced

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:57.240
Macintosh, one of the great
dramatic presentations

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.850
in corporate history.

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:00.810
It follows the exact
same structure--

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:05.430
the setup, where he talks
about the status quo, the world

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:06.620
as it is.

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.630
And he introduces a villain.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.320
All great presentations
have to have a villain.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:16.060
The villain, in the Steve Jobs
narrative, of course, was IBM.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.300
IBM, he said, was bent
on world domination.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.170
He even used the
language of movies.

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:27.280
He said, there's only one
force to stand in its way,

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.810
and that's the resolution.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:31.340
The hero unveiled
the first Macintosh.

00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:33.490
But we don't get
to the resolution

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:36.160
until we go through
the other three steps.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.540
I've overlaid this structure on
so many things-- presentations,

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:43.830
also, famous speeches.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:48.460
Malala Yousafzai's
beautifully-written Nobel Peace

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:53.780
Prize acceptance speech follows
exactly the same structure.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.920
She doesn't start with
talking about the fact

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:58.360
that she was shot
in that school bus.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.610
She starts with
Act One, the setup.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.900
"In my paradise
home--" she said.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.410
She even starts with
"In my paradise home--"

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.350
"Everything is great.

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:11.040
We-- loved learning." "We
had a thirst for education."

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:12.240
Then something happened.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.820
And she has a very
clear distinction. .

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.950
"But things did not
remain the same."

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.900
So now you know Act
Two is going to start.

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.610
And now the conflict begins.

00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:24.320
"I was in Swat, which was a
place of-- beauty, suddenly

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.000
changed into a
place of terrorism.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.450
400 schools destroyed, people
killed, beautiful dreams

00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:33.160
turned into nightmares."

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.880
Conflict, and finally,
the resolution.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:38.480
Hero conquerors villain.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.500
"The terrorists tried
to stop us and attacked

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.860
me and my friends-- but
we're still here today

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.980
because neither their ideas
nor their bullets can win."

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:51.070
And now she is a voice for
the 60 million young girls who

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:53.290
are deprived of an education.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:54.630
This is a structure.

00:25:54.630 --> 00:25:56.070
There is a formula.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.700
So tell transformative
stories, you

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.940
can do this easily in your
very next business pitch.

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:03.390
You have an idea.

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.590
Start with Act One,
the status quo.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:07.790
Here's the status quo.

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:08.820
Here's the problem.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:09.700
That's the villain.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.230
Here's the problem that
you may not even know

00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:13.560
is around the corner.

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:14.840
And here's the resolution.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:18.040
Here's how my idea is
going to fix that problem.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.820
It's sort of a natural way
that we like to hear stories.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.680
And finally, just in the
last five minutes or so,

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:25.520
let me talk to you
about the three steps

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.710
to making a presentation great.

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:32.050
Number one-- always sharpen
your presentation skills.

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:36.700
Practice makes good
storytellers great.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.410
Very few people practice
public speaking.

00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.330
They don't practice,
even their presentations,

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:44.730
before they're actually
going to launch one.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:47.380
Martin Luther King
gave 2,500 speeches

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:49.020
before his Dream speech.

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.480
That's what I mean by when
you see a great communicator--

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.660
whether it's a
historical figure or just

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.890
somebody you know
here at Google--

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:58.380
they weren't born that way.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.310
They probably worked at it.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.200
There was a very famous TED
Talk-- Jill Bolte-Taylor,

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.759
she was the woman
who had a stroke.

00:27:05.759 --> 00:27:07.050
And she lived to tell about it.

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.966
I don't know if some of
you remember that one.

00:27:08.966 --> 00:27:13.000
She told me she
practiced 200 times.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.150
200 times.

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.440
So practice your
presentation skills.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.090
Always try to get better.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.590
Second, illustrate your
story as much as you can.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:27.200
People like pictures more than
words, especially on slides.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.830
So you can have a few words.

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:33.170
But also try to balance
the words and the pictures.

00:27:33.170 --> 00:27:35.320
This is a balance.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.310
Some of you may
remember Chris Hadfield.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:38.940
He was the singing astronaut.

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.910
He was the guy who sang
"Space Oddity," floating

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.620
in space, the David Bowie song.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:46.140
He's a great presenter.

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.160
He delivers 35-slide
presentations

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.650
with no words, just pictures.

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:54.010
And when I asked him why
he does that, he goes,

00:27:54.010 --> 00:27:55.901
Carmine, I'm telling stories.

00:27:55.901 --> 00:27:56.900
I'm telling a narrative.

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.600
Why do I want words to
interfere with that?

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.230
I want people to
listen to my words.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:04.280
The slides just
complement the story.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.580
Let's take a look at Elon Musk.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.120
Elon Musk is doing a
lot of this lately.

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:12.520
His presentations are beautiful,
but very minimalistic.

00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.870
This slide only has
three words on it.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:17.300
The next slide has
no words on it.

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:20.820
So this is definitely a trend
in presentations, a little bit

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:21.770
more visual.

00:28:21.770 --> 00:28:23.880
I'm not asking you
to completely blow up

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.230
the way you do presentations.

00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:28.570
But try to balance
words and visuals.

00:28:28.570 --> 00:28:30.410
I like this.

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.130
After this presentation,
a blogger said,

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:37.750
"Dude's selling a battery and he
still managed to be inspiring."

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.620
Of course, because it's
more about storytelling.

00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:43.570
And finally, unleash
your best storytellers.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.910
Let's say, you're a manager,
where you have a team,

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.680
and you have to deliver
an idea or a pitch.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.530
It's not all about you.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.560
Give everybody else a voice too.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.850
In fact, if you go to a Broadway
play, or if you go to a movie,

00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:59.194
there's different characters.

00:28:59.194 --> 00:29:00.485
Introduce different characters.

00:29:00.485 --> 00:29:03.030
It's not just about
you as the storyteller.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.360
Make sure that
everybody on that team

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:08.590
has a part of the narrative,
has a part of that pitch.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.660
This is what they're
doing at SAP.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.870
At SAP, the big
software company,

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:16.230
they hired not a
VP of marketing.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.084
They hired a chief storyteller.

00:29:18.084 --> 00:29:19.500
She's in the
marketing department,

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.100
but she's a Chief
Storytelling Officer.

00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:26.700
And her role now, her mission
is to unleash the stories

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.590
of 65,000 salespeople at SAP.

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:32.400
So she's giving them tools
to be able to capture

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:36.276
customer stories so other sales
people can share them too.

00:29:36.276 --> 00:29:37.650
So when it comes
to storytelling,

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:43.066
make sure that you unleash the
best storytellers on your team.

00:29:43.066 --> 00:29:44.690
And finally, let me
just end with this.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:47.080
I love this quote
from Walt Disney.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:51.970
"Storytellers instill hope
again, and again, and again."

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:56.930
And that's why we need people to
be more inspiring storytellers.

00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:59.832
You're story can
change the world.

00:29:59.832 --> 00:30:00.790
It can change a career.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:02.650
It can change an industry.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:07.170
I believe that storytelling is
not something that we just do.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.050
Storytelling is who we are.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:12.220
And all of you have
stories inside of you.

00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:13.710
So please, share those stories.

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:18.629
And inspire the people around
you to live a better life.

00:30:18.629 --> 00:30:20.712
Thank you very much for
coming out this afternoon.

00:30:20.712 --> 00:30:21.378
I appreciate it.

00:30:21.378 --> 00:30:23.117
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.230
By the way, if you
enjoyed it, tweet me.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:30.010
I'd love to keep up
the conversation.

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:31.790
Just go Carmine Gallo.

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:34.980
Or go to my website and
sign up for a newsletter.

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:39.255
You'll get content every week
on this topic of communication.

00:30:39.255 --> 00:30:40.630
DAVE MARX: To
start, I'd actually

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:43.192
like to kind of bring it
to us, and how we might be

00:30:43.192 --> 00:30:44.400
able to tell our own stories.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.316
And one of my favorite
lines in the conclusion

00:30:46.316 --> 00:30:48.760
is a quote you put
in from Robert Stone.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:51.660
It says that "Storytelling is
almost as necessary as bread.

00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.350
We cannot imagine
ourselves without it,

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:56.060
because the very sense
of self is a story."

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.944
I really like that.

00:30:57.944 --> 00:30:59.610
CARMINE GALLO: I wish
that was my quote.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:00.540
That was nice.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.248
DAVE MARX: Right?

00:31:01.248 --> 00:31:02.174
It is a great one.

00:31:02.174 --> 00:31:03.840
And what I wonder is
I know some people,

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:06.440
sometimes, have trouble
telling their own narrative.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.815
So what advice do
you have to us,

00:31:07.815 --> 00:31:10.530
to help identify
our own narrative

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:12.077
and tell it in a better story?

00:31:12.077 --> 00:31:13.910
CARMINE GALLO: Definitely
what we're seeing,

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.390
especially in
leadership today, we

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:20.030
are seeing more transparency,
more authenticity,

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:23.250
where people do seem to be a
little bit more comfortable

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.630
sharing those back
stories, the back stories

00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:28.210
of struggle and triumph.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.761
And there's a reason why people
like to hear those stories.

00:31:31.761 --> 00:31:34.260
So it doesn't always have to
be the skeletons in the closet,

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:34.760
OK?

00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.990
It can be something
as simple as having

00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:41.220
a very big, major business
challenge, or a failure.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.600
I mean, this is a culture
here, in Silicon Valley,

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.102
where we celebrate failures.

00:31:45.102 --> 00:31:47.310
So if you've had a failure,
if you've had a challenge

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:50.190
and you overcome it and
you learn something,

00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:52.540
that's one of the most
powerful stories you can tell.

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.890
But you don't have to tell
the personal stories either.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.100
Remember, a case
study is a story.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.066
Very few people are using
case studies anymore.

00:32:01.066 --> 00:32:02.440
But they don't
have to be boring.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.939
If you're going to
use a case study,

00:32:03.939 --> 00:32:08.130
still put it into the
context of narrative

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.750
with conflict and resolution
and struggle and triumph

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:13.000
over struggle.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:13.730
DAVE MARX: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:16.160
Look to our own struggle, and
then look to outside stories.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.856
Our narrative doesn't always
need to be stories about us,

00:32:17.856 --> 00:32:17.990
right?

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.823
CARMINE GALLO: Yeah.

00:32:18.823 --> 00:32:22.910
You know, I brought up that
slide of the Vinod Khosla.

00:32:22.910 --> 00:32:26.890
He actually delivered that
quote at a Khosla Summit,

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:31.890
where he gathers the CEOs from
all of his portfolio companies.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.990
Sergey Brin and Larry Page
were both there as well.

00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:37.250
And that was the
conference where

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.410
Vinod Khosla walked on stage.

00:32:39.410 --> 00:32:41.540
And he said, all of
you are brilliant.

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:43.910
He wasn't talking
to Sergey and Larry.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:45.520
He was talking to his CEOs.

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.980
But they were there on stage.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.860
And he said, all of
you are brilliant.

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:51.000
But none of you are
good storytellers.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.130
So that's where
I got that quote.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.820
You have to learn to
tell better stories.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:01.110
We can't invest in you unless
we understand the story.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.090
That's actually why
I wrote that book.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.370
If he had not said
that, I'm not sure

00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:09.330
if I would have had
the topic in mind.

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:10.080
Hey, how are you?

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:10.930
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:12.440
I had a question
about actual stories.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:12.770
CARMINE GALLO: Yeah.

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.686
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
some Hollywood movies.

00:33:14.686 --> 00:33:16.851
But can you mention some
stories from literature

00:33:16.851 --> 00:33:17.850
that are your favorites?

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:20.890
And why are those
stories your favorites?

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:25.035
CARMINE GALLO: Like Oedipus,
and some of the Greek stories.

00:33:28.116 --> 00:33:29.990
I'll tell you, I don't
read a lot of fiction.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.280
But I love biographies.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:35.290
So I am immersed in those kind.

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:38.830
Because biographies,
what I have found--

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:43.050
and this actually reinforced
some of the literature

00:33:43.050 --> 00:33:47.780
that I've found-- it's important
to tell family stories.

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:51.430
And it's important to
tell tales of heroes.

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.380
Because they inspire
us to be better people,

00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.280
which is why the whole
Horatio Alger type of stories

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:01.650
are actually very important
for people to hear.

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:08.190
And I never realized why I
loved certain historical books.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:08.730
Right?

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.389
Anything on George
Washington, is in my library.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:14.139
I read everything on George
Washington or Thomas Jefferson.

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:16.580
I love hearing
all those stories.

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.000
And what happened
during my research,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.270
I found out that
people like Elon Musk

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:28.370
said that they became more
courageous because their youth

00:34:28.370 --> 00:34:31.980
was spent reading stories
of mythical heroes

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.429
and true heroes.

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:37.624
John Kennedy was laid up in
bed for many, many months--

00:34:37.624 --> 00:34:39.540
a lot of people don't
know that history-- when

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.839
he was very young, in college.

00:34:40.839 --> 00:34:42.020
He was laid up in bed.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:43.270
He had terrible back problems.

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:44.949
He had a lot of illnesses.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:47.560
During that time, he read books.

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.400
And he read mythical
stories of King Arthur.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.130
And when it came time
for him, in World War II,

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:56.360
to play the hero
in his own journey,

00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:58.010
it all came back to him.

00:34:58.010 --> 00:35:00.006
And so I was really
curious as to why.

00:35:00.006 --> 00:35:03.240
You know, why are all of these
great leaders inspired by books

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.980
and inspired by stories?

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:06.710
There's a reason for it.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.330
There's actually
science that says

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:15.740
you are braver when you hear
stories of people who conquer

00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:18.260
seemingly-insurmountable odds.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.130
Malala said, that her
father was a storyteller,

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:25.270
and always told her
stories of folk heroes,

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:28.720
of young women who
could lead armies.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.060
So eventually, the reason why
those books are important--

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.770
and I tend to lean
toward history books--

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:38.440
is because it actually inspires
you to be a better person.

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:39.770
DAVE MARX: And I just
wanted to read another quote

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:40.800
from the book that
related to that.

00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.880
CARMINE GALLO: Yeah.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.196
DAVE MARX: From Greek
philosopher, Plato, "Come then,

00:35:43.196 --> 00:35:45.450
and let us pass a leisure
hour in storytelling.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:47.706
And our story shall be the
education of our heroes.

00:35:47.706 --> 00:35:49.330
Plato meant that the
stories themselves

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:50.790
would aid and inspire
and guide others

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:52.706
to play the hero in their
own life narrative."

00:35:52.706 --> 00:35:54.010
It's been around forever.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:56.566
CARMINE GALLO: They knew that
back in ancient Greece, right?

00:35:56.566 --> 00:35:57.940
But I don't think
a lot of people

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.000
put those two and two together.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.060
So if there's any questions?

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:03.740
Think about your next pitch.

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.360
Think about a presentation
that you've delivered.

00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.450
If you want to ask a question
about that, because it

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:11.380
should be in narrative form.

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:12.500
And we could do that.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:13.490
Yes?

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:15.640
AUDIENCE: So I can
completely appreciate

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.240
the need for storytelling.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.080
Now, when it comes to
the business world,

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.770
you gave us a great
example about Apple.

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:22.100
CARMINE GALLO: Yes.

00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.641
AUDIENCE: And yes, that was in
the kind of three-point format

00:36:24.641 --> 00:36:25.820
that you described.

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:27.310
But is that very common?

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:30.010
Because when I was thinking
about some examples,

00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:32.670
it seems like the conflict
just won't have the same punch.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.140
Because there's
not a lot of cases

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.500
where you can set up an enemy
or a tremendous pain of some

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.819
sort, in that kind of
three-point framework

00:36:39.819 --> 00:36:40.860
that you were discussing.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.100
CARMINE GALLO: Yes.

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.430
I should add the caveat
that what I'm showing

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:49.270
you are pretty extreme examples.

00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:52.610
When it comes to just a
basic pitch, basic idea,

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.750
just sharing your
idea with the team,

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:57.350
the reason why I bring up
the three-part narrative

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:01.490
is because anybody can
start with the status quo.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:02.920
So you can tell
your team, or you

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.170
can tell the person, your
client, your customer,

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:06.910
who you're trying to convince.

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:09.280
All this comes back
to, we have to convince

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.570
people of something.

00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:12.870
We have to convince
people of our idea.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:16.000
So if you can get people to
start nodding in agreement

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.330
and saying, yeah, yeah, OK.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.560
So that's the way things
are happening now.

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.340
But there's a problem here.

00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:23.950
And how are we going
to resolve the problem?

00:37:23.950 --> 00:37:26.290
In a basic business
presentation,

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:28.870
the villain-- there has
to be a villain in order

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:30.750
for a good story to
take hold-- doesn't

00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:33.040
have to be a competitor.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:35.470
It doesn't have to
be this big villain

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.320
bent on world domination.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.290
It could be a problem.

00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:41.027
Problem, solution.

00:37:41.027 --> 00:37:42.610
You know who's doing
this really well?

00:37:42.610 --> 00:37:44.070
Is Elon Musk.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.830
That presentation that I
showed you was brilliant.

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:50.480
And he was
introducing a battery.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.440
So now we're talking about
something that isn't that sexy.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.150
It's a home battery that
takes sunlight, converts it

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.460
to energy.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:03.920
But the way he structured
it, it was a narrative form.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.820
And he started with a problem.

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.100
And he showed pollution
being spewed in the air

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:10.270
by those smokestacks.

00:38:10.270 --> 00:38:12.460
And he used very
simple language.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.740
He said, this is real.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:16.220
This is happening.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.090
It's not good.

00:38:18.090 --> 00:38:21.870
And then the next slide was the
sun, just a picture of the sun.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:24.560
And he said, this
is also a real.

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.990
It works.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:28.480
It happens to be on every day.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:31.460
Why aren't we harnessing this?

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:34.040
Let's take a look
at today's batteries

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.150
to see what the problems
are with today's batteries.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.029
So now he's
introducing a problem.

00:38:39.029 --> 00:38:40.570
Now, how are we
going to take the sun

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:41.650
and convert it to energy?

00:38:41.650 --> 00:38:43.130
How do you do that?

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.720
Well, there's a problem
with today's batteries.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.660
But rest assured,
I have a solution.

00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:49.910
That's part three.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:50.960
And here's my solution.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:53.260
So within that
three-part structure,

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.840
you could have a lot of fun.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.580
Some screenwriters
in Hollywood--

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.579
and I've talked to a lot
of screenwriters, which

00:38:59.579 --> 00:39:01.390
is why I have fun
with this stuff-- they

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:02.990
don't like the formula.

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:05.060
But when they veer
from that formula,

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.710
they got a flop on their hands.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:10.690
So producers now, they
actually go to a certain page

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:14.080
to find the
beginning of Act Two.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:17.700
Within the structure though,
you can have a lot of fun.

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.810
You do a lot of crazy
things within the structure.

00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:24.315
But it seems as though
people like a structure.

00:39:24.315 --> 00:39:26.440
It's just something that
we're kind of wired to do.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:29.040
We like a logical structure.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:32.940
What do most of us do what
we create a PowerPoint?

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:35.240
Or when we create any
type of presentation,

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.796
regardless of the tools you use?

00:39:36.796 --> 00:39:38.670
We just put a lot of
facts and data on there.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.470
We don't even think
about a structure.

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.230
We just load it up.

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:44.939
That's the biggest
problem I've seen.

00:39:44.939 --> 00:39:46.480
AUDIENCE: I'll admit
the neuroscience

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.995
of this really fascinates me.

00:39:48.995 --> 00:39:49.870
Think of it this way.

00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.911
You described how it's
all kind of this formulaic

00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:53.674
conflict-resolution thing.

00:39:53.674 --> 00:39:55.090
If you think about
it, most of us,

00:39:55.090 --> 00:39:57.920
we deal with conflict in our
own work lives, personal lives.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:39:59.750
It stresses us out.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:00.510
We're frustrated.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:03.150
And then we go home, we
turn on TV, we read a book,

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:06.760
and we love seeing that
conflict resolution play out.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.866
We immerse ourselves in other
people's conflict resolution.

00:40:09.866 --> 00:40:10.990
CARMINE GALLO: That's true.

00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:12.280
AUDIENCE: So a
buddy of mine, he's

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.779
come from a
neuroscience background.

00:40:13.779 --> 00:40:15.090
We were at a party recently.

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:16.740
And we were trying
to theorize what

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.020
about our brains enjoys that.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.697
He started talking
to me about dopamine,

00:40:20.697 --> 00:40:22.530
which I understand, as
we think of it often,

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:24.330
is sort of a
pleasure-reward thing.

00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:25.910
We're hungry, we eat something.

00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:26.994
Dopamine gets released.

00:40:26.994 --> 00:40:29.410
He told me something I didn't
realize, which is dopamine's

00:40:29.410 --> 00:40:31.900
also part of seeking.

00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:36.840
And so it's sort of like, when
the outcome isn't predictable,

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.142
dopamine gets
released a lot more.

00:40:39.142 --> 00:40:40.850
So I'm wondering if
that's kind of what's

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:41.790
going on with stories.

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:44.164
Like, when we don't know what
the outcome is going to be.

00:40:44.164 --> 00:40:45.130
We're kind of on edge.

00:40:45.130 --> 00:40:46.880
When the resolution
happens, we get, like,

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:47.980
a hit of dopamine or something.

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:49.313
Is that kind of what's going on?

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:50.580
CARMINE GALLO: Yeah, yes.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:51.830
That's part of it.

00:40:51.830 --> 00:40:53.940
Dopamine plays a lot
of different roles.

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.181
But dopamine's also
the feel-good chemical.

00:40:56.181 --> 00:40:56.680
Right?

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.670
So if you can
empathize with someone

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:02.310
to feel really good
about that person,

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:03.750
then it releases dopamine too.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.820
So it's all part of it.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:10.650
But dopamine also forces
you to pay attention.

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:12.180
And again, I'm not
a neuroscientist.

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.280
But what I'm very good
at-- because I'm a trained

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.850
journalist-- I enjoy
speaking to neuroscience,

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.130
and studying it, and then
trying to articulate it

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:23.280
in plain English.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:26.130
So I've talked to John Medina
at the University of Washington.

00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:31.690
Great book called "Brain
Rules-- How Persuasion Works."

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:33.690
And he introduced a lot
of these concepts, where

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:37.640
he talks about how dopamine
is like a stamp on your brain

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.600
that makes you pay attention.

00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.930
So when you have this
rush of chemicals,

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:46.840
cortisol, mostly though,
dopamine put and oxytocin--

00:41:46.840 --> 00:41:50.700
and Paul Zak is studying
oxytocin-- it forces your brain

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.110
to pay attention.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:53.970
This is important.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.240
There is a reason
why you remember

00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:00.100
where you were during certain
big events, like a 9/11

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.210
or someplace like that.

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:05.110
You remember things because
there's that rush of chemicals.

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:06.990
And so it's easier
for you to remember.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:10.840
So how do we take that kind and
hijack the brain's processing

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:14.130
system so that they
remember our ideas?

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:16.390
You can take this
in almost any area.

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:20.290
People remember ideas
for a specific reason.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:22.230
There is a formula to this.

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:26.470
Just like Max Martin knows
how to write a song that

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:31.590
gets stuck in your head, we
know why ideas are memorable

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:34.710
and others are forgotten.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.090
Of course, you got
to have a good idea.

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:37.970
Right?

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:40.160
That's what Richard
Branson said.

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.090
It's got to be a good idea.

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:44.010
So that is number one.

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:49.220
But if you can't communicate
it, then it becomes a problem.

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.695
Sergey and Larry
had a good idea.

00:42:51.695 --> 00:42:53.070
AUDIENCE: I really
liked when you

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.610
touched upon the modes
of persuasion stuff.

00:42:55.610 --> 00:42:56.610
CARMINE GALLO: The what?

00:42:56.610 --> 00:42:59.070
AUDIENCE: The modes of
persuasion, Aristotle, ethos,

00:42:59.070 --> 00:43:01.057
pathos, and logos stuff.

00:43:01.057 --> 00:43:03.140
I was wondering whether
you could elaborate on it.

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:06.610
You said that the goal
is to do more [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:08.140
and less of the other stuff.

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.970
But I was just wondering
whether you could elaborate.

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:11.803
Because I found that
was really interesting.

00:43:11.803 --> 00:43:15.530
CARMINE GALLO: Well, apparently,
years ago, up until 20

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:19.260
or 30 years ago,
most people assumed

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:23.780
that we're rational beings.

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:27.510
So it was more about
the data and the logic.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:31.160
Whereas in the last 20 years
or so, they're finding--

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.700
and Jonathan Haidt is
doing a lot of research

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.240
into this-- that we
think we're rational.

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:42.740
But our emotional side of the
brain is much more powerful.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:46.860
Which is why, when you have to
persuade somebody of something,

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.660
you want to convince
them of something,

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.320
you need to have both.

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.430
That's why I think Bryan
Stevenson, go watch his TED

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:54.550
Talk.

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:55.355
It's phenomenal.

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:58.380
Because what it does,
is he's very persuasive.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:02.292
By the end of 15 minutes, you're
ready to buy into his idea,

00:44:02.292 --> 00:44:04.000
even if you're pretty
defensive about it.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:04.930
It's amazing.

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:06.740
He's very persuasive.

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.050
And he wins cases before
the US Supreme Court.

00:44:10.050 --> 00:44:11.780
He knows how to persuade.

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:16.050
But 65% % of his public
presentations are more heavy

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:19.390
on emotion, 25% data.

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:21.320
So you got to have a balance.

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.030
And I think we're seeing that
in our political campaigns too.

00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:25.446
There's some people
who are really

00:44:25.446 --> 00:44:30.200
good at getting your attention
and triggering emotions.

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:30.740
Right?

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:33.470
So I think it applies
in everything,

00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:36.340
from political
campaigns to business.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:41.140
AUDIENCE: Could you talk a
bit more about what emotions

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:45.840
you appeal to, and how
you set up a story so it

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.530
flips that switch, if you will?

00:44:47.530 --> 00:44:50.320
CARMINE GALLO: Apparently,
in storytelling, tension

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.200
is everything--
tension and conflict.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.740
There has to be some
kind of conflict.

00:44:56.740 --> 00:44:58.990
Titanic has to hit an iceberg.

00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.620
Right?

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:02.510
So you need to have the
conflict in Act Two.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:07.470
If there isn't a conflict,
then the audience

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:09.950
doesn't have anyone
to rally around.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:13.430
We want Jack and
Rose to be saved.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:16.300
And we want them to
be saved in "Titanic,"

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:18.450
only after we get to know them.

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:20.510
So that's the structure.

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:23.300
You need to be able to get
to know the characters so you

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.820
feel empathy for the
characters involved.

00:45:25.820 --> 00:45:28.950
Then you have to
introduce a conflict.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:32.930
And that conflict better have
a happy ending and a resolution

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:33.740
afterwards.

00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.610
So it's a pretty
basic structure.

00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.610
But those are the two
things that you absolutely

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:38.950
need in every good story.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:39.949
You need a back story.

00:45:39.949 --> 00:45:41.490
We need to get to
know the characters

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:45.450
a little bit so that we feel
empathy for the characters.

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:47.910
And then there has to be
a pretty significant--

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:49.450
what Paul Zak
calls the-- trigger

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:51.660
event, which is that conflict.

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:54.610
And so if you can get your
audience nodding in agreement,

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:56.720
going yeah, yeah, that's
the problem I have.

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.740
I have that problem.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:01.070
Then you're going to hook them.

00:46:01.070 --> 00:46:02.700
That's what we call the hook.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.720
Just like the chorus
in "Cheerleader."

00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.820
That's what we call the hook.

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.680
It works remarkably
well, remarkably well.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:11.120
I cannot tell you
over the years,

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.590
of how many business
presentations I've either seen

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:19.720
or I've worked with at a lot
of major companies-- LinkedIn,

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:24.470
Microsoft, SanDisk,
Intel, many--

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:28.880
where when we create something
like this and then we go back

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.260
and we see what was the
most memorable part of that

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:34.380
presentation, what
resonated with people.

00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:37.070
People come back,
like, two years later

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:39.570
at the same conference
and tell the executive,

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.470
I liked that part
in that presentation

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:42.640
you gave two years ago.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.680
It's always the story.

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.860
Always the story.

00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:49.761
Nobody ever remembers oh
yeah, I loved that slide 32.

00:46:49.761 --> 00:46:50.260
Excellent.

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:51.220
That was great.

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.360
Yeah, and the chart on slide 32?

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.410
Unbelievable.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:57.260
But they always remember
the story, always.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.320
That's why I'm getting
into this idea, where

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:01.260
I am very emphatic about it.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:03.740
I'm saying, this is the hook.

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.340
A songwriter knows what works.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:09.380
That's why he can keep
turning out hit after hit.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:10.760
We know what works too.

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:14.492
We know what works when you're
delivering a presentation.

00:47:14.492 --> 00:47:16.200
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about telling

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.070
personal stories--

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:17.930
CARMINE GALLO: Yes.

00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:20.260
Now, your father is a
data scientist, right?

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:21.220
AUDIENCE: Computer
science professor.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:22.050
CARMINE GALLO: Computer science.

00:47:22.050 --> 00:47:22.970
And he tells stories?

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:23.720
AUDIENCE: He does.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.165
CARMINE GALLO: I love it.

00:47:24.165 --> 00:47:24.360
I love that.

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.260
AUDIENCE: Telling
stories in the classroom

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:26.301
is very important to him.

00:47:26.301 --> 00:47:27.610
CARMINE GALLO: Great.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:30.193
AUDIENCE: I've noticed that when
people tell personal stories,

00:47:30.193 --> 00:47:32.570
they generally fall
into one of two frames.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:34.950
There's the
this-is-how-I'm-special angle.

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:38.640
And then there's the
this-is-how-we're-alike angle.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.860
Can you comment on which
of those-- is one of them

00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:42.780
superior to the other?

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.970
Do they both have a place?

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:46.820
CARMINE GALLO: Well,
let's not get too

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.740
hung up on the personal stories.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:49.110
AUDIENCE: I guess any stories?

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:50.070
CARMINE GALLO: Yeah.

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:55.840
Because for TED, the personal
stories work pretty well.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:58.260
Because it is a more
intimate environment.

00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:01.030
In business, I like
the case studies.

00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:05.140
You know, real stories of
real people who are helped

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:09.820
or whose world is made better
by your idea, by your service.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.760
Those are the stories
that resonate in business.

00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.780
And very few business
presentations-- at least

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.410
that I see- are
heavy in narrative.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:19.910
They don't tell those stories.

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:23.320
It's all fact without being
supported by the stories.

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.220
You know who's really
good at this now,

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:26.890
is Bill and Melinda Gates.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:30.320
They're fantastic
storytellers now.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.070
Like, every time they have the
new Gates newsletter, which

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.390
comes out every year and
talks about their philanthropy

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:40.640
efforts, Melinda is a better
storyteller than Bill.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.430
Bill's still a little factual.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:43.640
He's very simple though.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:44.760
He does a good job.

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.950
But Melinda likes
going into the stories.

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:49.140
So she uses the data.

00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:52.800
But she always starts with
very personal stories.

00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.490
And sometimes they're personal.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:56.880
But they're more
about other people.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.490
It's more of a personal
experience she had.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:03.700
But let me tell you about a
woman in this part of Africa

00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:06.610
who I spent a few days with,
and her and her family.

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.910
So it's kind of about
Melinda, but not really.

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:11.610
She kind of shifts it off and
talks about the other person.

00:49:11.610 --> 00:49:19.550
So I think the case studies, but
inserting yourself into a case

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:20.990
study is very powerful.

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:23.890
AUDIENCE: Do you have any advice
on how to use storytelling

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:28.010
in job interviews when
you have very little time,

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:30.759
and you have to kind
of sell yourself?

00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:31.550
CARMINE GALLO: Yes.

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:34.530
You have to do it
in job interviews.

00:49:34.530 --> 00:49:37.090
I have so many
interesting stories

00:49:37.090 --> 00:49:39.050
of people who have emailed me.

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:41.530
One young man emailed me
not too long ago, just

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.675
a few months ago, working at
a startup in San Francisco.

00:49:48.342 --> 00:49:49.550
I'm sure you're all familiar.

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:52.220
They do the coding
classes now, right?

00:49:52.220 --> 00:49:53.640
Those coding programs.

00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:53.870
DAVE MARX: The boot camps.

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:55.369
CARMINE GALLO: Yeah,
the boot camps.

00:49:55.369 --> 00:49:58.070
So that was his first
coding boot camp.

00:49:58.070 --> 00:50:01.140
And so he didn't have a lot
of technical experience.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.680
But he was a really
good communicator.

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:06.010
He studied the science of story.

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:07.470
And how to tell better stories.

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:09.860
So he walked into an interview.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:13.050
And he told stories
about his previous job,

00:50:13.050 --> 00:50:16.700
of where they had a
particular problem.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.800
And he told those stories of
how he overcame those problems.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.780
And then he applied what he
had learned to that company,

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:25.840
and what he had learned
about this new company.

00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.530
So that doesn't take long.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:30.450
Even in a 15-minute
job interview,

00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:32.260
that took about two minutes.

00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:34.470
But here's the
end of that story.

00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:36.430
Here's the conclusion.

00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:39.805
The reason why the young
man emailed me, he said,

00:50:39.805 --> 00:50:41.180
Carmine, you
wouldn't believe it.

00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.640
I doubled my salary.

00:50:42.640 --> 00:50:44.616
They hired me two days later.

00:50:44.616 --> 00:50:45.740
He interviewed on a Friday.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.110
They hired him on a Monday.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:48.470
Doubled my salary.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:50.660
And they told them
specifically, you

00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:52.410
don't have the
technical experience.

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:54.434
Because you just took
this one coding class.

00:50:54.434 --> 00:50:55.850
There are plenty
of job candidates

00:50:55.850 --> 00:50:58.760
who have more technical
experience than you do.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:02.470
But nobody could
communicate our story,

00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:05.570
our company story,
as well as you can.

00:51:05.570 --> 00:51:09.360
So to me, what we just
talked about, that's big.

00:51:09.360 --> 00:51:11.862
This is really important
for career advancement.

00:51:11.862 --> 00:51:12.820
Yeah, really important.

00:51:12.820 --> 00:51:14.390
Thanks for asking.

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:16.030
Well, look, I'll be around.

00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:20.272
And I'd love to sign some books
and meet you, if you'd like.

00:51:20.272 --> 00:51:20.980
Great, thank you.

00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:21.580
DAVE MARX: One more round
of applause for Carmine.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:21.880
CARMINE GALLO: Thank you.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.546
Yeah, thank you.

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:24.030
[APPLAUSE]
